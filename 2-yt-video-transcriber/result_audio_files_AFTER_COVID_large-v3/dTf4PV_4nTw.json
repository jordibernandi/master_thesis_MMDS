I know how it feels to have your hands grip on a steering wheel when you're outside of the wire, responsible for getting people from point A to point B alive, and you're worried about whether somebody or something you see fits the pattern of a suicide bomber.

But a judge has explained that he, quote, put his life on the line to defend America's rights, your rights, my rights.  He said that people wouldn't oppose the national anthem protest at NFL games if they had served in the military, which they didn't, but which he did.  But a judge has also trashed the current president for faking a disability to avoid serving in Vietnam.  He's called Trump's bone spurs diagnosis, quote, an assault on the honor of this country, end quote, because only bad people avoided the Vietnam draft.  That's the Democratic position now.  Amazingly, don't tell Joe Biden.  He got the same deferments that Trump did.  Don't tell Bernie Sanders.  He applied for conscientious objector status until he aged out of the draft.  But there's a larger question here.  As Peter Van Buren recently pointed out in the American Conservative, if Trump's military record is fair game, well then so is Pete Buttigieg's.  And here's the truth about Buttigieg's deployment to Afghanistan.  Quote, Buttigieg did all of six months in 2014 as a reservist deep inside Bagram Airfield, mostly as a personal driver for his boss, locked and loaded inside a Toyota Land Cruiser.  It's unlikely he ever ate a cold meal in Afghanistan.  Mayor Pete is milking his service for all it is worth politically, stretching a short tour into civics.  lessons he suggests can't be learned any other way.  So what you're saying, if the quote from your piece is representative, is that people to judge is basically inflating his experience abroad and using as a moral cudgel to crush his political parts.

Tulsi Gabbard did two military tours, one in Kuwait, another in combat in Iraq, and Buttigieg doesn't seem to equate any moral civics lessons to their service the way he does to his own relatively few months in Afghanistan.  Look, no one decries his service.  His work was honorable, and we applaud his standing up and taking the oath, but at the same time, to try to attribute some complex knowledge, some wisdom, based on a relatively short time in a non- substantive position in Afghanistan is pushing things just a little too far, especially when he turns that cudgel against Donald Trump, while ignoring the fact that Joe Biden, after multiple deferments, the same number of student deferments that Dick Cheney got, that Joe Biden was found one-wide to not go to Vietnam simply because of his teenage asthma.  Now, if teenage asthma and bone spurs don't share a nudge inside of the medical dictionary, then I'm not quite sure where they do belong together. ",

Bill Clinton refused to talk about those things, and he was elected to the White House, and in 1992, when he was running for president, the New York Times ran an editorial talking about the dishonorable war in Vietnam and how choosing not to serve in that war was almost a marker of morality as opposed to something negative.  Unfortunately, when it comes time to criticize Donald Trump, Pete Buttigieg is quick to pull those things out from the history books and talk about actions completely out of context 50 years ago while ignoring the fact that Joe Biden got the same deferments, Dick Cheney, George Bush, Dan Quayle, Mitt Romney and Bernie Sanders all deferred out of Vietnam, and at the same time refusing to ask questions of his current generation, including AOC, about why they didn't serve when the opportunity to volunteer was in front of them.
