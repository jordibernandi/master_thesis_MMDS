            "text": "Hello, YouTube family.  This is Diana, Frank's wife.  I am sorry I haven't posted in a few days.  It was a rough couple days.  I posted on the community page some details.  Frank was diagnosed as having had a stroke.  And that was on Monday.  But it turns out the stroke happened during the initial crisis, so it was nothing new.  They just didn't know about it.  Because they were so focused on his heart.  You know, keeping that pumping.  The doctor did say that if you were going to have a stroke, the area he had it in was the best because you... have the least damage there.  He might have an issue with peripheral vision in one eye, but it seems that it doesn't affect motor skills and cognitive ability.  But he looked pretty rough on Monday.  He was having trouble regulating his temperature, which they, the part where he had the, uh, the spot in his brain where he had the stroke does do some of that.  Um, he didn't have any infections they could find.  So they're chalking that up to the stroke damage.  Um, and he was having horrendous chills, so it looked like seizures.  So that was not fun.  Um, But that has since stopped.  Today I went in and there was no chills.  His breathing is very good.  He actually pulled out his tube in the middle of the night.  They had backed off on his sedation.  I'm sorry if I'm getting sidetracked here.  I'm kind of tired.  He moved his head when they asked him to.  He lifted his head.  They asked him to lift it higher and he did.  He was using his hands.  In fact, he has to wear these giant mittens that I'm going to tease him about later.  So he doesn't yank anything out.  He was shifting around the bed, moving his feet and his toes.  So when I got in there, even though he was sedated, I went to talk to him today and he responded.  He turned his head towards me and he was trying so hard to open his eyes.  Um, And I told him he was going to be okay.  And that, uh, I know you may not think you're going to be okay.  You may not feel okay, but you're on your way and to not to be afraid.  And I told him that God has him.  God told me he was going to touch him and not to worry.  And he got a little weepy.  So I knew I could feel that he was comprehending everything I was saying.  Um, So I just tried to reassure him.  I played him the Bible app.  It reads you the Bible to you.  Cause he likes to listen to that sometimes when he goes to bed or he's taking a nap.  Um, and he turned his head towards that.  He was definitely responsive even under sedation.  So, so the plan is tomorrow he has an MRI and, um, I just wish all the tests and results are over because it's so unnerving.  But I have to remind myself that God goes ahead of us and he already knows.  And it'll be okay.  But I wanted to thank everybody.  Like I can't even tell you what it means to read All your comments.

You know, normally you just have a network of your friends and family, which is a blessing, but his just poured out above anything I could ever imagine.  All your kind words, I do read them all.  I wish I could hit hard on all of them.  But please know that they don't go unnoticed.  And I am okay.  I'm just very touched by everybody.  I don't know any of you, but I do.  Because we're part of God's family.  And it's just so beautiful the way God arranged all this for me and my family.  remember when Frank started the channel he never in a million years thought it was gonna get to be like this and I am NOT gonna ever listen to this video.

Rescue me quickly.  Be my rock of protection, a fortress where I will be safe.  You are my rock and my fortress.  For the honor of your name, lead me out of this danger.  Pull me from the trap my enemy set for me.  For I find protection in you alone.  I entrust my spirit into your hand.  Rescue me, Lord, for you are a faithful God.  I hate those who worship worthless idols.  I trust in the Lord.  I will be glad and rejoice in your unfailing love.  For you have seen my troubles and you care about the anguish of my soul.  You have not handed me over to my enemies, but have set me in a safe place.  Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am in distress.  Tears blur my eyes.  My body and soul are withering away.  I am dying from grief.  My years are shortened by sadness.  Sin has drained my strength and I am wasting away from within.  But I am trusting you, O Lord, saying you are my God.  My future is in your hands.  Rescue me from those who hunt me down relentlessly.  Let your favor shine on your servant and your unfailing love rescue me.  Don't let me be disgraced, O Lord, for I call out to you for help.  Let the wicked be disgraced.  Let them lie silent in the grave.  Silence their lying lips and those proud and arrogant lips that accuse the godly.  How great is the goodness you have stored up for those who fear you.  You lavish it on those who come to you for protection, blessing them before the watching world.  You hide them in the shelter of your presence, safe from those who conspire against them.  You shelter them in your presence far from accusing tongues.  Praise the Lord, for he has shown me the wonders of his unfailing love.  He kept me safe when my city was under attack.  In panic, I cried out, I am cut off from the Lord.  But you heard my cry for mercy and answered my call for help.  Love the Lord, all you godly ones, for the Lord protects those who are loyal to him, but he harshly punishes the arrogant.  So be strong and courageous, all you who put your hope in the Lord.  The one verse that really stood out was how great is the goodness you have stored up for those who fear you. ",
