And so that in order to defeat one, we have to defeat the other or that we have to, quote, do both.  And, you know, I think in a certain sense, there's some truth to that insofar as like, of course, we have to oppose racial oppression and racial discrimination and capitalist exploitation.  But is this a useful framework for thinking about the relationship between capitalism and racism?  And what do you think it means to do both? ",

            "text": "Well, I think it is true that in order to eradicate racial oppression, you have to be anti-capitalist.  I think it's true.  By which we mean In order to eradicate racial oppression, you need to funnel enormous resources to give racial minorities real avenues for self-representation, self-organization, to bargain against their bosses, to have all the public goods and the necessities of life.  Without that, you will not eradicate racial oppression.  Why does that require anti-capitalism?  It's because all of those things are controlled by the class that has the economic assets and the economic wealth of society.  That's the capitalist class.  When we say you need to have a massive expansion of public employment, of healthcare, of high-quality education, primary and secondary education, of childcare, all these things, we're talking about the expansion of social democracy.  Now, you're not going to get the expansion of social democracy by having racial sensitivity seminars.  I mean, if you've ever seen it happen, please let me know because it makes our job a lot easier, right?  So it requires some kind of anti-capitalism in your politics, or I should say anti-capitalist politics.  Now, that's if we conceptualize our agenda as an anti-oppression agenda.  But if you think racism is discrimination, attitudes, social affronts, what's the word, microaggressions, sure, you don't have to be anti-capitalist at all.  In fact, I can guarantee you that you can make massive inroads against these things within capitalism.  So there's two roads you can take.  In my mind, the only way around an actual racial, the way to address racial oppression is through having some kind of labor-oriented politics in which you put the interests and the needs of the socially oppressed groups as a but central to your agenda.

I wanna talk about the legacy of black Marxists, communists and socialists who've advocated or organized around universal programs.  And this idea now that people who are advocating for universal programs are against, race-specific or race-sensitive programs.

            "text": "Let's make a distinction between race-sensitive and race-specific.  I think one should support race-sensitive programs.  You have to be aware that that any program that's universal in intent has to be especially cognizant of the liabilities and the weaknesses of socially oppressed groups and make sure that the rights that are being and the allocations that are announced as being universal are in fact delivered to them because understandably social attitudes, prejudicial attitudes towards those communities might get in the way of an adequate unrolling of these a universal program.  So you must be race sensitive.  Race specific, no.  Why would any progressive support a race specific program unless you think the only people oppressed are those of a very particular race?  You must, I think, support a universal advance in people's social position, especially in a country like the United States.  If you think you're going to get the political leverage that it's going to take to direct resources at a racial minority without the support of other ethnic and racial groups, you're in wonderland.  This is magical politics.  You're not going to get the level of political power you need in order to address the situation of Black Americans, unless you also have the support of the Latino and the white working class.  And how are you going to get those support if you say, no, no, this is just for them, not for you.  You get to the back.  I would love to know the political program that seeks to move forward on this sort of agenda.  The only way you get support from those other groups is by saying, this is for everyone.  But we have to make sure, given the history of this country, that everybody in fact gets it.  Because in the past, we haven't been very good about it.  That's how you move forward.  Outside of a universal agenda, you don't move forward.  Now, Arielle, to your question.  black Marxism and black radicalism.  Yes, I'll address that, but let's just say non-white radicals historically around the world in the 20th century.  What I've just said, I didn't invent it.  I'm simply telling you what every single black or brown radical in the 20th century said until America handed to the world from the 1980s onward this nonsense that if you take up economic demands, you're not serious about race.  This is an invention of the American post-80s American life.  And we are now in the position of having to somehow drag ourselves out of this miasma, this psychological and intellectual malaise that the post socialist so-called radical intelligentsia has generated, which has made us completely and totally irrelevant to ever doing anything meaningful on this very question of race.

            "text": "No, of course not.  There's nothing Marxist about it.  We have to separate out certain strands here.  Critical race theory is something that came out of the academy.  It's usually dated in the late 80s.  People think of 1989, this conference in Wisconsin as this founding moment.  And it was really connected up with other trends in academia at the time.  The immediate sort of parental theory was critical legal studies.  Right at the time that intersectionality theory was being promulgated and promoted, it comes out of a trend within academia where erstwhile radicals were trying to grapple with how you understand racial and gender and sexual oppression.  initially when it came up it was taken for granted that there is an economic foundation to all this that there's a material foundation to all this.  so i would say that you know in its very early version there was a strong marxist influence in this stuff because there was a strong marxist influence on all strands of radical theory at that time.  um so there is this idea that race is fundamentally about power.  yeah which is right that race is not deeply biological that Biological markers that individuals carry with them are fastened upon as having some kind of social significance.  And that's a process of social construction.  That's also true.  And so it works with these tropes, as it were.  And in so doing, seems to be bringing race and the understanding of race into a materialist framework to enrich that framework.  There's an extent to which I think that's true.  So one can't, at a certain level, I think validate the accusation that this is a Marxist plot for the very early iteration of this.  But keep the date in mind.  We're talking about the late 80s.  And the late 80s is the moment where radical thought enters its most profound degeneration that we've seen in the history of the modern left.  I would date it a little bit earlier, but that's when it really starts to take off.  So not surprisingly, by the time you get to the early 2000s, critical race theory has morphed into something quite different from its original starting point.  It is now much more firmly embracing that milieu of intersectionality and what was called multiple oppressions theory, for whom the centrality or the foundational importance of economic inequalities to the perpetuation of racial and gender injustice is no longer accepted.  In fact, it's taken as a sign of intellectual weakness and even a kind of political conservative.  So by, I would say, the early 2000s, in all of these intellectual strands, intersectional theory, intersectionality theory, critical race study, and all that, you get, on the one hand, a nod to power and an affirmation of the social construction of these categories.  But the social construction now is put on steroids and it becomes an artifact of discourse and ideology and affect and these sorts of things.  And now the cultural attitudinal components of race and racism become on par, are placed on par with the economic foundations of racial oppression.  And this is why today you get from race theory and racial, uh, the race experts, this notion that systemic racism is actually.  when they interpret systemic racism, they mean racism is everywhere.  And what keeps it everywhere is not the economic foundations on which it rests, but rather the attitude would continue to reproduce it.  And that's why the key to racism is sensitivity training.  seminars and this sort of stuff, more research, as you guys were talking about, and this notion that it's in the air and it's everywhere and it rests in the most subtle gesture, in the tiniest inflection, in language.  And all of this, by this time, by the 2000s, becomes a very different kettle of fish than the early foundations of it.  I would say the last two years, it takes on a different cast altogether.  It starts out with this slogan of anti-essentialism.  But by now, I would argue, it's a profoundly essentialist doctrine, but around race, not around class or economics.  And that's what this 1619 project in the New York Times, I mean, if you look at the 1619 project, Trump's interpretation is not outlandish.  It sees race as what it called the original sin.  It sees racism as in hearing in white culture.  It doesn't explain where it comes from.  It's just there.  And race is what produces and what generates the inequalities of society, not class.  Race is the original sin, the poor category that out of which flows everything else.  And it's in everyone.  That's what they mean by systemic racism.  That's why all of us, us meaning white people, have to unlearn it.  Well, then yeah, they've got to take over the school.  You've got to rewrite the textbooks.  Kendi has to be the czar of anti-racist scholarship.  There's a committee that will pronounce on whether or not a textbook or an article is sufficiently anti-racist.  That is a profoundly authoritarian trend.  There's nothing Marxist about it.  If only Trump would watch this show, he would know that about critical race theory.  Listen, this is a fight.  The left today is a left that sees no problem with all of these things that I'm criticizing right now.  And it simply comes down to this.  If the left is ever going to be relevant outside of these teeny tiny eddies, the professional managerial class, it's going to have to gather up the resolve to stand up and say, this is horseshit.  And it's profoundly reactionary.  I don't really care anymore.  I've been doing this now for 30, 35 years.  I'm to the point where I'm just tired of having to convince people who call themselves leftists that poverty and inequality is what your focus should be.  The fact that you have to say this on the left is astonishing.  It just shows that it's not a leftist.  It's something else.  They should come up with a different name for themselves.  I just don't know what to call it. ",
