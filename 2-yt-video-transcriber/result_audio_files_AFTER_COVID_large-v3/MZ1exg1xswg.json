JT, over the course of the last few years, our viewers have seen us cover some magnificent video on blood.  1914, Jesus is not your mediator.  You name it, we've covered it.  Why don't the leaders catch this, amend their policies, their behaviors?  Talk to me about leadership and the Jehovah's Witnesses. ",

What I was introduced to is what is known as Jehovah's Witness reformists.  One guy said, JT, you are a JW elder who wants to reform things.  And what that basically means is there are lots of Jehovah's Witnesses who are actually watching this video right now.  Dedicated, baptized Jehovah's Witnesses.  And they'll say, I love Jehovah, I love the friends of the congregation.  But deep down inside, they know that there's some things that are wrong.  And the witness has been told, wait on Jehovah, wait on Jehovah.  But more and more people are starting to realize it really ain't got nothing to do with Jehovah.  It has to do with the people, as you said, in the leadership role.  I was told before I left this organization, I was told, I went to some brothers, I talked to them, and they said, JT, this is what they said, they said, JT, look, man, once we get some new blood, Once we get some new blood, JT, things are going to change.  You know, the governing body now, Fred, Franz, all these guys, they're up in age, man.  The next generation are going to be younger governing body members.  They're going to be more in tune with what's going on for young people.  It's going to be some changes.  All you got to do is wait.  Well, all the governing body that I knew when I was at Bethel are gone.  And now we have what we have.  We have what we have.  who are serving in the leadership roles in this organization.  And so the question that you asked is an excellent question.  Why don't they catch it?  Why don't they change?  Well, there's a lot of reasons.  And if you like, I would like to share some with you.

            "text": "You know, that's a good question.  The White Star likes to play around with who the leaders are.  For many of us over the years, we were told that the leaders were the faithful and discreet slave.  And the governing body was merely a representative of this faithful and discreet slave.  We were taught that the faithful and discreet slave went all the way back to the apostles.  And therefore, these individuals who serve on the governing body, they're just merely a representation of these who make up the faithful and discreet slave.  This channel that God has had from the first century, Pentecost, all the way down to the day, all the dark ages, the 1500s, 1600s, God always had someone of the faithful and discreet slave.  That's who the leadership was.  Well, that's what we were told.  And then in October of 2012, A big announcement was made that there is no faithful and discreet slave.  back in those days.  We are the faithful and discreet slaves, what the governing body told everybody.  Us eight guys up on this stage, we are the faithful and discreet slave.  And for people who were, quote unquote, of the anointed, they just got fired.  They just lost their job with just a stroke of a pen.  And so the leadership that Jehovah's Witnesses have basically can be summed up in the governing body.  They are the mouthpiece of God.  And as far as the circuit overseers and elders, branch overseers, they just simply fall in the pecking order, in the corporate pecking order. ",

They just be imperfect men.  That was basically what every witness has been told all their life.  But when you start digging, asking questions, taking a step back, and looking at stuff critically, what you begin to see, unfortunately, is just sheer arrogance.  Basically, they got a train started back on the Charles Taz Russell And they realize we're not going to get off this train.  We're going to ride it to the end, to the wheels fall off, as it were.  And so over the years, the organization has simply held positions, even positions that they knew were wrong.  You and I had to discuss something about Ray Franz's book, Crises of Conscience.  And in his book, he talked about that as far back as 1970, ",
