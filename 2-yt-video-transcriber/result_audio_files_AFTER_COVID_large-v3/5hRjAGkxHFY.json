            "text": "Hi my name's Mike and today I've got a message to share from the Fofo Prophecy News site called Beware the Elements of Nature are Rising Up given to Cryptic One.  And it begins with.  this message was given on the 25th of August 2020 and the 27th of August 2020.  Before I start, I just want to say that as children of God, we should have no fear of what's coming because God will protect us wherever comes our way.  And this is how it starts.  Daughter, the end is near.  My people are fearful of what is coming.  Tremor shook the land.  Tremor will shake the land once again.  Earthquakes, tsunamis, majestic displays in the cosmos akin to Aurora Boilaris.  Heavenly projectiles thrust to the earth below.  Signs and wonders will abound in that day.  Mountains will move from their foundations.  The seas will roar to and fro with unprecedented power and might.  Volcanoes will explode in fury.  unleashed magma churning burning living static energy soon to be released upon the earth and to its inhabitants.  celestial bodies will tumble from their place in the heavenlies and be thrust from their foundations as well.  falling stars falling meteors Comets and the like will rain down from the skies.  Meteor showers will pan across the sky in a fiery light show.  Celestial beings too will enter your atmosphere.  These who fell from their first estate.  The mark, the beast, the changing of the guard is about to begin.  Good will appear as evil, black as white.  The lines are blurred and still my children sleep.  But I shall awaken them soon, very soon, for there is much work that needs to be done to bring in the lost souls on their way to perdition.  The Antichrist who stands in opposition to everything I am.  Sorcerers, demons, witches, warlocks.  You will see these entities returning to the earth soon.  many have given themselves over to the wicked one the son of satan himself.  i speak of the man of perdition who will soon rise in power and great authority greater than any authority in your earthly realm.  he will bedazzle the masses charming them into his grip and they will become his slaves for all eternity.  Do not take the mark nor the vaccine.  Both of these entrapments will alter your humanity and deny your right to eternal salvation.  Remember this.  Salvation alone is for mankind.  And once you take of the mark or the vaccine, you are doomed and lost to me forever for eternity.  I am that I am that I am.  I was I am.  What will be, will be.  The destruction of your planet is begun.  Cracks in the Earth, magma rising, temperature fluctuations and more.  Disruption of the weather patterns, satellites falling.  Earth's inner chamber, inner core releasing waves of energy, breaking Earth's crusts.  Tectonic plates shifting and levelling.  Midnight skies blacker than black.  will envelop the earth soon.  i have already told my people of the darkness to come that will encapsulate the planet.  it will cover the world enveloping it in darkness like never before.  winds howling high rates of speed breaking twisting total destruction.  where it passes extreme weather patterns changes in temperatures will shift from heat to cold expanding hail thunderstorms lightning from the sky will do substantial damage to man and beast.  but where the elements of nature are rising up for the annihilation of the world is near torrential rains flooding you will have to seek higher ground.  in some cases emergency situations will become commonplace as people search for places to hide from the onslaught of my judgments upon the earth.  foolish souls seek me and you will live.  i speak in terms of eternity for many will have to take up their cross for my name's sake.  many will die by persecution and be martyred for my sake.  but behold a heavenly reward awaits those who give up their lives for my sake and for those who persevere.  to the end The oceans will roar and cower the land, seeping into the cities and coastal areas.  Nothing will be spared as my judgments are poured forth upon this sinful generation, the generation that will see the return of the Messiah Yeshua.  Be ready, O mighty saints, to walk in exploits unheard of.  The world will step back in awe and wonder at the miracles that will be unleashed through my church.  Return to me, O saints of the Most High, return to your first love.  The storm clouds are gathering and evil is rearing its ugly head.  You have witnessed but the beginning of the takedown of your nation, America.  Soon destruction comes at your door.  Be prepared for the fall in the fall.  Be ready, O Church.  I come soon upon the clouds of glory, your risen Lord and Saviour, your mighty Prince of Peace who comes to wage war upon the earth.  The Lion of the tribe of Judah returns from whence he came.  Be ready.  I come.  I come soon.  And that's the end of the message.  There's a scripture given in Matthew 24, 29 to 30.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.  The stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And that's the end of the message.  Anyone out there who hasn't come to Lord Jesus, please don't wait as time is running out.  God bless you all.  Bye-bye. ",
