            "text": "Everybody got a chance, saying that even if the South is not popular because of racism and slavery, that they can still have a shot and still dominate in politics by voting only in the Electoral College.  And in 1970, they appointed me.  I don't think there was another black in the country put into the Electoral College.  I was in the Electoral College.  I got a chance to vote.  Electoral College was based on how many representatives that you had in the country.  Like for instance, every state had two, they were entitled to two votes in the Electoral College just because of two senators they had.  And based on how many persons you had elected to the Congress, House of Representatives, you got those and additional votes.  Like I said, Florida had 17 people in the Congress, and then they had two senators, they had 19 votes in the Electoral College.  Are you following me now?  Okay, and that's where the power came from.  So the South then was dominant because the South had the resources.  And what they don't tell you, they lie to you to tell you that Civil War was fought to free the slave.  That's bullshit.  The Civil War had very little to do with slavery.  They talk about, you black folk got to love Lincoln because Lincoln set y'all free.  Lincoln ain't set a damn soul, not one soul free.  He said not one black free.  What they were fighting over, the North was fighting the South over the industrial development and the resources that were coming out of the South.  The cotton, the rice, the indigo, the tobacco, all that stuff coming out of the South.  The vegetables, the gut food stuff is coming out.  And the iron industry and all that stuff was coming out of the South.  That's what they were fighting for.  So now to get back to your question, with strong thermos, strong thermos, strong thermos theory, still represented that group.  It was called the Solid South.  S-O-L-I-D, the Solid South.  It was still locked as a block.  You still see them right now every day in the politics.  They're called the red states.  See all those red states that show up?  The blue states are now, let's say in those days, the Democrat was really those red states.  They changed seats in 1930.  They changed uniform.  And see, the old Republican Party in 1930s became the Democrats, and the old red Mexican conservative Democrats became the Republicans. ",

            "text": "Okay, so when you were meeting with Strom Thurmond, there's a lot of people who say that you shouldn't even talk to a racist.  You shouldn't even negotiate with a racist.  They were saying that about Ice Cube with Donald Trump.  What's your perspective on that?  Negotiating with somebody who they say doesn't like black people.  Is that something that you think that you agree with or disagree with?  What do you think? ",

            "text": "You have to communicate with some of them.  You have to.  You have no choice.  But if you're a weak person and have no balls, don't do it.  Do not contact and negotiate with racists or conservatives if you don't have enough balls and a consciousness to be able to stand up strong because you'll signal weakness.  The biggest reason why whites and conservatives hate black folk and black folk don't know what it is.  They say, well, they hate me because I'm black.  They don't give a damn because you're black.  That's not the issue.  Know it.  Know it.  Can somebody out there come in and help me explain this stuff to them?  Damn.  They go, well, the doctor, he's because I'm black.  They don't give a damn about your blackness.  He'd go out and lay in the sun for three days just to get as dark as you are.  He can say about blackness.  What he's concerned about is that he perceives you as being a weak ass.  That's what it is.  He says that you're a weak ass.  That's why I don't like, I hate you because you're weak.  And see, but then that's why they see.  the whites always had more respect for the Indians than they had for black folk.  Because they say, well, Indians, we'll save the Indians, let Indians go to school.  We'll make them go to school, and we'll build schools for them.  And we'll cut deals with them and make treaties with them.  Why?  Because they got some balls.  They will start up a fight.  If we kidnap Indians and have them, put them into slavery, they wouldn't stay there more than a day.  They'll either run away or the rest of the Indians will come get them and rescue them.  You black folk let somebody rip your ass day and night, 24 hours on the hour, and you keep saying... We shall overcome someday. ",
