            "text": "This guy, Konstantin Kaysen, I'm not sure who he is.  What is he?  He's a winner of Jewish Comedian of the Year in Coast of the Triggered Pod.  Centrist Chad.  Here's what he writes.  I'm going to read you this whole thread.  It's very, very important.  He writes, you're going to hate me for writing this.  You're going to resist what I say because you don't want it to be true.  You're going to pretend that I want this to be true, when in fact, there's nothing I hate more than the fact that it has come to this.  Here's what happens next.  If protesters continue to deface monuments like Winston Churchill's statue and burn British flags on the cenotaph, you will see groups forming to defend them.  These groups will be composed primarily of young, angry white men and led by people with links to groups like the EDL and Tommy Robinson.  This is already happening.  The groups will gather in city centers to, quote, defend our country.  They will have names with words like patriotic British defense in them.  Inevitably, they will clash with the current protesters and the police under pressure from the media and political class.  The police will overreact.  They will treat these groups differently to the BLM protesters.  They will use force.  They will detain people for breaking lockdown rules.  They will issue stiff sentences.  The media will do the opposite of what they did with Black Lives Matter.  Instead of talking about how, quote, 27 police officers were injured in largely peaceful protests.  They will run major front page headlines like 27 police officers injured by far-right violence.  At this point, the majority of the public will lose the ability to be nuanced.  The double standards will be too obvious to ignore.  Fueled by a constant stream of images of white people kneeling, washing POC feet, and publicly apologizing as they already are, they will conclude that their very identity is under attack.  At this point, all their sensible aversion to supporting thuggish far-right groups will evaporate.  they will believe they are in a war for their survival and extreme measures are justified.  At the next election, which will likely be brought forward for one reason or another, fueled by mass unemployment resulting from the economic depression, far-right parties will make significant inroads.  When I say far-right, I am not talking about what the far-left call far-right, such as anyone who talks about controlling immigration.  I'm talking about genuine far-right parties that talk about reversing immigration and deportations.  These parties will not win seats or get anywhere near government, but they will put a UKIP-like pressure on the conservatives.  Boris Johnson will likely be ousted as too soft and liberal and replaced by a law and order hardliner.  From here, I'm afraid, the journey is all too obvious.  The only way to prevent this is to reverse the re-racialization of our society.  Either we learn to live together or the very idea of a multi-ethnic society is over.  End.  I completely agree.  And there's another article that talks about this.  that says, quote, far right groups are already showing up in the UK to defend and to fight back.  And you already have the sentiment in the US that you have clearly one ideology that is favored by the police, Fort Worth, New York, and the racetrack in North Carolina that claimed to be a protest got shut down.

They're under attack.  They're losing their jobs.  How does this make sense?  Then some racial slurs got dropped.  He was forced to apologize.  But this is a very important story because it shows you that, I mean, this guy, I don't, I didn't listen to the conversation.  It didn't sound like he was overtly racist, but it did sound like he was angry that he as a white man was being attacked simply for being white.  There are memes about this where it's like you've got a bunch of people saying something like, you know, you're white and you're bad.  So then all the white people band together and they go, oh, no, they're forming evil groups.  And it's like you threatened them.  You insulted them based on race.  So they did exactly what anyone would expect them to do.  They created a group based on what they were being attacked over.  So I think things like this are obvious.

And the regular liberals got attacked by them, too, and just kind of stood back and did nothing.  And that's kind of how the bad stuff happens.  So I wonder if, in the end, when given the choice between what they call progress but is actually just a mishmash of weird ideas and authoritarian traditionalism, people choose what's familiar and what they think will be safe and fine.  Think about it this way, man.  They banned Gone with the Wind.  But they also banned Baby, It's Cold Outside.  There's going to be a ton of people who are in their 40s and 50s who are going to think back to that suburban life where it was Christmas time and they woke up early in the morning and there was mom making a batch of chocolate chip cookies.  And she turned on the song, Baby, It's Cold Outside.  And then they remember mom dancing with dad and having a good time.  And they're going to say that was home.  That was family.  That was safe.  And now they're being told you're wrong, you're evil, you're racist.  Some people fall for it.  Some people are going to say that was bad.  Now, tradition is absolutely fine.  It's the authoritarianism part where things become evil.  Progress is absolutely fine.  It's the authoritarian part where things become evil.  Yeah.  So we have right now a liberal society.

The conservatives have been speaking up and they get banned for it.  Why?  Because liberals won't speak up.  I've talked to my friends about it and they're just like, oh, I don't know.
