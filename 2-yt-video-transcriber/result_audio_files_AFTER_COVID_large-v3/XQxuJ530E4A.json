            "text": "So I'm sitting here, you know, self-quarantined, social distancing as recommended by the CDC, no other reason, all my friends are six feet apart, just out of frame, social distancing too.  Had a big video planned about the coronavirus, but that's just all my feed is right now.  Everyone's talking about the coronavirus, and I'm not gonna lie, My anxiety is through the roof about it.  I live in New York where the most cases of it are, so that's cool, that's fun.  Celebrities are just not doing very well, crying in their mansion, literally withering away, Madonna doing whatever this is.  Let's go eat some fried fish, fried fish.  Come on, vote and go.  Let's go eat some fried fish, fried fish, cause there's no more pasta.  Day six without child sacrifice.  But I figured to get our minds off of this pandemic, to get our minds off of the literal apocalypse, I would bring our focus back to some dumb, pointless shit.  So I'm scrolling through my feed, mad online, as one does, and then there I saw it.  Introducing the New Warriors.  A classic team reunites to mentor a new generation of heroes.  When Kamala's Law goes- Kamala's Law.  That's a cursed name.  But anyway.  When Kamala's Law goes into effect in the highly anticipated one-shot outlawed, super heroics will be left to the adults and underage heroes will be banned unless they have official government-assigned mentors.  That's where the new warriors come in.  So I'm going to show you guys these characters.  Screen time.  You remember Ben 10?  This is him now.  Feel old yet?  A, oh my god, the words can't even come out of my mouth.  A meme obsessed, oh my god, I'm done.  A meme obsessed super teen whose brain became connected to the internet.  after becoming exposed to his grandfather's experimental internet gas.  What does that even mean?  This is literally somebody's deviantart fanfiction.  Who is responsible for this?  Stan Lee is rolling in his grave.  Now he can see augmented reality and real-time maps.  and can instantly google any fact.  the man's power is using a smartphone.  my man's power is google.com.  what are they gonna be like in the middle of battle like screen time help us and then dude's just like yeah one sec also.  i'm pretty sure we're going to have this technology in like a few years.  if we don't already like just connecting our brains to like google home or alexa Now showing results for, Am I a Furry?  And there's this one.  Be negative.  A teen living vampire exposed to Michael Morbis' blood as a child in a rogue but life-saving medical procedure.  He still ages like a regular kid but has the abilities of Morbius.  He's also obsessed with all the music, an attitude of a classic long past decades like the 90s and 2000s.  The world is a vampire and so am I. B Negative is the goth kid.  This would have been like my fanfiction self-insert when I was like 15.  His name is B Negative and he listens to MCR and he's a goth and he hates preps and he's not like the other girls.  I mean, vampires.  Trailblazer.  A regular kid scooped up into the world of teenage superheroing.  Her magical backpack is actually a pocket dimension with seemingly infinite space from which she can pull out.  useful or random- Is this Dora the Explorer?  What if somebody takes her backpack off?  These heroes are useless.  What will these people do?  They were just like faced with someone with a gun.  Just like dead, dead, dead.  Oh, you didn't Google fast enough.  Dead.  But I saved the best or the worst, however you want to look at it, for last.  Snowflake and safe space.  Because 2014 never ended, and we're in purgatory.  Psychic twins.  All twins are psychic, but we're psychicker.  Wait, okay, they're twins.  What is going on over here?  I need an adult.  Snowflake, a kyriokenic, can materialize.  snowflake-shaped shuriken.  What are these weeb words?  This is murica.  Safe space can materialize pink force fields, but he can't inhabit them himself.  Imagine being non-binary and having like zero representation anywhere.  and then you finally do get a non-binary character and their names are fucking Snowflake and safe space.  It's the idea that these terms get thrown around on the internet that they don't see as derogatory.  They take those words and kind of wear them as badges of honor.  Okay, I, you know I fucking hate ID poll, you know I hate like vapid identity politics, but the guy who created this is not non-binary, he's just a regular, like, regular, regular dude.  This is like some hyper woke, out of touch, liberal perception of like, non-binary.  Take back the word snowflake.  This is like this dude making like a Mexican character and calling them like, wet back or making like a black character and calling them n- Safe Space is a big burly sort of stereotypical jock.  Snowflake is non-binary and goes by they them.  Ah yes, the two genders.  Jock and non-binary.  What is that?  What?  What?  This is like someone pointing to me and my boyfriend and going, that's the Star Wars nerd and that's the woman.  This is like low-key, no, this is high-key insulting.  This is like somehow worse than Someone straight up just making fun of a non-binary person.  This is like some benevolent try hard shit.  Why does safe space get to be like this burly jock and then snowflake is just they them non-binary?  I was really curious to see if this pandering actually works.  So I went on Twitter and I asked, what do non-binary people think of this?  If you're non-binary, like, tell me your opinion about this.  And these were the answers I got.  I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.  So obviously pandering with a complete blatant lack of understanding of the subject matters.  Lame.  Hate.  This is some token shit right here.  This shit sucks, LMAO.  Tokenization.  Feels like a slap to the face.  Utterly disgusted.  Not sure who let this became a thing.  Genuine gender dysphoria sweeping through my veins looking at this.  Nonbinary isn't some character archetype token lol.  This is fucking ridiculous.  Feels super tone deaf.  I wanna burn it so badly.  Fuck this shit, man.  I just want representation.  Good representation.  Well too bad, you're getting snowflake, and you're gonna like it.  I don't know what to say.  On one hand this makes me laugh so hard my stomach hurts, but on the other hand it makes me sad, because I know there will be people using it as an example of forced diversity, or use this to make fun of non-binary people.  Or everyone will just forget about it in a week.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be that last one.  Not sure what's worse, the obvious pandering or the fact that we'll be the ones to blame for it.  I don't think any anti-SJW or at least the people who subscribe to my channel are going to blame non-binary people for this very blatant, try-hard pandering.  As a woman, I know what it's like for companies to try to pander to me.  And it sucks and it's cringe and I hate it.  This is just pandering to a minority who are starved for representation.  You know what?  This pair is non-binary.  So there you go.  You now have better representation on the Shoe On Head channel than you do in Marvel.  You're welcome.  Just give us good characters.  Stop gender swapping people.  Stop tokenizing people.  Like maybe this will be good.  Maybe.  I know there was a lot of freak out about that. ",
