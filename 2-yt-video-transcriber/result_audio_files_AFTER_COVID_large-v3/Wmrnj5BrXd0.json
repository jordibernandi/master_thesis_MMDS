I thought it was a good speech.  I was glad to see him make an appeal towards unity.  I think all of us would like to see greater national unity at this time when we have so much division, so much anger and hatred pulling this country apart.  But then he left giving that speech and he returned to the Oval Office and literally within minutes began signing these executive orders that were radical and extreme.  As you noted, he signed an order canceling the Keystone pipeline.  11,000 jobs with a stroke of a pen he made go away.  8,000 of those are union jobs.  And at the same time, he rejoined the Paris climate deal, which threatens to destroy thousands of high paying jobs across this country.  And the answer, I've asked multiple Biden nominees what they would say to the union workers who just lost their jobs because Joe Biden decided they didn't deserve a job.  And essentially, nominee after nominee after nominee has said, well, Tough luck.  You know, John Kerry in that same news conference you put up, he said, well, they need to learn to make better choices.  What an arrogant, out of touch statement for a centimillionaire to say, you know, you little people.  You know, I don't like the choices you're making, and so your jobs go away.  As John Kerry said right there, quelle surprise that the Democratic elites have decided that blue-collar workers, that union members, that men and women with calluses on their hands they've made the wrong choices in john kerry's words.  well that that is not a unifying message.  it's not doing with a job we should be doing fighting for working men and women in this country.

The first thing they do is look to where to cut the fat.  Where am I going to cut back because I'm facing new fees?  I'm facing new regulatory hurdles.  Are you expecting business to look at these new regulations around climate and say, well, I'm going to have to cut here.  I'm going to have to cut there.  And we know that the oil industry is not just one segment.  There's a lot of indirect exposure throughout the economy and business that gets touched by this. ",

Notice it's never their jobs they're giving away.  It's never their Silicon Valley billionaire supporters.  It's, it's never Wall Street.  It's never Hollywood.  It's they're willing to give away someone else's job.  And look, among these orders, one of the things Joe Biden did is he shut down new energy exploration on federal land, just shut it down again with a stroke of a pen.  And by the way, you know who that helps?  That helps Russia.  That helps Iran.  That helps Venezuela.  That means America relies more on Middle East oil, sending billions of dollars to nations that are not our friends.  And it pollutes the environment worse.  The irony of what they're doing is there will be worse pollution.  You know, something that neither Joe Biden or John Kerry ever address.  Maria, do you know what nation last year had the single greatest total carbon reduction of any nation on the face of the earth?  The answer, of course, is the United States.  Yes.  And what they're doing is slowing that down.  They're saying, let's not rely on lesser producing, more efficient job creating American energy.  Instead, let's go back to being energy dependent on foreign nations.  This is hurting a lot of jobs and it's undermining the security of our country. ",

You know, one of the really disturbing patterns that we've seen come out in this past week with Biden nominee after Biden nominee is a warm embrace of China.  that you want to talk about.  one of the most dramatic shifts the next four years are going to entail is the Biden administration crawling into bed with China.  You know, I asked multiple Biden nominees, for example, whether they would maintain Huawei on the entities list because Huawei is a global espionage company masquerading as a telecom company.  Not a single one of the Biden nominees was willing to commit to keep Huawei on that list.  And I'll tell you today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we had the confirmation hearing for Biden's nominee to be ambassador of the United Nations.  She disclosed that just a little over a year ago, in October of 2019, she gave a paid speech before a Confucius Institute.  Now, Confucius Institutes, as you know, are paid for by the Chinese Communist Party, paid for by the Chinese government.  They engage in espionage and propaganda.  I authored bipartisan legislation in the Senate that passed into law that has shut down dozens of Confucius Institutes.  Well, Biden's nominee to be UN ambassador just over a year ago gave a paid speech there praising China and saying America needs to be more like China.  This is dangerous that this administration as a policy decision is embracing and getting into bed with China. ",

Joe Biden, one of the orders he signed says you can't refer to the COVID-19 virus as the China virus or the Wuhan virus because God forbid we acknowledge where it came from and which country spent months silencing, oppressing, imprisoning the doctors trying to stop the spread of this virus.  And, and the Chinese communist government bears direct responsibility for the hundreds of thousands of lives that have been lost because of COVID-19 and the Biden administration, it seems virtually none of them are willing to actually say that out loud.

It will take all 50 Democrats agreeing to break the rules and blow the Senate rules up to end the filibuster.  Right now, there are two Democrats who are saying they will oppose that, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.  If they actually hold the line that will be a big benefit for the country.  Now, I got to admit, if passed his prologue, Chuck Schumer has been very good at putting the thumbscrews to Democrats, and I actually wonder if they're literal thumbscrews at times, because they have had a party discipline that is remarkable.  So I hope Joe and Kirsten can hold the line.  If they do, the worst legislative excesses that the Democrats want to pass won't pass into law.  So if the Democrats don't have the votes to end the filibuster, DC won't become a state.  Why do Democrats want DC to become a state?  Because they want two more Democratic senators.  Likewise, if the Democrats don't have the votes to end the filibuster, they will not succeed with their radical plan to pack the US Supreme Court, to add four new left-wing activist justices to the court, to take it from nine justices to 13, which would profoundly undermine our fundamental rights of free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment.  That being said, even if they don't end the filibuster, we're going to see a lot of harmful policies the next two and four years.  We're going to see executive actions.  We're going to see regulatory actions.  We're going to see national security actions.  And they're going to take up what's called budget reconciliation, which is a procedural mechanism to get around the filibuster, which means we are headed for a massive tax increase.  They can do that with just Democratic votes.  I don't think they're just going to repeal the 2017 tax cut.  They are going to raise the taxes on every working American.  That's coming.  And I'll tell you, I'm committed to doing everything I can in the Senate to lead the fight to stop policies that hurt jobs and that take away our freedoms. ",
