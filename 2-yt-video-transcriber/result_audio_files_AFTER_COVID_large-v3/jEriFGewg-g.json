            "text": "Brothers and sisters, I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  I would like to give thanks to Mike 44, to Jeff Bailey, and to Lisa, and to all my subscribers.  Thank you.  May God bless and keep you.  Be strong and continue in prayers.  I have a message again from the Holy Spirit.  And this message was given to me on July 8 at 8.15 p.m I heard, I am the father, write down what I say.  And I continued hearing this message for about two days after that, my brothers and sisters.  The confirmation number for this message is 227- Greek.  it means true, truly and truthful and in Hebrew it means beginning, even and from.  The scripture that goes with this that I get from the Holy Spirit is Psalm 97.  My brothers and sisters, this is the message.  I am thy father, the one who created thee.  The time has come for me to bring judgment upon the world.  It is written in my word, the testimony.  I have sent out my prophets and watchmen to give testimony of my son's death, the one who shed his blood and was lifted up for the world to see.  I created mankind for womankind, but men have taken my creation and made a creation of their own.  The unlearned, the uninstructed, the wicked, the vile.  Their hearts are in darkness and they follow the prince of this world whose heart is full of pride and wickedness.  For this now, my judgment comes swiftly.  Make no mistake, for it is already here.  Thy eyes have seen nothing yet, for when it starts, men's hearts shall fail them.  It is not I that brings judgment on thee, but it is of yourself.  you have chosen your destiny.  Brace yourself, for judgment comes to the whole world.  Who has an ear, let him hear what the Father said.  It shall delay no longer.  What is coming to thee is catastrophic.  I am the Lord thy God.  Judgment comes swiftly.  My babies will be taken away from this filthy and corrupted world.  To the ones I have chosen, do not be afraid, for thou shall abide under my wings.  I have given thee power, love, and a sound mind.  Continue in prayers and obedience.  Thy father must bring judgment to wake up a sleeping church.  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.  They understand not.  It shall come swiftly without warning.  The people shall weep bitterly and many shall commit suicide.  It is thy father that make wrath against thee.  Wait for it.  It is coming.  And this is the end of the message, my brothers and sisters.  With everything, take this to the Lord in prayer.  My brothers and sisters, let us be obedient to our Father.  He said for us to stay in obedience and continue praying.  And for those who don't know Jesus Christ yet, I am hoping that you are listening to this message and that you will seek the Lord before it's too late.  My brothers and sisters, God love you and I love you.  And have a wonderful night.  Bye-bye. ",
