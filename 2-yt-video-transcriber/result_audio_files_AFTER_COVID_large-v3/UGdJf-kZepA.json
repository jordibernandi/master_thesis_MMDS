            "text": "I want to talk today about the coherence theory of truth.  The coherence theory is relatively recent to the philosophical scene.  Throughout the history of philosophy, most philosophers who have reflected on the nature of truth have been correspondence theorists.  They've said that something is true if and only if it tells us the way the world is, and so a sentence is true if and only if it corresponds to a fact.  or it maps onto the world in a structure-preserving way.  It depicts the way things are.  And so they've thought in terms of something like correspondence, or a picture theory, or a structure-preserving function that takes us from language to the world, maybe from thought to the world as well.  I want to think about things in a slightly different way, though, because we might think that's not the right approach for a variety of reasons, but we might try to take a different perspective.  Francis Herbert Bradley, often called F.H.  Bradley for short, was a British philosopher around the turn of the century.  who developed a comprehensive idealistic theory and put forward a coherence theory of truth.  The coherence theory breaks away from this talk of facts or structure-preserving functions or pictures and instead says that language is doing something different and we have to evaluate claims about truth in a different way.  Why?  Well, we'll see his reasons in a moment.  Basically, he is highly suspicious of this talk of picturing, of a talk of a structure-preserving function, or talk of something like correspondence to a fact.  In fact, he denounces facts as vicious abstractions.  And here is what he says instead.  A sentence is true if it coheres with a comprehensive theory of the world.  Now, at first glance, that's a rather strange thing.  You might think, a comprehensive theory of the world?  Well, there could be many comprehensive theories of the world, and some of them are a lot better than others, so you might worry that this is going to destroy the notion of truth altogether.  And indeed, that's an objection that's been made against the coherence theory of truth.  But Bradley has in mind something that is truly comprehensive, including not only all of my experiences of the world, but all of our experiences of the world, and maybe not just up to now, but in general throughout the fullness of time.  And so if you think of it that way, you might think of a comprehensive theory as a theory that really is a theory of everything, not just in the sense of the physicists who want a theory that explains all the fundamental forces of the universe, for example, but that really explains everything, everything from the success of the 1927 Yankees to the weak force in physics, to the existence of dark matter, to... the beauty of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to, well, anything you think of, right?  Anything about the world, it explains that.  And so think about a comprehensive theory that basically tells us everything that coheres with our experience in any way at all.  Well, to be true is to be part of, or to be at least coherent with, that theory.  And when we think of truth that way and realize, by comprehensive, Bradley means comprehensive with a capital C. then it retains a bit more plausibility.  Still, you might worry that that doesn't pin down the concept of truth.  Maybe all of our experiences taken together, even those of every human being throughout the entire stretch of time, past, present, and future, would nevertheless leave open some possibilities and might lead us, in fact, to false beliefs about the world.  So we should think carefully about the coherence theory and what it really amounts to.  In order to do that, let's think about Bradley's reasons for maintaining the coherence theory and for moving away from the correspondence theory of truth.  He does think of facts as vicious abstractions, as the imaginary creatures of a false theory.  He says they're manufactured by a mind which has ",
