I was supposed to win that fight.  Bro, if I got decked in the stomach and you know that... you know that fuck in front of my whole my family my brother and we walked back the walk of shame.  but that was a humbling experience for me.  I've had to take L's like that my whole life.  you know what they say about L's.  you know what I'm saying.  two wrongs don't make a right but two L's make a W every time you say this. ",

Guys who are less attractive and who grew up less physically attractive and not as attractive to women when they were younger, don't get old or older, become attractive, and then reject hot women because they're angry about their childhood.
