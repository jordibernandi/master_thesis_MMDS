Manhattan laughs so loud.  At the queen's kid with the biggest mouth Had no class, had no clout Till your dad laid millions out He and Roy Cohen showing how To cheat and steal.  How do we fail?  How do it feel?  I'll tell you.  Like a toenail ingrown.  Like a badly broken bone.  Like a kidney stone.  Ah, you had the grades you got in school, but there's no way that stable genius brain got straight A's back then.  Nobody's ever had so many big bankruptcies.  Now only Deutsch will lend you one red cent.  You say to hire Americans Why you lowball your employee immigrants?  That foundation you have came and went.  They just paid for portraits, scams and rents.  And hey, is this Ukraine?  Let's make a deal.  How do we fail?  How do we fail?  I'll tell you Like a gasket blown Locked down like Al Capone Like a defaulted load Like a kidney stone.  Ah, you better turn and see your GOP.  Senators are freaking cause they're tanking thanks to you.  Barely got elected four years back and now there's a deadly virus putting its stank on you.  The shameless plug of your golf course, you tweet it out.  Our numbers keep rising on the body count.  Your bottom line's all you care about.  You call that winning while we drown.  But you're gonna lose cause there's news you can't conceive.  How do we fail?  How do we fail?  I'll tell you again.  Like a real fake moan.  Like low testosterone.  Like really bad cologne.  Like a kidney stone.  Oh, women that you meet are hardly people.  You just get to grab them and stab them with your nasty words.  Payoffs and company checks, then another home gets wrecked, oh yes.  I wonder if it hurts.  But nobody's here cheering you.  Yeah, your Poland's going south.  The reporters you abuse All aching for November And the day you lose When you will discover All the ugly truth.  It's a miracle.  now When you disappear We will be healed.  How do you feel?  Oh, how do you feel?  Tweeting on your phone With no compassion shown While people die alone.  People die alone. ",
