The first roadblock was a cow and fuck.  does she look tasty in the event that we have to hunt.  So I needed a better look at the landscape to identify any more sustainable food sources.  So I climbed to the top of the truck and wow, immediately spotted a pack of wild pigs.  As we approached the pack, we realized that they as well are blocking the road.  In fact, they seem to have a nest with Young.  As we approached the nest, we realized that these are dirty costumed pigs, not fit for human consumption.  Now instead of a meal, they're looking more along the lines of about 1,200 pounds of hammered dog shit, which as we all know is pretty much useless.  Now the older pig is going to try and protect his young by not allowing us to educate him, barking bullshit orders at us.  I can smell their fear.  So I jump into the nest. ",
