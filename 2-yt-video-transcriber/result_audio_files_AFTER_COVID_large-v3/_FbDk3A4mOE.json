As many of you know, I am often late to the game.  But when I finally take the field, I'm the first person to make sure it's properly fertilized.  Even if I have to fertilize it myself.  In that vein, I have to confess, I completely missed out on the whole essential oils thing.  And by missed out, I'm referring to capitalizing and monetizing, in essence, profiting.  The John Hopkins Medicine website says that essential oils don't work for everyone.  But there's no harm in trying them as long as you use them in a safe way.  And I might add, so long as you're not one of those people who've had a severe toxic reaction causing welts, blisters, swollen eyes, etc.  Hopkins says, even if they just boost your mood, it can make a positive impact on your health and well-being.  Of course, I'm concerned first and foremost about the well-being of you, my audience.  which is why I'm announcing my latest venture, Don't Terra Non-Essential Oils.  This is not yet a reality.  I'll need your support to make it happen, but I can't imagine anyone standing on the sidelines when an idea like this can possibly, however unlikely, change the lives of millions of people.  Non-essential oils are oils that all of us could benefit from, but are yet in the hands of the few.  For instance, it's a known fact that pheromones can impact the behavior of individuals receiving them, making some people more successful in a given field than others.  We want to make something similar available to anyone who wants to pay an excessive amount of money to acquire such a thing.  We're contracting with some of the most beautiful people on the planet, Hollywood stars, models, singers, fitness gurus,  etc.,  to acquire their workout clothes, including headbands, socks, underwear,  etc.,  and harvesting the pheromone-rich sweat which makes these folks so attractive to the opposite sex.  We believe, despite a complete lack of evidence, that this will make you and yours more attractive and sexually desirable.  Likewise, I've suffered throughout my life with extremely oily skin.  But that oily skin has been the source of my youthful appearance, keeping me from the wrinkles that naturally come with aging.  When people find out that I'm actually 93 years old, they are shocked and instantly want to know my secret.  Before Don't Tara... I had no way to pass that on.  Now I'm taking something which has been a huge negative in my life and turning it into something positive that can help others, all while expanding my sense of purpose and pocketbook.  In order to make this happen, I'll need you to go to my Patreon page and become a patron of these shows.  On top of helping me launch this new venture, you'll get insightful, humorous content in video form at least four to five times a month.  as well as all kinds of other benefits which are neither specified nor likely.  You are not going to want to miss out on this amazing opportunity, even if it never happens.  And to all of you who've already helped out, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  And I'll leave you all with our new Don't Terra tagline.  I thought of this one myself.  Don't Terra, non-essential oils.  They're in no way essential until they're not.  I'll see you next week. ",
