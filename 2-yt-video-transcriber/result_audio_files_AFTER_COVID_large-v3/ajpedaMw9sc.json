            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel.  I know it's been slightly over a week since I uploaded last.  I know, I try to never go that long without uploading, but lately my mental health has said bye bitch.  But it's rolling back in and I'm feeling better, so let's go.  Oh, and super briefly, you guys know that through the month of May, we've been doing no strings attached cash giveaways on my Instagram.  Every picture I've been posting on my Instagram through the month of May, I've been giving cash to people who comment and let me know that they've been affected by the current economic crisis.  Again, no strings attached.  Just letting you know, we're at the end of the month and we do have one more before the month ends and you can expect that in a couple days.  But moving on, I kind of can't believe that I've never done a video on this topic before as someone who's probably done a video on every single trans related topic under the sun on my channel.  But there is still a stone left to be turned over and that is trans species, aka other king, aka a deep dark internet hole that I kind of wish I hadn't fallen into.  The things I do for you guys.  So trans species, otherwise known as otherkin, it's people who identify legitimately, unironically, as animals.  It's often conflated with transgenderism, which is... Annoying.  And I've never touched on this topic really because I kind of always thought it was a joke or ironic in some way.  I thought it was similar to being a furry where, to my knowledge, you know, I don't know the inner workings of the furry universe, but to my knowledge, they don't legitimately think that they are animals.  They dress up as that for hobbies or for, you know, their kicks or whatever, which, you know, no judgment as long as you're not doing anything to hurt anyone.  Rock on, furries.  I don't get it.  But it's no shade.  Actually identifying as an animal, however, that is some other sh**.  A woman in Norway believes she belongs to a different breed.  She claims that she is a cat trapped in a human's body.  And it's kind of one of those things that people tend to use as ammunition against the concept of being transgender by saying, oh, you identify as a woman, I identify as an anteater.  Checkmate.  so today we're going to take a deeper look into trans species.  that sounded ridiculous.  first up is a trans girl trans deer who currently has the entire internet very angry at her and we'll get into exactly why this is some weird ass.  this is apparently a deergasm but that's how they put it.  What in the... Thank you.  I need Jesus. ",

I kind of feel like you know I don't want to like beat up on these people or like really really go in on them because I feel like this is probably some sort of just like I would imagine.  these people have some sort of like deeper issues and we all have issues right.  their issues are just different.  I just personally I don't like how all this stuff is called trans species, transracial, trans all this stuff because it really does muddy the waters of what transgender is and what transsexuals are.  You know, my only beef is when they say that it's comparable to being transgender or when people use this against transgender people because it's not even apples and oranges.  It's like... apples and a falafel or something.  You know, being a transsexual is something that I feel like entails a very real medical condition, which is gender dysphoria.  It's something that I feel like can be done to where you are existing harmoniously with those around you, because obviously I am biologically male and I am a transsexual, but in the general society in the world, I'm just some chick.  So it's a little different, I think, in the sense that, like, you can't just be a deer and just roll up on someone and start eating their grass.  You know what I mean?  And that was why I was a little freaked about the trans deer girl specifically getting so much attention because I felt like a lot of people on Twitter were trying to say, there goes trans people being crazy again.  It's always that, right?  But I do think the trans deer girl is crazy, but I don't think it's because she's trans.  I think it's because she thinks she's a deer.  Right? ",
