You think you are the only ones who respect human rights or others.  it's about violating human rights.  No.  We've fought for human rights and freedoms of our people much better and more than anyone, including you people who keep talking about this nonsense.  Where we have taken our country from and where it is now speaks for itself.  The rest of the story just comes from this complex.  These two worlds where there are people who know everything about human rights and all kinds of things, and another world where people are just people who don't know.  But these are our human rights.  When we respect the things we respect in our countries, It's not for you.  It's not for anybody.  It's for ourselves.  Is it not universal?  Yes, it is universal, but you don't sit there.  If it is universal and you believe it, then you don't become the judge yourself.  You don't start telling the others what to do, what they should not do, or that what they are doing is not to your satisfaction.  Who are you? ",
