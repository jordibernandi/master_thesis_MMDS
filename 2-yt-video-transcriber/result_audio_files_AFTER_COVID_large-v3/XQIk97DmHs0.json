            "text": "I want to thank you for joining me today on my YouTube channel.  This is going to be a very interesting and quite intriguing mini study that I want to share with you for the next few moments.  If you've never heard of this or if you've never researched this, it's probably one of the most interesting parts or interesting facts concerning American history and its presidents.  Now, the question I'm posing today is simply this.  Will the zero curse strike Joe Biden?  We assume at this point, unless there is a change, that Joe Biden will be the nominee and the president of the United States president.  in the next four years from beginning 2021, 22, 23, and 24.  And again, at least that's the way it looks at this point.  So that brings us to an intriguing comment about what is known as the zero curse.  To explain the zero curse, I'm going to have to do a little bit of background in some history.  Now, this is something that I have written about as far back as the year 2000 in a book that I wrote that is no longer in print.  But it's something that is tracked historically.  The Zeru curse allegedly began after those who signed the Declaration of Independence died.  Three that were presidents all died on July 4th, oddly enough.  Two of them died hours apart.  Now, this begins with William Harrison, who was the ninth president of the United States.  During Harrison's time, the Shoney Indians that lived along the Ohio River had a chief that they called the prophet.  His brother, Tecumseh, were leaders in land management.  that the government of the United States, the federal government of the United States, was attempting to take from the Indians.  Harrison was known as the Indian destroyer.  That was one of the nicknames that he'd been given.  So Harrison moved in, this was before he was president, with a thousand soldiers to kill the Indians.  The legend has it that the Indian prophet cursed Harrison and those that would follow after him who would lead this country in the future.  And I'm going to give you a quote that was in my book.  By the time Harrison had arrived on the scene, most of the Indians had been reduced to poverty.  Their hunting lands had already been carved up by the new farmers in their midst, and they were regularly victimized by traders.  Harrison added more than 50 million acres to public lands that were originally belonged to the Indians, of course.  and the Indians weren't paid, but the official government price to white settlers had been $2 an acre.  Now, after the Battle of Tippecanoe, and later in the 1830s, the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh sent a message to Harrison by a released prisoner.  Harrison will not win this year to be the great chief, but if he wins, he'll die in office.  And this was the quote.  Every 20 years, the leader of this country, speaking of the United States, will die in office to remember the death of my people, speaking of the death of the shedding of innocent blood of the Indian people and the Indian nation, especially there where we talked about the Shawnee tribe.  Here was the quote.  Every 20 winners, the days of the great chief they elect will be cut short, which meant every 20 years.  Now, oddly enough, this began to occur for seven different presidents that were elected on a zero year.  What I'm going to do is give you the year, the president that was elected and how they died in office.  Again, all elected on a year with a zero in it.  1840, William Harrison was elected.  On his inauguration, he caught cold and he died 30 days later, very short term.  In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected.  In 1860, he saw a dream in a mirror where he saw one body with two heads and the second head was very pale.  His wife predicted that he would not live out his second term, which happened.  He was shot in Ford's Theater there in the DC area and assassinated.  Then in 1880, James Garfield was elected again, a president elected on a zero year.  Three months later, he was shot at a railway station outside of Washington, D.C.  or in the D.C.  area.  Then in 1900 came William McKinley at the Pan American Expo in New York while shaking hands.  He was shot, but he later died of gangrene from the gunshot wound.  In 1820, William Harding was elected president.  And in 1923, at a speaking tour, he became violently ill and died.  Oddly enough, his wife refused an autopsy, which only added to the speculation of what actually caused his death.  In 1840, Roosevelt had been elected for a fourth term.  And the man who ran against him was named Wendell Wilkie.  who died in 1944 and Roosevelt also died being elected again the fourth term in 1940, elected on a zero year, meaning that either man that would have been elected that year would have died in office, elected on a zero year, whether it had been Wilkie or it would have been Roosevelt.  Now, the other individual that is more famous than probably any of these, because he's a contemporary of our time, is 1860.  When John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, I may have said 1860. there, in 1960, there was a man by the name of Gordon Lindsay of Christ for the Nations who was a great writer and a Christian man whose headquarters for his ministry was located in Dallas, Texas.  He wrote a book, Will John F. Kennedy Survive the Zero Curse?  And this was in 1960.  What was so bizarre is after releasing the book about the zero curse and the possible death of Kennedy, Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas, November 3rd.  I'm sorry, in November, I should say, of 1963.  Ronald Reagan followed in 1980, and there was an assassination attempt on Reagan's life in March of 1981.  And the bullet was actually, it went into his lungs, was about an inch from his heart.  Reagan survived because I knew at that time some individuals that were in the Secret Service.  Now, I did not know them at the time Reagan was in, but they later retired and moved to Cleveland, Tennessee.  One of them became head of my security for a long time.  But they said they knew about this, but it was not often discussed about this zero curse.  They also knew that Reagan being elected in 1980 would be subject to this if it was a valid thing.  But they did say that there were prayer meetings that were conducted.  And I do have a friend of mine that knew Reagan back in those days that said that Reagan was aware of this.  And there were prayer meetings conducted to break the power off of that curse.  And of course, Reagan did serve two terms for a total of eight years.  I began to write about this again in the year 2000 when George W. Bush was elected president of the United States in that very, very controversial election.  Now, the point is that there were seven presidents who died, all elected 20 years apart, either by sickness or assassination or different situations.  All the presidents who were killed, oddly enough, who died were from areas where Indians once lived, but were ran off of their lands.  And I don't have time to go into the states.  You can research that on your own.  Someone asked me years ago, why did I think that Reagan broke it off?  Well, one of the possibilities, and again, this is only a speculation or a possibility, is Numbers 26, 28 in the Torah, it mentions that a punishment would exist seven times or it would continue for seven times before it could be broken.  And there were seven individual presidents.  Now, John F. Kennedy's is very interesting because I talked to a missionary in 1980 where I was ministering in his church in Mississippi who had been a mission director for the country of Haiti when President John F. Kennedy was president of the United States.  Now, Kennedy, as some of you may know, put a blockade on Haiti during his administration.  The man who was then leading the country was a man named Papa Doc, who was actually very heavily involved in voodoo.  Papa Doc had survived six different assassination attempt.  He was heavy into voodoo worship, but he was also extremely superstitious.  According to a British News Network report, Papa Doc would not go out of his palace except on the 22nd day of the month.  NOW THIS MISSIONARY WHO SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH ME, THAT I HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN, SAID TO ME THAT PAPA DOC MADE THE STATEMENT THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A VOODOO DOLL OF JOHN F. KENNEDY, AND HE HAD PLACED THE NEEDLES IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD TO SEND SOMEONE TO ASSASSINATE HIM.  NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS ACCURATE, IT'S A PERSON FROM SOMEONE WHO LIVED IN HAITI AT THE TIME, AND THIS IS A GREAT MAN OF GOD, AND I KNOW HE WOULD TELL THE TRUTH, BUT IT WAS NOT A WELL-KNOWN STORY.  THAT WAS PUBLICIZED.  PAPA DOC WOULD ONLY COME OUT OF THE MONTH, OUT OF HIS PALACE ON THE 22ND OF EACH MONTH.  ONE DAY, JFK, JOHN F. KENNEDY, WAS KILLED THE 22ND OF NOVEMBER, ALLEGEDLY.  AGAIN AFTER PAPA DOC MADE A VOODOO DOG PLACING A CURSE ON HIM.  Now, I want to just mention something very briefly about the idea of curses.  A lot of people make fun of these things or think they're not valid or it's just some kind of overblown superstition.  There is in the occult world incantations and curses and also in the realm of voodoo.  However, if you are a spirit-filled, blood-bought Christian... that believes in the power of the blood of Jesus Christ.  The Bible says you overcome Satan by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony.  So therefore for believers who truly know who they are in Christ, there is no fear of this.  However, religion or being religious or being a religious person does not necessarily prevent someone from falling under these types of things that may have been established many, many years ago due to the curse of shedding innocent blood.  And we know, according to Matthew chapter 23, that there is curses that can come on cities such as Jerusalem in the ancient time.  And the reason Jesus gave was you shed the innocent blood of prophets and saints.  So it could be the shedding of this blood of the Indians has had seven generational cycles to go through or seven different leaders of this nation.  If that's true, then perhaps it's over.  However, if Joe Biden does become president and there again, we're assuming he does based on evidence, unless somehow it's overturned, which you know how that could go with the situation with the government, governors and governments and judges and so on.  But let's say he does become president.  President of the United States, then this beggars the question, with his age, with the physical situations that he is encountering, and of course other situations that may be out there, is it possible that he would fall to the zero curse?  Well, I will say this to you, that the 2020 election was definitely held on a zero year, and if this has not been broken in the past, it is something that could repeat itself in the very near future.  And I want to again say that just because you are a particular religion or a particular religious background or you claim to be quote unquote a religious person does not prevent you from experiencing these type of things.  Religion is an idea of how you believe in God or how you attempt to counter God.  We're talking about an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ.  A person must have a born again experience with the Lord Jesus Christ to break any kind of incantation or curse.  that would be, whether it's historic or whether it's something that has recently happened, it's insignificant.  There's power in the blood of Jesus Christ according to Revelation chapter 12.  And I'm very happy to report that to all of you today.  Of course, I primarily, I am a teacher, but I'm also primarily a minister of the gospel.  So therefore, it's always a great privilege when we can share with people the significance of serving the Lord and knowing that he is with us and that Christ has redeemed us as believers who believe in him from the curse of the law being made a curse for us.  So there is a way out of these things, but it's through faith in Jesus Christ and truly serving him, not just mouthing, I'm a Christian, not just saying I go to a church or I go to mass, whatever the case may be, but having a true relationship with him.  Will he fall under this curse?  Well, I guess the only way of knowing is time will tell.  We do know, however, that there are other predictions and one of those we will give probably around the middle or the end of January.  that goes back a long way that I have documented that I'm going to share if things go a certain direction.  So we're still in that timeframe of not knowing everything at the conclusion of the matter.  But we do know that the greatest hope that we have, again, is our walk with God, our relationship with Him and the Word of God, which never changes.  This book that is right here in front of me, the Bible.  Thank you for your time.  Subscribe to our channel.  We have a lot more things coming out.  We have another one coming out real soon that I think you're going to find extremely interesting.  God bless you. ",
