It is never wise to say, we did this, not God.  I understand that you may be countering an extreme faith idea, we'll just pray and God will take care of things and we are irresponsible.  You know, we'll spend all our money and God will take care of the debt, that kind of irresponsibility and spiritual fantasy.  I understand that's out there, but sir... It is never wise to dishonor God.  You have no idea if any of your best efforts would have done anything if not for people praying for mercy, if not for people crying out to God day and night behind the scenes, if not for God caring about human lives as well.  You literally have no idea how much your best efforts matter.  did save lives and how much the prayer of God's people saved lives or how much God's merciful intervention saved lives.  So why not say, thank God?  We are so grateful for where we are.  And we thank all of you who've prayed.  And I want to commend all of you for the efforts you've made because the efforts you've made, they have saved lives.  Why not say that?  Why not glorify God, thank everyone for praying, and say, along with prayer, it's your action that has made a great difference?  Why not say that?  Because it is true that people have made efforts, and certainly those efforts have made a difference.  Either just thank the people for their efforts and say it's working, and don't even mention the God part in that context, because you're just talking about practical steps, or Give thanks to God and appreciate people praying and then commend everyone for the efforts they're making and say, your actions are saving lives.  But to discredit God, to say God didn't do this, sir, number one, you don't know that.  Number two, it's always wise to honor him rather than dishonor him.  To the extent we glory in ourselves, to that extent we prove ourselves fools. ",
