            "text": "Hey everybody, James Madison here.  We're in Defuniac Springs.  This is just almost to, oh, where's this place at?  Almost to Alabama.  That's where I'm headed right now.  You can see, this is it.  City Marshall, they call it.  We're going to go check it out.  We were here last time seeing what's going on in this little tiny town here.  I don't think there's much, but we'll see.  If you travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea, return from a cruise or travel from any COVID-19 site.  That's funny.  That is hilarious.  So, it's like this guy's getting ready for shift, checking his car out, cleaning it out.  Maybe.  Maybe.  270, getting on shift.  I think this is about close.  He's cleaning his car up, making it look nice and good.  Weren't they in Chargers or Challengers, you guys?  I mean, they are.  Ah, they're the Chargers.  That's right.  That's exactly what they are.  What's up, man?  How's it going?  What's up?  You doing all right?  Yeah, you doing all right?  You mind taking your hand out of your pocket for me right there?  Do you have any weapons on you or anything like that?  I'm not a cop.  You're not a cop?  No.  Oh, okay.  Do you have anything in your pockets I need to know about?  You got anything in your pockets I need to know about?  Yeah, I do.  What you got?  I got everything.  What is it?  What's going on?  You know this guy?  I just don't know if he has a weapon in his pocket or anything like that.  You guys do that for officer safety, don't you?  I thought you said you don't work here.  I'll play it back and record it.  Are you going to go take my scooter?  Are you going to?  Yeah, what's your name?  What's your name?  I don't give my name.  You don't give your name?  What's your policy then?  I bet you 20 bucks.  you guys are clearly accredited.  You're not?  But you don't have policy that says when someone asks for your name as a public servant, you don't give it?  No.  No, it's actually House Bill 435, which classifies as a bicycle.  So get back in your car and read the statute book and learn something.  It's not motorized?  It's motorized for sure, but House Bill 435 classifies as a bicycle.  So learn you something.  So what's your name?  What's your name?  Hey, when you guys got a supervisor or sergeant on duty?  Is that you?  You?  Yes, sir.  Sergeant.  Oh, cool.  I was just coming down here doing a tour with Ding Dong here.  And what's his name?  Is it Ding Dong or do I do something?  Do I reference him to something else?  You can ask him.  I asked him.  He won't give it to me.  So you're a sergeant.  You know Paul's.  Go ahead.  You can do a records request.  I do a records request for some guy that has a hat on that originally told me that he doesn't work here.  I got it on camera here.  No, I'm not going to have a good day.  We're not done.  So KWVW30.  All right, Sergeant, so I just need a complaint form for you.  I'm going to file a complaint, a formal one with this gentleman right here.  I'm going to file a formal complaint with that guy right there.  I do not take complaints on other officers.  It would be the lieutenant, and you'll have to come in between 8 and 5.  Oh, that's what it is?  That's what it is.  Oh, cool.  All right.  You know what I was coming out here doing?  Talking about the Funniac Police Department, how last time I came here, they were really cool and helped me out.  But then you got that dick right there.  Why?  I can't say excuse for him.  So what's his name?  so I can probably complain later?  Ackison.  Ackison?  Ackison.  Ackison.  Okay.  Ackison.  You have a good day, okay?  All right, we're going to be down here for a little bit.  I was going to come down here and be a nice thing, but that smirk on your face and his too, you guys got something stupid on you about, I guess, apparently.  What you feel and what I feel is two different stories.  I know, that's right.  That's it.  Good day.  All right, we're going to hang out and have a good day.  So you don't have complaint forms here, like a regular written form that I can take with me?  Don't learn from this guy.  This guy is definitely a tyrant and an oath breaker.  This sergeant is.  But, sergeant, do you have a paper form I can take with me and fill out?  Not on me.  Not on you?  I don't have them.  You have to get them from the supervisor.  I'm not going to take complaints like that.  All right.  But you don't have complaint forms like you should have per your policies?  We have them, but we're not required to carry them back.  Yeah, I know.  There's a little thing up here.  He's got a little key on his badge on there, and you can grab him right there.  I don't have access to the lieutenant's office.  Oh, they're stuck in the lieutenant's office?  He's a patrol search bother.  Ah.  Ah.  So then what's your name, so I can add that complaint to it, Sergeant?  Well, have a good day.  What's your name, Sergeant?  Sergeant Mayhem.  Mayhem?  Yep.  Like crazy and nuts, like you don't know how to do your job, I guess?  Well, what you've got an opinion of.  I've got a fact right now.  Can't believe that.  I was down here literally going to talk about this place and how it was nice and quiet last time, and then you got that guy wanting to do what he does there.  I hope you don't do that and don't learn from them.  Hey, just a second.  Your secondary safety is not on your holster there.  Just let you know.  Yeah, I know.  But yeah, just to let you know that Smart, the investigator there, he probably should be back in the office there, but he was like, is this a motorized vehicle?  Wanted to throw that route.  It's actually a house build.  They've already made it into law.  Those are considered bicycles.  Well, I don't take sarcasm really from people that are supposed to act a little bit more professional than that.  Because if he's going to do it to me, what happens if he's going to do it to someone that doesn't have a backbone to stand up to him and talk to him like that?  He's going to take him to jail and write a creative report and put him in handcuffs.  I don't know what he would do to me if I'm not him.  I know.  Well, you saw it.  You saw a bad cop happening right there trying to intimidate me for coming out here just telling a story.  Yeah, I know.  I appreciate you.  What's your name so that the viewers can say thank you?  Paul, P-A-U-L?  So yeah, guys, if you're watching this here, and Officer Paul, he's understanding.  He's not saying anything.  We've got Sergeant Mayhem, which is causing mayhem here, a little smirk in his, you know, not wanting to identify someone.  So I guess we're going to do, I came down here literally to talk about the funny experience because the last time I was here, it was nice and quiet.  It was really cool.  Went inside, got a complaint for him.  But then we had that.  And then homie wants to come over here and ask that this is a motorized vehicle.  Don't brain wrestle with me.  I'm not in the mood for it right now.  Not at all.  Can I help you?  Yeah, I was going to see, do you just have a blank complaint form up here I can take with me?  What kind of complaint form?  A complaint against an officer.  Hang on just a minute.  Yes, ma'am.  Thank you.  Yo!  What's going on?  You want me to file a complaint?  I want to get a complaint form so I can take it with me.  Are they going to help you out?  I think so.  Good day, man.  What was that?  You just asked for that?  Yeah.  Make sure you take care of it.  All right.  Serve and protect.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Serve and kiss my ass.  Get out of here.  Love you.  This is what's known as a normal complaint form.  Yeah, let's stay calm.  All right?  All right, thanks.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's it.  This is it right here.  Just a regular statement form and stuff.  I got one, so that's all you got to do.  That's all I needed?  No, that's good.  And then the guy comes back and wants to knock on the window and says, make sure I want to serve and protect.  See, that's not the way to be.  Not the way to be at all.  Some of these guys just have a crude sense of humor and think it's funny to mess with people.  Yeah, it's not funny to mess with people.  It's not really the place and time to do that.  Officer Paul, I appreciate it.  Paul, right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  All right, Officer Paul, see you later.  Stay safe out there.  Yep.  So we got this guy over here.  He's got this dark tinted window in his car there.  That's the same officer that was going to follow me around now.  Guarantee it.  There he goes.  Wants to help serve and protect.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Wave again.  I didn't hear you.  He says, love me.  That's his arrogance right there.  Yeah, one more thing to do.  Hey, again, sorry.  Yeah, sorry about that.  I was going to see if that sergeant's available, if he's still here.  Hey, Sergeant Miami.  Yeah, real quick, I just went and reviewed the footage that I have on here, and when the investigator there was holding the camera and filming, he turned it, and I saw the recording going.  So I want to preserve that as an open records request, because I'm going to do that first thing.  Do a public records request in the morning.  Yeah, I'm going to do that in the morning, but I just want to make sure if he deletes it or anything like that, it is a criminal offense to delete it after I tell you about it, because I saw it and I have the evidence that's on there.  So I just want to get a copy of that video and then probably at your body camera.  if it comes down to it.  Yeah, no problem.  But on the phones, a lot of people don't realize that they are public records, even if it's a personal phone.  But once you make that record and record it while you're on duty like that, or even if you're off, if you're active within the scope of the department here, it becomes a public record.  Yeah, we're well aware.  That's why I don't use my phone for personal business.  You're smart then, Sarge.  All right, talk to you later.  All right, be good, man.  Well, just wanted to make sure that was known right there because that guy did, in fact, do a recording there.  And I turned the phone and saw the footage on it.  I'll be out of here now.  It's cold.
