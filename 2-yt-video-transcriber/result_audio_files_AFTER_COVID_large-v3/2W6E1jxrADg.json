            "text": "So I just left a so-called press conference in Clark County, Nevada.  And yeah, if you are wondering, that was me in the barbecue, beer, and freedom shirt.  Those are my three favorite things.  But I had to crash their little lamestream media party because they're not reporting what they should be reporting.  And that's the Joe Biden crime family is trying to steal this election.  They won't show you that.  That's why that video went viral is because they won't show you.  They're stealing this election.  Don't you find it odd that they're just finding ballots in places all over?  Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, up my ass, up your ass.  I found three ballots in a winter coat just last week.  This shit is rigged.  If Trump loses.  And there's three things I believe in.  Barbecue, beer, and freedom.  And you know that Q stands for QAnon.  But I'm full up on barbecue and beer.  And I'm still hungry for my freedoms.  And I'm just trying to get Joe Biden and all them laptops to stop stealing mine.  So this goes out to you, sleepy Joe Biden.  Stay off my freedom. ",
