            "text": "All right, everyone, there's a very, very humorous link in the description.  This is the sort of thing that has come to exemplify the Biden camp.  Now, normally you would think, well, that means like Joe Biden's gonna make a gaffe.  He's gonna make a mistake.  He's gonna say something that's off the wall.  He'll devolve into a 70s story or sometimes a story even older than that.  Or he'll say that someone's not black because they don't support him.  We've gotten used to that.  What people I don't think reckoned, at least people on the left that generally are going to support the ticket, they're going to support Kamala to some extent because it's Yas Queen Slade.  She's stunning and brave.  Another rich, long-term political figure, corrupt neoliberal, happens to be female and black.  So this is progressivism according to the smaller, smooth-brained minds of society.  I don't think that they quite understood what people like me were telling them about Kamala for months, which is that it would be particularly a bad idea to choose her as a running mate because she can't debate.  She can't deal with interviews.  She can't deal with off the cuff questions.  She has the same problem that Biden has, only she's not demented.  The fact that she doesn't have dementia makes her a grade higher than he is as far as her debating capabilities and so forth.  But that still puts her in as a C minus sort of political figure.  The fact that she shines next to Joe Biden, that's not exactly a hard act to follow.  Tulsi Gabbard, who has relatively little political experience and ultimately a small cult of personality style political following, completely decimated Kamala Harris at the debates.  Kamala Harris only became known at all, only rose above the other low tier candidates for a brief moment in time, less than a month by the way, in polling because she had one good debate performance right out of the gate where she was sort of the wild card.  She was the flash in the pan candidate.  She was sort of like the Herman Cain of the current election cycle.  Sort of like a Ben Carson figure or something like that.  That was her qualification.  Of course, Biden doesn't give a shit.  As long as she happens to be female, she was on the short list because Joe Biden made it clear early on boxing himself in.  I agree with Ramsey on this one that that would be the case.  Look, link in the description.  And you can clearly tell there's something desperately wrong with this particular individual.  There's something wrong with Kamala Harris.  Now she's talking to Stephen Colbert.  He is a liberal.  He is clearly going to vote for Biden.  He clearly supports that side of the aisle.  He's not gonna support Trump.  It'd be career killing if he did since 90% of his fans are millennial liberals anyway.  He supports generally left-leaning and neoliberal causes.  He's sort of like a Marr or something like that.  He's not even politically knowledgeable.  He's a scripted comedian.  Used to be entertaining back when the right wing in the 2000s was genuinely insufferable.  I had fun watching Colbert.  I had fun watching Marr.  And I had fun watching Jon Stewart and all of these others because they were right.  Because the Republicans back then, they were still the party of Bush.  Now, unfortunately, they've gotten older and they've sold out and they've become the insufferable ones.  The Republicans have changed.  They haven't.  Take a look at this.  Here's Kamala Harris, she's getting, this is a fluff piece interview.  This is a softball only interview by a fellow liberal who clearly wants her to win.  And even in he is raising his eyebrows at her response when he's saying, well, at the debates you were throwing haymakers at Joe Biden, you were saying, He was problematic and he wouldn't stand for the right values and all of these other things.  And she did.  You can go back and look at the fucking debates.  She insinuated the dude was racist.  She outright said that he was being sexist.  She said a year prior to that, before the debates even happened, before Biden even got in, that she believed his accusers, which, by the way, at the time, I don't even think included Tara Reid.  There have been plenty of them throughout time.  And yet she climbs aboard as potential VP, she climbs aboard as running mate, completely sells out.  And that's really what the name of the game is about.  She gets questioned on this and it's sort of like when Warren, this was equivalent, the way she responded.  if you watch this.  Again, take a look, it's almost surreal.  This was the equivalent of when Warren went on Charlemagne the God's program and he said, well, you're basically the original Rachel Dolezal and she couldn't answer.  Look at her response here.  It is so telling that she doesn't even answer his question, of course, because he's not a great interviewer.  He never follows through.  He insinuates, you know, were you lying?  And she basically flat out says, yeah, I was lying.  Oh, I was just debating.  Oh, it was a debate.  Don't press me further.  Otherwise, you'll get a strongly worded email from the DNC through your partners in the legacy media.  That's basically the name of the game.  You can tell.  This dude probably had a couple of gin and tonics after this fucking conversation.  shook his head sadly and resigned himself to the very real possibility he's gonna have to deal with another four years of Trump being president.  Because Kamala Harris, for all of her weaknesses, which should be apparent after watching this, is far better, more coherent and more politically feasible, I would argue in some ways, than Joe Biden is.  He's the candidate, it was funny.  Scott Adams.  the other day, he tweeted out and he's like Biden put out his first sort of campaign picture there with Kamala and she's in front of him.  She's larger than he is in the picture and the optics of that is something that he had to analyze.  Yes, it is very psychologically telling and it's basically a dog whistle by the campaign.  Hey, this is the person that will be in charge.  Don't worry, she's a strong, empowered black woman.  She don't need no man.  He's not gonna be doing anything.  He's almost 80 years old.  He's had multiple aneurysms and he clearly suffers from Alzheimer.  Just fucking vote for us.  You'll get your first black female president.  Huzzah, first female president and first female black president for the Democrats, which of course is what they want.  They will ignore that.  the first mainline party candidate for the presidency that got any traction, who was gay, was actually a Republican many years ago.  And the first black senator actually was a member of the Republican Party as well, Kamala Harris, of course.  There was quite a long period there where that was an uncommon thing now, wasn't it?  Kamala Harris thinks that she shattered some sort of black ceiling, but that never actually happened.  Especially when you look at her actual ethnic background and it's starting, I think, to rankle people because they're like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Kamala Harris is nuts.  This was a major blunder.  This is a gaffe on the same order.  I would class it, it would be similar to the Warren with Charlamagne the God interview.  It would also be similar to Hillary Clinton's deplorables comments.  Or maybe when she said, what difference at this point does it make in regards to Benghazi?  And sort of just goes off and doesn't wanna answer the question.  And the problem is that the optics, for an independent voter, the optics are this is a person who clearly is feeling challenged, feeling uncomfortable.  If she hadn't done anything wrong, why would she be feeling that way?  The number of psychological tells, the number of visual cues here, the fact that she was very upset over this particular line of questioning in an otherwise complete 99% fluff piece goddamn conversation with someone who probably has similar political beliefs to her, definitely is gonna be voting for Biden no matter how badly these people fuck up.  That's quite telling.  This was really, really funny.  This could go down in history as one of the main political blunders of the election cycle.  Biden choosing someone who is uniquely unqualified based on her inability to deal with the fact that she will be criticized and questioned is going to be a big problem.  The problem is like at the debates, when she's facing off against Pence, when Trump is against Biden, it's not gonna be softballs, it will be haymakers.  Only they'll all be directed at the Democrats.  Pence is going to crucify her harder than Tulsi Gabbard did.  It's gonna goddamn clobber her.  The problem is there is a very outsized role for the VP in this particular election on both sides.  Donald Trump is 73 years old.  He's no spring chicken.  He's a bit of a portly dude.  He's not very, he doesn't get a lot of physical exercise.  Okay, he golfs.  Okay, 99% of that is riding around in a fucking cart, dude.  Joe Biden is pushing 80.  He's had two aneurysms.  He's clearly demented.  And I don't give a fucking shit what anyone says about that supposedly being a conspiracy theory.  No, the dude's got Alzheimer's disease.  Fucking let it go.  You can still vote for him.  You can say, well, Orange Man is so bad, I'd rather have the demented guy.  Perfectly fine.  But admit to the obvious.  At least be objective.  Look at observable reality and reconcile yourself to the fact that it is observable reality.  That being said... Kamala Harris will be the President of the United States if Biden wins.  That is a guarantee or a near guarantee.  Okay, maybe they embalm him enough.  They put an animatronic skeleton underneath his meat, his meat sack so that it kind of looks like him.  They got a bad Botox job.  That's why his skin is hanging off of his muscle tissues.  Trump could end up leaving behind a President Pence.  We gotta be honest about that too.  Again, he's approaching his mid 70s, dude.  75 is the cutoff for officially elderly status.  That's like the 50-50 survival point.  And Trump has a Big Mac for breakfast every fucking day.  Now, while I think that it's much more likely that he manages to get through a second term than that Biden manages to get through maybe even the first two years of his first term.  And while I would never vote for someone crazy enough to think Kamala Harris would be qualified to run the country, it really works both ways.  Age is playing an outsized role.  Personality is playing an outsized role, I think too.  Trump at the end of the day, you can count on him to say crazy shit and that becomes funny.  Biden was like that.  He'd come out, he'd make gaffes.  The legacy media would have plenty of stuff to report on.  It'd sort of be like maybe if social media were around in 1987 when Reagan started beginning to lose his marbles or something like that.  It would have been funny now, wouldn't it?  A little bit saddened for Freud there at someone's expense.  But Biden hides, he doesn't even say anything.  He trots out Kamala.  The first major conversation she has with anybody in the wake of being chosen as the running mate, she goddamn completely fucking fumbles.  Fucking look at this video and try not to laugh.  This is one of those try not to laugh scenarios.  And I love the fact that this election is just so insane.  You've got one candidate who never even campaigns, isn't even sending out Sunday morning show circuits ahead of the convention.  You've got two repeatedly switched, largely digital-only conventions.  You've got it up in the air as to whether you're even going to have presidential debates.  You've got a pandemic and a recession.  Things couldn't get screwier right now.  I'm actually McLovin it.  I'm on Trump's side with regards to the McLovin it thing at this point because it's just so great.  And Kamala Harris, the only good thing about choosing her is that you can rely upon her to be an abysmal failure.  And he should have known this.  He could look back at the primaries.  He could look back at the debate performances.  He could look back at her record as prosecutor.  What's he trying to signal to the American voters by pulling her on board?  Anyway, he's alienated half of the Bernie bros.  Those that were already saying, well, I'm inclined not to support this man because he's definitely not a progressive.  He chooses Kamala and they say, fuck it.  I'm staying home.  I'm just gonna shit post on Reddit all day about how Biden has failed me.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
