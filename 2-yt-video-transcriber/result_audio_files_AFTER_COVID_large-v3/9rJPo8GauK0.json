The law says that you can't sue gun companies simply because a criminal used that company's gun or bullets to commit a crime.  Congress passed this law because anti-gun groups like the Brady campaign were constantly bringing frivolous lawsuits against gun companies that would eventually make fighting them so expensive they wouldn't be able to do business anymore.  In fact, having this law to protect the gun industry was so important, even the Department of Defense said that it strongly supported the law because it would help safeguard our national security by limiting unnecessary lawsuits against an industry that plays a critical role in meeting the procurement needs of our men and women in uniforms.  I want you to think about that for a second.  Even the Department of Defense was like, nah, y'all need to pass this law or there won't be any gun companies left to make the guns.  we need to protect this country.

Joe wants to regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act.  Recently, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden released details of his assault weapons ban, and it calls for AR-15s to be registered rather than confiscated.  Owners of these weapons would be given a choice to sell their guns to the government or to register them with the ATF.  So essentially, Joe, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.  Give up your guns voluntarily or we'll just force you to register them and then take them later.  Congratulations, Joe Biden.  You are now officially the booty warrior of the political world.

            "text": "Joe wants to require background checks for all gun sales, i.e.  universal background checks.  First comes universal background checks.  Then when it does nothing because criminals buy their guns illegally, they'll say, well, we need a registry to enforce it.  Then when the registry doesn't work because like we all know and have been studying and proven time and time again that criminals get their guns illegally, they'll say, well, That didn't work either.  so now we're just gonna have to turn in all your guns and we're gonna use the registry to get them because we know exactly where they are.  Congratulations.  And I know this will happen because it happened in Australia, the UK, and Nazi Germany, and a bunch of other countries.  Joe wants to close the Charleston loophole.  First of all, the Charleston loophole is not a loophole.  It was a very deliberate safety measure put in place to prevent the federal government from arbitrarily denying people their Second Amendment rights by simply not completing background checks in a timely manner.  Without it, the FBI could just sit on your background check as long as they wanted to.  Not to mention, the Charleston shooter didn't get a gun because of a loophole.  He got a gun because the people responsible for processing and running the background check system, i.e.  the government, dropped the ball.  Had nothing to do with the loophole.  Someone failed to put the right information in the right place, so when they went to look for it, it wasn't there.  That's not a loophole, it's called government incompetence.  Joe wants to incentivize state extreme risk laws,  i.e.,  red flag laws.  Now, as a new gun owner, I want you to imagine a few weeks or months or even years from now, you're sitting at home with your family, the very reason why you bought the gun in the first place, and the police knock on your door and tell you that they're there to take your guns because somebody you didn't know about had some secret meeting with the judge and told them that you're a danger to yourself or other people and should have your guns taken away.  But you're a little confused because you haven't committed a crime.  Now you're asking yourself, how can I do that?  I have a second amendment, I have a fourth amendment, and I have a 14th amendment.  right.  I haven't broken any laws.  How the hell can the cops just show up at my house and take away my rights without even charging me with a crime?  I'll tell you how, red flag laws.  Red flag laws or extreme risk protection orders, as some states call them, are state laws that allow law enforcement, family members, friends, romantic partners, coworkers, or close associates to ask courts to confiscate the guns of someone who a judge believes is a danger to himself or others based on a one-sided story of the people asking the judge.  Considering the most recent spate of mass shootings by people who we later learn were dealing with mental health issues, I can see how the masses might be seduced by the idea of red flag laws.  However, red flag laws are like a lot of people's Tinder profiles.  On paper, red flag laws look great, but in the real world, they're a flaming hot catfish with massive teeth and an appetite for devouring civil liberty.  Anti-gun politicians and anti-gun special interest groups like the Brady Campaign, Moms Demand Action, and Everytown, two of which were started and funded by a billionaire anti-gun politician, Want you to believe that red flag laws always work like this.  However, they don't talk about the reality of red flag laws.  Red flag laws are literally laws based on a movie where they had gifted beings with supernatural powers making the decisions about someone's future crimes.  And even they couldn't get it right. ",

            "text": "Red flag laws take inherently flawed human judges and expect them to become these quasi-fortune tellers based on a one-sided story.  Joe wants to give states incentives to set up gun licensing programs.  Your licensing requirement is not meant to save lives.  It's meant to be an unnecessary obstacle to those exercising their fundamental right, i.e.  making gun ownership so hard and expensive most people won't be able to do it, thus creating an elite class of people who can own guns while the criminals continue to get their guns on the black market like they always have.  and completely bypass any punitive gun licensing requirements that you may dream up.  Don't believe me?  New Jersey has the same licensing scheme and New Jersey has made it even harder and made it more expensive over the years just to acquire this license.  Joe wants to put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns.  Joe, I promise you right now, no one on your Secret Service team would want to use a smart gun to protect you.  You wouldn't want them to use a smart gun to protect you.  Hell, I doubt the inventor of the smart gun would want to use a smart gun to protect himself.  You couldn't pay me to use a smart gun for my protection.  And you wanna know why?  Because it's stupid.  This Glock 19 is one of the most reliable handguns on the planet.  And even this gun has felled on me more times than I can count for various reasons.  Sometimes it's a magazine issue, which come to think of.  it was probably because you banned the number of clips in a gun.  Sometimes it's an extractor.  It could be the way I'm holding my gun.  It could be because it's dirty.  It could be because of the ammo.  Any moron knows that adding something as complex as a biometric reader to make a gun function is just another malfunction waiting to happen.  And we haven't even perfected the mechanical reasons why guns malfunction in the first place.  And now you want to go all iRobot on us and force us to use smart guns.

It would be nothing for a criminal to hack a gun and make it work for them.  Matter of fact, it would create a whole new black market for it.  Not to mention, who do you think would be affected the most by this smart gun requirement?  Yup, you guessed it.  Low income people.  Guns are expensive as hell as it is.  You think smart guns are gonna be cheaper?  The current smart gun on the market is $1,700.  With $1,700, I could damn near buy three of these things, and this is considered one of the best guns in the industry.  Joe Creepy Biden, you have absolutely lost your mind.  Joe wants to require gun owners to safely store their weapons.  Biden will pass legislation requiring firearm owners to store weapons safely in their homes,  i.e.,  you go to jail if you don't lock your guns up.  Now, on average, over 3,000 people die from accidental drownings, mainly kids, every single year.  And less than 500 people die from accidental shootings.  And that's including the accidents that storage laws would not have prevented.  So I have to ask, when was the last time someone was thrown in jail for six months because a child died in a home swimming pool accident?  Exactly.  Firearm safety and responsibility is paramount to me.  And look, I understand wanting to incentivize people to be responsible gun owners, but locking me up for not locking my gun up when I'm at home is not how you do it.  No one accidentally shoots themselves on purpose.  It's a lack of firearm education, not storage laws, that cause a lot of these accidents.  And if I'm going to be honest, there is no epidemic of accidental gun deaths that warrant throwing people in jail for not locking up their guns in their homes.  Personally, I don't like being legally mandated to lock up my guns.  The whole point of me having a firearm as a firearm owner is to be able to have a gun at the ready whenever I need it.  Things don't go down in real life like they do in the movies.  In the movies, the criminal will send a note that he's coming, show up, ring the doorbell before he kicks in the door, and then start monologuing about how he's coming to kill you as he slowly walks up your staircase.  In real life, you have seconds to get to your gun in a home invasion situation, not to mention you're usually caught by surprise.  All of the odds are already stacked against law-abiding gun owners.  And that's my problem with gun storage laws.  They only account for the possibility of accidental shootings, but don't account for the reality of a defensive shooting, which is more likely to happen than an accidental shooting.  And there you have it.  Joe's gun control plan.  for all the people who swear this man is not anti-gun, even though he has one of the worst gun control plans I've ever seen.  The ones in this video are just the main ones.  This video would have been an hour long if I included the other ones.  So if you're planning to vote for Joe Biden because you think he won't affect your gun rights, you might want to think again.  And for those people saying, why aren't you talking about the other candidates' gun control plans?  Well, I would, but they don't have any.  Joe Jurgensen is vehemently pro-gun and notwithstanding this.  This morning ",
