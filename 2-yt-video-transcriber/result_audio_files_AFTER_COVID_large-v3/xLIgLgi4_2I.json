            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  Now river in Sudan, highest level since records began.  Interesting how Africa's largest dam was just completed this year.  Possibly strongest medicaine to ever make landfall in the Mediterranean.  Largest amount of smoke and carbon dioxide released from fires ever recorded in the United States.  All at the same time, we're transitioning to planetary monitoring for everything.  Atmosphere, land, water, biodiversity.  You're going to have to start thinking about open market trade because putting this on the blockchain and this straight from the fishermen, this will be a back way to your food source without being tracked.  And yet another data breach, consumer credit reporting agency Experian, revealing that the information of 24 million individuals and 800,000 businesses in South Africa, exposing them to phishing attempts.

More strange events purveying our planet.  The River Nile and Sudan, the highest levels since records began.  You'll notice in the image the blue and the white Nile meet to form the main Nile River.  Now official records began more than 100 years ago measuring the water height and these floods right now surpassed that all-time high.  But if we jump back into the 1600s with writings from Arab traders, this area also turned into what they termed an inland sea.  So in the mid 1600s, modern minimum era, floods were at least this large and apparently larger than what we're seeing here.  But nonetheless, this is a massive event going on.  A climate tracker has put the 1988, 1946, and now the purple, the 2020 floods.  It gives you a good indication.  These are the three largest floods recorded in the last 100 years in exactly the same area we looked at, where that island between the Blue and White Nile, at max water height it's still half a meter or a foot and a half higher than everything else recorded.  bit of visual imagery here comparing above and below what it normally looks like in a non-flood stage compared to what's being experienced right now vast changes and i did a full video about the largest dam in africa now charging with water the runoff from the ethiopian highlands in africa's largest hydroelectric dam now filling to record levels so quickly.  how did they know to put the dam here at this exact time right when the changes are starting.  Because before, this was in a drought area.  Who would have ever thought to put the largest dam in Africa into the middle of a drought zone and expect that thing to ever stay full?  Unless you knew the cycles.  And when I say the cycles, I am talking about grand solar minimum, cloud cell, jet stream shifts on 400-year, 2,000-year, or 3,600-year cycles.  If you knew this pattern, you would know when the rains would return and where they would return across Africa.  And I am so firmly in belief that this is the prize for superpowers across the planet.  This 13 million plus square kilometers of new grow zone coming on.  It's going to need electricity.  Magically, the largest dam in Africa goes into fill mode and electrical production this year.  along with the significant rains all the way across the Sahel.  Record floods from Nigeria all the way over to what we're seeing in the Sudan.  It's a cycle.  Chinese were there originally.  Now so many others are jumping in to try to take advantage of this.  The new grow zone emerges.  While northern latitude superpowers have their crop yields decreased year upon year, Central Africa is going to continue to increase, doubling, tripling, quadrupling their output year after year.  and more indications of cloud cells and jet streams shifting, more vortices in the atmosphere.  Medicaid and Llanos will be determined if it's the strongest Medicaid ever to make landfall in the Mediterranean.  after tomorrow's wind speeds are fully calculated.  They're gonna get some shear off the mountains as this thing lands right over Greece.  And look at the eye formation on that.  Category one borderline, category two hurricane wind force landing over the Mediterranean.  And since this event has been ongoing for the last couple of days, it's making landfall.  It should take another 48 hours or so to finally clock some of these wind speeds.  And weather forecasters were already pinging that it would be the highest wind velocity ever on the coastal areas of Greece as a Medicaid-made landfall.  And to bring you to the trifecta of strongest, biggest, most ever wildfires in the  U.S.,  you know, I've already done a video on this and it's been quite prevalent across the U.S.  newsfeeds.  It is the most smoke and the most carbon dioxide ever released from fires.  The smoke itself is having an albedo effect where there's already cooler temperatures happening where you're getting into the really dark yellow there.  We're looking for snowfalls and drops in temperature over the next seven days of these areas that continue to have persistent smoke coverage, blocking out sunlight, lowering ground temperatures.  And staying in the US, this bankruptcy of Briggs and Stratton, see if we're gonna bring manufacturing back to the United States to restart our economy, and if we're gonna start thinking about moving into a new economy based on what we can do in the United States or in any individual country, you're gonna have to have motors.  And here we are, the world's largest manufacturer of small gasoline engines in Wisconsin.  Chapter 11, bankruptcy.  So, you know, this should be essential business that should have had such large bailouts that it should have existed in perpetuity.  This is the kind of industry that we needed.  We need small engines for individuals to plant their victory gardens.  We're gonna need small engines for people to process some of their own foods that they're able to grow in a neighborhood setting.  Dry it, chip it, powderize it, whatever it is.  And small gasoline engine, driver of the economy, out of business.  So you are gonna have to grow some of your own food and think about having a small engine powered device to help you grow food more efficiently.  This is just another brick in the wall against you being self-sufficient.  and when you think it couldn't get any stranger in the landscape of the world we live in today.  planetary monitoring yeah get used to those words.  nudging consumer behavior citizen awareness and action through programming of social media the digital ecosystem for the planet.  it's all about the atmosphere the land the water the biodiversity in the oceans all digitized And you're going to be monitored on how much you partake in any of those things that are natural from our Mother Earth.  This is all put forth by the United Nations, of course, our friends.  They're pushing the frontier technologies for a digital ecosystem for the planet.  This is the blueprint for everyone moving forward.  You see the weather and the climate completely falling out on these 400-year cycle now.  Low solar activity, solar cycle 25 not even really kicking in.  Now they're admitting it's going to be extreme low solar activity, grand solar minimum inbound.  So with the food insecurity and skyrocketing food prices, everything's going to need to be monitored and distributed down to the calorie.  This can only be done through a digitized world, a digital ecosystem.  Everything from cloud computing, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain and distributed databases.  But that would include Ripple and RippleNet with instant settlements between sovereign nation to sovereign nation and all the international banks to get instant liquidity, as well as you and I using blockchain for payments like Digibyte.  It's all going to be coordinated through satellites, drones, and sensors because they care so deeply about our well-being.  So think about how you're going to be able to trade or have to trade outside that particular monitored ecosystem directly from the producer.  And I would ask after a currency reset, with a quarter ounce of silver, how many fish do you think you'll be able to buy?  Because we're going to go back to that.  We're going to be trading sound money for sound food.  Protein for metal is where we're going to go.  Or you're going to have to trade some sort of skill or barterable item for it.  Because I personally don't know how many fishermen are going to be rocking down to the docks with their cryptocurrency apps asking for you to pay for either chicken, duck, goose, fish, clams, And it's all going to be in the wholesale arena where you're going to have to pick your own like this.  Most of you watching that are in the United States would not want to shop like this.  This is just standard across Asia.  It's soon going to be standard across where we live everywhere as well.  It's going to come in bulk form.  is going to come directly from the producer and these different types of seaweed that we see here are usually picked by locals who have their own seaweed farms off the coast and they're not going to be running around with a smartphone with a blockchain app on it so you could pay them with a digital currency.  they're going to want sound cash sound money and i'm wondering if you're ready for that kind of world because if you're not you're going to be stuck in the blockchain and you'll only be able to spend your money where it's deemed permissible.  So two different economies are going to rise out of this transition.  I hope you're ready for both of them.  And growing your own food is going to be one of the most essential things moving forward.  so you have that value to trade for others.  Food, food, food.  And if I say it again, food is going to be the most important resource.  That's why I'm working on my farm, getting it ready at lightning speed.  Homestead 2030.  You can join me over there on Patreon forward slash adapt 2030.  I do appreciate you watching.  Hope you got something out of the video and I'll see you next time. ",
