Well, normally, I would just do videos I want to do.  But since Pokimane came out and completely roasted me, I've been cancelled, boys.  Cancelled, I tell you!  Well, Stu, pack it up.  It's over.  Alright.  So, Pokimane cancelled me.  Unexpectedly, really.  I don't know what lured her to me.  It must have been this avatar.  Oh wait, that's right.  She said my avatar is sh-.  I am shocked!  Shocked!  Well, not that shocked.  Well, that sucks, pokes.  That was a low blow!  Do you know how hard it is to make this thing work?  Literally, the program's in Chinese.  The fact that I've learned to navigate this at all is amazing.  Well, she allows ya!  I hope that isn't considered racist.  I took Chinese at school.  God, screaming in Chinese really wipes out my voice.  Great.  Now I'm Joan Rivers.  Pokey cancelled me.  In a fantastic fashion.  Well, ironically, it all backfired.  Dude, everyone came down on her like it was the Avengers Endgame.  And in all honesty, I thought it was the end for me.  I was like, oh great, I pissed off an attractive woman in 2020.  That spells trouble.  I'm a cisgendered male.  Wait a minute.  Hmm.  Maybe I can make things worse for Pokimane.  There's only one way to go.  Oh my god, like, Poki was picking on me and I was so scared, you guys.  I was so scared.  Poki's real mean.  She's a big meanie.  I hate meanies.  They make me sick inside.  I like hugs and kisses.  I like friends and good times.  When Poki was yelling about my channel, I was so scared.  I was like, oh, no, Poki, please.  Oh, shit, my face.  Oh, my God, guys.  I'm stunning.  I'm so cute like this.  You can just look at me, wink.  It's easy to love me now, right?  See, I'm waifu.  Wife, don't be mad at me, pokey.  Don't be mad.  Dude, like, for real, Stu?  We're gonna have to start streaming with this shit, bro.  We're gonna get paid, bro.  Feel it, dude.  Feel the money.  Feel the good vibrations.  Positivity.  Wow.  I'm telling you, being an attractive woman is... Yeah, I'm feeling it.  I feel good inside it.  I feel like this is right.  Stu, turn this shit before, like, I start making weird life-altering changes.  Oh my, oh my god, Stu, I'm not joking.  Where the fuck's my real body?  I gotta admit, dude, I think I understand why Pokimane went to that, like, went to a tirade, dude.  You start living like an attractive woman, even if it's virtually for like three seconds, you start feeling your oats, honey.  Are you in a Whitesnake video?  What are you doing over there?  I'm feeling my oats, let me feel my oats.  I was about ready to start singing and dancing.  I'm every woman.  It's all in me.  A pokey man got mad at me and decided to cancel me in the absolute worst way.  I mean, frankly, okay, fine.  So I got some things wrong.  Big whoop, it happens, man.  I mean, it's Twitter.  And retarded stuff happens on Twitter all the time.  And when I find screen caps or they're sent to me, I take them at face value.  I mean, look at this here.  This is a tweet from a man who is... transitioning and saying that he doesn't have sex like a man, though he has a penis, right?  But if you don't go out with him and you're a woman, you're homophobic and transphobic.  It's like a whole hot mess.  You got to understand.  Sometimes, baby, you see some wild ass tweets and you think they're real because more often than not, they are.  You know what?  Let's watch Poki's love letters to me.  I think Poki has a crush on me. ",

Wow, this guy's a tyrant.  He's got to go.  My God, if literally your thought process is someone said something I didn't like, I'm going to report him.  You're a douchebag.  You are.  You know, that's douche tactics.  Even when Amaranth, false copyright claimed, one of my videos that got all the revenue from it, I didn't sit there and go, report her and her career.  I didn't give a rat's ass.  It's like, you know what?  This is such small, petty shit.  If you can't laugh at anything, then what can you do?  Send your simps to attack a YouTube channel.  And then completely wreck yourself.  Pokimane set out to cancel me, and she canceled herself.  That's the beautiful part of all of this.  I had to do absolutely nothing to Pokimane.  She loaded the gun, handed it to me, but then dropped it and shot herself in the fucking foot.  And it's glorious.  It's absolutely glorious.  Dude, I'm harder than the job economy right now.  and then ragging on my poor avatar.  How dare you, Poki?  You know what the best part is?  The fact that Keemstar just exposed Poki on Twitter.  For having a boyfriend.  This shit's blowing up like the Godfather.  Dude, I finally understand Avengers Endgame.  You know that scene where like Captain America, right?  And Thor and Iron Man, they're getting the shit kicked out of them by Thanos.  And then, you know, Captain America's like walking back to fight all this stuff.  Thinking he's got to do it alone.  That's what I was feeling like the day Pokey came for me.  And all of a sudden, the commentary community came to my fucking rescue.  Dude, everybody came out.  Everyone.  Pokey got wrecked and I had to do nothing.  That's it makes it great.  It's kind of like a guy sitting out to fight you and he slips and falls and knocks himself out on a dumpster.  Oh Man and for a minute I kind of felt bad for pokey.  But then I rewatched this and remembered she sent people to try and cancel me on so many levels including with my sponsor.  and And the sad thing is, I didn't walk away from this unscathed.  I had a sponsorship kind of lined up with like a big video game company.  Let's just say they're big enough that E3, they had their own press conference and special presentations.  Yeah, that kind of went.  So I hope you're happy, folks.  But in the long run, I come out looking like the good guy.  And all I did was have a little fun.  Thanks, Pokimane, for being a Karen.  That was great.  I mean, a multi-millionaire sets out to ruin someone who's broke.  Wow.  And you thought it would work out for you, didn't you?  Hell, I actually did too.  These turns of events have been fan-fucking-tastic.  This is like the sort of stuff you see in a movie.  Shit, I'm gonna watch Endgame again because of Pokimane.  Came in here like Thanos.  She was like, I'm inevitable.  I'm Pokimane.  And I was like, and I'm a dude who shitposts.  Hemorrhoids used to control my life, but thanks to Anasol, I've turned my hemorrhoids into hope.  Now my asshole doesn't look a day over five.  Ask your doctor if Anasol is right for you.  Side effects may include dizziness, larger hemorrhoids, and obscene blood farting.  Stu, you're telling me that all of this drama started because Pokimane was watching videos of herself?  What?!  Doesn't DSP do that?  The retrospective stream?  Except DSP has the decency to do it once every few months?  Like, Pokimane does it regularly?  She just sits and watches videos about... What would she watch?  Literally, if you watch, like, compilations of Pokimane, it's literally like... Dude, for real, Stu.  I don't care if the video's long.  I don't care.  Pull it up.  I need to see this.  She watches compilations of her... My God.  Even ProJared didn't feel his oats that hard.  And he was sending dick pics all over the place, too.  See, the Pokimane Feet Wick Picky.  Pokimane Feet Wicka Picky.  Pokimane Wikipedia for her feet.  Okay, you know, let's... Stu, can we get in trouble for showing Pokimane's feet?  I don't know if that... That is a fetish though, Stu.  That's definitely a fetish.  I'm telling you it's a fetish, bro.  I'm on Pornhub regularly.  I know what the hell I'm talking about when it comes to this stuff.  Pokimane is thicker than a Wendy's milkshake.  Boy, are you thirsty.  Okay, alright.  Okay, yeah.  You don't even have to type Pokimane fully before it goes like, Poki is thick.  Now, I'm looking at this, dude.  I don't care.  I don't give a rat's ass anymore.  The Pokimane Thick compilation.  Wow.  Pokimane Thick No Nut Challenge.  Mmm, that's content right there.  That's the stuff I need.  Pokimane Thick Destroy Dick December Challenge.  What?  What?  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.  Holy shit.  Destroy Dick December.  See, Pokimane is mad at me because I was laughing at stuff like this.  I'm the bad guy.  I didn't make Poki Thick Destroy Dick December Challenge, Poki.  Pokimane Thick AF Moments 2020.  Thank God.  You know, the coronavirus may have stopped a lot of things in the world, but it did not stop.  Pokimane thick compilations.  You got to admire that dedication.  Oh, boy.  What else have we got here?  Pokimane twerks on stream.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yummy, yummy.  Mmm.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, give it to daddy.  Pokimane angry after being called thick on stream.  That doesn't sound like fun.  Poki absolutely thick Pokimane compilation.  Really?  Need to put her name in there twice to make sure you don't make a mistake, huh?  Pokimane thick no nut challenge part three.  Okay, so let's be real here.  The damn title say no nut challenge.  That basically means somebody wanking off to this.  Somebody's beating their meat.  Some dude is somewhere watching this.  Oh, oh, and he's beating his dick like a Hong Kong protester.  Okay.  Look at those beautiful toes.  Look at those lovely feet.  It's a Pokimane treat.  Look at those lovely feet.  Give me another, Stu.  I don't want to see men's feet.  I'm not gay. ",
