I hate to admit it to you guys, but I don't know how much longer we can make fun of David Rubin for.  I think there was a time when he was actually a pipeline to a lot of bullshit.  There was a time when you can't... Sometimes you can't put the lightning back in a bottle.  There was just a time where he was sort of on the scene, and he also just was just such an irresistible comedic target, as well as somebody that I think needed to be dealt with.  Now, of course, he's still got a big following, whatever, but in the main, increasingly... I think considered something of a joke. ",
