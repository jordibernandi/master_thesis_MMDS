            "text": "Hi, I'm Eduardo Naret with Campus Reform.  With President Trump's recent executive orders aimed at helping struggling Americans during the coronavirus, we're here today to talk to young Americans to see what they think about that.  Do they think President Trump is helping Americans economically?  Let's find out.  All right, so Joe Biden came out with a proposal over the weekend to help people during the coronavirus.  One, deferring payments on student loans.  So if you have student loans, you don't have to be making those payments right now.  And then he also proposed a payroll tax cut so people would get a little bit more money in their paychecks.  So what do you guys think about that?  Does that sound like a good idea to you?  What do you think about those proposals? ",

            "text": "I think it sounds like a good idea.  I think those are great ideas because people are really struggling.  I think it's a good idea to help people during this time because obviously we're in a pandemic so like there's not much that certain people can do so.  I think it's an amazing idea.  let's just hope he actually goes through with it like it's not actually a campaign proposal.  But I think student loans like if I had student loans and I was not having to pay them.  that would help me a lot.  So we're nursing students so we have a lot of loans.  the interest part of it it does help it truly does help and we have gotten care fund act which i don't know if you guys know about it it's a care fund act and we have gotten money from it.  um did you say joe biden or donald trump biden?  okay i think the student loans yes it's a good thing.

Actually, when I read about it, I was surprised because it doesn't, I mean, he does seem to want to be helping the economy with those two measures.  I mean, I'm not really all about President Trump, but the part of funding schools to giving us money while in this crisis and this whole pandemic, it did help.  Yeah, it's shocking.  In a way, because like, I also don't like him.  So it's shocking that he did that.  And I think it does change kind of my view on what he's done throughout the pandemic.  And yeah. ",

I'm not fully for Trump, but... The CARE Fund Act has helped for sure.  What he did recently was good for us.  I mean, we're struggling.  Like we said, we're struggling students and a lot of people.  It's not just us.  That says a lot, honestly.  That says a lot to students.  Yeah, I think he's trying to help them, like those people who struggle economically, especially now with like what he passed yesterday.  The things that has happened with, I mean, I'm pretty sure the whole nation, it has helped like the money wise, the unemployment wise, like not a lot of countries do that at the end of the day.  And people need to notice also that not a lot of countries will give you money when you're not working in a crisis like that.  So in that sense, he has somewhat, I guess, helped money wise.  I do think he's trying to help people economically. ",
