            "text": "A Democrat Los Angeles city councilman was arrested by the FBI this week.  This photo provided by the U.S.  Attorney's Office shows roughly $129,000 in cash that was found stuffed inside red envelopes with Chinese letters on them.  This was some of the evidence that was first found back in 2018 when the FBI raided the residence of L.A.  City Councilman Jose Huizar.  A new article from the LA Times says that this week's arrest of Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar marks the biggest domino to fall in a multi-year federal investigation of corruption and alleged pay-to-play practices at City Hall.  According to the 172-page indictment released this week, authorities say they found cash inside Huizar's suit jacket pocket and cash concealed in large envelopes and wrapped in a t-shirt, along with the cash that was found in red envelopes with Chinese characters.  Another article on this adds how earlier in the investigation, they received a tip that Huizar was seen cashing out casino chips that were ultimately traced back to a Chinese developer.  The court filings offer the example of an unnamed company that schemed with Huizar to secure benefits connected to an arts district project.  The executive highlighted the quote, \"...truly amazing accomplishment of minimizing affordable units in a building in a wealthy, opinionated, hipster  community.\".  The executive made several donations to a political action committee linked to Huizar.  Department of Justice and FBI officials stressed that their investigation into corruption at LA City Hall will not end with the arrest of Huizar.  Prosecutors have already alleged that Councilman Huizar took cash, casino chips, and other bribes from developers with business in his district, but the newest filing says that one businessman also provided Huizar with hotel stays that allowed the councilman to conduct, quote, \"...discrete encounters with a woman with whom he was having an  affair.\".  The same businessman also paid for Huizar to receive, quote, massage services on a number of occasions, which ran $300 per visit, prosecutors said in their filing.  Moreover, one real estate developer provided Huizar with opposition research on two of his former staffers who were suing him for harassment.  This is the same developer who was seeking to build a 35 story project in LA's art district who later boasted in an email that the city had required minimal affordable housing compared to other local projects.  LA Times article also adds how investigators allege that Huizar hid money that he received as part of the pay-to-play scheme by funneling cash through his family members to deposit into their accounts, which they then used to pay his credit card bills and other expenses.  Two of his relatives had initially denied that Huizar gave them cash before admitting to it earlier this year.  Meanwhile, another recent update on the case adds that the troubles besetting City Councilman Jose Huizar now also seem to involve his wife.  The LA Times reported that Rochelle Huizar may be called to testify in a case against her husband.  Councilman Huizar was arrested on Tuesday, suspected of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from a developer company.  in exchange for a support of a downtown high-rise project.  Though Rochelle Huizar has not been identified as a member of a criminal enterprise, she has been under scrutiny by investigators who have been documenting her activities, including her bank deposits and her attendance, at a meeting to discuss a consulting agreement.  the prosecutors have called an indirect bribe.  More info here, they explain that more than 18 months after federal authorities raided his office, longtime LA City Councilman Huizar became the fifth and most high-profile person to be arrested in an ongoing corruption investigation.  U.S.  Attorney Nick Hanna said that one real estate developer gave Huizar half a million dollars in cash in paper bags to help resolve a labor dispute.  The political fundraiser who served as the middleman and helped facilitate that money transfer reached a plea deal with prosecutors earlier this year.  Furthermore, Huizar was provided more than a dozen trips to casinos in the U.S.  and abroad in which he was given a quarter million dollars in gambling chips.  In addition, a Chinese real estate developer put up $600,000 in collateral so that Huizar could get a bank loan to pay off a woman who had accused him of harassment, the complaint alleges.  When Huizar stopped making payments on the loan, the collateral was used to pay off the remainder of the loan.  Huizar also planned to have his wife run for his seat in order to be able to continue the pattern of corruption, Hanna disclosed.  During a series of a dozen casino trips to Los Angeles, Huizar accepted rides on private jets and stays at luxurious casino villas, one of which cost over $38,000 per night, according to the DOJ.  Tuesday's press release from the Department of Justice includes another quote from United States Attorney Nick Hanna, who explained that this case pulled back the curtain on rampant corruption at City Hall.  Councilman Huizar said, violated the public trust to a staggering degree, allegedly soliciting and accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from multiple sources.  over many years, using the power of his office to approve or stall large building projects, Huizar worked through a web of other corrupt city officials, lobbyists, consultants, and developers to line his pockets and maintain his hold on Council District 14, which he turned into a money-making criminal enterprise that shaped the development landscape in Los Angeles.  Paul Delacorte, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said, quote, Mr.  Huizar was busy enjoying the fruits of his alleged corruption while his criminal enterprise sold the city to the highest bidder behind the backs of taxpayers.  DOJ continues explaining that Huizar has represented Council District 14, which includes downtown Los Angeles and its surrounding communities, since 2005.  In addition to representing an area that has experienced a commercial real estate boom in recent years, Huizar for several years was chair of the city's influential Planning and Land Use Management Committee.  a position he lost after the FBI executed search warrants at his city offices and personal residence in November of 2018.  The federal investigation has revealed that Huizar operated a pay-to-play scheme in the city utilizing and commodifying the powerful council seat of Council District 14 whereby he solicited and accepted financial benefits from international, primarily Chinese, and domestic developers with projects in the city in exchange for favorable official actions.  The 116-page affidavit alleges that Huizar operated the Council District 14 enterprise along with co-conspirator members, including Individual 1, a former general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, and former deputy mayor George Esparza, Huizar's former special assistant, and real estate development consultant George Cheng, Members and associates of the criminal enterprise referred to Huizar as their boss, operated as a criminal organization, and worked together for common purposes, the complaint alleges.  The Council District 14 enterprise allegedly had several objectives, including, one, enriching its members and associates through means that included bribery, extortion, and honest services fraud, two, advancing its political goals, and maintaining its control and authority, three, concealing the enterprise's financial activities, and four, protecting the enterprise by concealing its activities and shielding the enterprise from detection by law enforcement, the city, and the public.  In recent weeks, both Esparza and Cheng agreed to plead guilty to the same RICO charge that Huizar now faces.  The Council District 14 enterprise was created in early 2013 by Huizar and Individual One at a time when each of them faced significant threats to their political and professional careers, according to the affidavit.  Individual One, who maintained close relationships with Chinese developers, introduced Huizar to Chairman Yi, a Chinese billionaire who runs a multinational development firm and who owns a hotel in Huizar's district.  ultimately chairman e provided over eight hundred thousand dollars in benefits to huizar so that huizar would assist chairman e's ambitious plans to redevelop his property in council district fourteen and build the tallest building west of the mississippi river.  according to the affidavit In a second scheme, developer C agreed to pay a half a million dollar cash bribe to secure Huizar's help in resolving a labor organization's appeal of a major real estate development, which, when resolved, would save the developer millions of dollars.  After a middleman, Justin Jangwoo Kim, collected half a million dollars in cash from developer C, Kim and Esparza decided to keep some of the money for themselves.  Kim pleaded guilty on June 3rd to bribery charges and admitted facilitating the bribe from developer C. A third major bribery scheme outlined in the affidavit involves Company D, another Chinese real estate firm that wanted to develop a large mixed-use project in Council District 14.  In exchange for Huizar's support of the project, Company D agreed to hire Huizar, Associate 1, as a consultant to perform work real estate reports that discuss development opportunities that actually was completed by Cheng.  The affidavit alleges that Company D also financed part of a Huizar family trip to China and agreed to contribute $100,000 to a political action committee that would benefit the campaign of Huizar's close relative, who Huizar intended to replace him on city council after he was termed out in 2020.  Finally, they note that the RICO conspiracy charge alleged in the complaint carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
