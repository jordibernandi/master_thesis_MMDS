This one dates back some 2,700 years to the time of King Hezekiah.  Get all the details coming up.  Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to the Watchman Newscast.  A very busy, very hectic time in the Stackelbeck household right now.  We are in the middle of a move, so boxes are kind of laying around.  The movers are on their way, but I had to come to you like we do every Tuesday and Thursday with the Watchman Newscast.  In particular today, because we have some breaking news for you.  Yet another breaking amazing archaeological find in God's city, Jerusalem.  Now this one is some 2,700 years old from the time of King Hezekiah, the time of the Assyrian invasion of Israel where the Assyrians carted away into slavery 10 of the 12 tribes of Israel.  So this discovery has major significance obviously for the biblical historical reasons, but number two, the location.  Folks, this amazing treasure trove of archaeological material, it's a huge site by the way, was found literally right next door to the brand new U.S.  Embassy in Jerusalem in the Arnona neighborhood of Jerusalem.  And the very interesting thing is that this archaeological find was essentially an administrative building.  under King Hezekiah, an administrative building 2,700 years ago, sitting right next to where an administrative building stands today, the brand new U.S.  Embassy in Jerusalem.  So fascinating stuff.  Our good friend Danny the Digger Herman is with us, top tour guide, archaeologist from on the ground in Israel.  He has all the details on this spectacular new find.

And Hezekiah and Josiah are very famous in the Bible for doing the major religious reform of desecrating all those pagan worship centers. ",

Before the excavations, there was a big pile of rocks at that site that could have been viewed without even the excavations.  These huge piles of rocks are called the wujum, okay?  They're like thousands and tens of thousands of stones about the size of a melon to a pumpkin maybe.  They were deliberately accumulated at that spot.  And you have several wood rooms like this in the mountains of Jews.  What is their purpose is a big mystery to this day because none of them till now has actually been excavated.  So one possibility was these were stones put aside while terracing the mountains for agricultural development.  Okay, which is a pragmatic answer, but then if you want to terrace the mountains, it would be smarter to use the stones for the terraces.  Okay, so the other option was suggesting these were bases of watchtowers that were put in the agricultural fields to watch the fields, which also makes sense, except that we never found the foundations of any round tower evident in these piles of rocks.  So if there's no pragmatic explanation, what else can it be?  And archaeologists always as a default, when there's no pragmatical explanation, they argue for something religious, something cultic.  Okay, so one archaeologist, a dear friend of mine, a rabbi from Dr.  Gabi Barkayi, I don't know if you ever interviewed him. ",

And over 100 of them were marked, were stamped, by the owner or by the commander who collected those jars.  Most of them were inscribed with the title Lamelech, which means in English, to the king or of the king.  Okay?  And this type of series of stamped jar handles called Lamelech are known from many other sites and are attributed to King Hezekiah.  Why did King Hezekiah make a big order of collecting taxes?  It's not related to the religious reform, but we believe it's related to the big threat of the Assyrian attack.  Yes.  Okay? ",

In the twelfth year, he, Josiah, began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah, Poles, and idols.  Under his directions, the altars of the Baals were torn down.  He cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them and smashed them.  the Asherah, Pauls, and idols, smashed them.  And indeed, those figurines were always found smashed.  Now, the book of Kings, in the parallel description of the same event, gives us even a geographical indication of where this was happening.  I'm reading now from the second book of Kings, chapter 23.  The king, Josiah, also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem and the south of the hill of corruption.  Okay?  Where is the hill of corruption?  Most scholars identify it just east of biblical Jerusalem, the city of David, which you have reviewed many, many times.  And so south of it would be the area of the American embassy.  Okay?  So I'm reading it again.  The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem and the south of the hill of corruptions, the one Solomon, king of Israel, had built.  Josiah again smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.  Now this site indeed has all of these smashed idols, piles of rocks and burying the site.  Okay?  And it's very tempting.  when I did all of this reading and interviewed the archaeologists, I found it very tempting to suggest maybe this is it.  This is one of those places where the religious reform caused a deliberate burial of a high place.  Okay?  And I'm still waiting to hear the final report with all the information to see if my theory is correct or maybe not.  But that's the beauty of research, of science, of archaeology.  You just never know what you might find. ",

I'm listening to several books.  on audio from Audible in my car when I'm working out.  So it is a great opportunity for you.  We live in very busy times right now.
