It is important that these stories have these moral truths of goodness.  And the moral imagination is not just being formed in children, it's being formed in all of us. ",

Adults should not only remember their childhood, they should keep it.  Children are naturally wondrous.  Things they see are new.  Things we see are new, too.  We just don't see them as well.  Children's literature can help you recover your childhood. ",

If you hear a particular title, so for example, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, please don't judge the story solely based on the movie.  Read the story itself.  Get into the story.  When you read Treasure Island, try to smell the salt air.  Try to get in the company of these pirates.  Feel the boards on the deck of the Hispaniola.  Enter that world. ",
