            "text": "All right, so the Biden campaign, they admitted.  They rarely admit this on anything.  They're not very transparent.  Lots of smoke and mirrors going on with the Biden-Harris ticket.  But they did admit that they're failing with the Latin community and that they need to do better.  So Joe boarded a plane.  Left the basement.  You know, they've realized that, too.  They haven't announced it and verbally admitted it, but they realized that we've got to get this guy out of the basement.  Trump's kicking his ass.  Like, we've got to get him out.  The old plan is not working.  So he's been moving around.  And yesterday they decided, okay, let's go down to Florida.  Really important swing state.  Really important whoever wins that.  We know that.  Florida is always a huge state in the election.  It's no different this year.  But there's also a huge Latin population and he needs his numbers to improve there, especially if he's going to try and win here.  So he went down there and there was a couple stops that he did.  But this was just the introduction, which I think is priceless.  I hope you enjoy it too.  Maybe I'm the only one who sees the humor in this.  And it's subtle, but this was the introduction at one of his events.  Roll one. ",

You've got lots of issues and concerns, lots of discussions circulating out on the worldwide web, in mainstream, everywhere about your cognitive health issues.  your awareness, and you're in an event that is a Joe Biden event, that is a scripted, staged event, which all, I'm not saying just his are, that's politics, right?  You're campaigning, it's a staged event.  But you're not even ready.  When they announce your name, and it's not like it's a one or two second delay.  They clap for a while.  They stop clapping.  He's still not there.  And then finally emerges, and then there's some awkward clapping afterwards.  Like, what the hell just happened?  What were you doing back there?  Did you forget why you were here?  Like, the whole thing I just thought was so Biden.  And it was so perfect for what we've seen and or heard from him throughout this campaign season.  So I had to share that one part.  But then he gets there.  This is what everyone else is talking about.  He gets there and it gets worse because he whips out his cell phone, kind of struggles with it for a second.  No worries, that's fine.  You don't have to be a tech wizard.  But struggles with it and then does this role too. ",

            "text": "All right.  So that was for him yesterday, Despacito, the very popular song, I think, from 2017.  We switched it out because we don't have the rights to play that, and we want this show to not get flagged for anything.  But he played Despacito there, and then you saw his head nod, his smile, and his dance.  Just playing a song, a Latin song on the phone, that's going to win over the voters.  It's a slam dunk, right?  You've got him.  Done.  Done deal.  But my question is, it's funny to watch, it's funny to listen, but who the hell thought this was a good idea?  Who on the staff was like, you know what, Joe?  Let me show you how iTunes works, or Spotify, or whatever he was listening to.  Let me show you how this works.  He still didn't do it well.  Play this song when you get out there.  And yes, the artist who introduced him is the guy, so there's a connection there.  But even so, just playing a song, pandering like that, that's... That's pretty silly, I think.  But if that's not enough, just playing a Latin song hoping to appease Latin voters and the people in attendance at this event.  The lyrics of Despacito, if you're aware of them, are very Joe Biden, very inappropriate lyrics.  for a presidential candidate and campaign to go out and be celebrating.  But again, it's very Joe Biden.  These are some of the words here.  And think of Joe Biden sniffing someone or caressing someone's shoulders or legs like he always does as you hear them.  Slowly, I wanna breathe your neck slowly.  Let me tell you things in your ears, right?  You can see him doing that.  So that you remember when you're not with me, slowly, I want to undress you with kisses.  Slowly, sign the walls of your labyrinth and make your whole body a manuscript.  Very Joe Biden.  Probably not the best thing to bring up in discussion when there's so much discussion already about how you're a creep and can't keep your hands, nose, and or lips off of women and young children who don't want you touching them.  So the whole thing was interesting.  But his trip started off poorly from the get-go.  And I apologize for the loud woman laughing in the background in this.  I can't control it.  It's the only version we could find out there.  But it is kind of funny.  And it's a little bit of a stretch.  I'll give you that.  But... He never knows where he is, and apparently he sees, when he was getting off the plane, we now know that Joe has imaginary friends and sees people that aren't actually there.  This was him arriving in Florida, roll three.  Candidate for president in this race is walking off the plane, arriving in Florida just moments ago.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, he's there to try to... ",

There was a fire truck down the one side, so I'll give him that.  But the rest of it, and where he initially looked and waved, there's nothing there, folks.  It's the end of the tarmac and... and some grass fields.  Part of the grass, by the way, that looks like it needs some help.  But, you know, I pick on Joe a lot.  I pick on, we talk about the lack of enthusiasm all the time.  And then I remembered this clip, and it kind of dawned on me.  Like, this is why there's no enthusiasm.  This is why there's issue.  It's not just his 47 years of failure.  It's not just his rapid cognitive decline.  It's not just his hot temper, which you see where he always is threatening to go out in the parking lot and fight someone outside or whatever he does, or even his inability to control himself with the sniffing and the groping and the touching.  If you look at this clip back from the debates, he simply just told supporters the wrong place to go.  He sent them all to the wrong place, so they don't know where to find.  Joe Biden, rule four. ",

There's no people watching the online events.  And he's just a mess.  That was an old clip, again, from the debates where he stumbled.  I'm surprised he got the number right.  But he stumbled through it, pointing them to a location that doesn't take visitors that way.  It was a text mode.  Mammoth Nation is the discount club for conservatives. ",
