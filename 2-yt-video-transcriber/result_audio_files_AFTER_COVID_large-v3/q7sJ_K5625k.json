            "text": "Earlier today, the Poor People's Campaign held a digital sit-in and call-in to Senator Mitch McConnell's offices demanding action on a coronavirus relief package.  Bishop William Barber is the co-chairman of the Poor People's Campaign and the author of We Are Called to Be a Movement.  And he joins me now.  I want to start, you know, we have a lot of concern by people like Jim Jordan, who might want to stay away from the whole football issue, who had some issues with, you know, assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State.  But he's out there saying we need football.  You have other people saying, you know, football is a priority.  Lots of people tweeting.  Ben Sasse wrote an entire letter about it.  It struck me as I read those tweets and saw that there was this letter from Ben Sasse that the people who go to play football in college on scholarship generally come from families with no money.  And without those scholarships, they couldn't even go to college.  And there's this big concern that they get out on the field and run and jump for the entertainment of rich people.  Meanwhile, their families might not be able to afford food.  I don't know if it struck you that way, but that's how it struck me. ",

            "text": "Well, it struck me that that's the way in which many of these people feel about the poor.  You know, it has its roots rated in racism.  when they talk about if they give people money, they're going to be lazy.  And that's the same thing slave masters and racists said about black people.  Or, you know, they're just good for sports.  But here's the ugly and I want to say damnable thing that Americans are learning.  And that is that racists are liars, but they're also learning that racists are thieves.  And so if you have someone who commits racism, not only will they hurt black people, but they'll hurt all Americans because they will steal your health care, they will steal your unemployment, and they will literally steal your life if you allow it.  We released a report the other day, I mean, just this morning, that said that Senate is in play and poor folk have the power to make the play because 34 million poor and low-income people were eligible but did not vote.  We found out a lot of them didn't vote because of problems with transportation and illness and not having open, but also because they never hear their issues.  But in these states, George, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Arizona, Minnesota, Maine, Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, Ohio, if just 1 to 19 percent of poor and low-wealth people will register to vote, move around an agenda and vote, they can fundamentally change the United States.  STATE SENATE AND CHANGE THE PRESIDENTIAL RATE.  THAT'S WHERE WE'RE PUTTING OUR ATTENTION ON.  WE HAVE TO BUILD POWER IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY UNDERSTAND. ",

            "text": "Yeah, and that is an important point because people will blame poor people for not voting.  But as you said, first of all, there's having an issue to vote on, and there's also the logistics of it.  We're seeing this attack on the post office, where if you go into a post office anywhere in the country, whatever the demographics are, you'll find the post office is disproportionately staffed by people who are black and brown, right?  And so there's this... UNYIELDING ATTACK ON IT AS IF THE ONLY THING THE POST OFFICE DOES IS DELIVER BALLOTS WHEN IT ALSO TURNS OUT.  THAT THE POST OFFICE DELIVERS MEDICINE AND PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS AND PEOPLE'S SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS.  AND SO IF YOU BREAK THE POST OFFICE RURAL PEOPLE WON'T GET ANY MAIL BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A LUCRATIVE ROUTE FOR THIS UNITED STATES.  UM FOR UM YOU KNOW FEDEX AND THESE OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES.  So what do you make of the fact that this attack on the Postal Service is being done?  narrow casting Donald Trump's reelection and not looking at all these other ways in which primarily poor people are going to be affected?

            "text": "It's being done by Trump, being allowed by McConnell and Republicans, and it is an all-out attack, a war against the poor.  The poor people are already in a depression, even before COVID.  But this is about really an annihilation, if you will.  We had 43 percent of the country in poverty before COVID.  It's upwards of 50 percent and headed higher now because of the way we've not responded properly.  And what do you have?  You have McConnell\u2014 being silent.  You have Trump trying to undermine the access to the ballot.  We have 30 million more people unemployed, 27 more people without health care.  And what does McConnell want?  Two hundred-some-odd billion dollars for tax cuts and $25 billion for a plane the Pentagon doesn't even want.  And he wants to protect corporations from liability.  Just a few hours ago, we had 200,000-plus people come online for a moral march on McConnell to challenge his mayhem, his meanness, and his madness, and make thousands and thousands of calls.  People are sick of this.  They are starting to recognize that these folks have a disdain for the poor and low-income.  It doesn't matter what your color is.  There's an all-out war against the poor.  and an all attempt to steal and filter more money to the greedy, and they don't care what they use.  That is why we did this report, and that's why we're organizing poor, low-wealth people all over this country and saying to any political party that really wants to win, poor people now make up 25 percent of the electorate.  Twenty-five percent of the electorate is political suicide not to organize that group and speak to their issues and talk about living wages and health care and how you're going to deal with the issues of voter suppression that hurt not only black people, but poor people as well.  But if you mobilize that group, if you mobilize that, they can fundamentally shift the elections and the power in this country, both in the Senate and the presidential level and at the governor's level.  We have to change this narrative.  We have to build power because these folks, as you said, Dora, they would shut down the post office to stop our political power being exhibited if they could get away with it. ",
