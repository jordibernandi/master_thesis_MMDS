            "text": "Florida, a huge assault weapon ban has been submitted that has a lot of intricacies and bans a lot of things including parts, a single part.  Yeah, you might want to watch this one.  Stick by for this episode of Guns and Gadgets.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premiere source for Second Amendment news.  If it is the news that you want related to the constant attack on our right to keep and bear arms, the constant list of infringements on the only amendment in the Bill of Rights that says, shall not be infringed, you have found your home here on Guns and Gadgets.  Please hit the subscribe button down below, hit the thumbs up to help break the anti-gun algorithm, and share this with everybody.  you know.  Florida.  State Bill 370, submitted by State Senator Gary Farmer.  It's bad.  I mean, it's really bad.  I'll go over it real quick.  I'll have a link down below.  I'm gonna hit some bullet points, but if you live in Florida, you're gonna wanna become very intimately familiar with this bill, and you're going to wanna get some people calling the State House and telling them you do not want this to pass.  I'll have links down below so you can contact your state senator, your state representative in Florida.  This has to be stopped immediately.  So as I said in the quick open, 370 in Florida looks to ban what they determine to be an assault weapon, also any magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, as well as parts.  Yes, parts.  Let's get into it real quick.  I have a list because there's so much stuff in this bill.  I'm going to be referring to a note real quick.  So in addition to what they're calling large capacity magazines, that's anything over 10 rounds, It also bans their version of assault weapon.  Now, this is very similar to the Bill Clinton assault weapon ban, as well as the attempt that Florida had by the group called BON, B-A-W-N, which was Ban Assault Weapons Now.  And this is, it's ugly.  This will ban if it goes through any semi-automatic rifle, and it names a whole bunch to include any AK, any AR variant.  And it goes through and lists some specific ones.  So don't go in the comments and say, Jared, does it do this one?  Does it ban this one?  I'll have a link down below.  You can look at the ones down below, but chances are it's there.  And if it's not named, like Bushmaster is in there, but if it's not specifically named, they have a way to ban that as well.  AKs and AR variants.  It also goes on and names specifically to ban any pistol variant of an AK or AR and also names other types as well.  It will also ban some shotgun types, SEGAs, etc.  And there's probably like 10 or 12 that are in there.  And this is the concerning part.  It will ban a part, a single part, or any combination of parts that would be used to either convert or simply to build their version of an assault weapon.  So that could be something at an 80% lower.  It could be a strip lower.  It could be a trigger spring.  It could be a safety selector switch.  It could be any single part used to build an AK or an AR or anything else in their terms of assault weapons.  So in theory, in this bill, if you have a spare part for something that might wear out or break, many people keep extra, whether it's a bolt carrier group or a bolt or a spring or washers, whatever, It is a violation of this bill.  It goes further to screwing the American people by mentioning any semi-automatic pistols that accept a detachable magazine.  Just the simple ability to accept a large capacity magazine would ban that item.  Which means any gun that accepts a magazine, that somewhere in the world there's a magazine for that gun that accepts an 11th round, that handgun is banned under this bill.  Any pistol handgun that has a threaded barrel that would accept anything to include suppressors, is banned under this bill.  Any semi-automatic rifle that can accept a detachable magazine that has any one or more of these lists of craziness, a folding stock, a telescoping stock, any pistol grip, any thumb hole stock, or any other characteristic that they think would function as a stock.  And then we have the typical, I'm scared what this thing looks like parts.  If it has a bayonet lug, if it has a flash suppressor, if it has a hand guard on your rifle that allows you to grab that with a second non-firing hand and not be melted and singed and seared to the barrel.  Any barrel shroud that would act the same way.  They've even lumped in .22 calibers into this band.  If you have a fixed magazine .22 that has a fixed magazine that has more than 10 rounds, 10 rounds of .22, that's banned.  And then it gets better.  You cannot sell, transfer, import, distribute, keep for sale, offer or expose for sale, or give any assault weapon or large capacity magazine away.  If you do that, then you have committed a felony and you'll serve a minimum of two years in prison.  If you do any of that sale, transfer, import, distribute, keep for sale, offer for sale, or expose for sale, or even give an assault weapon or a large capacity magazine to anybody under 18, you're gonna do a minimum of six years in prison.  The simple possession of a single large capacity magazine or assault weapon would be a minimum of one year in prison.  Now I know there are a lot of people in Florida, I know many of you in Florida, my friends out there, and I know you have normal, everyday, lawful items that the Constitution allows.  and shall not be infringed, right?  Well, this state senator, Farmer, this clown, has a little plan.  There's a little bit of a, I won't even call it a grandfather clause because it's not.  It's not a grandfather clause, so pay attention.  He'll allow you Him, the king, will allow you peasants to keep these items only if you apply for a certificate of possession.  And that's only if you already lawfully own one of these items before October 1st, 2021.  He's gonna give you some time because he's a good, caring, kind king.  He's very, very caring to his people and very understanding.  Oh, and that certificate of possession, you have to apply for each item and every single firearm that you have that this bill would lump in.  each and every single magazine that you have as well.  So say you have a pistol that has a threaded barrel.  Oh this is a scary assault weapon under this bill.  Say you don't have a threaded barrel but your magazine is more than 10 rounds.  Oh this would need a certificate of possession and this because this could go inside of it needs a certificate of possession.  That's two certificates of possession for this one item.  Now, after you apply for this, it is a mini NFA.  They're going to take all of your information as well as your thumbprint, and they're gonna run some background checks on you.  And if you are denied your certificate of possession, you have to relinquish your possession within 10 days of all of these items that you might have lawfully.  throughout however long you have lived on this earth, but just happen to be living in the state of Florida, According to this clown, you'd have to get rid of all that.  Otherwise, they're gonna put you in the gulag.  Now, if you are granted the King's permission to have these items, you can't sell them.  You can never sell these items.  This is a way to extinguish all of these items within two generations from the state of Florida, because you can't sell them.  The only place you can sell them is to a dealer.  You have to have a certificate to do that as well.  It has to be reported to the local law enforcement, but then that dealer can't sell it to anybody in the state again.  You can't give it to your children as you're getting older in age.  You can't say, hey wifey, this is your gun.  Can't do that because the king won't let you.  Now what happens to say?  you're somebody like me who wants to move and you think I am sick and tired of the snow or I'm sick and tired of the tyranny.  I'm going to move to Florida because they're typically a gun friendly state.  If you move into Florida and you lawfully possess these items that shall not be infringed, once you get into Florida, within 90 days you have to do one of the following.  Render each item and magazine permanently inoperable.  sell them off to a dealer or remove them from the state.  If you're moving to Florida, you can't apply for a certificate of possession, I guess, unless you move there real quick and you happen to lawfully own these items in the state of Florida prior to October 1st, 2021.  But if you move in.  after that, the King will not allow you to have any items that shall not be infringed.  Now, once you have your certificate to possess these items from the King, you can only possess them in these scenarios in your residence in your business or on your property or somebody else's property with express consent of possession.  you can't just say well i'm not going to tell them because it's my right.  i can go anywhere i want.  Oh, no, no, not under the king wannabe here, Mr.  Farmer in Florida.  Also, only at a range or a club or any specific type of training event that's run by law enforcement or somebody specifically training on firearm safety.  Or you can transport these to or from those places or to a dealer.  And that's it.  Now, of course, there's going to be a cost related to this permission slip for each and every single item you have because... You need to take a thumbprint, so they're gonna be able to charge you for that.  Now, if you live in Florida, your Senate president has the ability to kill any bill meaning it doesn't have to get a public hearing.  So I'm gonna have the information down below where you can reach out to your state Senate president, and that's Wilton Simpson, and he's a Republican, and you should tell him that you expect him to kill this bill.  Now, you know I have a lot of friends over at Gun Owners of America and they make it very easy.  I'll have a link down below where you can just click that button and they'll be able to take your information down and send that letter off to the Senate president on your own.  but I still want each and every person who lives in Florida to call the Senate president, to call the king wannabe farmer, and call your local representatives and state senators, and I'll have the link down below for you to do that.  Guys and gals, we know the makeup of the country right now as far as the powers that be.  We know they've campaigned on stripping us of our lawfully owned items because they believe they have the power to do that.  They don't.  And it's time for us to make our voices heard each and every step of the way because we're not doing it anymore.  Guys and gals, I hope you're fired up.  If you live in Florida, you need to make those phone calls.  If you were going to move to Florida, you should probably let everybody you know in Florida make these phone calls.  Tell them to do this.  I hope this fires you up, because it really angered me, because I was literally on Zillow last night, literally on Zillow last night, looking for places outside of the Tampa area, because I hate Massachusetts.  And there's a lot of bad stuff happening to Florida gun-related wise, and you'll see more of that here.  If you want to stay up to date with the Second Amendment attack, no matter where it happens in our country good bad ugly or indifferent please subscribe to guns and gadgets and spread it with everybody.  you know it is imperative.  now with the huge amount of uh shadow banning and deleting and all that stuff taking place it's on us to get the news out.  guys and gals i hope you have a fantastic day until we see each other again.  be safe stay vigilant carry a weapon and i will see you on the next one and there'll be a next one.  take care everybody.
