They need to have all of their access stripped away from them.  It all needs to be burned down.  They need to be, their brand needs to be totally destroyed, even more than they've already destroyed it.  Corporations needs to pull out.  New York City's trying to cancel its contract with the Trump Organization.  They need to be investigated.  Donnie, as far as I'm concerned, should be indicted for inciting an insurrection.  And all of them, should be doing nothing but defending themselves against charges.  So that's down to us.  We can't forget it.  Donald has shown just how capable people like him who have his resources, who have his connections, are rehabilitating or staying in the game when they should have been discarded a long time ago. ",
