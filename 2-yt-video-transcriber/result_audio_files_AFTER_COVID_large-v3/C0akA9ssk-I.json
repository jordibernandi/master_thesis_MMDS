This was 14% of the nation's farms, and it was our all-time high.  Since then, Black farmland ownership has precipitously declined to the point where farmers now control only about 1.5% of the farmland in the United States.  When Black farmers did manage to acquire those 16 million acres of land, the backlash was swift and severe.  The White Citizens Council, the Ku Klux Klan, and other white supremacist groups attacked Black farmers for the audacity of leaving the plantation and not being sharecroppers anymore.  So homes were burned, people were murdered and lynched and driven off of their land. ",

And we found that one of the most effective ways to address the trauma is to help our folks understand that our relationship to land goes back thousands of years before land-based oppression.  So there is certainly a returning generation of farmers who are excited to reclaim the proud legacy of our grandparents and great-grandparents as stewards of the land.  The problem is that there isn't enough training, there is not enough capital, and there's not enough land.  We are the grandchildren of the people who are dispossessed of their land, both through racist violence and government discrimination.  So we're calling on the federal government and for the public to make sure that this returning generation of farmers can be successful. ",
