            "text": "There's males and females out there.  We've seen them all.  This female rioter, I'm not going to call them a protester.  There are some protesters out there, but most of them are rioters.  This female rioter gets detained by law enforcement out there.  Mind you, these guys are tired.  This has been going on for over 70 days.  Over 70 days in Portland.  Unchecked.  The law enforcement officers out there They brave the conditions every night, putting their their life on the line, despite having no support from Attorney General Mike Schmidt and Mayor Ted Wheeler and the rest of the city there.  They're basically just like, don't do anything to these people.  Let them do their thing, but also don't let them get us.  That's kind of the mindset of Democrat leadership in these cities and particularly those guys.  But so these guys are frustrated, right?  They've they've they.  the cops have been the ones handcuffed.  throughout this.  not these people who are.  who are you know.  yes some are getting arrested and detained.  this is an example but but they are.  they are treated with kid gloves.  a lot of them let out.  the charges are not what they should be.  there should be a precedent set.  there should have been a precedent set night one where everyone went down.  the police got rid of all the protesters with whatever means necessary and i'm not saying the worst but you know i'm saying going out there and and making it clear that this is not okay.  this is not acceptable behavior for someone anywhere on either side of the political aisle.  this is it's just not acceptable.  so all that to say this chick gets arrested is being detained.  she's got another female protester rioter friend in the background asking if there should be a female cop present to pat her down.  roll four five whatever it is.  Is there a female officer present to do this?  Good question.  Is there a female officer present while you're patting her down?  What's that?  Do you have a female officer present while you're patting her down?  Nope.  How do you know that I don't identify as a female?  So, if you couldn't hear that, she's asking... Can we have a female officer present?  She repeats it three times.  And the cop responds, how do you know that I don't identify as a female officer?  Which I think is amazing.  It made my day.  Just an absolute baller response.  I know it pissed people off.  I don't care.  Don't care if you're mad about it.  Because... Look, there's a couple things here.  One, obviously, just if you act with respect and dignity, then you get respect and dignity in return most of the time.  Not all the time.  It's not a perfect world.  But you get my point.  Generally speaking, do the right thing.  Treat others the way you want to be treated.  And you're going to get that back.  But also, you've got here, you've got these groups who are so loud and so aggressive in their rhetoric and aggressive with their behavior too, as we've seen throughout 2020.  But you can't rely, and someone said this, you can't rely on gender norms if you're an advocate for no gender norms.  So you don't wanna be called a pronoun.  You don't wanna be called this, that, or the other in a more traditional sense, until all of a sudden it benefits you.  So, you know, earlier in the night when they were doing, you know, all that they're doing in Portland, what's left of it, they would have been all for eliminating pronouns and traditional roles in society.  Now, all of a sudden you are scared, you're panicked because you're being arrested and you want to be treated this way.  It doesn't make sense.  It's like the cop, the city councilman in Los Angeles we were talking about yesterday.  Wanted to fund the police.  Wanted to fund the police and bow to this mob out there that hates them and thinks they're awful people when that's A, not true, and defunding the police who's already under resources is an awful decision.  And for those of you on Twitter and YouTube who keep saying, you don't understand what defund the police is, shut the hell up.  We all understand what it means.  The point is, They are already under-resourced.  You are claiming they are all bad when they are clearly all not and cutting them, defunding them.  whether it's by 50% or by 5%, is not the right move.  That's the point.  And you have people pushing for it, like Mike Bonin, whatever his name was, Mike Bonin, I think it was, in Los Angeles, who've then called the police 40 times over the last five years.  They've called him eight times to his home for his own benefit since April.  It's the same thing here.  You can't... Look, if you're going to... Stick to your principles.  If you're going to be... I can be whatever gender.  I'm a girl now.  I'm a boy later.  And tomorrow I'm going to be a unicorn.  Cool.  You do you.  That's weird.  I think that's weird as shit.  But you do you and I don't have a problem with it.  But then when things go south and a club won't let you in because they don't allow unicorns in, don't get all pissed and decide that you're a different gender or person or entity.  And use it again.  Stick with it.  Don't get mad when someone calls you a girl and then wants the benefits of being a girl when you're being arrested.  It just irks me.  It drives me crazy.  You guys act like animals.  You make up whatever rules you want, and then you get mad when people call you on it.  This is America.  There are laws.  There are normal things.  that we go by.  There are normal traditions and values backed by science that we live by.  If you want to do something weird, that's cool, but don't get mad at people when they question it because you're not the majority.  You are a minority.  It doesn't mean you don't have a voice, but it means that you need to understand the way the world works, and it's more and more apparent that you don't.  So stop listening to the lies about police officers, the lies that BLM and Antifa are teaching you. ",
