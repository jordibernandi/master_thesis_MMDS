Someone who owes somebody else 100,000 euros and who thinks yelling like a madman is the way to win a debate.  He thinks he has a secret knowledge that no one else has and is special.  Well, he's right.  He's definitely special, just not in the way he thinks.  More in the back of the bus licking the windows kind of special.  This is the story of Howard.  But from now on, I will call him Harold the Stupid because it annoys him.  This is episode 38 of Flirfs are Idiots.  Meet Howard George Stirrup, a flat earth activist dumbass of epic proportions.  Howard, who from this point forward we will only refer to as Harold the Stupid, thinks the earth is flat and has devised some experiments, well at least he calls them experiments, to prove this fucking stupid notion.  Harold usually spends his time shouting at pigeons in the street and trying to convince people that the CIA are controlling them through fillings in their teeth, so... Maybe he didn't have time to learn actual science?  Let's find out.  Throughout history, we've been distracted and divided by having beliefs in other people's theories and secondhand information.  Oh man, flat earthers can't do anything right.  Harold, how did you manage to mix the sound so badly that the water behind you is five times louder than you are?  Harold the stupid, you are a massive fail whale. ",

And thanks to Tommy Gronville for modelling this out for me, we see that light would only have to bend 0.016 degrees for 10 miles.  And light would only have to bend 0.162 degrees for 30 miles.  This matches the GLOBE predictions perfectly and is not evidence for there being no curve.  Also, when there's observations like this one from Miles Davis that show mountains over 500m in elevation appearing below an eye level of 210m, it makes observations like yours irrelevant.  It's high enough for refraction to not be an issue.  Links to both Tommy's and Miles' channel will be in the description. ",

That meat thermometer you are using actually has an error margin of plus or minus two degrees Fahrenheit.  So how do you know the water's actually cooled by that much?  And of course you are ignoring a well-known physical phenomenon called radiative cooling.  Something in the moon light has an open sky above it, meaning it can radiate heat back into space easier than something in the moon's shade.  In a recent debate with me, Harold the Stupid expanded on his claim by saying, only the waning moon cools water.  So I've decided to test this and I'm currently doing a 30 day experiment to test Harold's claim.  If you want to get involved, then the best thing to do is to join my discord.

            "text": "Show some curve to win 1,000 euros.  My name is Howard George Stirrup, and I've had enough of the debate and the complicated explanations, so I've decided to prove that the earth is flat for once and for all.  It's 33 kilometers from Benidorm to San Juan Alicante.  That's 20 miles as the crow flies.  So according to the Pythagorean theorem, there should be 80 meters hidden due to the curve.  To help put that into perspective, that's the first 20 floors of the average apartment block.  As it's always happy hour in Benny York, I'm willing to increase the odds.  If you can show me 60 meters hidden due to the curve, I'm willing to pay 1,000 euros cash in hand to whoever's got a better camera than I do.  Good luck. ",

            "text": "So Harold the Stupid has actually upped the amount.  he says that he will pay to 100,000 euros.  But here's the thing, his challenge has actually been met.  This is an answer to his challenge.  On the 5th of June 2018, someone made these observations.  Pictures were taken from Faro Grau Gandia towards Denia.  Two photos were taken about 40 meters apart laterally, one at one meter above sea level and one about eight meters above sea level.  As this webpage shows, link in the description, at the higher elevation you see more of the cliff face and this demonstrates about 60 meters of curve.  Of course, Harold has claimed these are fake and refuses to pay.  Not that anyone thinks a flat earther has 100,000 euros to give anyway.  Harold, you're a liar, a conman and a welcher.  Pay what you owe or admit you are wrong.  You ask for repeatable counter evidence.  This is what I presented in this video.  That's all the stupid that I can take for today.  But before I go...
