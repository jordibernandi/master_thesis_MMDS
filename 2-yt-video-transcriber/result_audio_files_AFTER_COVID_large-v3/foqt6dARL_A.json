Chosen.  Chosen.  I will set apart, set apart for God to do.  Form in his image.  Chosen.  They say the chain of Shaitan is not that strong.  They say his time is running out.  He ain't got that long.  They say murder, murder, kill.  This is not that song.  Said I won't amount to nothing.  They got that wrong.  I was set apart and I was shown the light.  And if I get the kingdom, I'll be clothed in white.  One third will be delivered and the rest were blinded.  Their fate is set in stone.  What you ain't read the fine prince.  Christ is going to give a crown to us.  In the end, we'll have the nations bowing down to us.  with their faces to the ground to us.  It's the truth, as crazy as it sounds to us.  Jacob forever rules, and with his precious jewels, showed us love and patience, put us above the nations.  And that's the gospel.  Thank God for choosing me.  Bad news for you is really good news for me.  I was set apart, set apart for God's use.  Chosen.  Chosen.  I will set apart, set apart for God's use.  Born in his image.  We're not just celebrating combinations.  Let me tell you why.  We have a different kind of shine, a different kind of mind.  The rhythm's not the same, we're on a different type of time.  It's a different kind of pace, a different kind of race.  The season's not the same, we have a different kind of taste.  A different kind of salt, we are so not them.  Got my sword and my shield, man, I'm so locked in.  And when I came to serve you, Howard, put my whole heart in.  So I can sit calm, I'm no Martin.  Ha!  And that's the reach, y'all.  Chosen to teach, y'all.  Every Sabbath, you can find us in the streets, y'all.  Daniel Alla, my nickname is Priest, y'all.  In the gym, they say that I'm a beast, y'all.  Set apart, the nation's all hating me.  Set a trap, they lying in.  wait for me.  Chris Paul, they don't want to play with me.  But if you love me, I'm asking that you pray with me.  I was set apart, set apart for God's use.  Chosen.  Chosen.  I was set apart, set apart for God to form in his image.  Chosen.  And thou art in holy people unto the law of thy God.  The law of thy God have chosen thee to be a special people.  Chosen.  Above all people that saw the face of the earth.  That's Deuteronomy 7 and 6.  That's you, black and Latin man.  Chosen.  That's you, black and Latin woman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We the chosen.  Chosen.  Chosen.  Chosen.  Chosen.  Chosen. ",
