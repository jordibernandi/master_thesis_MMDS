If I recall, I pointed out that while I was at Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels and among all people who were there on that Hajj, who had accepted the religion of Islam.

So this was an observation on his part and he was not in the least becoming an integrationist.  His role was forever the fight for black freedom.

And he felt that civil rights confined our struggle or our fight for freedom to the borders of the United States.

There was that old house Negro and the field Negro.  And the house Negro always looked out for his master.  When the field Negroes got too much out of line, he held them back in check.  He put them back on the plantation.  The house Negro could afford to do that because he lived better than the field Negro.  He ate better, he dressed better, and he lived in a better house.  He lived right up next to his master in the attic or the basement.  He ate the same food his master ate and wore his same clothes.  And he could talk just like his master.  Good diction.
