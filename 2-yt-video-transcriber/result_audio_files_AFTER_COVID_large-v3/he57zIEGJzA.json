            "text": "And I thought I'd go and have a look at Jewish literature to see what they say about their origins.  And here we see three quotes.  And the first is in the 1925 Jewish Encyclopedia which says that Esau, Edom, is modern Jewry.  And of course this is contrary to what most people believe today which is that the Jews are God's chosen people because they are the Israelites.  But here the Jewish literature is saying that they are actually from the tribe of Edom, not the tribe of Israel.  In the Jewish Almanac in 1980 it says, strictly speaking, it is incorrect to call an ancient Israelite a Jew or to call a contemporary Jew an Israelite or Hebrew.  And that's because, truthfully speaking, they are not the Hebrews or Israelites, they are really the Edomites.  And also we see here in the Encyclopedia Judaica, that Edomite Jews began to call themselves Hebrews and Israelites in 1860. ",
