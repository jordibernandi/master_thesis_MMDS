Thanks, Raya.  This is Ava in Kid Correspondent.  I'm here to find out how kids like us can disagree.  awesomely.  When was the last time you disagreed with someone?  Yesterday.  This happened very recently, actually.  I've had one yesterday.  Do you ever disagree with your brother and sisters?  We always get into disagreements.  Always.  We disagree about who gets to go in the shower first.  How do you try to settle disagreements?  I try not to be too mean.  I also try to find a solution.  It's okay to have disagreements, but you want to say it in a proper way.  that will not hurt them or hurt their feelings.  Good to know that disagreements can be settled with an open mind.  Back to you, Raya.  A lot of people don't know this, but along with being a reporter, I also want to be a senator and an astronaut and a pet owner.  I'm debating getting a cat or a dog.  I'm just not sure what pet to get.  I'm getting tell we have a commercial break.  I don't even know this show got commercials. ",

I have a big kid correspondent question.  Is there a right way and a wrong way to disagree?  Let's go to special correspondents Jack and Maya.  Thanks, Mariah.  I'm Maya.  And I'm Jack.  And we never fight.  Yeah, we do.  Never.  All the time.  Well, in case we ever do, which we won't, we're doing it right now.  We wanted to learn how to disagree and how not to.  Rule number one, don't bring a compressed air horn.  Or do listen carefully to the other person.  Don't hold your breath until the other person agrees with you.  You know what's terrible on your pizza?  Pineapple.  Don't call your grandma while the other person's talking.  Hi, Grandma.  How are you doing?  We're in the middle of an argument.  Grandma, hi.  Do let the other person finish.  Well, I think I had a good point there, but it's going to take a long time, so get prepared.  Most importantly, if something makes you angry or upset, don't be afraid to talk about it.  And do remember that it's okay for friends to disagree.  Back to you, Raya.  I was going to say that.  I was going to say that.  Thanks, team.  Now you know the rules of disagreement, we're going to put it into practice.  But with a twist.  Let's go to Christian for see-saw, see-saw.  For see-saw, see-saw.  Let's just go to Christian.  Thanks, Raya.  A lot of excitement down here for what promises to be a great debate.  I disagree.  I disagree.  Today we have Rosie and Ava on the seesaw.  Have you ever seen a seesaw debate?  Me neither.  The topic is, which season is better, summer or winter?  It's about to be a great debate.  Summer is so much better.  You can go swimming, and you can spend the whole day outside.  Summer wins.  Oh, did you just hear what Rosie said?  No way.  Winter is the best.  It's hot.  Chocolate time, the holidays, and it's snuggling in front of the fire.  A strong start for these two.  Neither one giving an inch.  But I love the politeness.  There's holidays in summer.  Fourth of July.  Ice cream.  Hammock.  Sunburn.  Sweat.  Mosquitoes.  Good one, Ava.  No way.  The winner is winter.  Going sledding.  Shuffling snow.  Breezing cold.  Thumb is down winter.  Some good points being made.  Listening well.  These two know the fundamentals.  You don't like summer because I'm a better diver.  You are not a better diver.  I am.  Hey, I'm a good diver, too.  You're just jealous.  Oh, foul on the play.  He's right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You know what?  I don't want to fight.  How about this?  We all have our own opinions.  I like winter and you like summer.  It's not something worth fighting about.  Yeah, let's find something we can both agree on.  Fall.  We can both agree on fall because there's Halloween, pumpkin pie, and our birthday.  Yes, fall is awesome.  It's a compromise.  What an ending to this exciting match.  What a great debate.  Hey, we're not disagreeing anymore.  Hey, you're saying the same thing.  I'm saying.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  Not this again.  And that's the debate.  Christian out.  I could really go for a donut right now.  I love donuts.  I love donuts.  What was I talking about again?  Saying things to another person's side is important.  I think there's a word for that.  I forgot what it is.  Well... That's it!  Hi, Raya!  Robin Roberts!  You're one of my heroes!  You're good with words.  What is it called when you want to see something from another person's side? ",

Meet 11-year-old Colby McAllister.  He was being bullied at school, and he wrote a book about standing up to bullies.  It's about a boy who finds a magic crystal that gives him powers to stand up to bullies.  He hopes to inspire kids all over the world to find the magic in them to solve disagreements and to stand up to bullies too.  Wow, that's incredible.  And you know what else is incredible?
