This video is put together rather quickly because I'm going live tonight, but that's going to be a mostly political discussion and I didn't really want politics to be my first video of the year.  Luckily, scientifically ignorant commenters are a great resource for quick content.  Now, every so often, I make a short video demonstrating a scientific content just for a commenter to see.  And I did that here and thought, how about I just do it as a video?  Anyway, you ever come across a content that is so fundamentally dumb that you get taken aback by it?  Anyone who has dealt with globe deniers knows exactly what I'm saying.  A comment so out of touch with reality that you don't think you should ever have to explain it.  This is one of those.  Some time ago, I made a video showing the claim that the moon gives off cooling light is BS.  And at the end of that video, I also showed that the moon is showing the same light patterns.  objects lit directly by the sun do, and thus is being lit by the sun.  The most stunning comment I have ever gotten as a rebuttal, and I've seen this argument a few times, is that the moon can't be reflecting sunlight because... Hold on, let me get this straight.  Light can't be reflected off round objects onto other objects.  This is one of those things, you know?  Society has failed these people.  Now, in this case, I'm specifically talking about a user that actually calls himself, show me the evidence.  For over a year, this person was arguing on my moonlight video that light doesn't reflect off round objects.  And a few days ago, I tried to clarify his position and said, if I could show you a beam of light bouncing off a round object, would you concede that the moon can reflect the sun's light?  He followed up this morning challenging me instead of commenting.  I should have shown an experiment proving my position.  Now, I had already done the experiment and was just waiting for him to show that he was still in the conversation before putting it up.  Now, before I go through the wholly unnecessary task of this demonstration, let me explain something to show me the evidence that 99.999% of people on this planet knows.  Hell, I would say that of the adults alive today with working vision, there are not 5,000 people that don't know this.  If you see an object that is not itself a light source, you are seeing light reflecting off of that object.  Light travels to that object, bounces off of it, and then to your eyes.  In the case of this metal ball here, light has traveled to this object, reflected off it, and to the camera sensors, and to my eyes here.  This alone is evidence that light can reflect off of round objects.  The fact that you see round objects is evidence.  But let's go to the next level.  for the sake of humoring users like, show me the evidence.  Here are several round objects.  Light is currently reflecting off of those round objects to my eyes and to the camera sensor.  The fact that I can get in close to this metal ball and see the yellow ball means that the light is reflecting off of that yellow ball, then reflecting off the metal ball to the camera sensor.  Here's a laser pointer dot that you can see reflecting off of the yellow ball to the camera sensor.  And reflecting off the yellow ball, then the metal ball to the camera.  Let's try one more.  The laser reflects off of metal ball number one, then off metal ball number two, then off metal ball number three to the camera.  That's it.  It's all there.  This is basic vision.  How can you get through life and be so fundamentally ignorant that you don't know these things?  Anyway, It was my intention to go back to making explanatory videos, helping clarify concepts to people in languages that they can understand, and get away from responding directly to shockingly stupid claims of globe deniers.  And I will.  You'll get that, and nerdy TV show comments, and other things like that.  I couldn't put that little demo together and then not let everybody see it.  Just in case there's anyone else that's as misinformed out there.  Show them this.  Goddamn.  That's my job.  That's what I do.  I don't lose.  I win.  I win.  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by congratulating them last night victory. ",
