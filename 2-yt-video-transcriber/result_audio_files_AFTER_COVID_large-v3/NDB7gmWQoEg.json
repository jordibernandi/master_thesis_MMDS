            "text": "good damn afternoon americans jericho green here with you once again.  and did you guys see biden's pervertus?  some uh footage was uh found leaked dug up whatever you want to call it of him in 2016 addressing some soldiers.  I don't know where it was.  It could have been over... It looked like it might have been overseas.  I don't know.  But he... He's up there talking to him and he says, you know, I'm a smart guy.  I did this, I did that.  And I'm the one who told Johnson, he points behind him.  So it must have been some general or somebody.  I don't know.  He said, I'm the one who told Johnson to, uh, oh, he said, I'm a smart guy.  I married Jill and I'm the one who told Johnson to join the Academy or some shit like that.  And then he goes, uh, then it's kind of a silence.  and he goes, you guys go ahead and clap for that.  You stupid bastards.  Hey, that shit was funny, man.  That shit was funny.  And anybody being offended by what he says, you're wrong, man.  Like, who gives a fuck?  I mean, my only problem is... And his camp, Biden's camp, came out saying, oh, you know, he was saying that in jest.  You know, he was just messing around.  He didn't mean it.  And that's probably true.  I mean, as crazy as that old fucker is, I don't know.  I mean, this is back in 2016, so... Now, yeah, he probably totally would have said that shit, not joking around.  But back then, I'm going to go ahead and give him the benefit of the doubt that he was just kidding.  My only problem is if it was the same exact situation, nothing changed except... It was Trump instead of Biden.  You know how these fuckers would have reacted.  There would have been no listening to all.  we were just saying it and just know he hates the troops.  He wants them to die.  That would be the narrative.  That's the part I have a problem with.  I don't care that he called him stupid bastards.  That shit was funny.  If I was there, I would have laughed.  And I'm sure they did too.  It was funny.  It was unexpected to hear that fool sit up there and say, yeah, go ahead and clap for that, you stupid bastards.  Shit was funny.  To call him a bunch of stupid bastards, that was just a unique set of words to choose for that situation.  That shit was funny, man.  I don't have a problem with what he said.  Shit was hilarious.  It's just the hypocrisy.  That's where my problem is.  Because if the shoe were on the orange foot, you know these motherfuckers would lose their minds.  See?  He hates them.  He hates the troops.  So because he said a joke, he hates them and wants them to die.  He wants their mothers and fathers to cry over the loss of their young lives.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  In order for us to fix shit... We have to get back to some basics.  There have to be some non-negotiables, and there has to be a sense of, yeah, I know you were just fucking around.  You know what I mean?  Getting offended over shit people say simply because they're on the opposite side is stupid.  All right?  People joke around.  It was a funny joke.  I know Biden doesn't give us many things to compliment him on, but that shit was funny.  So... Trump rolls out the platinum plan.  This is his plan or a plan to do what exactly?  Now, I don't agree with this whole plan.  I don't.  Some things I like, some things I think are fucking stupid and gonna do more damage than good.  Allow me to elaborate.  So some of the things I like is, number one, he's gonna prosecute Antifa as a terrorist organization.  Finally, that's what they are.  You're intimidating people trying to get your demands met through terrorism, through terrorizing people, through fear.  They are a terrorist organization textbook.  So yes, prosecute them as a fucking terrorist organization.  Do you not prosecute mobsters and shit under the RICO statute?  Because that's... When you do gangster shit, they prosecute you under these gangster rules.  They're acting like a terrorist organization, so prosecute them as such.  That I agree with.  Also, making Juneteenth a national holiday.  I agree with that.  The end of slavery is a big fucking deal.  What is it, over 600,000 men gave their lives for that?  I say we commemorate it.  Call me crazy.  I don't have a problem with Juneteenth being a national holiday.  As long as we get rid of Black History Month.  That's an insult.  It's stupid.  It's a slap in the face to not only people who aren't black, but to black people.  What do they fucking talk about and what do they do during Black History Month?  What, the streaming platforms put some black stories up?  McDonald's tells you about fucking Martin Luther King and George Washington Carver?  Heard it.  Heard the fucking.  I Have a Dream speech 10,000 times.  Fuck Black History Month.  Making Juneteenth a national holiday.  I'm down with that.  Also, school choice.  What was it?  Kim Klesik was on... Man, what was she on?  Maybe she was on Fox or something.  But I saw her giving an interview, and they asked her, they said, is it true that out of 10 schools, they couldn't find one child who was proficient in reading?  Not one.  School choice.  There being no air conditioning during the winter, no AC in the summer, no books, violent-ass campuses.  School choice.  There needs to be school choice.  If the school we live near is not cutting it, we need to go to another one.  Shut that shitty school down or fix it.  Parents should have the option to give their child the best education possible.  Now, you notice the Democrats don't want school choice.  That means an absence of power for them.  They can't have that shit, even if it's at the cost of your child's education.  There needs to be school choice.  The power needs to be with the parents.  We know how to raise our kids better than you.  You're a bunch of incompetent fucks.  Look at your kids.  Do they turn out good?  Where'd they go to school?  I guarantee you they didn't go to these sorry-ass, bullet-ridden fucking schools around here.  Parents need to have the option to give their kids the best shot.  That starts with education.  School choice.  What I don't like is there's things in there that they're going to bolster black business ownership and black home ownership.  Now, I don't like preferential treatment.  I just don't.  What do you mean by bolster black businesses?  Make it easier for them to create businesses?  So are you making it easier for everybody else?  Black home ownership.  So do they get breaks on loans or something?  Or they don't have to do all the paperwork?  Like how do you help that?  I don't like the sound of it.  I don't like one group of people getting help and not another.  Those people that come here from other countries, they work and get their shit.  People in this country, they work to get their shit.  So don't give us something you're not giving everybody else.  If everybody is getting these same benefits, shit, let's do it.  But if it's just black folks, I don't like that.  We've had enough benefits, government.  We've had enough of your help.  $16 trillion spent since the war on poverty.  What has it done?  It shattered the fucking family.  That's what it's done.  Now you got BLM, I'm sorry, CBLM, Certain Black Lives Matter, here to clean up the pieces, to get the stragglers.  That's what the war on poverty has gotten us.  $16 trillion.  20 million dead black babies later.  No, we don't need any more fucking government handouts.  What needs to be done is you need to incentivize people to get married before they have children.  Finish high school.  America is set up so good that all you have to do is not get preggers or get some girl preggers.  Get your diploma from high school and you'll be all right.  You got an idea?  You got a business you want to start?  Go for it.  Incentivize the family to stay together.  That's what the black community needs.  That's what any community that's failing needs.  The family to be repaired.  You can throw all the money you want.  16 trillion, remember?  That's a lot of dead presidents.  That's a lot of greenbacks.  That's a lot of cash, dinero, scratch, and cheese.  That's a whole bunch.  So money is not cutting it.  We need no more social programs.  You can build all the nice centers you want.  If you got a bunch of ghetto ass savages going in there, they're going to fuck that building up.  That's all that's going to happen.  They're not going to walk in and go, oh man, everything's so nice and clean.  Got that new building smell.  I'm going to change my ways.  I'm going to respect other people's property and authority.  You have changed me with this new building.  Hell fuck.  no, that's not going to happen.  Respecting authority and other people's property starts at home.  What'd your parents tell you?  Don't touch things that don't belong to you.  Listen to what I say or there will be consequences.  That's teaching you to respect people and their property.  Not money.  I don't like the sound of this stuff.  I don't like blackness.  Anything with a color in front of it, keep that shit.  Because that means it's only for that group.  That creates animosity.  Get a group of kids, give one of them a lollipop, and sit back and watch the show.  They're gonna hate that little kid.  Same thing on a bigger scale.  Same fucking thing.  Stop giving black folks handouts.  If you're not giving it to everybody, don't give it to anybody.  Allow them to fail.  Not just black folks, anybody.  Stop giving handouts.  Allow people to fail.  If you fail, you just fucking fail.  How's it going to get any worse?  The body count inside and outside of the womb is through the fucking roof for black folks.  After $16 trillion.  Money ain't doing shit.  It's the quality of people, not the quality of things for them to play with.  Fuck that.  I am not a fan of this platinum plan.  Maybe some more details will come out.  Maybe I need to read a little more into it.  But from what I've read so far, I am not a fan of it.  Not the whole thing.  I like school choice.  I like Juneteenth being a national holiday.  I like those little punk pussy motherfuckers being prosecuted as terrorists because they are.  Another thing is the KKK is also supposed to be prosecuted as a terrorist organization.  What KKK?  Oh, you mean those borderline retarded sister fuckers?  The what, all 12 of them?  Fuck them!  That's probably the only good thing the ACLU ever did in the Southern Poverty Law Center was suing the KKK into fucking oblivion.  The KKK is nothing.  Not what they used to be.  I remember in the early 1900s, like I was there, seeing pictures from the early 1900s.  You remember when Margaret Sanger was out there giving speeches before she started Planned Parenthood?  That's another video, you fucking suckers.  Anyway, pictures from the early 20th century of the Klan marching 100,000 strong right down Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.  That Klan is dead.  The ones that did what they did to Emmett Till, they are dead.  Literally and figuratively.  They are no more.  Why the fuck do we need the Klan to be designated as a terrorist organization?  They're nothing.  Antifa, that's the new Klan.  That's the new enforcement arm of the Democrat Party.  That's who we need to focus on.  Not these broke down, dingy hooded motherfuckers.  Suckers, man.  I saw this, I don't know if it was on the History Channel or what, man, a few years back.  It was some militia way back in the fucking woods somewhere and they had all these signs.  No trespassing.  We don't want no niggers here.  Trust me.  Ain't no black people going out there.  So they had this compound and they had this private meeting room and they were going to let the camera crew into their private meeting room.  So one of the members, I don't know if he was of any note, but.  One of the members of this militia, he's like, yeah, yeah, come on in here, man.  We're going to show you our fucking private meeting room.  And believe me, that's not much of an exaggeration from what this fucking moron sounded like.  You know, if you put a camera inside his brain, it would probably just be a half-dead hamster going on a fucking wheel.  real fucking slow, right?  So he goes, you're going to come in our private meeting room.  Hold on.  You got to wipe your feet.  So you look down and this moron is wiping his feet on the Israeli flag, right?  But then his name comes across the bottom of the screen.  And what was his name?  It was something, something Goldberg or green, black.  He was a fucking Jew.  So you're a Jew Klansman wiping your feet on the Israeli flag.  That is a level of stupidity with this new Klan.  Fuck them.  They are no longer a threat.  Let me know what you think in the comment section.  I don't like the entirety of this platinum plan.  We can pick little things out here and there, but some of it, I'm not feeling it.  What I am feeling is getting home to my beautiful wife and kids.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe.
