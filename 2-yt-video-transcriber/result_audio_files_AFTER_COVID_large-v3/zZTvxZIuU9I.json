But unless other Democrats take a page from his book stressing the practical over the theoretical, the universal over the particular, they won't prevail either.  Left but not woke is the Bernie Sanders brand.  If anyone failed to recognize it before, if anybody failed to recognize it before, nobody can miss it now.  Last week, the mega podcaster Joe Rogan endorsed Sanders.  The Sanders campaign tweeted a video of the Rogan endorsement from Sanders' own account.  The tweet then triggered an avalanche of disapproval from other voices in the Democratic coalition.  Rogan is not an ally to the cultural causes that have come to predominate on the contemporary left.  He even mocks many of those causes while also dancing around conspiratorial thinking of the left and right fringes.  9-11 denialism, Obama birtherism, and speculation about dark deeds concerning Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

            "text": "And you know what?  The Rogan endorsement, the way he said it, actually proves why Bernie is the only one who can win, honestly.  Because he wasn't touting any issues that Bernie supports when he said he supported Bernie.  He said Bernie's been consistent.  Bernie's been consistent for 30 years.  He's said the same thing this whole time.  And I want to.  I got to credit somebody who is that consistent.  Now, of course, for establishment liberals, that's horrifying.  John Che wrote an article or he wrote a tweet saying, actually, oh, no, he did write an article.  Actually, it's actually an insult to someone to say they haven't changed in 30 years, because, of course, as a meritocratic liberal elite, the idea of that being nuanced.  Yeah.  The idea of, ooh, always being willing to admit I was wrong.  That's a value.  But what that reads like to regular people is being a fucking snake.  Yes.  And being someone I can't trust. ",
