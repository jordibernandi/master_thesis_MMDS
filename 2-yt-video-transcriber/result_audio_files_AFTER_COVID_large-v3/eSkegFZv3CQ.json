            "text": "So we need to talk.  Ahmaud Arbery is dead because he was a black man.  He was hunted down by two white strangers in broad daylight because he was two things.  He was black and running, which was enough reason for them to grab weapons and get in their truck and chase him down the street and assassinate him in the middle of the day.  Being black and running was Ahmaud's crime.  To some white people, you can't be black and running.  You can't be black and standing outside a store at night.  You can't be black and sitting in your car eating lunch.  You can't be black and playing in a park.  You can't be black and watching TV in your apartment.  For some white people, you can't be black.  For far too many white Americans, such things are probable cause for calls to the police and threats from a distance and physical intimidation and violent executions.  This is the unthinkable reality of the America that we live in.  And in this America, there are only two kinds of white Americans.  There are white racists and white anti-racists.  I'm not talking about white people who profess to be against racism and they feel bad when they see a story like this and then move on with the rest of their day.  I'm not talking about white people who say they're against racism but then endure grotesque racist dinner table diatribes from uncles and sisters and husbands and choose not to speak because they don't want to deal with the blowback at home.  I'm not talking about white people who say they're against racism and then sit through incendiary Sunday sermons from white supremacist pastors and yet find themselves in the very same pews the next Sunday and the Sunday after that.  I'm not talking about white people who claim they're against racism but then absorb vile break room jokes and laugh outwardly outside even though inside they're sick to their stomachs.  I'm not talking about people who say they're against racism and scroll past the most dehumanizing memes and videos from friends and people they've grown up with and refuse to say anything because they don't want the collateral damage that comes from confronting people they know and love.  In the presence of this kind of cancerous hatred, the kind that killed Ahmaud Arbery, the kind that's having a renaissance here in America, there aren't moderate gray spaces to sit comfortably and observe from a distance.  No, this is a stark place of black and white clarity.  You either oppose the inhumanity or you abide it.  You condemn the violence or you're complicit in it.  You declare yourself a fierce and vocal adversary of bigotry or you become its silent ally.  White friends, we're being asked to speak clearly because when we do, we place ourselves alongside people who deserve to get up today and run and stand outside stores and sit in their cars and play in the park and relax in their homes.  And we place ourselves across from the bigots who feel they'll never be held accountable for not wanting black people to do these things.  Now, to be clear, this outward stance doesn't erase our privilege or exempt us from our prejudices or remove the blind spots within us that perpetuate inequality.  Those are realities we're going to have to continually confront in the small and the close and the quiet moments for the rest of our lives.  It doesn't also dismantle systemic racism or the institutional inequalities woven into our nation from which we benefit.  But what our outward declaration will do is to let other white people know where we stand, our neighbors and our pastors and coworkers and family members and social media friends.  It will place us decidedly on the side of black men jogging in their neighborhoods.  It will place us in unequivocal opposition to white men choosing to become judge, jury, and executioner of strangers who've never grown up acknowledging the value of a black life because so few white neighbors and pastors and coworkers and family members and social media friends told them otherwise.  As of today, Ahmaud Arbery's white murderers are still free, and whether they remain free or not, the malignant racism that engineered his death will be showing itself again today.  It will show its inhumanity across tables and in pulpits and in break rooms and on our news feeds and in presidential tweets.  And we who live with the unearned privilege of having children and fathers and sisters who can run and stand outside stores and sit in their cars and play in the park and watch TV in their homes without fearing the taunts and punches and bullets of irrational strangers, we have an obligation to speak explicitly and loudly now.  White Americans need to condemn white racism in America or be guilty of it.  I want to be someone who condemns it. ",
