And this is where, I don't know.  if you remember from our Reddit days, a long time ago, there was a guy on Reddit, on the men's rights subreddit, that his name was EverythingIsRape.  And he would comment on things and he would take it.  through however many degrees of separation he had to go through to get from whatever was said to rape.  And a lot of times he could make a connection in like two or three steps.  You know, you're like, well, I had to bake bread today.  And well, bread is made using yeast.  Yeast infections.  You had your finger in yeast.  Did you ask for consent?  That's rape.  You know, it would be something like.  ridiculous like that.  along those lines of course. ",

            "text": "the whole point of it was to just make fun of the way that feminists do turn everything into commentary about rape.  so What I want to talk about here, because they do the same thing with women most affected, and they did it with the beer virus, is revisit a couple of other instances where they've done that to a ridiculous degree.  For instance, feminists have a habit of, they like to ignore the vast majority of criminal perpetration against strangers and stuff, because most of the victims of stranger crimes are men.  Most of the mugging victims, most of the random murders, most of the people who get shot on a night shift at a place of business because they're getting robbed, that's almost always men that are in those positions and who are less protected.  So feminists want to focus on specifically instances where workplace deaths occur involve a partner killing the female worker.  So her husband comes in and shoots her, her boyfriend comes in and shoots her, or she has an affair in the workplace and somebody kills her.  And the goal there is to, you know, workplace deaths, women most affected, even though the vast overwhelming majority of workplace deaths involve men getting killed on the job.  And usually through some sort of accident, or the employer's neglect of safety conditions and stuff like that.  And they do the same thing.  we have, the classic everybody is pretty well aware of in the men's rights community, the chicanery they've been engaged in with respect to statistics on intimate partner and sexual violence.  And so that's another easy one we can look at.  But they'll do this with everything.  If you look at the citation of how many women are killed by domestic violence, killed by partners, and intimate partner violence, and you find that, actually, it's not just a tiny number.  There's almost as many men killed as there are women.  It's a slightly tinier number, but because we're dealing with two tiny numbers, one of them can be made to look significantly smaller than the other by going by percentages, instead of looking at these two tiny numbers.  or making a statistic like one a week and with men it's one every two weeks or one every week and a half as opposed to one a week.  and that one a week has a lot of play, right?  So they do this not to actually deal with the issues but to figure out a way to portray women as the biggest victims and use this portrayal of women as these huge victims to get changes in law and policy that essentially leave male victims out in the cold and leave accused men vulnerable to infringements on their due process rights and demand resources that are largely paid for by tax dollars that are paid in by, again, men.  So it's an interesting grifting tactic and they use it as a way to make problems look bigger for women than they are and get money without actually taking any measures to solve the underlying problem.

            "text": "What's interesting is I've seen even charity organizations that I thought were not influenced by feminism do similar tactics.  For example, I followed an organization called Stop Prison Rape, which I think became Just Detention International.  When I originally followed Stop Prison Rape, it was started by a man who had been raped in prison.  by another man.  And it had these harrowing accounts of male victims of rape and sexual assault in prison.  And just to get an idea of the statistics, the rate of rape of inmates in prison, of course, in terms of sheer numbers, men are the biggest victims of sexual violence in prisons.  But the way that the numbers fall out is really interesting, because male inmates actually don't rape each other as much as female staff.  are raping male inmates, or female inmates in female detention centers are raping other female inmates.  So in terms of percentages, the largest number of victims are male inmates of female staff, which is astounding, and it's a statistic that nobody pays attention to.  followed by female inmates victimized by other female inmates, and then following at the bottom is male inmates victimized by other male inmates.  And yet these statistics are, you know, nobody knows about this.  And I watched just prison rape go, or stop prison rape, as it became just Detention International, start to drop.  presenting male victimhood and start focusing on the least likely arrangement of rape, which is a male jailer with a female inmate.  And they would start to find those stories and start putting them as bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger focus.  And the male victims started to recede in importance and almost disappear in favor of of the version of sexual assault in prisons that's least likely to occur, but I suppose the world cares about more.  And I'm watching this, I'm thinking, wow, and it was a slow shift over time, because I was following Stop Prison Rape since about 2003, and I was just gobsmacked by that.  And then I noticed... the Innocence Project, which is about getting mostly men who are falsely incarcerated out of jail, I've noticed the Innocence Project is going the same route.  It's starting to focus on women.  And I'm like, at this point in time, I used to support the Innocence Project, but I unsubscribed from their email list, and I am thinking I'm not going to continue to support them.  because they're going the same route and what I know the end end result of this is is that male victimhood will disappear the funds for helping men will disappear they will focus more and more on women who are harmed by the system.  and this is a rot that I see in a lot of charities.  and once this happens I know that it's more about the money than it is about the problem.

            "text": "And what seems to happen is the same thing that happened during Erin Pitsy's beginning of the shelter movement in Chiswick, UK, where she got something started.  She put in all the blood, sweat, and tears.  She was the little red hen, right?  She's the one that gathered the wheat and ground it to flour and made the bread and put it in the oven and got it out of the oven.  And then everybody else came along and wanted to eat.  And it was, feminists came rushing in when they found that there was money to be had, when there were funds to be raised on the basis of, we have this problem and it requires a treatment.  And as soon as feminists came in and started doing that, the two things that happened were the problem became a female-only problem.  You weren't allowed to talk about men's experience of the problem.  You were only allowed to talk about men as a cause of the problem.  And you weren't allowed to talk about women as a cause.  You were only allowed to talk about women as victims of the problem.  The second thing that happened was no cure was allowed to be had for this problem.  You had to maintain a system of consistent and constant treatment that had to be perpetually funded And if there were ways to reduce the problem, it was verboten to talk about those.  And you see that with every issue where, particularly if part of the cure, part of the ways of solving this problem, basically, or part of the approaches that are needed to reduce the incidence of the problem involve changing women's behavior.  But even if It involves, to a degree, changing men's behavior.  We see this idea that you can't solve this problem.  You just have to perpetually fund treatment of it.  And it would be like if a cure was discovered for cancer.  and the drug companies came along and started demonizing anybody who provided that cure, right?  Let's say the cure was made public, everybody knows the cure, but they decided to make the cure immoral.  You can't do that because you're targeting cancer patients.  and suddenly, you know... Be unbelievably dishonest. ",
