            "text": "In my hands, I have the congressional record of Monday, June the 9th, 1969.  Dr.  D.M.  MacArthur, Deputy Director of Research and Technology.  Dr.  B. Harris, Deputy Assistant Director, Chemical Technology.  Dr.  K.C.  Emerson, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army.  Brigadier General W.S.  Stone,  Jr.,  Director of Material Requirements, Headquarters, United States Army Material Command, Colonel J.J.  Osick, Chief Systems and Requirements Division.  And now we have them before the Senate Appropriations Committee.  And they're talking on chemical and biological warfare.  In 1969, In the testimony, they go on to talk about developing a virus.  I want you to look at this.  Now I'm telling you where it is, you go find it.  Monday, June the 9th, 1969, chemical and biological warfare.  before the Senate Appropriations Committee.  They're talking about germ warfare.  They're talking about chemical warfare or biological warfare.  And they talk about developing, listen, a virus that would weaken the immune system.  It's here in the record.  They were asking for $10 million for research in 1969.  Ten years later, the disease shows up.  But it shows up, they say, from some green monkey in Africa.  In Uganda, the jewel of East Africa.  Uganda, the Congo, or what is called Zaire.  In Central Africa today, whole tribes are being wiped out with AIDS.  And they're not homosexuals.  And they're not intravenous drug users.  They are the victims of silent death from a wicked scientist of evil.  Wait, no, no, I don't want you to clap.  I just want you to think, because we're going to think tonight.  And when I leave, you can call me anything you want to.  but deal with what I say.  This is in the congressional record.  You remember the Tuskegee experiment where they infected hundreds of black men with the most virulent form of syphilis and never told them that they had given it to them.  You remember the polio epidemic And back in the early 60s, we were going getting polio shots.  You don't know what the hell you're getting.  Now, it was Dick Gregory who exposed the fact that millions of Americans were injected with a polio contaminant called SV-40.  Which was cancer itself.  And now many of us who had no connection to cancer.  Now cancer is a number one killer in our community.  Black men, the number one killer of black men is prostate cancer.  White men too, but black men more.  We're being dealt with.  And we don't even know it.  You run out of Mississippi.  You ran out of Georgia.  You ran out of Alabama and Louisiana.  You either gave your land away, sold your land away, neglected your land.  Now you are dependent on the merchants of death in these beautiful big conglomerate food service.  You buy the food.  You don't know how long it's been dead.  What chemicals are used in it?  You know nothing about it.  You don't know how it reacts in your body.  You just eat it.  Then you go and you drink whiskey and wine.  You eat pork.  You eat all of the hormones that they inject into beef and lamb and pork to fatten it up quick.  You don't know the results of it.  You take steroids to get big muscles.  You're so sick.  You're poisoned right now, dying with poison all inside of you.  They don't mind killing a few white folks just to get at you.  So white folks are dying with AIDS.  They put a stigma on the gay and lesbian community.  It didn't start with homosexual behavior.  It was spread like that through experimentation in prisons.  They sent all these philanthropists to Africa.  I'm going to inject the people against smallpox and diphtheria.  These Africans living over there for centuries, man.  Tens of hundreds of thousands of years, they're still living.  Now they're dying from some unknown disease.  Why?  Because if America does not control the rich strategic metals that are found in Africa in the 21st century, she will not be a world power militarily.  Somebody got to control it.  So Africa is being set upon now.  Even as we speak, the conspiracy is being wrought.  So here now we're dying of AIDS.  And we found in Kenya a black doctor who developed the best remedy for AIDS.  But because he's black, they will not admit it into this country in wholesale numbers.  Low dose interferon.  We got the exclusive rights to distribute it now.  the nation.  And we have doctors now with AIDS patients taking what is called Immunex.  We have to rename it because some other company here has the name Immunex, so we call it Immuviron.  But 97% of those that we're treating with AIDS are recovering now.  And we don't care what your color is, what your religion is.  If you got AIDS and we can help you, we'll help you out of it.  But mainly black people are suffering from this. ",
