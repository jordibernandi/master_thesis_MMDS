You know, there's this weird thing, I think, actually, about a couple, but the thing about Donald Trump, this weird thing, he's got this weird obsession.  with wanting to get rid of whatever President Obama and Vice President Biden created.  It's just this weird obsession, right?  We're talking about 8 million people who have a pre-existing condition called COVID.  And they're trying to get rid of it.  So there are very clear choices here.  And the bottom line is I do believe And Joe and I are actually particularly proud.  I was doing some interviews earlier.  We're proud of the fact that Arden is a campaign that has probably built one of the broadest coalitions of any campaign in recent history.

They're really showing themselves to do really well.  Come on, man. ",
