            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Yerushalayim, from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in prophetic and exciting times.  The veil is being lifted in Israel, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews are being saved like never before, in the midst of the coronavirus, in the midst of the world panic, in the midst of Israel being attacked.  in the midst of the demonic outpouring god is moving hearts god's holy spirit is hovering over the nation of israel.  proverbs chapter nine verse ten.  the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the holy one is understanding.  the only way anybody can overcome that fear is by fearing the Lord, Yeshua, Jesus.  Greater is he in us than the one in the world.  This is why it's so important that we continue to preach the gospel.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11, 26.  2 Chronicles 7, verse 14, If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.  The only way the people in Israel and around the world, the nations, can be healed is by calling on the name of the King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus Yeshua.  As of the making of this video, many cities and settlements in Israel have been closed down from 7 p.m.  until 5 a.m The reason is the religious people here in Israel, the rabbis and the Orthodox cities and settlements are gathering together in the evening in large amounts before the Feast of the Lord.  The Israeli government says you have to wear a mask.  in public.  But children are not required to wear a mask.  But we're seeing something new right now.  Not only are the people putting masks on, but the Orthodox Jews are so scared, are so panicking right now, that they're even forcing their children to put on masks, something that the government does not require.  Our ministry has been preaching the gospel all through Israel and all through Yerushalayim, Jerusalem, asking the people, why are your children also putting masks on if the government doesn't require?  Don't you have enough trust in the God of Israel?  Not everyone is telling their children to do this, but the numbers are increasing as the panic grows.  We've been sharing with the people that are in panic, Psalms 56 verse 3, When I'm afraid, I put my trust in you.  We don't put our trust in a mask, and we don't put our trust in governments.  We put our trust only in Yeshua, Jesus, God.  In Hebrew, it reads like this, But the word ira in Hebrew not only means fear, it has a much deeper meaning.  In Hebrew, it means fear, it means panic, and it means anxiety.  But it also means the fear of the Lord.  The same word found in Proverbs 9, verse 10, the fear of the Lord.  is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.  So we can see that this word in the book of Psalms 56 verse 3 has multiple meanings to it when we understand the Hebrew.  We're using this Bible verse to preach the gospel here in Israel in a time of panic.  We began our day in prayer and started our outreach in Jerusalem in the Old City area.  An Orthodox man and his children were walking with masks.  As the team were praying, I walked over to them.  I introduced myself.  He introduced himself as Eliezer.  a cantor in a synagogue in Jerusalem.  In Hebrew, a cantor is a chazan, basically like the elder of the congregation and the one who reads from the Torah scroll and sings, the worship leader.  The cantor is also the one responsible for training boys to be bar mitzvahed at age 13.  It's a different position of a rabbi.  I told Eliezer, that is a very interesting position you have, worshiping in the synagogue.  reading the scroll.  He was very happy and said, yes, I've studied this for many, many years, and I've been to Cantor there for over nine years.  I then asked Cantor Eliezer, can I ask you a question?  He said, yes.  I noticed your children are wearing masks.  According to the law of the Israeli government, they're not required to wear masks.  What's the reason they're wearing masks?  After all, you are a cantor in the synagogue.  Surely you know the God of Israel.  Eliezer was caught off guard.  The question puzzled him.  Finally, he spoke and said, I'm on the way to the Kotel area to pray with my children.  I then asked Cantor Eliezer again, I understand that you're on the way to the Kotel area.  What does it have to do with your children wearing masks?  Instead of answering my question, he asked me a question.  What is it relevant if they wear a mask or not?  I answered, Eliezer, it's very relevant.  If you believe in God and you're a cantor and you're having your children wear masks when the government doesn't require it, it means that you don't trust God enough.  Eliezer answered, but I do trust God.  That's why I'm going to the Kotel area to pray that my family will not be infected by this coronavirus.  I then asked Eliezer, when you go to the synagogue on the Sabbath or in the middle of the week and you read from the scroll and sing, do you wear a mask?  He said, no.  Do the people in your congregation wear a mask?  He said, no.  Why not?  Does the coronavirus know the difference between a synagogue or the outside street?  He said, because it's the house of God.  I then told Eliezer, so this means that you trust God only in a synagogue.  You don't trust him outside of a synagogue.  Are you scared?  Are you frightened?  Eliezer said, yes, I'm frightened.  I'm scared.  I then turned the Bible to Psalms 56 verse 3 and read together with Eliezer as his children were listening.  When I'm afraid, I put my trust in you.  And in Hebrew, The word ira, not just fear, but the fear of the Lord.  I then told Eliezer, it's good that you're praying to God.  You're a worship leader in the synagogue.  Let's continue to read Psalms 56, verse 4.  In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust, I shall not be afraid.  What can flesh do to me?  As a worship leader, you should stand on this word.  You praise God.  What can flesh do to you?  Don't be afraid of the coronavirus.  Don't put your trust in a mask.  Put your trust only in God.  God has called you to worship, but to worship him in spirit and in truth.  Do you know what the truth is?  And the truth can only do one thing, and that is set you free.  I then turn the Bible to 2 Chronicles 7 verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.  You see, God wants you to pray to him.  He wants you to humble yourself, but he wants you to seek his face.  Do you know God's face?  Do you want to be healed, not just from this demonic outpouring of the coronavirus, but from all sickness of this world?  Eliezer said, yes, it was time for the full gospel.  Your heart is telling you to seek his face.  Just like Melech David, King David, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.  Psalms 27, verse 8.  My heart says of you, seek his face.  Your face, Lord, I will seek.  There is only one way to turn to the true light.  I turn the Bible to Psalms 27, verse 1, and read together with Eliezer.  The Lord is my light and my salvation.  Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the stronghold of my life.  Whom shall I be afraid?  And in Hebrew, it reads like this.  The Lord is my light and my Yeshua.  Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the stronghold of my life.  Of whom shall I be afraid?  Because the word in Hebrew for salvation is Yeshua, Jesus.  We can see here the deity that Yeshua is God.  I then asked Eliezer, do you know who Yeshua is?  The Lord is my light and my Yeshua.  Eliezer was silent.  Praise Yeshua.  The power of the Holy Spirit was working.  I then turned to Eliezer and said, the fact that we met today is a divine appointment.  The fact that you had your children, wear masks, is God is calling you not to be in fear.  The fact that your name is Eliezer, which actually means in Hebrew, Eli, God, Ezel, help, God help me.  And God today wants to help you with eternal life.  Eliezer, the Lord help me.  in English known as Lazarus.  And as believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, we know the account of Lazarus in the Bible.  And God helped Lazarus, Eliezer.  Eliezer could not move.  He could not speak.  I told him, Yeshua.  is the messiah who died on the tree on the cross for your sins.  he rose on the third day and by his blood all who trust in him and believe shall have eternal life and salvation and that is the true light.  the lord is my light and my yeshua.  whom shall i fear?  yes you need to pray to the lord.  yes you need to worship the lord but no one makes it to the father only through yeshua.  he wanted to leave and he couldn't.  it was too late.  the gospel has already been preached.  the power of the holy spirit was hovering.  his children were listening.  I told Eliezer, I too wear a mask because the law requires, but I don't put my trust in a mask.  Trust in Yeshua today.  Believe that He rose from the dead today.  Believe that He is God, that He is the Mashiach, the Messiah.  I then opened Psalms 18 verse 28.  You, Lord, keep my lamp burning.  My God turns my darkness into light.  And we know that the light is Yeshua, Jesus.  There is no other way to keep your lamp burning.  I then told Eliezer, God loves you so much.  He drew you here today to hear the message of salvation.  We're approaching right now the feasts of the Lord.  Now is the time, as the shofar, the trumpet is blowing in Israel, that you hear the call to salvation.  The true trumpet, Mashiach Yeshua.  Listen to the voice of the trumpet, Yeshua Jesus.  Do you want to hear the joyful sound?  I then opened the Bible to Tehillim, Psalms 89 verse 15 and read out loud, Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound, who walk, O Lord, in the light of your presence.  So you can see that God is light and his voice is a shofar.  And the only way to hear that joyful sound and be blessed is through Messiah Yeshua.  There is no other way.  Call on His name today, and you and your household shall be  saved.\".  I gave Eliezer contact information, told him to seek the Lord and not be afraid, humble himself, and God will hear from heaven.  He took the contact information, praise Yeshua, and left nervous.  One thing is certain, Eliezer, his family, and all those who heard the gospel will never be the same again.  And for this we give all the glory to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Jesus Yeshua.  And for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that the word in Hebrew for salvation is Yeshua, Jesus.  Her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  Continue to stand together with us in prayer for the salvation of Israel and the nations.  as we continue to work the harvest together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Yeshua, Jesus, is Lord God.  Amen. ",
