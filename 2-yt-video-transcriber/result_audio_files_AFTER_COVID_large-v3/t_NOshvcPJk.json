And if you don't know, debt slavery is where families have to borrow money.  And it's normally in a medical emergency.  And when they borrow the money, they enslave themselves in these brick kilns to make bricks just for a few dollars a day to pay back the loans.  It can sometimes take generations to pay back the loans.  So we see the headlines, but our team see the reality of this.  And what we're about to show you is first-hand video evidence of this terrible, terrible situation.  And it's been recorded just a few days ago.  So let's take a look. ",

But to be honest, people like looking at this, you know, I really want to do something, you know, Chris really wants to do something.  And we have done this six or seven times before, you know, we was thinking about, you know, giving them like a huge food path, like for the family, like 40 kilograms.  And, you know, we've been advised that that would, you know, be the best way to help these people.  So we just wanted to sort of throw it to you, you guys, And, you know, just, you know, I don't know what you guys think, you know, because we got two options, haven't we, Chris?  You know, we can either do nothing and walk away or we can, you know, we can just ask the people, ask the viewers, you know, do you want to do something?  So, but.  I think you agree with me, Chris.  We want to do something, don't we? ",

And, you know, like Rez said, we've helped the Pakistani people who have really suffered through the COVID lockdown and obviously flooding.  that has hit certain areas of Pakistan over the last couple of years and also just through poverty.  we help these with food packages.  so this is just another one of those circumstances where we want to help them again and I just want to show you this list on the screen And as you can see, guys, a lot of the essentials there.  Like I said, there's 40 kilos of food there, or about 90 pounds worth.  So there's a lot of food, and it should last them a good few weeks.  And it's a family of four, five people or so, and then we're supplying about 115 families.  So it's a lot of food, and it really, really does help them out, considering they earn such little money per day at the brick kilns. ",

This is to the absolute penny.  It's $52.91 per family.  And there's 115 families.  So it does add up.  It really does add up to $6,084.57.  Help everyone and that's probably about six or seven hundred people in total.  So it's just up to you people if you're up for us if you you know, if you want to help.  We've got the teams.  You've got the.  you know, we've got the logistics.  We last mission We turned it around pretty fast.  It was about a week where we showed you the update video the following week.  So we've done this yes six or seven times and to be honest people we just want to show you a happy video, you know smiley faces and Because these guys are really, really deserving.  And just underline, they're Christians.  They're Christians.  They're our brothers and sisters in Christ.  And the Lord Jesus teaches us to love our neighbor.  And this is the greatest way to love our neighbor is to see their need and to meet their need.  And their need right now is to give them a helping hand with the food.
