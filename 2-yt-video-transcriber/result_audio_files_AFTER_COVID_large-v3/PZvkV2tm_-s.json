            "text": "Well, because there's three, when you look at a balance sheet here, okay.  What most people have in there are 401ks and cash.  And I don't know if you know this, but the federal reserve, the treasury, the T-bills is how they steal your wealth.  You know, every time you put your money in a treasury bill, That's how they steal your wealth.  So a treasure bill is a thief.  So that's why I say savers are losers.  Now, the reason I like gold, silver, and Bitcoin is because they're outside the federal system.  I've always been kind of a rebel.  I don't want to be an insider.  I want to be outside the Fed and the treasury and the banking system.  So every time I operate with gold, silver, or Bitcoin in a crypto like Ethereum, I'm outside their system.  So the reason silver is the best, I track it every day.  I've been buying silver since 1964 and gold since 1973.  I'm a multimillionaire in gold and silver, the real stuff.  And I've also taken a silver mine public through an IPO in Toronto Stock Exchange.  And I took a gold mine out of China through an IPO public in Toronto also.  But the Chinese confiscated.  because I've made too much money.  I don't like Chinese, but anyway.  But the whole point here is that gold and silver are God's money.  They've been here since the earth was formed.  The US dollar will be long gone before gold and silver.  It will be long gone before gold and silver.  And Bitcoin is people's money.  Again, it's outside the central bank system.  So I'm a student of economics and all that.  Central bank is same as communism because a centrally controlled economy is communism.  So a central bank is part of a communist system.  So the reason I have gold, silver, and Bitcoin is I'm operating out.  Now silver is still 50% below its all time high.  So when gold just went up to 2000, it dropped down to about 1900 today.  But when gold takes off, silver will follow.  So what they say is gold knocks on the door, but when the door opens, silver goes through it.  So my biggest gain is going to be through silver now, at this time.  You know, five years ago, it may be different.  So for a person without any money, a silver US Eagle, silver, it's about 25 bucks.  I don't know anybody who can't afford 25 bucks.  But the people who can't are people who are saving U.S.  dollars or yen or euro or pesos or, you know, whatever they say.  Paper money is fake money.  And that's why I wrote this one here.  Fake, fake money, fake teachers and fake assets.  And that's my whole background is actually economics.  I'm not an economist.  So I love gold and silver and Bitcoin because they operate outside what I consider a totalitarian system called the United States. ",

I don't like the stock market because I've taken companies public.  You know, either you're an insider or you're an outsider.  So anybody who's got a stock bond, mutual fund, or ETF, or a bond, you're an outsider.  I only invest in the inside.  So that's why I like real estate.  And that's why I like starting my own companies.  So if you're going to hold, it depends.  You can buy, I don't recommend it, but you can buy mining shares And mining shares are higher leverage, but they're paper.  But I've taken two companies public.  I don't test it.  I mean, I know the stuff.  I know it's manipulated.  I know how they manipulate it.  And that's why I'm kind of spooky.  But I started, I wrote about it in fake.  I bought my first gold coin in Hong Kong because in 1973, it was illegal for an American to own gold.  So my carrier group sailed into Hong Kong And while other guys were chasing the wild woman in Hong Kong, I was in the streets looking for gold.  And I found a South African Krugerrand for about 50 bucks.  And today that South African, I still have it.  It's in storage in Switzerland.  That South African Krugerrand is probably about 2,500 bucks.  And then I started collecting silver coins back in 1964.  So I just, I have, I don't want to get public too young, but there was a, you know, Donald Duck, and there was Scrooge McDuck.  And Scrooge McDuck always had this gold and stuff like this.  That was my hero. ",
