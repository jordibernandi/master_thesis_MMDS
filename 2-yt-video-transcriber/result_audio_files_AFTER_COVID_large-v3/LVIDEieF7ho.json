Other than subjective feelings of meaning and importance, atheism implies we will never get objective data on the matter.  Atheism simply fails to capture a true or higher meaning.

Okay, I've taken the green screen down because what I'm about to do may well interfere with it.  And what am I about to do?  Something I haven't done in a very long time.  You see, while I was making this video, a bunch of packages arrived.  And so it's time for... An unboxing video!  Believe it or not, like a year or two ago, I used to do unboxing videos all the time because for some reason you evil geniuses kept sending me stuff and... well... Truth is, I started feeling a little weird about it.  It... They were some of my most-watched videos, but it's not my usual content, and I started to feel a bit like a freeloader, and so I tried to move them to my secondary channel, but nobody watched, and, well, the whole idea just sort of petered out.  I don't know.  If you want to see me keep doing unboxing videos, let me know in the comments.  Up to you.  This actually arrived a couple of days ago.  It says TANSTAFL, which is a reference to the Robert Heinlein book The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  It's an acronym.  that means there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.  A sentiment that I understand and agree with, even if I don't think it's a philosophy to live by.  There was no note, no idea who to thank, but whoever you were, thank you.  That said, someone else seems to have bought nearly a third of the stuff off of my Amazon wishlist, which, number one, is awesome, and number two, it gives me an opportunity to do something I love but haven't done in ages.  Okay, let's open this box.  I think I know what's in it based on the weight.  There we go.  And I'm wrong.  It's not what I thought.  It is, in fact, a book.  This is, what is it, book six in the Hilo series, which is by a guy named Judd Winick, with whom I am Facebook friends.  Awesome guy.  He was on The Real World at one point, and he's written for a lot of comics.  This is technically for kids.  It's kind of like a sanitized version of The Adventures of Barry Ween Boy Genius.  And I really enjoy it, even though the age range or the intended audience is a little bit younger than me.  But then, hell, sometimes I think I'm just an overgrown kid anyway.  So let's see who sent this.  If anybody, if they left a note.  Yes, someone left a note.  It says here, hi Kate, enjoy your gift.  Also, oh, I don't want to say, it says also send something, and I don't know, maybe it's in this box, but I want to save it for a surprise.  It's from someone named Vonrek.  Vonrek, Vonrek, Vonrek.  I don't know, V-O-N-R-E-K.  Either way, thank you very much for this.  I'm going to enjoy it.  And now... The bigger box, much lighter than the other one.  It makes me wonder what the heck's in here.  Can't possibly contain all of the items that I know are sent.  Look at me all ripping, ripping with this box here.  All right, there we go.  What have we got here?  I don't know, and there does not appear to be a note.  This does not look like... Has more than one person bought me stuff?  I don't know, but let's see.  Okay, well, cutting that, and opening it up.  What on earth?  This doesn't look like something... What on earth is this?  Socks?  Did someone literally get me socks?  That's crazy pants, but okay.  Socks.  Why not?  This was definitely not on my wish list, but socks.  Okay.  Well, whoever you are, thank you.  I think there's a lot of these here.  Yeah, is there really no note?  Oh, I flung the box.  I'll go look in a second, but I didn't see a note.  okay kitty.  so uh yeah oops columbia stop bashing that.  okay i know you love the microphone.  stop nuzzling the micro columbia.  oh i love my cat but sometimes i need to murder her anyway.  um yeah.  so according to my wish list because it says there's other stuff coming that's not what i've opened.  so i guess the next time there's a uh a video i'll have to oh my gosh.  Well, anyway, the next time there's a video, I'll have to open those too.  Like I say, let me know if you want to see me unbox more stuff.  Maybe videos unto themselves.  I don't know.  It's like totally up to you guys because, you know, you're my audience.  Anyway, until next time, fellow space travelers.  Richard Dawkins.  Damn it. ",
