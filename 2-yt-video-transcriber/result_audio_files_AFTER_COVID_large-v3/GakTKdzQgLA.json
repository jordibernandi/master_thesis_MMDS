            "text": "You see, Pastor Ray talks about this.  He says, we need in life a good balance of challenges and support.  challenges.  we all want challenges.  some of us are here.  we're back to the gym in January back to the gym in January or when it opens again or we're working out.  we're doing something.  we want a challenge in life.  we want an educational challenge.  we want a promotion.  we want a career challenge in life.  I'm going to ask you a simple question after 2020 does anybody need any more challenges?  I am overdosing on challenges right now.  But I'm going to ask you the question, does anyone need any more support?  My hand's in the air, everybody.  We all need the right level of support.  Where does that support come from?  I'm going to tell you this.  This is it, everybody.  It comes from godly friendships.  Now you might say to me, I've got a friend in Jesus.  Now that's wonderful, but that's just the name of a hymn, everybody.  Let's get to the real world.  Jesus wants to be your friend, but he wants you to have great friends as well.  He wants you to be connected.  That's why here at Bayside we say get in a group.  At the moment maybe you're not comfortable with physical groups.  Get in an online group.  I'm serious.  Text the word groups to 56316.  Get yourself in a group.  It's your group that's going to support you and is going to look after you.  The book of Ecclesiastes says this.  Ecclesiastes 4, 9 to 10.  And often we use this at a wedding.  You can read this at a wedding, but this is a life.  This is a group's text or a verse.  Two are better than one because they have good return for their labor.  If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.  But pity the one who falls and has no one to help them up.  You need people in your life that are going to support you.  A number of years ago, I had a friend here in the United States.  I wasn't living in the United States.  We had friends.  And we were just like, we were crazy about these people, loved them a lot.  They've been over to Ireland quite a bit.  And they went through enormous grief in their life.  Their oldest boy, six years old, died of a brain tumor.  And it was just such a difficult time walking with them and taking them through that.  And People, you've got to know this, that when you go through trauma like that, it tests everything in your life.  And it really tested their marriage.  And someone gave me a call.  I remember with Ireland, the time difference.  I was in the evening in Ireland and said, have you heard about this couple?  They've separated.  They've separated.  I was heartbroken.  I was heartbroken.  But do you know what I thought to myself?  They are not going to separate.  They are not going to leave each other.  Not on my watch.  It's not going to happen.  And so I hunted him down.  I mean, I started calling everyone and he had changed his cell and I thought, I'm gonna find it.  I was like FBI at that moment.  I was like CIA.  I was like Sherlock Holmes.  I was gonna get his number.  And eventually I got his number.  He answers, he's like driving across America at this point.  And he answers, I said, it's me.  And he went, oh, bad news, travels fast.  I said, no, I'm fast.  Good friends travel fast.  I said, what can we do to help?  Oh, I think it's finished.  I said, I don't think it's finished.  it's not over.  I said, I'm going to put a deal to you.  And he went, what?  I said, what happens if you leave America for three months?  I'll get you a home in Ireland.  I'll get your other kid into your school and you come over here and we're going to love on you.  We're going to give you the most support.  You have been through trauma.  You need cared for.  You need the best counselors, the best supporters, and we will take care of everything financially.  I had no money to do it, but I've just said, we will take care of everything financially.  he said she'll never do it.  I said what if I call her?  I called her.  she said I'll do it.  within three weeks they were in Ireland.  their kid was in a school their marriage was rescued and they are still together to this day and in full-time ministry.  I'm telling you need good friends around you.  you need good friends around you people. ",
