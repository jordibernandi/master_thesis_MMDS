And I was like, I don't need to take dance lessons.  And then finally, when I was five, my mom was like, I see something there.  I think we need to put her in dance.  So she put me in dance at five.  just like a little recreational studio, like close to our house.  Like we did like one dance a year, like it wasn't anything.  And we had been really big fans of the show.  We watched every single season and I was a huge fan.  So she, I was like six and a half, I think.  And we like started again at the studio and she was like, I think we're gonna pull her and take her to Abby's.  And as soon as she took me to Abby's, Abby was like, you are mine, you're a ballerina and I'm gonna make you into something amazing.  And the following year is when I got casted to Dance Moms.  So it was like, my mom was like, wow.  Like, cause she said the Lord really showed her she needs to be somewhere else.  Like there's something there that I can see.  And she said, you wouldn't be here if I hadn't listened.  So that was really, really cool. ",

And my little brother, who's six, is always in the toy section, and he loves, Mark Hall loves Avengers.  So we would always see this, like, Doctor Strange, I think his name's Doctor Strange, and he literally looks just like Mark Hall.  So I took a picture of it, and I, like, DM'd it to him, and I was like, hi, like... My name's Sarah.  I just wanted to share this with  you.\".  And he sent back, he was like, I've been praying for you.  I'm like, you're praying for me?  What?  But that was like, I was fangirling.  I was freaking out.  And that was almost two years ago.  And then it led into, he was like, what do you have going on?  And I would tell him performances or dance competitions or basically anything.  And he was like, I'm praying for you.  Hope that you do well and all this stuff.  and then he was like.  when he announced he was going on tour He was like well you need to be my like celebrity guest at like you're the Pittsburgh City.  And I was like oh my gosh like yes like.  and he was like you can come backstage and meet the bands and all this stuff.  And then like one thing led to another and we like damned him We're like.  would it be okay like if she danced?  and he was like oh my gosh.  Yes.  Let's see.  I was like I What?  Because in 2017, when the On My Soul video came out with a single ballerina, I came to my mom and dad and I said, I wanna do this.  This is something that I would wanna do with my life and my ministry and my career with dance.  And they were like, that's a big deal.  But the fact two years later that it happened, it came into existence was so crazy.  And we had told him and he was like, let's do On My Soul.
