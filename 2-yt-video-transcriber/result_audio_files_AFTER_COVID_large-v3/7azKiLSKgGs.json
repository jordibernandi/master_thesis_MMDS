            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Bridehop with the Unboxing Authority Liberty YouTube channel and I'm also on Twitch and I've got this product here.  It is called, well it's actually a starlight, a Bluetooth speaker starlight, but it says bring a romantic starry night.  So maybe you live in the big city and or you're stuck indoors or whatever and you just can't see the stars and you want a starry night indoors.  This is for that and so much more.  This is for any occasion.  So you can use this in your game room.  You can use it for a starlight dinner, a romantic dinner.  You can use it for ambient light behind your TV or wherever you want.  You can use it for relaxation, nightlight or home party or disco party anywhere.  You could take this with you and disco anywhere.  and cannot leave the balcony.  Veins fall apart, the center and the bone.  Their energy is loosed upon the wound.  Blood imprisons.  It has a built-in speaker and it has the starlight thing.  Now it has several different modes for any kind of setting that you're in.  So we're going to try this out today.  I know it works with Alexa and with the Google thing and Bluetooth.  I think it might also have an audio input.  We'll take a look and see.  So let's get this open here.  This might be kind of fun to use in my gaming videos and stuff because you're supposed to use it in your game room.  It has a very big, thick instruction manual for most products.  So that's a good thing.  We like lots of instructions.  So that's very good in lots of different languages.  Here we have what appears to be a small remote control.  It's not too small or too big, and it's very lightweight.  I'm sure the batteries will probably weigh more than this does.  It takes two AAA batteries, which actually look big because the remote's so small, which is kind of funny.  Yeah, I don't see that it comes with batteries yet.  We'll have to see if it does.  You can use this to answer calls, apparently, because there's a microphone button.  On the remote, I don't know if there's a microphone in the remote.  It looks like infrared, so there's probably not.  And we have a laser light apparently in this because it says laser.  Oh, no, that's on and off, I think.  There's two different buttons here for on and off, so I'll have to figure that out.  All right, so here's what this looks like up close.  Again, here's your control buttons on the front for going backwards, forwards, volume, up and down, where you aim the remote control.  This looks like a microphone up here, and this is your USB input, USB type C, on-off Wi-Fi.  your usb flash drive port or you could use a micro sd card or sd or anything you know solid state that you can plug in here.  and then you've got your digital volume up and down right there.  you've got a laser lamp output here for laser show apparently and then the star light thing up there and on both sides you have a Bluetooth speaker for stereo sound.  So again, this is very awesome.  Now with all the abilities and the power that this thing has, I'm wondering what the voltage is of the USB.  Let's take a look.  And this one says that it is just using 5 volts at 2 amps.  So that's pretty awesome because that means it's going to work with your power bank or anything.  So you can disco everywhere like it says.  You can have a disco dance party in the middle of the shopping mall if you think that's a good idea.  Alright, so here's what it looks like when it's just running, and now I'm going to show you the effect it has on the ceiling.  So you can push red, it'll turn off and on the red.  You can press green and it will turn green on and off as well.  And of course the same with blue and white.  But apparently, unless the app does otherwise, you can only have two color combinations on at the same time.  And we'll go ahead and turn the green off for a minute so I can show you the lasers going on and off.  Let's see if I can turn off the white light for a minute.  Can I do that?  Yes, I can.  Okay, so here's our laser pattern.  that's in the background.  And so if I push the laser button, you can see it's fading and doing things all on its own there, fading in and out.  I'm going to push the laser button, we can shut that off, and then we can go ahead and turn on just red, or just green, or just blue, or just white, and then we can do, I think, any combination of two colors at one time.  This is probably, if I can do it here, this is probably your romantic color here, or just the red, or whatever, and you can turn your laser lights back on, your star light, laser light, and then you've got the red and green.  And you can get red, green, and blue at the same time with the lasers.  So while I was demonstrating this, there were two women looking at it.  They thought it looked nice, which is what the package says that it's advertised for.  So it definitely works for that.  And you do get that nice sound coming out of it.  I'll tell you what, I will aim the camera at the device so you guys can hear what it sounds like.  And I'll play some soothing music from TechnoAXE.  Okay, so here's the music.  There's a happy little track for your happy lights.  It's called Happiest Robot.  So it does have some depth to it, depending on the tracks you play.  There is some bass tone to it, if that's what you're looking for.  But of course, the EQ app works by removing what you don't want.  So if you want more bass, it's going to remove highs, and it doesn't add to the sound.  But, you know, if you're using an app on your phone or whatever, which, of course, then you have more control over the sound than if you just plug a chip into it or something like that.  And, of course, also you can choose what music to listen to.  And it works with Alexa and the Google Home stuff as well.  So, obviously, you could choose, you know, tell it what to play and all that sort of thing.  So, yeah.  All in all, it's a very good device, and I was very surprised with the value of this device because it's a lot more than I expected.  I thought it was just a starlight, but it comes with all this stuff.  And you do have to remember, it is only working on 5 volts, 2 amps of power, and you've got a green laser beam.  You've got all this light coming out of here, two lights at once, plus the laser beam.  And then you've got a stereo... stereo sound coming out of it as well, two speakers.  So at 5 volts, 2 amps, I think they're pushing the potential of this thing, what it can do.  And the power brick here, I was worried it might get hot earlier.  It's slightly warm.  So I think this is definitely maxing it out.  Now I could take it back home and I have a power supply I've been given to review.  that will tell me the amperage if we want to know how much power it's actually drawing.  It could be 1.5 amps.  I don't know.  But it's definitely doing what it should and getting the job done with this power brick.  Again, the power brick does not feel hot and it feels very sturdy and heavy.  It doesn't feel like cheap plastic.  And when I was in college, you know, and they taught us how to rate power supplies.  If you've got two different power supplies and they're rated the same, the one that's heavier is the one that's going to do the best job.  And unless they pack them with sand or something, that's true because you're going to have heavier wiring.  You're going to have, you know, more guts basically.  inside your device unless it's got aluminum wiring or something instead of copper or something like that.  But so far, very impressed with this.  The instructions are very nice and straightforward.  It's got a QR code for the apps, instructions on what apps if you're using Apple or if you're using Android.  From my experience with this, if you are going to use the apps, you're going to need to do it over Wi-Fi.  You're going to have to put this thing in Wi-Fi mode and do it that way if you're running Android.  You might be able to do it with Bluetooth.  I haven't figured it out So I'm pretty sure you're going to have to do this over Wi-Fi if you're going to do that.  But I think that the options in this with what it has available, you can control everything from the remote.  So I don't really see a reason to use the app unless it has more features and more automatic automated control over the lighting and the colors and things like that.  I definitely do think that this probably would be something that would be good for a romantic atmosphere.  You know, anything you can do, you know, when you're trying to set up something to show effort that you prepared something or did something for a romantic evening is probably going to win you points.  Regardless of how romantic it actually is, you know, you put forth some sort of effort And it does, like I said, it does look very soothing, calming, like ocean wave is how it's described.  Anyways, thanks so much for watching the video.  You can check out the link to this product in the description of this video.  And I'm very happy to be able to do this review and share it with you.  And I hope that someone out there that gets this enjoys it.  So, and again, you know, you could set this behind your TV if you have all your lights out and you can see how it's lighting up the wall behind me, even though it's pointed at the ceiling.  All right.  Thank you.  God bless you, your family, your business, and all God has for you to do. ",
