            "text": "Shalom lachem, shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porah, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  We are in an exciting period of time of the year.  We are on the Feast of the Lord, beginning with the first feast, which is Passover and Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Matzah.  We're in the Feast of Unleavened Bread right now, and we are entering into what's known as First Fruits Resurrection Day, where we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus.  Without that resurrection, you and I would not be set free.  Without that resurrection, there would not be the Gospel.  Without that resurrection, sin would continue to destroy the world.  But through the blood of the Lamb, through the blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus, we have victory.  And what a time it is right now to celebrate together.  But I want to touch today on what happened before Jesus went to the cross, before Resurrection Day, which is First Fruits.  He told His disciples, I've desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.  He didn't say the Passover meal.  He said, I've desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  The reason it wasn't the Passover meal was because Yeshua is the Passover lamb.  Yeshua gave up his spirit.  On Nisan 14, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Jesus gave up his spirit.  The same time the Passover lamb was slain at 3 o'clock.  And that's the reason he told his disciples, I desire to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.  It was a dress rehearsal.  It was a preparation for his disciples to to understand how to celebrate Passover, to understand what it means to go out and make disciples of all nations, to understand that he is the Passover lamb, and when he's going to give up his spirit on the cross and rise on the third day, they would understand what he's talking about.  And we today, as believers in Yeshua Jesus, have that dress rehearsal that he did for us as how we celebrate Passover, Unleavened Bread, and Resurrection Day, which is First Fruits.  In 1 Corinthians 11, verse 24, Jesus sits with his disciples and And he blesses the bread, the Bible says.  And then he says, this is my body broken for you.  Do this in remembrance of me.  In the Hebrew, it's the word zachal.  And what it means, if you remember God.  God will remember you and write you in the book of remembrance.  We read this in the book of Malachi, chapter 3, verse 16.  Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the Lord listened and heard them.  And a scroll of remembrance, a book of remembrance, was written in his presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored his name.  When we remember the Lord, it means we honor the Lord.  And when the Bible says, do this in remembrance of me, when Jesus said this at the Passover meal, that's what he was referring to.  If you remember me, I'll remember you.  And yes, the foundation is Passover.  The foundation is the Lamb, is the cross.  But every time that we break bread and take the Lord's table, we do this in remembrance of what He did for us on the cross, what He did for us in first fruits and resurrection, and what He's going to do for us when He comes back as the King of kings.  and Lord of Lords, and we meet him in the air, and come and reign with him for a thousand years.  As the Bible says, and he's coming back on a white horse, and he has a robe dipped in blood, and on his name is the name of God, and those behind him also have the name of God.  The army, that's you and I, coming back to reign for a thousand years.  If you remember the Lord, the Lord will remember you.  Do this in remembrance of me.  Yes, the foundation was that Passover meal, but every time we break bread together.  We remember what he did for us on the cross.  We remember what he did for us on first fruits when he rose from the dead and crushed Satan once and for all.  And we remember what he's going to do for us.  meaning we go through a sanctification process, die in Messiah Yeshua daily, repent as we prepare ourselves to be the bride of Yeshua HaMashiach, consummate the marriage.  That's what it's all about.  But the foundation was Passover.  No Passover lamb, no salvation.  No first fruits resurrection, no salvation.  You and I have victory through Messiah Yeshua as we celebrate the Lord's feast.  It's not Israel's feast.  It's not the rabbi's feast.  The Bible says they're the feast of the Lord.  No man can claim ownership on them.  If you are born again, if you're under the blood of Jesus Yeshua, then those feasts apply to you because you belong to the Lord.  Hallelujah.  Revelation 12, 11, and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by their testimony.  That's how we can overcome the blood that He shed for us in Jerusalem.  Salvation came to you and I as a free gift by grace, but it came at a heavy, heavy price.  And the blood of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus, cannot be taken for granted.  If you come to Israel, to Jerusalem, and you go to the symbolic place where He rose, it says, He is not here, for He has risen.  Hallelujah.  And they overcame by the blood and the testimony of Yeshua HaMashiach, the blood of the Lamb.  That's how we overcome the obstacles of this world.  Do this in remembrance of me.  If we remember the Lord, the Lord will remember us and write us in the book of remembrance.  How do we celebrate Passover?  By taking the Lord's table.  This is my body broken for you.  Do this in remembrance of me.  This is the cup of the new covenant.  for the remission of sins of Yeshua's blood shed for many.  Do this in remembrance of me.  That's how we celebrate Pesach Passover.  How do we celebrate unleavened bread?  By remembering that Yeshua is unleavened.  He is the sinless, blemish lamb without spot.  How do we celebrate first fruits?  But remember that Christ, Jesus, Yeshua, is the first fruits of the harvest.  Remembering that Yeshua died on the cross on the tree for our sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if we repent and believe, we have full redemption of sins and eternal life, resurrection day, first fruits.  Hallelujah.  We remember, He is not here, for He has risen, and He's waiting for His bride to come back.  In my Father's house, there is many mansions.  We don't follow religion.  We don't follow tradition.  We follow only Yeshua, the written Word of God, in context.  And one thing I want to bring out here, it's very important, is when we celebrate the Feast of Unlimited Bread for seven days, and within that feast is resurrection, first fruits, how do we celebrate the Feast of Unlimited Bread?  Does that mean that God doesn't want us to have any bread in our house?  That's not what it means.  Yes, when we take the Lord's table, we should take bread without leaven because He is unleavened.  But when the Bible says that those who have levit in their home, they'll be cut off from Israel, it means that because the wages of sin is death.  That's what it means.  Levit represents sin in the Bible.  Paul says, a little levit spoils the whole lump.  What God is really saying is, take the levit out of your body, out of your temple.  Well, what's the temple?  The body says, we are the temple of God.  The Holy Spirit lives inside of us.  It's a sanctification process that only through the blood of the Lamb, only through Yeshua HaMashiach, can we take the leaven out of our houses.  And that's what it's speaking about.  Hebrews 2, verse 14 says, are partakers of flesh and blood.  He also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.  Satan has no more power.  Yeshua has conquered him once and for all.  And through Messiah Yeshua, you and I all raised from the dead, hallelujah, and become born again as we celebrate first fruits together.  He no longer has the power, Satan.  He's been crushed.  He's been destroyed.  He's been stomped on.  The Bible says in Hebrew, it doesn't destroy it.  It says in Hebrew, he crushed Satan once and for all.  Hallelujah.  Romans 6, 4.  We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that just as Yeshua Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  As we celebrate together this First Fruits Resurrection Day, we remember that through Him, we become righteous.  Through Him, we become priests.  Through Him, we become ambassadors for the kingdom.  And we share the gospel wherever God has positioned us to be.  And no coronavirus, no devil, no angel, fallen or so is going to stop us because greater is he in us than the one in the world.  It doesn't matter what you're going through.  It doesn't matter what you went through.  It doesn't matter what you're going through.  He is not in his grave because he has risen and conquered death once and for all.  Hallelujah.  May you and your family have a happy Passover, unleavened bread, and first fruits resurrection from Israel.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of Se'a Elohim, the Lamb of God, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Al Yehuda, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.  Happy Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits from Israel.  Shalom. ",
