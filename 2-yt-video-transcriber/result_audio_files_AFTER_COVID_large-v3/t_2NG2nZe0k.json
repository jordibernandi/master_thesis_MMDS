One of the things that I'm going to do today is take a look at a company called Diablo.  Now Diablo is a brand name, which you can buy these blades and drill bits and everything at the Home Depot, but the Diablo guy came by today.  And he brought me some items that I'm sure will improve the quality of my shelters, not that I can improve them much more, but I'm always looking.  So I'm going to show you what I'm going to do today to my bunkers to make them better for you. ",
