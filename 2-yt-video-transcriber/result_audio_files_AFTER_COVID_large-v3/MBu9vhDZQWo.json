            "text": "Hey guys, so I was stuck at work today with two single mother thoughts and I encountered a story and I wanted to share it with you guys because I think it illustrates something that's very important.  And again, women fabricate everything, but I got hard evidence to verify this.  So basically... One of the single mother thoughts.  She's a little black lady.  And she's not that attractive.  Neither of them are attractive at all.  One's a black girl.  One's a Latina.  Not attractive.  Almost 30 each.  Has a kid.  And she was telling me.  She's talking to this guy.  And he's in a different state.  Totally different state.  Far enough away.  Um, and it got pretty amusing at first, you know, obviously just like fucking thoughts, having beta orbiters, that's nothing new, you know, that's nothing new under the sun.  Um, but this one in particular really got me frustrated because I saw a picture of this guy and he's, I think he's like six, four, six, five.  He's a good looking dude.  You know, he could pull, uh, a lot more than what he's trying to get.  And the thing is he's not ever going to get it.  He knows she's seeing other people while she's talking to him.  But the part that really pissed me off is that she told me and then she showed me this earlier today that he is doing her homework for her.  So he willingly volunteered to do her college homework.  And ever since that, now she doesn't even send him her homework.  She gave him the login information to her web portal for school.  And he just logs in periodically and takes care of her homework for her.  You know?  I just, it's so, it's gotten to the point, like, it's, um, you know, I, I despair for the future of masculinity in the West, because this is pretty disgusting, like, Obviously, you're always going to have beta orbiters.  I've shared some stories before I found MGTOW.  I was never a simp, but I made mistakes with women.  I gave more than I should have.  I put women on a pedestal before I found MGTOW when I was younger, like 17, 18.  And now my version of a pedestal is much different from the pedestal of other guys.  So what I would have considered me being weak, weak-willed with women, putting them on pedestals is like a microcosm, a fraction of what some of the mega simps will do.  And you guys have confided in me in emails and comments and stuff where you share your stories and experiences.  As long as you're changing and you're on a new path and you're correcting your mistakes, you're acknowledging what you've done and you're not going to be a simp ever again, I don't have a problem with that.  Guys, you go through experiences, you make dumb mistakes.  We've all been there.  Now, the degree to our mistakes varies and I'll definitely be surprised when I hear something extreme.  But something like this that I heard today, 6'4\", 6'5 guy, smart enough to have a decent job and a head on his shoulders, but he can't fucking use that head for anything else.  Logging into some single mother thought in another state's web portal to do her homework for her with no benefit.  You're not getting anything out of this.  You're not gaining anything.  And they've never met before.  I forgot that.  Like, apparently they went to school, like, ten years ago.  She's told him to his... Not to his face, but I guess over the phone.  Because she was bragging about it to me.  She's like, I never knew he even existed.  You know?  And he just hits her up one day over, like, social media.  And now he does his homework for her.  So this is... It's a mental illness.  Now yesterday we talked about an openly, clearly distinguished mental illness.  I was talking yesterday about that dude who identifies as a deer on Twitch and now he's bragging like Twitch will never take him down and he can take people down and moderate and censor people and Clear mental illness, right?  But there's an underlying mental illness among weak men with no male figures, no positive masculinity in their lives.  Because on the surface, I've seen this dude, I've seen a couple pictures, she showed me his text messages, normal dude, you know, good looking dude, 6'4\", 6'5\".  On the surface, he would appear normal, but he has such a void of masculinity, such a desperation for validation.  that it would drive him to pure stupidity.  And I believe it's a form of natural selection for the weakest of men who can't even... And again, I'm not getting into the reproduction talk, like men who don't reproduce fail natural selection.  I'm saying from a purely resource management perspective.  Dedicating one's time, energy, intellect to something so fruitless as this guy's pursuit.  I can't fucking rationalize it.  I can't understand his position.  Crazy.  But these guys, they line up for single mothers, you know, like I... Back in the day, like when I first found Red Pill, you know, I was... And I'll talk about, I guess, standards for interacting with women.  But my standards have gotten very strict.  Used to be very lax, you know, as long as they were attractive.  And then gradually over time, I added standards.  But something I've always had and I always will have... The golden rule, never mess with a single mother.  And again, as we were talking all day, all the typical things we know about in the manosphere were reaffirmed.  Any man I meet will never be my top priority.  My child is my life.  They can't listen to themselves.  Why would a man sign up for that knowingly not being the top priority or the top focus?  You and I would ask that and that's not the case for these guys.  like these guys will sign up for something They will never see they will never touch They will never get to reap any benefits if you could call that a benefit being with a nasty Used up single mother, but in his eyes, it's a benefit and he's still not even getting that.  so obviously when guys do this and they give out this easy validation for women and not just attention, but now they're doing favors and shit and It corrupts the dating market and inflates their sexual marketplace value.  And it's so telling of the time we're in when men can't even have an outlet to talk about these things without getting shamed by other men.  Like when you think about it, the guys who would attack MGTOW and guys in the manosphere and this conversation we're having.  these are the guys we're talking about.  like these are the guys who come after us these hardcore simps these feminized men who grew up in single mother households.  and for a brief second i considered how guys envy women and how they want to reap all the easy benefits of that.  And you know, I've already come to terms with this.  I never would ever want to be a woman.  And part of me understands the surface level appeal of that, of guys who want to get those ethot bucks, who wish they could make an OnlyFans and just quit their jobs, who wish they could have guys in other states doing their homework for them.  You know, on the surface you think that's appealing, but there's something that you would get from building something yourself as a man.  You know, harnessing positive, productive masculinity, overcoming weak men.  There's that masculine urge to prevail over trials and tribulations that women will never understand.  And that laziness that you get as a woman, that entitlement, that's something you don't want.  That's poison.  That's poison of the soul.  That corrupts ambition.  That destroys dreams.  That paralyzes you because you end up looking for the easiest way out.  The... Most amount of resources you can extract with the least amount of effort.  And that's not somewhere you want to be.  If you build a self-sustaining business that pays for itself, that creates a passive income for you, that you made through hard work, that's something different.  Being a leech and leeching resources like that, that's not something you would ever want to be.  So yes, guys may wish they could live on, recruit difficulty, be an ethot, start cyber begging and twerking your ass.  No, you don't.  That comes with so much baggage.  With the female biological imperatives, imagine a life where you could never be satisfied.  I'm trying to think of classical tales like this, but try to picture yourself in a desert.  and you come across an oasis and you drink the water because you're dying of thirst and the water could never satisfy your thirst.  now that is female nature like nothing would ever be good enough for you.  You could always see the flaws in people who try to help you, who try to provide for you, who try to offer themselves to you.  You can never be satisfied.  That is a curse.  That's a classical curse that you'd read about in stories of old.  And that's not something I would ever want.  And guys who wish that, guys who wish for the easy road out, who want that easy provisioning from simps, you know that's just.  that's your short-term gratification talking.  you're looking for an easy way out so you could be lazy cut corners and that's what women do.  so you know these single thoughts.  they may have an easy in that regard you know but in the long term they haven't much harder because They will never have true fulfillment Contentness being happy with themselves being accomplished with their own achievements and being independent of the provisioning of others.  That's something they'll never have.  So enjoy that.  Enjoy the possibility of creating that for yourself, the path that leads to that.  And it may be tough.  You're going to be working crazy hours to build something for yourself, not just financially, But physically, you should be taking care of yourself physically, building yourself economically, and spiritually, mentally, getting yourself in a good space.  This all requires years of work, decades even.  I'm not even fully there.  I don't even think you can be fully there ever.  You can always be working on that path towards that.  And that's the journey.  It's not the destination.  So don't look at where the young women may find themselves.  Single mothers, attractive, non-attractive.  Women can pull anything.  It doesn't matter if you're fucking butt ugly.  They can pull something.  So don't ever compare yourself to them because it's not something you would want.  And for those guys who don't have standards... You know, hopefully they come around one day and eventually if they do find MGTOW and the Manosphere and stuff like that, it's gonna be really tough for them to adapt.  It's gonna take them years for something that you and I might understand, you know, in a couple months of binging good content or reading up stories and experiences because they're so far gone into femininity and lack of masculinity.  That it will take so much work to bring them back to a good starting point.  But that's for them to decide if they're willing to put in that much work.  To reshape their world views.  To detox themselves of that simp mindset.  That's for them to decide.  The stuff is out there.  We put the stuff out there.  We share our experiences online.  they need to do it themselves and you know it's telling that they often don't do it because it's much easier just to stay in that comfortable abyss of of seeking female validation by any means necessary.  it leads to nothing.  it yields nothing in return.  it is a fruitless endeavor and they're doomed to pursue it forever and that is their curse And I don't wish the curse of simping on any man.  I don't wish the curse of leeching as a woman upon any man.  And have some peace of mind knowing that while you're sitting here saving your money, spending the time how you want to spend it, enjoying the bachelor lifestyle or the monk lifestyle, whichever you prefer.  Just know they're out there simps or keeping those single mothers busy because you don't need to be doing that yourself.  So until the next video, guys, take care.  I'll see you next time. ",
