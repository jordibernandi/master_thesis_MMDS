            "text": "Hello everybody, Terrence Pop here with another episode of Live from the Lair.  And today we're going to be going over heat mail and stuff.  So let's look on the clipboard of Woe here and see what we've got going on here.  Alright.  Alright.  As of today, which is February 25th, coronavirus update.  Okay, now... been watching this very closely on YouTube and there's a couple of channels out there.  one particularly the guy's name doesn't really ring a bell with me.  I'm terrible with names anyway but I would know it if I saw it.  he's a doctor from England and apparently he has worked Africa the Middle East and over in Asia knows a lot of the doctors in the know and people in the medical field and Apparently they're emailing them a lot of updates on the download.  He talks about him on his channel.  Of course, I'm sure he's being demonetized and Being labeled as fake news.  All right now apparently there is this new virus All over the world.  Alright, apparently it's kicking ass in Iran.  There are a lot of rumors that it's mutated to become even more deadly in that particular part of the world, which I really don't know.  I'm not a medical guy.  But, you know, if they're not releasing the numbers or they don't know the numbers because their medical facilities are for shit... that we really have to take those numbers with a grain of salt.  Now, the way it's looking from the other victims of this particular virus in other portions of the world, it's looking like the serious involvement rate is roughly 20% and the fatalities are fluctuating anywhere from 1.8 all the way up to five percent.  so you know as a betting man if i was betting that spread i would bet somewhere between two and two and a half percent.  you know fatality rate which You know, for every hundred people get sick, two and a half people die, which in reality is three people died because you can't really halfway die.  Either you're dead or you're not.  So, in that particular instance, I would say fractions can suck my dick.  Okay, so... Another thing that I found pretty upsetting is the WHO, which is the World Health Organization.  Still... has not called this a pandemic.  Even though when you read the definition for pandemic, that's exactly what we have going on.  So what does that say about the World Health Organization?  Well, I'm gonna have to say that maybe their credibility is now for shit and apparently maybe somebody got money put in somebody's bank account so they can say the party line or whatever they fucking want them to say to not spread panic and discord.
