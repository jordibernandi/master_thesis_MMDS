            "text": "Good afternoon, good evening, good morning.  This is Catania Alwyn speaking from Vancouver in Canada, or Cowichan Bay in Canada.  Now, this is all in the news about coronavirus, but oxygen therapy is working for coronavirus patients, Sewell says.  Yeah.  Now, many of you or some of you might know that I'm a health, a natural health practitioner with a classical dance background and also classical singing background.  And health is of vital importance to me and it always has been.  So food, herbs and various other things.  I was also very fortunate that, this is a rather peculiar way of saying it, but that as a baby I had double pneumonia.  I then suffered from bronchitis for much of my early life, went through the war, was born in 1939, so in England, and that... and we always seemed to be around where the bombing was going on.  So I took quite a hit from a point of view of lung issues.  When I was 50, I decided I was really going to focus on my health, which is, I had focused on it, but I was really going to focus on it.  And that I did.  And what was interesting is I started to become sick in all sorts of ways because the body was saying, OK, you want to really clear us up.  You want to clear your own health swamp up.  And so it did.  But it was very good because it actually made me really address certain situations.  I'd also had the experience when must have been in my 30s when I had decided to look after my own health and not go to the doctors and had suffered a cold, bad cold, flu, bronchitis, whatever it was.  And so I was doing lemons and lemon and honey and various other things.  And my husband said, no, you're going to go to the doctor.  Well, God bless him.  I'm very glad he did because the doctor gave me antibiotics.  Right.  I'm not saying good for antibiotics, but what this did to me, I was so ill.  I was absolutely horribly, horribly ill.  that I swore I would never, ever go and see and consult a doctor again, other than, of course, Chinese doctors.  I have been to them.  I've been for acupuncture.  I've had herbal treatment, et cetera, and fantastic.  But that experience really was wonderful.  It was horrible in one way, but it made me so determined that that was it.  Never go to another doctor again.  And so for probably, well, I'm 80 now and I was in my 30s then, so 50 years, pretty well, not 45, something like that, not seen a doctor for consultation.  Obviously, we have had a few friends that have been doctors.  Well, not all that many.  One or two.  Anyway, so I've always gone down the natural health way and it has served me extremely well.  One of the things that I talked about in the last video and gave you links to was oxygen.  This oxygen that you can breathe in or this liquid oxygen.  And Mr.  Oxygen, which some of you might have seen the video in my last video, which I put the link in there, really brought oxygen back into the fore.  Now, it seems what South Korea were doing, they were using oxygenated or oxygen masks.  Now, whether that was the mask like the lady has got on at the moment, It has a form of liquid oxygen in it, or whether she's breathing oxygen, I'm not quite sure.  But there are also those other big masks that you put over your face, which are very ungainly.  But actually, if you take liquid oxygen, now another wonderful thing is colloidal silver, and you can make your own.  And if I don't get a chance to show it in this video, I will show it, and I'll put the link in the description box where you can follow how to make it.  It's very simple.  Now, another thing is also high levels of vitamin C. Absolutely brilliant.  So, now I've brought you John Rapoport's.  I like his work very much.  China Coronavirus Hype Straight Out of the CDC Flu Playbook.  And he's got here to read about John's mega collection, The Matrix Revealed.  So do click on that because he's written a tremendous amount and you'll learn a lot and be able to pass a lot on to other people.  because we're being played for mugs and you really we need to wake up now.  in today's episode of numbskulls and deceivers in medical science i ask the question are chinese researchers copying an old cdc scam or Have they independently come up with their own lies which happen to mirror CDC hype?  In my series on the China epidemic, I've pointed out that pneumonia, the key, indicator of the coronavirus, can be caused by many other factors, other microbes, fungi, toxic pollution, etc.  And Chinese authorities no longer require direct testing for the coronavirus.  Instead, CT scans of the chest are employed.  If these scans show signs of pneumonia, the coronavirus epidemic label is absurdly applied to the patient.  I've also pointed out that historically, pneumonia has been a major disease in China long before the emergence of the new human coronavirus.  People in China have been dying of pneumonia at the rate of about 300,000 a year.  Now, those people passing away from the disease in 2020 can be falsely called deadly epidemic cases.  How convenient!  Well, it turns out that the US Centers of Disease Control, that's what CDC is, has been running its own pneumonia scam for a long time.  Some years ago, when I was writing about the flu, or flu as I used to be told, From English, it's not the flu, it's flu.  It's influenza.  I received emails from Peter Doshi and Martin Maloney.  They fed me data from the CDC's own charts detailing flu deaths in the US, and they pointed out the lies.  Doshi went on to write an analysis for the British Medical Journal online.  December 2005.  Here is a key quote from his report.  According to CDC statistics, influenza and pneumonia took 62,034 lives in 2001, 61,777 of which were attributed to pneumonia.  and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.  You might want to chew on that sentence for a while.  You see, the CDC has created one overall category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths.  They call this category flu.  Why do they do this?  Why do they deceptively assert the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu?  Because they want to sell doctors and the public on the dangers of flu.  Pneumonia has a number of non-fuclase cases.  But even worse, in all of the 2001 flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus.  I'll read that again.  But even worse, in all the 2001 flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus.  Therefore, the CDC couldn't truthfully say that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001.  Not 36,000 deaths, the old CDC PR statistic.  Just 18 deaths.  Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu deaths statistics.  Between 1979 and 2001, the CDC data showed an average of 1,348 flu deaths per year, range 257 to 3006.  These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia.  this low death toll would drop much lower if you added the need to confirm the presence of a flu virus in those cases.  Now, let's think about what vitamin C does.  Let's think about what oxygen does.  It builds and strengthens the immune system, both of them.  And there are other things that build the immune system too.  so we have two fake hustlers years apart in the?  u s and china both based on the deceptive use of pneumonia liars.  and to tell the same kind of lies over and over Medical liars often import diseases that have nothing to do with their claims in order to build up the case numbers and pump up threats and fears, and then sell toxic drugs and vaccines as solutions.  Well, there we have it.  I'll be quite happy to offer this article and its blunt facts to the New York Times or the Washington Post or CBS or NBC or ABC, providing they assure me that they'll print it and then force their hungriest hounds to track me down and indict the high-level deceivers by name.  who are pushing these criminal falsehoods.  Ordinarily, I would charge, oh, that's a lot of money, it's a lot of zeros.  after there, for the article.  But, in the case, I'll settle for a six-hour face-to-face live streaming interview with the head of the CDC in prime time.  Now, I just want to, and that's John Rapoport, I want to say, John, I hope I'm doing you a service by reading this out because it's so important.  what you say is absolutely spot on.  Now, in the description box will be the links and also, so that you're not taken for suckers, go on to the link that talks about Delphin World and look at that link and subscribe to it and start your own personal empowerment process So you don't get pulled into being a sucker for these questionable MSM news stories,  etc.,  etc.  This is Catania Alvin saying God bless.  This is part one.  There's a part two coming down the road.  Okay, on this very subject, God bless and talk to you again soon.  Bye-bye. ",
