I always wanted one and they have it stripped up with the police stickers and everything, right?  He just asked what's going on, but he didn't really stick around to find out.  So inside here, I don't see anything illegal, which is good.  But why would Vantner?  Well, I guess they have the boardwalk and the beach.  So I'd get why they would need one of these.  It just seems too fun for tax dollars to me.  so they got these cool wheels too.  i'm sure they're not custom wheels.  these things are extra they are.  we got some business going on up there.  black.  what happened?  are you okay sir?  Yeah.  What happened here?  Did he ask any questions?  Okay.  So apparently this is their door, I guess.  There's no buzzer on it, so there's no way to contact the police officers if you need help.  Can I help you guys?  Yes, ma'am.  If you go up these stairs, there's a lady sitting there.  Where can we go to get a police complaint form at?  I'm sorry?  We need to go get police complaint forms.
