            "text": "My next update has to do with a private report that was leaked.  It was a report commissioned and paid for by the JPMorgan Chase Bank, one of the largest banks in the world.  The paper explains whether or not, it answers the question, whether or not climate change is something that threatens the world and, therefore, if JPMorgan Chase needs to, and I quote, rethink its investments in the fossil fuel industry.  And the conclusion of the paper, which I've now looked at, is remarkable.  First of all, it answers the question with a resounding yes.  Climate change is very real.  Climate change's economic effects are enormous.  And it is advisable for JPMorgan Chase basically to get out of financing the fossil fuel industry.  That's oil and gas, for those of you who aren't clear.  on this subject.  So beside one of the largest banks in the world taking a position, for example, diametrically opposed to that of the Trump government, and that, by the way, has been done by the largest money managing firm in the world, BlackRock, as well, so this is now a trend.  But I want to go beyond that because the report says something even more important.  It refers to the whole climate change issue as an example of, and again I quote, market failure.  And here's what they mean, that for years now decisions have been made on what is or isn't profitable.  based on comparing the revenues of an investment with the costs of an investment.  And what this report does, which JP Morgan believes in, is to say we were wrong in our capitalist system.  That's my words, not theirs.  We were wrong in our system not to count the costs of environmental damage.  Had we added those very real costs, many of the projects we've invested in over the years would not have been invested in because they weren't profitable.  The revenues they generated weren't enough to cover the costs, if you included the costs of the environmental damage.  Good, says my economist hat.  This is a recognition that markets don't count many of the most important costs of business in our capitalist system.  In the second half of today's show, when we interview Tess Fraad-Wolf, she will explain\u2014and I think you'll find it intriguing\u2014that there are psychological costs.  of workplaces, impacts on workers that they take into their personal lives that really are big costs of capitalism that nobody counts and that therefore the market, based on costs not counted, is making one wrong decision, one inefficient decision after another.  The love of markets, the celebration of markets as if a market-based economy is something to emulate, to celebrate, and to praise means you don't understand how markets work and, in particular, how markets mis-estimate, ignore, and miss the real costs that go into the decisions made by market criteria.
