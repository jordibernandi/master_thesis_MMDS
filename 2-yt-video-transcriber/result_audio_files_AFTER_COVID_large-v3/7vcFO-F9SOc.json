            "text": "You know, what I would say to them first is this, that you can imagine very easily where you're going to be in five years.  It's more of what you have right now.  You have no reason to believe that any of your habits, any of your relationships, any of your fears will be allied or improved or removed.  And there's got to be this moment where the pause button is pushed and everything stops and you freeze frame your life.  That's what you need to do right now and realize someone is talking to me.  Someone is talking to me.  You know, in Acts chapter 14, there's a verse that we don't identify very often as being important, but it is central because the Bible says, that Paul was opposed.  He went into Iconium and they opposed him and therefore he stayed.  The church cannot abandon the blue state cities just because they're going politically into a crazy mode.  This is when we need to stay.  This is when we need to stand.  Because I'm telling you, the mechanism of manipulating these elections can be broken.  And we find there's a harvest field.  People want God.  But here's what you do.  Why should you turn to Christ?  Jesus said, I'm the way, the truth, and the life.  Someone said, well, he was a great moral teacher, but he wasn't the way, the truth, and the life.  Well, if he wasn't and he said he was, he's a liar.  And that means he can't be trusted.  He has to be who he said he was.  One time, a great thinker that was converted from communism in the turn of the 20th century was asked, how on earth did you become a Christian?  You can't even see Jesus.  And he said, I didn't come to Jesus because I could see him, but because when I met him, I was able to see everything else.  The order, the power.  the the changes that occur in you.  suddenly you feel you have a plan for tomorrow.  suddenly you don't know why.  you know.  when the bible says peace that passes understanding.  i want you to listen to this part folks.  when the bible says peace that passes understanding there's a modern way to say that that will come alive to you.  why is it that now that i have gotten right with jesus That no matter what, I'm convicted that everything is going to turn out all right.  And I can't explain that conviction.  I can't explain why I know that everything about my life is going to turn out all right.  And that's why you surrender to Christ.  That's why you don't wait.  You say, well, I need to think about it.  There's nothing to think about.  This is the gift you do not turn down.  And when God speaks to you, the one talent you never want to acquire is the ability to say no to God.  You want to say yes now, and you want to say it with all your heart.  And that's what has to happen across America.  You know, I'm kind of looking for the day, Alan, when I am given a release from the mandate to do this blog because I am a soul winner.  I'm a passionate soul winner.  And we're planning to do larger crusades, more crusades, and to build literally a studio platform for the gospel to go across America in a way it never has before.  And we're about to do that.  And it's because of the effect.  And that's what the media doesn't want you to see.  What does someone become like after Jesus gets a hold of them?  You see, they're all lying because they say they want equality.  They say they want to get racism.  They say they want people to be treated fairly.  They want income distribution.  that's loving and right.  All of that comes through Christ.  So nobody who tells you they want justice and leaves Jesus out is telling the truth.  They're dishonest and they're lying.  Because the minute... If you make an honest intellectual commitment to know truth... And to find out how to benefit society, you end up at the foot of the cross.  It's inescapable.  It's inescapable.  And there's only one thing that keeps you from the foot of the cross.  And that's pride and arrogance and deceit.  And I know that without a doubt. ",
