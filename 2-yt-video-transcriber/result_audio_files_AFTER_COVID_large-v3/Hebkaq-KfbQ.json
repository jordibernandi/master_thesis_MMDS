            "text": "Hark, Donald!  According to official records, you are 74 today.  Of course, according to official records, you are also 244 pounds.  So you're probably 103 today and look every minute.  I was asking people, the ones you haven't killed with your pandemic incompetence, what we should get you for your birthday.  If I tell you what they said, But I don't use that type of language or invite calls from the SS as you so fascistly call them.  Besides, you really need so much.  You're like a Wizard of Oz trifecta if you only had a brain and a heart.  And courage, Bunker Boy.  And if only your cult knew you were just a scared old man ranting from behind the curtain.  Only really, you're just a scared old man tweeting from under a desk.  I used to think you were the worst possible president.  And you certainly proved that in your response to Miss Rona.  But now I'm starting to think that in a really odd, unexpected way, I'd be the right president.  at the right time.  I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out.  Maybe having the most overtly racist president that didn't actually own slaves at this very moment is having a profound effect on America.  A competent president, you know, a human with empathy, would say the right words about police brutality and how black lives matter.  But those types of words have all been said before, and then nothing changed.  And you are incapable of saying those words, even in sincerely wheezing them off the teleprompter.  And you're so unable to read the room, choosing to side with Confederacy over black citizens.  I know you don't know, well, anything, but especially history.  But has no one told you how siding with the Confederacy works out?  Look it up.  But having a president who is so ham-handed in his racism makes it harder for America to avoid looking at the problem of racism in this country.  You offer no platitudes to cover it up, just dog whistles to draw attention to it.  Well, they're not technically dog whistles when everyone can hear them.  Maybe watching countless videos of police brutality and having such a crass racist in the White House will prove the last straw for most Americans, the ones who aren't willfully ignorant racists themselves.  You know, your mega cult.  By handling the Black Lives Matter protests even more ineptly than you handled the coronavirus, your racism may be causing more Americans to confront their own.  I'm hoping that will be the one good thing you did for America before you got the hell out of town.  Oh, and happy birthday.  I'd make the most of it.  It's going to be your last one.  Unindicted.  Oh, my God. ",
