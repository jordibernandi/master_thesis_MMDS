I can't believe this is happening!  Y'all cut it off because the dude who was taping me started laughing.  He's like, whoa.  He started laughing.  Look, I warned y'all.  Get your ass whooped out there.  Y'all keep messing with some of these black people.  I didn't know it was in flight.  Yeah, I was like, what's wrong with y'all?  He grabbed her quick, though.  He's like, oh, put it in first class.  Put it in first class.  Put it in first class before she whooped that ass again.  She had a bit over the neck over that seat.  Hey, I ain't mad at her.  I ain't mad at her.  I would have choked the shit out of her, too.  All right, folks, back to my video in just one moment.  All right, so a lot of y'all always asking me about some of the pocket squares that I wear.  Now, I don't know.  Robert don't have one on.  Now, I don't particularly like the white pocket squares.  I don't like even the silk ones.  And so I was reading GQ magazine a number of years ago, and I saw this guy who had this pocket square here, and it looks like a flower.  This is called a shibori pocket square.  This is how the Japanese manipulate the fabric to create this sort of flower effect.  So I'm going to take it out and then place it in my hand so you see what it looks like.  And I said, man, this is pretty cool.  And so I tracked down, it took me a year to find a company that did it.  They're basically about 47 different colors.  And so I love them because, again, as men, we don't have many accessories to wear.  So we don't have many options.  And so this is really a pretty cool pocket skirt.  And what I love about this here is you saw when it's in the pocket, you know, it gives you that flower effect like that.  But if I wanted to also, unlike other, because if I flip it and turn it over, it actually gives me a different type of texture.  and so therefore it gives me a different look.  so there you go.  so if you actually want to uh get one of these shibori pocket squares we have them in 47 different colors all you got to do is go to rollinglessmartin.com.  forward slash pocket squares.  all right.  so first of all that graphic is way too small.  so uh tomorrow we're gonna run it right down here all across the screen.  so it's rolling this martin.com.  forward slash pocket squares.
