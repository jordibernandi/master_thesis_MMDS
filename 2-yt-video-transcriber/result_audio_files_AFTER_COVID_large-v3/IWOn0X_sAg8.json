            "text": "Why do women reject ugly men?  Common sense would say it's because they're not attractive and women just don't want to date them.  But if you can believe it, the real answer to that question is even more brutal.  If you're an unattractive guy and you've always wondered why women say no to your romantic advances, then you're going to want to watch this video.  I'm going to share the results of a scientific study called Resisting Connection Following a Social Exclusion.  Rejection by an attractive suitor provokes derogation of an unattractive suitor.  The results of this study are fascinating.  They're so revealing of female psychology.  To make this more fun, I thought that I'd call up my female friend Sada so that we can go through the results together and I can get her female perspective.  I'm going to go ahead and call her now.  Hey Sada, how are you doing? ",

So women are hypergamous and they're trying to partner up with a top value man.  So when she's being rejected by the attractive guy, at that moment, she's feeling very vulnerable about her own desirability.  Suddenly she's feeling like, Oh, I thought that I was this highly attractive, desirable woman, but this guy just rejected me.  Maybe I'm not that way.  Maybe everybody who's watching this is thinking, oh, I guess she's not so attractive or desirable after all.  So she's feeling very, very vulnerable.  And she has this strong desire to... assert herself as a desirable woman again.  she wants to publicize to everybody.  i may have just been rejected but i'm still a top value woman i'm still high quality i'm still highly desirable and so when the ugly man then approaches her she's not thinking oh it's time for me to settle.  she's thinking This is a good opportunity for me to signal to the high value men and to everybody watching that I am not of this low value.  I'm not an unattractive woman.  I'm going to strongly reject this man, maybe even be harsh and cruel to him as a way of demonstrating how out of his league that I am.  And so you begin to realize here that she's not actually even rejecting the ugly man for For his sake.  It's not that she's not interested in him.  He's just a pawn in the game so that she can use him to publicize and advertise to everybody else.  Hey, I'm a high value woman.  This is how strongly I reject any low value guys.

It's because she's signaling to the other men in the club, the high-value men, this guy, he thought that he had a chance with me because I'm some low-value woman.  Nuh-uh.  I shut him down really, really strongly.  I'm a high-value woman, and you can see proof of that.  So, you know, I'm still available, high-value men.  Come talk to me.  Okay. ",

But does that potentially blind us to the negative qualities that a woman has or give us unrealistically high standards so that we remain perpetually single?  Do we need to ignore our biology when choosing a partner?  That is the topic of my latest video.  In this video, I explain the two competing instincts that your genes have given you and how to balance them inside yourself.  I talk about the importance of your girlfriend's appearance to your overall happiness and the correct way to view your partner as a sort of status symbol in order to gain the respect of your friends.  I talk about the best way to enjoy female beauty throughout your life, even into old age.  And lastly, I talk about the minimum standards of appearance that you should have when looking for a woman to partner with.  If you're somebody who's a complete sucker for a pretty face, and you're worried that that's going to cause you to make a bad partner choice, then this is definitely the video for you.  Right now, for every video that I post on YouTube, I post an additional bonus video on my Patreon page.  That means that at the moment, you're only seeing half of the total content that I create.  If you'd like to see the other half, then please go and sign up at my Patreon.  It's just $5 a month and you get instant access to a whole bunch of exclusive content.
