Mark Sargent, the leading voice of the Flat Earth community, has appeared on This Morning in the UK, which is a daily show which is watched by millions of people.  Did he make a fool of himself?  Of course he did, because he's a Flat Earther.  He only has to open his mouth to make a fool of himself.  So, these are the points, the talking points.  Can he prove it?  No.  How does he know the Earth isn't a globe?  He doesn't.  Why can't we go to Antarctica and see the ice wall?  Because we can't.  Because the Antarctic Treaty forbids it.  Has he got any proof?  No.  I've already said that once, haven't I?  But you get the picture.  He's gone on national TV and made himself look like a complete twat.  Tidy!
