            "text": "I am quite disturbed to be making this announcement this morning.  And the announcement is in line with the mischief that is happening at Africa Union.  Under the leadership of Farke, the chairperson of the Africa Union, who has been there now for the past four years and is asking for an extension for another four years.  But in the four years that he has been in power, we have not seen anything that we can write home about.  Firstly, we want to outline and make it clear that under the watchful eye of Farke at Africa Union, who happens to be a francophone himself from the French colonies, the exclusion of Dr.  Chihombori from running for chairperson of the African Union will not keep us silent.  We need to raise our voices and for the first basis of gender.  We are electing and making announcement on the basis of power, on the basis of interest.  And as a nation, the African nation, I think we have it in our hands to also be given the power to elect who we want to assist to drive the African Union.  we have seen the French colonies, 14 of them, continuously being ripped and raped by France under the watchful eye of Farke, who supervised the project with such precision to make sure that more than 500 billion dollars a year was moved out of African countries into France.  under his watchful eye, as a watchdog for the French government, African countries have continuously suffered, paying taxes, as it were, taxes of colonialism to France.  This is how it happens.  When you are getting independent, you must sign a document that allows the interest rates which are competitive for the world.  Now, where in the world do you see that you take your own reserves as African countries, you give them to a French country and when you want your money, you are taking it back to yourself as a loan?  You can make your own calculations and see how this injustice has been happening on the African continent under the watchful eye of Farke.  Farke must go.  You will not get another extension in that office.  Farke, step down.  Farke, take an early retirement and stop the mischief.  We also hear that under your supervision, your brother-in-law is now the ambassador in Europe, your own brother-in-law.  watchful eye, we hear that the Africa Union offices are actually bugged by the Chinese and that all the servers of Africa Union are being supervised by the Chinese.  You are selling African information to the Chinese under your own supervision.  Under your supervision, wars in Africa have constantly raged.  to none of your conversation.  We have never seen you, Honourable Farke, making a statement on anything.  We saw black people dying in America.  You are silent.  Poverty is raging on the continent.  You are silent.  War is going on.  You are silent.  Sitting around the 18th floor of the Africa Union and making sure that your pocket constantly gets deeper and deeper.  I want to make a comment this morning That challenges your position.  We know how Africa Union has been designed and that only presidents of countries are the ones who are going to be voting for the person they want to become the chairperson.  But we know that our African presidents have not stood up to the task.  Not even by ballot, we can vote by internet.  We have these softwares now.  There is no reason why we can constantly pontificate the Africa Union offices. ",
