            "text": "I mean, it makes you wonder, is Walmart in on it?  Hey, what is up, guys?  Welcome to the channel.  If you're new, hit the subscribe button.  Got a lot of topics to talk about, some things to figure out with the media and what's going on, you know, and trying to get the right answers, but being just, you know, spoon-fed garbage.  numbers that don't match, the fudging of numbers, people not believing the message the White House is putting out because the White House puts out a message that contradicts itself every couple of days.  One minute it's, oh, you don't need masks.  The next is, everyone should be wearing masks.  Then just ridiculous information about who the virus targets.  At first it was, oh, it seems to hit Asian people.  Well, it's because it originated in Asia.  Then it affects some old people.  Well, it's only gonna affect our elderly and our most at risk.  just happened to be because it got into a nursing home.  The way they're processing this information just seems ridiculous to me.  They have an influx of cases in Louisiana, so the numbers spike for black Americans.  Oh, it's affecting black people the most.  It's ridiculous.  The narrative is constantly changing and it makes no sense.  If it came up here to North Idaho, everyone would be convinced it's murdering white people.  But that's not the case.  What we're seeing is it doesn't matter who it is.  It's affecting all of us.  So the narrative is stupid.  And it just seems like they're just doing a song and dance.  To distract us?  I don't know.  You guys tell me in the comments.  Do you think the media is just lying?  Do you think they're just putting out bits of information that they come up with just to put something out?  Do you think we're being misled?  Or do you think they're doing the best that they can?  Is this the best?  Are we getting the best?  We're seeing these different news organizations saying one thing, then coming out and switching their narrative completely.  One minute, you know, it's a hoax.  The next minute is, oh, it's very serious and very real.  You know, everyone wants to blame everyone for it.  It's, oh, it's Trump's fault.  No, it's the Democrat governor's fault.  Guys, all these governors are stepping on people's rights.  Republican, Democrat, doesn't matter.  They're all doing it.  Keep that in mind.  Don't start fighting amongst each other.  That's a waste of time.  But guys, the point of this video is because I'm just wondering... Why it is Walmart is handling stuff the way that they are handling it?  What are you up to Walmart?  I got a big bump coming, hang on guys.  My neighbors dug a bunch of drainage ditches in the road so that the road melts off and a couple of them are pretty gnarly.  so we get some pretty big bumps.  So I had a buddy go into Walmart on the phone talking to me and he was telling me what he was seeing in the moment, at the time.  What was going on.  And he had parked at one side of Walmart.  You know, they got their big entrances.  He parks at one side, he gets to the door and it's locked down.  Tells him he has to go around.  So he has to walk all the way around.  He's like, man, what is the point of this?  gets in there and Walmart has got their entire building open with one exit, one exit, one entrance.  That's it.  So he goes in and does a little bit of shopping is looking around, you know, and it just seems like the reports of what's on the shelf are just varying.  Uh, one minute it's, Hey, everything's good.  Most recently, uh, report was there's like no canned food items at all and there's no flour.  i gotta buckle up for safety.  There's no flour.  There's no yeast.  Seems like people out here on the West Coast are having a hard time finding flour and yeast.  For other people on the East Coast, they're reporting that it seems to be pretty easy, but they're having issues with milk and bread in some places, guys.  And don't freak out.  if your store in your town is doing good, okay?  Your store in your town... it's not indicative of what's going on all over the place, right?  So we're sharing reports of what people are saying in their area and what they're saying because it's important.  It's important that we piece the information together as community versus listening to the media who's just blowing in the wind And just changing their narrative constantly, changing the story.  Guys, and we all know that big media is fake news.  Their opinions are bought.  Their narratives are bought.  So it doesn't matter, right?  So we the people are sharing information, trying to figure out what we can figure out.  that's going on, right?  Because it's the best that we can do.  It's work together.  is to work together and share that information to try and help each other out.  Some of you guys are having issues finding seeds, some are not.  As of this last weekend, the governor in Michigan has decided that seeds, nurseries, any place that sells vegetables, things like that, are deemed non-essential.  Not essential for people.  What does that mean?  It means you don't have the right to grow food for yourself.  They're going to try and control it.  That's a pretty scary thought.  You're welcome to go and eat their hot pockets, but you cannot grow vegetables for yourself.  So they're not allowing people to get seeds.  Guys, and if you don't plant seeds in the beginning, you just don't get anything that year.  That's just the way it works.  Where we're at, we have a very limited growth season.  If our government was trying to limit our seeds, they could very easily stop us from gardening for a year.  So getting back to Walmart guys, reports from inside Walmart is the employees are walking around with no face masks, no gloves on.  Some people are wearing face masks and gloves.  They're claiming to wash down the carts for people.  Still helping people to get checked out and stuff, so maybe not necessarily abiding by that six foot rule.  But I just, I find this to be weird.  They shut down all the entrances except for one.  They have everyone coming in and out, which clusters people together.  It also happens to be on the food side.  which means we know this thing is airborne.  So if people are coming in all from one side, you would think that that would saturate that area in germs, right?  If we're running away from an airborne virus, if we're staying six feet away from people, even though you can cough up to 18 feet, we're staying 16 feet away from people, is it safe to buy vegetables?  the grocery store.  Is it a good idea or is it a bad idea?  Are you guys buying vegetables and fruits at the grocery store?  Let me know in the comments.  Share with people what's going on in your area so that people can cruise through the comment section and see who's affected where and what.  We really appreciate you guys sharing that stuff.  There's no better information.  As long as you guys are given accurate information on what's going on in your area, it paints a better picture than what we're getting from the media.  So we also know that things are going to have to change when it comes to dealing with communist countries, guys.  All the products that come from China, all the goods that they provide, are we going to go right back to just... Getting back into bed with the communists?  Are we going to go right back to buying their stuff and cripple America?  Or is something going to change?  Tell me in the comments.  I want to know what you guys think.  Should we just go back to business as usual?  Or should we rewrite the book a little bit and start bringing jobs back to America?  Start bringing factory workers back to America?  What should we do?  You guys tell me.  I think we need to decrease our reliance on China.  What does that mean for Walmart?  Watching you Walmart. ",
