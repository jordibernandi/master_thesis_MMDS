As many of you know, I discussed this creature, Tommy Lauren, about three years ago, and I said I didn't think she was a sincere conservative.  In response, I had a bunch of sexually frustrated boomer men say that, Oh, you must be a liberal butt pirate.  A couple months later, she said she supported abortion, so stabbed the conservatives in the back.  But I'm sure they will defend her then, and they will defend her even now, after this little entertaining skit that we're going to examine. ",

Kathy Zhu, everyone was simping over, and then she was doing the risque modeling pics, which if you want to do that, fine.  Maybe you're like, oh, I'm only fiscally conservative and socially liberal.  Whatever.  But is that a good role model to young women in the age of TikTok, in the age of over-sexualization, that you're going to do that sort of thing while claiming you're a conservative woman who's trying to protect society against the liberals?  Eh, just saying.  Sarah Palin, nice pro-American mom who then she gets out of politics as soon as she has the chance to make money.  Cam's out.  Allegedly she slept with an NBA player.  In another case, I think she cheated on her husband.  And then she's on the show singing, I like big butts and I cannot lie.  These are the role model of conservative women, apparently. ",

It's because they live in a modern society where they go to public schools, overwhelmingly female teachers.  They come from households where the husband, the father, has been driven out.  Every organization meant to shape boys into men like the Boy Scouts, the military, police forces.  civic groups, they've all been inundated and encroached upon by women and empowerment and diversity and all this stuff that is irrelevant to the development of a human male into a man.  But I'm sure Tomi Lahren doesn't want to actually live in a conservative traditional society because then she wouldn't have all the rights that she enjoys.  Conservatives don't care about cancel culture as long as it's targeted towards someone they don't like.

            "text": "Yep, that's the way.  to make a woman crazy about you is not to pay attention all the time.  Don't be a bitch.  What does that even mean?  Could you reciprocate with another word?  No, of course you can't.  So, yeah, you know, She proved very quickly when she got her ass handed to her by none other than Trevor Noah, who I don't think is funny.  Just like, who is the other guy that they brought on?  As soon as Trump became president, we had to have diversity in late night just to be able to show that they were resisting his evilness.  I don't think he's funny.  I didn't even think Jon Stewart or Seth Meyers were funny, personally.  But she got her ass kicked by Trevor Noah, so that says a lot.  This is the reason why there's a lot of talk in the manosphere about how, like, oh, MGTOW, they're copers, they don't, they're just, no women want them.  But it's like, here, you see with Tommy Lawrence, she's angry about men not paying attention to her, even though most of those men wouldn't even clock her minimum standards radar.  And then she's frustrated because the higher value men don't really consider her to be high value enough to settle down and want to commit.  So it's just a constant debate.  In that sense, I don't really think these guys are doing anything wrong.  where they're like, you know what, just give up, walk away.  I think they're being kind of practical.  Because no matter what you do, no matter how driven or successful a lot of men are, they're not going to measure up to Tommy Lauren.  And she's always going to be angry.  Like Richard Wallace says in his book, a woman is never satisfied.  So, you know, I consider myself lucky.  I've got a girlfriend who, by the way, she's studying medicine, so she's not a loser who's just a little ditz on Instagram, as Tommy would say.  But she has some appreciation for the fact that there's a man and there's a woman.  Now, who knows?  That could change.  Maybe she'll turn into Tommy Lauren in a few years.  The point is, though, that as a man, if you're going to be in a relationship, you have to choose carefully.  Tommy Lauren would be a bad choice.  As much as she's cute, you know, we talk about white privilege.  I think that's a silly concept, but there is definitely, in the romantic market, there's privilege for white, Nordic-looking women.  dudes who, on the one hand, of the manosphere will be like, we're brothers till the end of time.  Then they turn around and start promoting these racial hierarchies and dating.  This is true of a lot of American women.  It's just that typically the blondes are at the top of the totem pole, where they think that simply being attractive, simply existing as a woman, means that you need to be exalted and treated like a queen.  It's like, no, character matters.  If you're a bad person, if you are ungrateful, if you treat a man like trash because he really is into you, because he has good intentions... then you should be ignored.  You should have men walking away from you and not even paying you the time of day.  So that's my thoughts on Tommy Lauren.  Let me know what you think.  Many of you probably will be on her side, will be supporting her, and so it'll be very interesting. ",
