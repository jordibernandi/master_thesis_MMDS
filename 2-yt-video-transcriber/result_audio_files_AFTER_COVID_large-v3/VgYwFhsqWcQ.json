            "text": "Christian Chung asks, on communism, I'm poorly read on far future communist society.  Will autarky be the norm?  I wouldn't necessarily say so.  Autarky means a society which is self-reliant when it comes to resources.  And so usually it's a term for nations, right?  So Nazi Germany, for example, had a policy of autarky.  And they built synthetic refineries and these kind of things to ply their army with oil and rubber and fuel so that they wouldn't have to rely on trade with other nations.  North Korea also follows a policy of self-reliance and autarky and these things.  And they tried to do everything themselves and they tried to build their nation in such a way that They don't have to trade with the outside.  In a far future communist society, I wouldn't say that archarchy would ever be the norm because it doesn't make a lot of sense for community.  I mean, in a far future communist society, I assume you'd be talking about communities, right?  And how, I mean, even to define what a community is in a far future communist society.  Like, yeah, you'd have communities and city districts or whatever, but that any of those would be autarkic, that any of those would be independent from each other and self-reliant and that, like, every city block in the world would have all the resources it would ever need to support itself.  I don't think that that's a realistic goal or even that it's necessarily a goal worth having.  Communism fundamentally is about cooperation instead of competing with each other and being isolated from each other.  So autarchy I don't think is a worthwhile goal to have, especially not in the long run of our future communist society.  Christian also asks, for beginners, what are a couple of ways of describing stateless society?  I think the most important thing is to explain the difference between a state and a government.  A state is, in Marxist theory, it's a tool which is used by the ruling class to oppress the working class, the lower class or classes.  State essentially means that breaking the law is punished with violence, right?  So the police and the military are part of the state, right?  Prisons and the military industrial complex, the military in general are part of the state.  In Leninist theory, the state is upon the abolishment of capitalism and the establishment of a socialist, revolutionary government.  The state is kept around, but it's used to suppress and oppress the former ruling class, right?  So the bourgeoisie, expropriating their wealth and their land and their, you know, their factories and all of that.  taking away power and influence from the rich and the powerful and the wealthy.  But in communism, society is stateless because there are no classes, right?  And without a ruling class to oppress a lower class, right?  If there are no classes, then there's also no need for a state.  That's what the theory is.  And the third and last question from Christian, are you optimistic about the future of socialism in the West within your lifespan?  I'm optimistic about progress in general.  The way I see it is progress can be the tiniest things, right?  So progress can be anything, any action, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant that is.  takes wealth or money or value away from the bourgeois class, the ruling class, the wealthy, the elite, the corporations, and gives it to the lower classes, the poor and the proletarian working class.  Whether that is, you know, striking for increased wages or increasing minimum wage or, you know, lower taxes on the working class, lower prices on foodstuffs, lower prices on these things you know necessary things in general lower rent all of these things which work to save money for the vast majority of people and take money away from those who have so much money that they could not possibly spend all of it within their lifetime even if they actively were trying to spend it all.  that is progress to me right because money is power and of course the goal of socialism and communism is to take power away from the wealthy and the elite and give it to the rest of society, to give it to the vast majority of people, redistribute that wealth and that land and those factories and, you know, the capital.  So to me, progress is happening all the time and progress is all around us.  And I take pleasure in small victories for common people.  I don't look at progress in terms of the establishment of a new socialist republic of Germany or whatever because, no, I don't necessarily feel optimistic about that happening anytime soon, but I'm still optimistic about progress in general because we see progress happening.  We see people around the world waking up to injustice and standing up for themselves and speaking out and saying, this is unfair, this isn't right, we deserve the right to live, to eat, to sleep, to have a roof over our heads.  We deserve the right to have a job with decent pay.  And whenever anything like that happens, whenever a strike happens, where people demand what is rightfully theirs, that to me is progress and that makes me optimistic about the future.  Albert Hilbert asks on communism slash socialism.  I live in China and I hear that socialism and communism is highly suppressed in Europe and US during the Cold War.  How is the situation nowadays?  Are there academic departments of Marxism in universities?  Do people get discriminated or isolated there?  if he reveals himself as a Marxist or socialist?  It is true what you've heard, that communism and socialism were suppressed during the Cold War in the West.  In Sweden, for instance, where I live, there was something called the Black List, which was created by the security police.  They created this list of radical communists who they would then pass out to potential employers, so to capitalist business owners, to warn them not to hire certain people because they had communist beliefs.  And that blacklist policy lasted up until the year 2000.  So nine years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, nine years after the Cold War ended, we still had that Cold War policy in place.  which did legally and actively discriminate against communists.  Of course, in the United States there was COINTELPRO, I believe it was called, the FBI program, which would infiltrate and eventually murder and execute people who were members of left-wing political parties.  The Black Panthers, for instance, famously... The Communist Party USA was infiltrated by the FBI.  Not to mention all of the numerous CIA operations in South America trying to undermine socialist revolutions and politicians in South America.  Salvador Allende, of course, is probably the most famous example when the CIA staged a coup in Chile to overthrow the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende.  And they replaced him with a military dictator, Augusto Pinochet.  And the United States tried to invade Cuba in the Bay of Pigs.  I mean, there's a long, long, long list of the United States trying to overthrow and coup and execute and assassinate communists all over the world and within the United States itself.  So you are definitely correct when you say that communism and socialism were highly suppressed during the Cold War.  We do still see remnants of those policies, especially in the United States.  We still see in Bolivia, for instance, the United States staged a coup in Bolivia to get rid of the very popular socialist Evo Morales.  And in Venezuela, of course, they've been trying for a long time to overthrow Maduro and replace him with Juan Guaid\u00f3.  who is a social democrat, liberal, friendly to the United States.  Of course, in Cuba, the CIA were trying to assassinate Fidel Castro long after the Cold War ended.  Reportedly, they tried something like over 600 times to kill him.  So the United States is definitely still not friendly towards socialism or communism, and they're still continuing with those old Cold War policies of suppressing socialism and communism around the world.  But things have been getting better.  Socialist and communist political parties are for the most part allowed to participate in democratic elections.  Are there any academic departments of Marxism in universities?  There are no... Marxism is not a subject in schools, or really in any universities that I'm aware of.  There aren't really a lot of Marxist professors in universities, in my experience.  I think I had a professor once who was a kind of post-leftist kind of deal, but other than that, no.  What first got me thinking about politics in general was being on Tumblr and seeing a lot of posts from people that I'd followed before and then know them coming out as homosexual or bisexual or transgender and these things.  and i grew up in a very socially conservative part of the country and so i had a lot of backwards views that i'd never questioned about race and gender and sexuality gender roles and that sort of thing.  and so when i started being exposed to people that you know i really liked and i really admired and then them Sharing their experiences and perspectives on gender and sexuality and race I started realizing how wrong I'd been and how kind of fucked up the ideas that I'd had when I was Young had been and so that really got me into the you know LGBT feminist Scene.  so I was kind of like a liberal feminist for a long time really only focusing on identities and trans rights and LGBT rights and gay marriage and that sort of thing.  Then, you know, I started thinking more about class and class issues and capitalism and I sort of became like a socialist, I suppose.  And then I joined RKU, which is Revolutionary Communist Youth.  I was with them for about two years, I think.  Then I eventually became disillusioned with Marxism-Leninism, and I left RKU.  I joined the Left Party instead, which is a lot more multi-tendency, and they also have seats in Parliament, so I just felt like it makes sense to join the biggest left-wing political party instead of being part of a very, you know, tiny youth organization.  I mean as soon as we get a military capable of rivaling the United States and we get territory just any territory whatsoever outside my bedroom and popular support and an economy Once we have all those things, sure.
