Now, this presentation can be split up into several chunks, and we're going to start off with photography and how images are proof of a flat Earth.  Now, do you think he starts off this section by showing photographs that have confused flat Earthers before, maybe like this photograph of the Chicago skyline?  Do you think he maybe produces observer heights and distances that have been verified by independent surveyors?  Do you think he does simple curve calculator calculations to produce data to support his stance?  Or maybe you predicted that he would do exactly what we're about to see.

            "text": "Now, finally, this is a point worth addressing because to the human senses, it very well may seem like that.  And here's why.  So for somebody who's about six foot tall, the horizon is about three miles away.  So simple trigonometry that we learn at school tells us that to see the horizon, we've got to tilt our eyes down by only 0.03 degrees.  Now this is such a small angle that the human brain just can't differentiate that from looking level.  Now Concorde flew about 60,000 feet.  And if we put that into the curve calculator, we'll see that that puts the horizon at just over 300 miles away.  And the very same, very basic trigonometry tells us that from that height, if we're going to look at the horizon, we have to tilt our eyes down by just 2.17 degrees.  Now, if you want to know what that looks like, it looks like this, the angle between the blue and red line here.  Again, almost impossible to detect without proper equipment.  But luckily, we do have proper equipment.  So for the second video on the trot, I'm going to be recommending a Wolfy6020 video.  He is a professional pilot and this is the view from his cockpit as he's using state-of-the-art technology to show the horizon drop.  This video is linked in the description and I suggest you go and watch it.  And it appears that the view of the horizon from a plane isn't the only thing that debunks a globe earth.  Apparently flight paths do as well.  That's all Manny's going to go on and explain.  Until he gets debunked by a member of his own audience. ",

You know, ask yourself, would it be cheaper to have one plane fly all three routes or three planes each flying those routes individually?  Who knows?

Now, what you've got to realize is that when we turn a globe into a flat map, you distort the picture.  And that means that the fastest path between these two points on a globe is anything but your red line.  Anyway, don't listen to me.

And it turns out that with this one particular flight path on a flat earth map, that's exactly what happens.
