            "text": "Hello and welcome to the Data Dividend Project.  Your data is yours and if anyone makes any money off it, it should be you.  Thank you for trusting us to fight for your data rights.  All we need from you is your name, address, phone number, date of birth, and whatever old email addresses you think you used.  After you give us those things, we will go to the tech companies and say, hey look, you owe... these people their fair share of the money you've made off of their data.  If you're in California, Nevada, you could see a check very, very soon because they already have laws in the books.  And if you're not in those states, we're going to work with the state legislators where you live to get those laws on the books so you can get your fair share.  Welcome to the Data Dividend Project.  Thank you for entrusting us to fight for your data rights.  Let's get it done and let's get you your data dividend check. ",
