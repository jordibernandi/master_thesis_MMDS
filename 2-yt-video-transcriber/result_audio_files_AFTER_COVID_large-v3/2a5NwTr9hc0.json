            "text": "hey what's up everybody?  this is Dante Fortson here with episode number eight of asking Israelite.  today's question is what is the black Hebrew Israelite awakening?  and before I get to that I just want you guys to know that asking Israelite is your chance to connect with the Israelite community.  feel free to post your comments and questions in the comments section under this video and I will get back to them as soon as possible.  make sure you like this video give it a thumbs up and make sure you subscribe if you like what we're doing with the outreach and make sure you click the notification bell if you want to be notified of these videos or any other videos that are posted to my channel.  so before we get started i'm going to give you the disclaimer.  as i always do i do not speak for all israelites.  that's super important so please do not contact me asking me to speak on behalf of the entire israelite community.  i don't.  the views and opinions expressed in this video are my own.  I am NOT associated with any BHI camp or denomination and I identify as an Israelite by birth.  all right so what is the black Hebrew awakening all about?  that is a question probably the the most asked question.  people don't know what this whole thing is about and so there's a lot of confusion a lot of misinformation and this comes from several verses in the Bible.  I'm gonna give you a couple here today just so you can kind of get a general idea.  if you want some more in-depth information I encourage you to check out the videos on my site.  so here's one I'm gonna start reading here and it shall come to pass.  when all these things are come upon thee the blessings and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the Lord thy God have driven thee and thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God and shall obey his voice according to all that.  I command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul that when that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whether the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.  that's from Deuteronomy 30 verses 1 through 3. this is after they have left Egypt.  in the Exodus so many people have pointed out that there is an awakening going on.  we're digging up information we're looking into the history and we're seeing that what we're presented with today as the nation of Israel does not match the historical description nor the biblical narrative.  and so this awake awakening is happening among people or descendants of the transatlantic slave trade that the information has been false that we're awakening and many of us are turning back to the Bible not as taught by Europeans but the truth of the Bible.  we're recognizing the ethnicity we're recognizing the geography we're recognizing everything the full truth of the Bible.  we're not sugarcoating it we're not trying to adapt it and some Israelites have turned back to trying to follow the law.  the intent is that all of us are on the same page as far as what we believe needs to happen.  we all believe that we need to turn back to God.  how that's done is where we don't always agree.  however we all agree that we need to turn back to the Most High in order to call him back and so that he'll return and remove us from the land of our captivity.  so here's another verse that we are basing some of this on again.  there's lots of verses.  this is just a general overview.  it doesn't do the entire movement justice but it does give you a somewhat of an idea of what's going on.  therefore fear thou not O my servant Jacob saith the Lord neither be dismayed O Israel for lo I will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid.  Jeremiah 30 verse 10. now many people have pointed out that what's going on in Israel right now could not have possibly been the return from captivity because they have no history of being in captivity.  they have no history of being.
