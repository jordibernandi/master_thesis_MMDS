            "text": "Hello Facebook.  We are looking.  This is so cool.  We're looking at the.  I'm going to show you what we're looking at right here.  It's the SDO AIA 171 on June the 9th 2020 and this right here.  Let me look.  I'm going to show you right here.  Look at this thing right here.  It's black.  It's getting ready to get blasted down by these old plasma from the Sun.  Look at that.  Is that not cool?  And we also have some little black wigglies that are over here to look at these.  These are those black wiggly things right here.  You may say where am I looking while you're looking at?  let me get the cursor here.  I got to find the cursor.  I can't see my cursor.  Yeah, right here.  These black wiggly things.  and if you've ever looked at the Sun years past, thank you for those hearts flying up the screen.  You will see that there's like been like a great big long one of these like attached to the Sun and like a big old round UFO attached to it.  But this is also one of those right here.  Look at that.  Watch what happens when this, okay, it's getting ready to happen.  It's going to get a big blast.  come out of the sun and knock it down.  There's like a big old.  I don't know.  I just like got squashed and it's all wiggly.  Look at that.  There it is.  It's a solid black like a big old black string like thing.  I believe it's some kind of living thing.  But the thing comes out of the sun, this plasma literally blasts it right down, knocks it down.  Look at that.  Is that not amazing?  It is absolutely amazing.  And I'm just sitting here finding myself when I saw this.  This is how I relax.  I go on the SWA, SWA, and I look at their products because I think this is so relaxing for me.  And then I saw that and I thought, now wait a minute.  What just came out of that sun that knocked that thing down?  It literally got pelted.  It ain't coming back up.  So yeah, they knocked it completely down.  And when it falls, you can see it has like two pieces of it like falls.  It like splits in half when it falls down.  Let's watch it like this again.  You'll watch it get ready to split in half.  Boom.  Did you see it like broke off?  It had like two arms or something stuck to the sun with its probes in there.  That's really what it looks like.  Two antennae like things.  This thing right here attached to the sun because it gets knocked down and you can see it breaks in two.  Boom.  Did you all see that?  Yeah, that's what happened.  This is the sun.  This is a solar.  I guess this supposed to been like a solar flare that came out or plasma or something.  But this black thing right here is what I'm focusing on.  It literally gets pelted from what comes out of the sun right now.  Watch it.  And when it falls down, you'll see it had a great big.  it had like one of its extensions over here and one of its extensions over here and that big old blast of plasma or something came out.  and boom it knocked it straight down.  You can see it when it falls.  It's absolutely amazing.  It is amazing and it's so cool.  Boom just like that.  It's like oh my gosh, you got to be kidding.  This is this is better than a movie.  Yeah, this is a real life.  It's like there is a battle going on up here.  This black thing is trying to get into whatever this is and I think it's like a ship or something up there.  and it's got its probes.  It's got its antennae things sticking in there.  boom because it comes down in two pieces.  It's forked at the end.  Is what it's like.  It's like oh my gosh.  Yeah.  Yeah it is amazing.  It really is.  And this is.  We're looking at the SDO AIA 171.  On June the 9th.  It's really cool.  I watched this over and over and over and over.  And I thought oh how cool is that.  I would encourage you to go to the iswa.nasa.gov.  And you check out this product.  Because you can see for yourself.  It is too cool.  Happened today.  So there is a battle going on up there.  There is something going on.  And this thing had its probe stuck into the sun.  And it knocked it out.  Boom.  Just like that.  Like a big old branches.  And then you have these other things over here.  Yeah.  And I apologize for using my cell phone.  But I can zoom up.  See now.  Look.  See here's some more of those black things right here.  Right here.  And you can see like some kind of white thing inside these hoes.  But these black things look see look it's like boom.  There's a fork like here.  It's like forked.  if they're forked or something is so weird, but that's pretty cool.  getting ready to knock it out.  Yeah.  It is the Sun.  I don't know what it is.  It's some kind of form of alien life, I guess.  I don't know, but it's about to get pelted and knocked off.  Boom.  You see that it just got knocked straight off of there.  Yeah.  It is just too amazing.  And this right here, for some reason, you know, I think my video should have been darker, but it's not dark on here.  I just wanted to zoom up on that and I'll try to look down inside here.  See what was going on.  I went.  it fell down boom.  It literally broke.  It's something solid is what it was something solid and it got knocked down into the sun.  You have to look down underneath here.  What's been trying to see?  see it.  Look at it extending out down there.  It is literally coming up from the bottom, but it's going to get itself knocked down.  Boom.  No, this ain't no solar whim.  It's something attached to the Sun.  It's got its probes stuck in there.  I think there's probably a ship back there a ship in the Sun and it like knocked it straight down.  That's the only thing I can think of is getting ready to get knocked down.  Boom.  There it flew.  It fell right out.  So yeah, so you can see this is a great big solar flare on the sun.  Yeah, it is nice.  It is cool to watch.  If you like this kind of things, I love it.  I really do.  I think it's so exciting.  Yeah, it's a great great day to wind down after working in my garden and get to do what I enjoy.  Boom.  It literally like it's like a something came like a weapon came from up there.  Knocked it off.  It is so interesting.  It is lovely.  It's exciting.  And again, this is the SDO AIA 171 on June the 9th of 2020.  It's a NASA product used for boom.  You seen it knocked it down.  It's it's available to the public for study and observation.  And you can see here's two more right here and you can see something inside of there.  These things are tethered to the sun.  Yes, like a tether thing.  I don't know, but it's going to.  it's going to get itself knocked down.  Watch it fall.  Boom.  It is an object.  It is an object is getting knocked down.  It's probably some type of a life form is probably what it is.  Yeah.  I just can't get over and that's why I just had to keep watching it.  Keep watching it get knocked down.  Look how it fell.  You know, it's like, oh my gosh, what are you all doing up there in that Sun?  You fighting a battle up there?  I believe you are.  Yeah, it is Gemma young and so it's so exciting.  It really is going to see it get knocked down.  And you can go look at this yourself over and over and watch it because it's just so exciting.  It fell with a great big boom.  It really did and what it fell into.  I don't know, but we can see it here.  And I won't keep you on here for too much longer.  I'm probably going to end this video because I know I said somebody might get tired of looking at it, but I just watch it over and over.  I could watch it all night long.  Watch it fall down because it literally falls down.  It has one big body.  Let's say it has big body and then at the end it has like two Arms reaching out into the sun.  It's like stuck inside there that both those arms are like.  there's an arm that is stuck over here and here but it's about ready to get pulled out of the sun out of this ship or whatever it had attached itself to and I'm sure there's some kind of a Star Trek movie or something where some kind of thing gets inside of ships like that.  I bet there is some kind of black stuff.  We're watching the the SDO AIA NASA.  It's the sun.  this black thing right here is getting ready to get knocked down.  When it comes down, it has two extensions that were like stuck inside here.  I think there's a ship in here or something or it was trying to suck the energy out.  Look at it.  Yeah, so it's going to get sucked.  It's going to get knocked down.  It's had enough.  They shoot a flare.  They shoot something out from up here and they push it down and get watch.  It's getting ready to fall.  Boom, it covers it completely in the plasma.  Yeah.  So yeah, you go to that site, the iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov.  It's a products, a NASA weather space analysis.  The International Space Weather Analysis System is what this is.  You can see it fall.  It's falling.  That's me.  I got to flip this camera back around because it's dark and you're not going to be able to see me in the dark.  Whoa, Gina, turn off that light.  How am I going to get this light off?  I got to flip this.  Oh my gosh, you are.  I can't get this light off of here.  How am I going to do this?  Shoot.  Wouldn't that be about right?  Okay, I think I got it.  There I am right here.  Hello.  Yeah.  Oh, crud.  How am I going to get it off?  You know what I'm going to do?  Well, we can even see it.  We can see it brighter.  Let's see.  You see it got flashed out.  I got to get this off of here.  I'm going to have to end this video because I don't know how to get this thing off of here.  Okay, I did.  I guess I did.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, you're very welcome.  Yeah, check that out yourself because it is the coolest looking thing to watch this thing.  come get smashed boom and it falls down with the two forks. ",
