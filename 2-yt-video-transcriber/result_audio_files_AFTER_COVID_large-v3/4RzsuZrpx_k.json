            "text": "Hi, my name is Mike and I wanted to share an older message from God given to Brother Jeff Barley.  It's called The Three Days of Darkness and the Transformation of the Remnant Bride.  The reason I want to read this one is because I feel it's very near.  It was given on 4-7-19.  And this is how it starts.  On Sunday 4-7-19, the Lord began to give me a revelation in the scripture about the transformation of his remnant bride that I was to share with a small group that meets in my home on Monday nights.  In my time alone with the Lord.  this morning, 4-10-19, He let me know that he wanted me to speak for him on my blog about this and about the three days of darkness.  Although there has been much said about this in the prophetic community right now, not all of it is truth.  This is what the Lord spoke to me.  This is how it starts.  my son i want you to speak to my people because the enemy has brought confusion and mixture to my remnant bride.  once again.  my people are not discerning my voice correctly.  the three days of darkness will indeed happen again.  I will tell you about this so that you do not fear now or when it happens.  Understand my word.  What is happening now has happened before and what will happen in the future has happened before because God makes the same things happen over and over again.  That's Ecclesiastes 3.15.  And I said it again here, for God speaks not only once, but more than once, even though men do not regard it as Job 33, 14.  Also, all of you need to remember this verse, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever as Hebrews 13, 8. i do what i have done in the past again and again because it is how i operate and it's part of who i am.  the better you get to know me the more you will understand this fact.  the three days of darkness will happen again just as it did during the time that my people israel were held captive in egypt.  Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that darkness may come over the land of Egypt, a darkness which is so awful may be felt.  So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and for three days a thick darkness was all over the land of Egypt.  The Egyptians could not see one another, nor did anyone leave his place for three days.  But all the Israelites had light in their dwellings.  as exodus 10 21-23. my people will have light in their dwellings during the coming three days of darkness as well.  my people will not need candles.  there is no need to fear in my people.  i will protect those who are mine.  candles will be needed by those who do not know me.  those who who do not know me will be in great fear because they will not understand what is happening.  If there are unbelievers in your household, offer to pray with them and encourage them to seek me and surrender to me, and I will save them.  Come, my people, enter your chambers and shut your doors behind you.  Hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment until the incarnation is passed, as in Isaiah 26.20.  Then my people shall be healed, strengthened and empowered by my glory and sent out.  Covering your windows will help prevent fear of the things happening outside, especially for unbelievers and children.  But this will not protect you, I will.  The darkness will be both physical and spiritual, and there will be evil entities outside of your dwelling.  But do not fear.  the movie bird box was made to cause fear.  the enemy loves fear.  unbelievers do not have any power over this darkness just like in the movie but my own do if you know me and have on your spiritual armour of light and evil and darkness will not harm you.  For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.  Therefore take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  That's in Ephesians 6, 12-13.  The sign of Jonah was a sign to those who witnessed my first coming and to those who witnessed my second coming.  Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.  But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.  For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  Just as Jonah and I experienced three days of darkness, so will this wicked generation.  These days of darkness will be caused by the destroyer of nations, you can read Jeremiah 4, 7, or what is now called Nibiru or Planet X. This is my instrument of judgment that I've used again and again.  This time will be the harshest ever.  This is written in the book of Revelation 6, 12 to 17. i looked when he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood.  and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth as a fig-tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.  then the sky receded as a scroll when it rolled back up and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.  And the kings of the earth, the great men and the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves, in the rocks and the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath has come, and who is able to stand?  This generation will see my return, but before that they will be given 40 days to repent, just as Nineveh was, which is the same amount of time that I walked the earth after my resurrection from the dead.  First the dead shall rise, and then my remnant bride will be transformed.  Out of the gross, thick darkness they will arise and shine.  Those who are transformed will be given forty days to bring in the end-time harvest and share me with all that will listen.  They will be empowered, will be overflowing with my power and glowing with my glory.  This will be the time of the greater works.  No one will stop them.  no man, no weapon, no sickness, no demon, no giant, no angel, no beast, and not even Satan himself, for they will have an anointing without measure.  After their work is done, then I shall take them to be with me forever, and they will sing to me in their brightest white robes that have been washed in my blood.  Amen.  Blessing and glory and wisdom, thanksgiving and honour and power might be to our God forever and ever.  Amen.  Revelation 7, 12.  My people, I tell you now, stop concentrating on the darkness and focus on the light.  I am the light.  Your fear comes from the fact that you know you are living in sin.  Put away your deeds of darkness and clothe yourselves with my robe of righteousness.  Cry out to me now and I will help you overcome your sin.  I never asked you to do it alone.  I hate self-righteousness.  Ask me to help you and I will.  I gave my life so that you could have it and I have it more abundantly.  Receive all that my spirit has for you.  I want you to swim in the ocean of my spirit.  That's how much I have for you.  The transformation is coming sooner than most think because they are concerned with the things of this world.  Do not be one of those whose hearts fail them for fear of the things that I see coming upon the earth.  The darkness is only a small part of which is coming.  Be transformed daily by my Spirit, and I will finish the work that I have begun in you at the appointed time.  and scripture given first john three two to three.  beloved now we are children of god and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be but we know that when we he is revealed we shall be like him for we shall all see him as he is and everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure your coming king yeshua jesus.  and just want to add a note uh regarding the three days of darkness.  some might say uh hold on doesn't say three days of darkness.  in the bible In Matthew 24, it does say something along them lines.  Let me just show you here.  And it says here, the sign of Jonah was given.  to the scribes and the pharisees it says teacher show us a sign.  it said no sign will be given except the sign of the prophet jonah.  for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish so will the son of man be in the three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  and in matthew 24 it says the sign of the son of man that will be shown.  sign of the son of man.  three days and three nights of darkness because it was the sign of jonah but became the sign of the son of man.  three days and three nights of darkness.  so it's in matthew 24 and i'll leave um the scripture in the in the comments box and also um the transcript to this message.  um Okay, I'll leave it there and say, anyone out there who hasn't come to Lord Jesus, please do so in prayer and repentance.  God bless you all.  Bye-bye. ",
