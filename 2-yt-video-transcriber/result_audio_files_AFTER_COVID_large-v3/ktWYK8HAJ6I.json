I mean look, another day, another indignity for the straight white man.  Here's the thing about reverse racism, it's a figment, it's a phantom.  It's summoned up by white people who think that talking about race is the same thing as perpetuating racism.  Maybe it's because whiteness as it is now is not something active or propositional.  It is the blank space against which everything else is defined. ",

Hello, welcome to this week's edition of Novara FM on Resonance 104.4.  Today we'll be discussing the invention of whiteness.  How can we locate the origins of whiteness as an identity, as the apex of a system of racial domination, as a set of cultural markers in various points in history?  Let's think about what happens when we racialize the working class as white.  Specifically, let's think about what whiteness is doing here.  I mean, that's the thing is that whiteness has to be read retrospectively.  We'll be talking about how whiteness can be defined and why this particular statement of an essentialized characteristic of human nature emerged as a method of social control. ",

Whiteness as a composite, so rather a single process of racialisation against a single tangible racial other.  One of the things that I found really interesting was that when white people were confronted with the increase in incidences of racist street harassment, they were really casual about it.  The real beef is the idea that white people might not be welcome in all spaces.  But rather than talking about whiteness as something tangible, framed it as a set of interactions they had with various racial others at different points in history.  But communism is back, baby, and it's back because Ash Sarkar I understand that lots of white people feel annoyed by the idea that they benefit somehow from their whiteness or that the presence of white people automatically means the presence of racism.  I really understand that.  But with all love and all kindness, this really isn't about you.  whiteness is what matters.  white people and everyone else white people on the basis of their race will never be discriminated against indicate an anxiety that whiteness being outnumbered is under attack by ever increasing numbers of people of color whose very existence is threatening Minority, majority, what does that mean?

For me, the metaphor that I find useful for thinking about whiteness as a composite is Isaac Newton's 18th century experiments with light.  And at the time, the scientific consensus was that white was the purest form of light.  It wasn't made up of anything else.  And through his use of prisms, he found out that actually it was a composite of every single color of the spectrum.  That's the way I like to think of whiteness.  It's a composite of every process of racialisation that white people have imposed on their racial others.  This next bit is just for the white people.  now, so viewers of Colour go make a cuppa or listen to D'Angelo.  A team mapping ancient DNA at the Natural History Museum presented evidence that the Cheddar Man had dark to black skin, black curly hair and blue eyes, rather than fair skin and light hair.
