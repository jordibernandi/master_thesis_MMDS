One of the reasons why a lot of guys are scared to say sexually provocative things to women, because they're scared they're gonna upset a good girl's sexual sensibilities.  Newsflash, no fucking good girls in today's society.  There might be, in the way I say, there might be 1%, 2%, maybe being generous, 3%, 4% of women who are saving themselves for their husband for marriage.  But today, women are fucking at the age of 11, 12, 13 years old.  There's women by the time they're 25, they've been fucking for 10 years.  I know that guy's sitting there right now.  Damn, this guy does keep it real.  Shh. ",
