It's an adventure that took place not just in the month of July, but rather one that took place in the last decade.  We all here and the people listening in today had the opportunity to share that adventure over its developing and unfolding in the past months and years.  It's our privilege today to share with you some of the details of that final month of July.  that was certainly the highlight for the three of us of that decade.  We're going to divert a little bit from the format of past press conferences and talk about the things that interested us most, in particular the things that occurred on and about the moon.  We will use a number of films and and slides, which most of you have already seen, ",

The flight, as you know, started promptly.  And I think that was characteristic of all the events of the flight.  The Saturn gave us one magnificent ride, both into Earth orbit and on a trajectory to the moon.  Our memory of that actually differs little from the reports that you have all heard from those previous Saturn V flights.  And the previous flights served us well in preparation for this flight in the boost as well as the subsequent phases.  We would like to skip directly to the Translunar Coast phase and remind ourselves of the long chain of events that actually permitted a landing, starting with the undockings The transposition and docking sequence.
