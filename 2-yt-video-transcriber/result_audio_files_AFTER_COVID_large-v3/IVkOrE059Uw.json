At the same time, they're scaling back police coverage in the name of fighting coronavirus.  In other words, they're actively making the public less safe.  Maybe they need to.  We can debate that.  But what they don't need to do is what they're also doing, and that's keeping people from protecting themselves.  In those same counties, gun stores have been ordered to close down.  The NRA recently sued California to block those closures.  Jason Ouimet is executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action in Washington.  He joins us tonight.  Jason, thanks so much for coming on. ",

And it's just kind of crazy to think that during a time when people would most need access to a firearm for defense of self, for defense of family, for defense of property.  that there'd be politicians that are looking to restrict that or to make them non-essential.  And the hypocrisy of this is even greater that in those exact places, liquor stores are open and deemed essential, but your right of self-defense or your access to exercise your right of self-defense is deemed non-essential.  And we further get to get into a look of how dangerous some of these, quote, common sense gun control bills that have been passed in some of these states are right now.  One of the biggest one is the universal background check.  The fact that you can't transfer a firearm in a state that has universal background checks if you don't have dealers that are open to process those.  There is no way for a lawful individual to transfer a firearm lawfully to another individual.  And we all know that the criminals are obviously, as you mentioned, not going to abide by the law, and they're going to be out there continuing to break the law.  And you've really locked down the right of self-defense for a number of Americans. ",

So in other words, you're stripping people of their right to self-defense, to self-reliance, to independence, and then you just hope they can hit the weed store often enough that they don't notice.  I mean, do you see something ominous about this combination of moves, or is that just me? ",
