And like you said, like we've been saying now for years at this point, you've been running crazy as white people.  She said the thing we always say, one day you're going to roll up on the right one.  She said, I am.  The right one.  Right.  But there's so much going on in that video, brother.  I mean, the ironies.  Here, this white woman is with a mask on.

And like when the man says, she's down, that sister right there has not only put herself in danger, but I'll end with this.  Like Claude McCabe, when he wrote If We Must Die, it was during the Red Summer, brothers.  The big conflagration that happened in Chicago that summer, the race war that took place in Chicago, it is attested that they were throwing rocks at a black kid trying to swim in the river in Lake Michigan, and they started throwing rocks at him, and next thing you know, everything sets off.
