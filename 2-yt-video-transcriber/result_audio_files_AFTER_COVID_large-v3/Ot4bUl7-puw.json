            "text": "What do you think of when I say babies?  Little fingers and toes?  Happy gurgles and giggles?  But we have been sold the story that the most innocent members of our society are stealing our freedom.  Mothers everywhere have been told to turn on the children growing within their wombs and have been guided to take their lives.  Today is the day where we stand up and say we are pro-life.  There's a lot of talk about abortion today.  My Body, My Choice and Shout Your Abortion have become calling cards for the pro-choice movement.  This movement has created a narrative in which infants are the thieves of our futures and should be done away with when inconvenient.  They've used words that are meant to make us feel more comfortable when talking about taking the life of an innocent child in its mother's womb.  They've coddled us into hearing the word abortion and not really listening to what it means.  They say it's just a fetus, so we think of it as something other than a baby.  They call it an abortion or a termination, so they can avoid saying it's the taking of human life.  Murder.  A baby's life begins at fertilization.  The sperm and the egg meet and immediately begin to create a new little human.  A baby's heartbeat begins at three weeks.  At three weeks, its DNA has defined its eye color, its height, every inch of its appearance.  The pro-choice movement will tell you that it doesn't look like a baby, but it already has a separate and distinct DNA from its mother.  The pro-choice movement will tell you it doesn't look like a baby.  but its heartbeat has already begun.  The pro-choice movement will tell you it doesn't look like a baby, but it is one.  Most women don't even know they're pregnant when their unborn child's heart has begun to beat.  At nine weeks, a baby is sucking its thumb.  Think about it like this.  More than 60 million American children have been aborted since 1973.  As a young woman in 2020, you have been told that abortion should always be an option.  Federal law allows infants to be aborted, terminated, murdered up until the moment of birth.  That means a baby will be injected with a substance that causes cardiac arrest as the mother is induced to deliver her stillborn baby.  So the child simply isn't inconvenient.  Human lives are not inconvenient.  As a young woman in 2020, you've been told that you get to choose what happens to your body.  That's true.  You get to choose what happens with your body, but you don't get to choose what happens with someone else's body.  That little baby with DNA that's been separate from your own since conception.  As a young woman in 2020, you've been told that pregnancy is hard, hard enough to warrant the killing of your own child.  Pregnancy can be difficult.  Tearing a baby from the warmth of its mother's womb in pieces is worse.  Just because a baby in the womb can't speak for itself doesn't mean we have the right to take its life before it's born.  Imagine not being able to speak as the decision of your life or death was decided without your consent merely because you existed at all.  But instead of being taught to protect our most vulnerable, We are told to destroy them.  As a young woman in 2020, you have been told that it's not a baby at all.  It's just a bundle of cells, or worse, a parasite.  But here's the thing.  You are its mother.  You are growing another person inside of you who depends on your love and care to grow into a little person.  And babies do feel pain at the latest by 20 weeks, but some studies show as early as 12 weeks.  As a young woman in 2020, you have been told that being pro-life is anti-woman.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  You are pro-woman's rights, and that includes the rights of unborn women everywhere.  Today, women are misled into choosing their desires over the very lives of their unborn children.  To lead a life constantly pursuing pleasure after pleasure as they constantly grow more and more fleeting.  To live in the perpetual present with no meaning in sight.  and to sacrifice the inestimable value of human life for empty freedom.  There is no worse tragedy for mother and child.  When a woman fights her own instincts and instead listens to those who tell her to choose her desires over her own child, she has been victimized into leaving behind the role she was born to play.  Mother. ",
