            "text": "Yeah.  So traditionally, I work within emergency medicine and I have been a doctor now for 14 years.  And this year it was planned.  even before Covid, that I'd be working in intensive care, just part of the way that my training was going.  It just so happened that this year Covid happened as I started ITU and it was.  I work in North Wales, in Bangor.  I've worked many years in London.  And every winter, yes, it's always been challenging.  It's always been tough.  I've even made, because I also make films and do broadcast.  So over the years, I was no stranger to speaking about the winter crisis, the challenges that we're facing in A&E, the existential threat to emergency medicine all the winters.  This year has been off the scale.  That's for sure.  I'm talking more generally.  I'm not talking specific to my own hospital now.  I'm talking about generally.  I've got all of my siblings work within the NHS.  Five of us are doctors, one's pharmacist.  We share notes.  Most of my other siblings work in London.  It's been incredibly hard.  My sister's a GP.  She works in the urgent care centre in Queen's Hospital in Romford, one of the areas in London, wide London, that's been hit incredibly hard.  She talked about an evening of work when every single patient that she saw out of her 14 patients she saw on that shift were COVID patients.  She told me about grown men in tears, crying in their 40s.  We're not talking about people with other comorbidities or elderly.  40s, young, in tears, in bits with the symptoms of COVID.  But every single patient... that she saw was COVID.  and I'll hasten to add what I have learned about COVID and how devastating it is to the individual is not.  yes I thought I had a good grasp of it from my work as a clinician but It really, really hit me when my own dad caught COVID two weeks ago, just before Christmas, actually.  He caught COVID and demonstrated some of the first signs of it.  We then spent the following week in hospital and his decline was enormous.  unbelievable it.  he deteriorated so fast so so fast and this was during the period of time when my sister was working downstairs in the urgent care of Queen's Hospital and my dad was a patient on the third or fourth floor in Queen's Hospital and we were keeping in contact with each other but my father's decline was rapid.  it was like nothing I've ever seen.  to be honest because I was with him I was fortunate enough to be able to be bedside with him.  I know this is something that not everyone has the opportunity to but the reason I was allowed is because my dad has a carer because he had a paralysis in one hand.  And so for him to have a carer was normal.  We had a full-time carer at home.  Because of that existing requirement, they allow a carer to be with patients in that category.  So I negotiated to stay with my dad.  I was there for five days, bedside, 24 hours a day, And I didn't leave for various reasons.  Number one, I was too terrified to leave him on his own.  Number two, I didn't want to cause any other risk to anyone else.  So when I went into that room, I stayed in that room in full PPU for five days.  It was one of the most harrowing things I've ever done.  And I come from a place of knowledge and experience.  I saw my dad deteriorate over five days, going from someone who could talk to me to who then couldn't actually cope with having the mask on because he ended up with a CPAP, that tight fitting mask on his face for five days.  He couldn't even take it off to have a sip of water.  We had to work out methods between me and the nurse of rapidly coordinating mask off, squirt some fluid in with a syringe, mask back on.  And we had to do it like a pit stop.  It was awful.  he couldn't cope with having that mask off for more than five seconds.  that even the thought of having it off was causing him great anxiety.  let me describe what it looked like when you did take it off.  it looked like someone who is either drowning and thrashing for air because they're drowning or someone who's had a plastic bag placed over their head and the oxygen and air starts to deplete and you then see them thrash about.  That's what it was like when you took the mask off.  I'm being graphic because I think it's important that people know what this looks like.  I think the majority of the public, unless they are those that have suffered it, have been shielded from seeing what it actually looks like to cause them enough fear to behave in a way that would protect themselves.  So for example, After just yesterday, just yesterday, I was shopping in my local Sainsbury's in the Olympic Village that Boris Johnson cycled to.  And there were people coming into the Sainsbury's without masks on.  And I and some of them were even handle.  So there was a woman without a mask handling cash with the cashier.  I asked the supervisor about this and he said, well, We actually can't do anything about it.  Just yesterday, someone verbally abused us.  And now we're just too afraid to say anything.  I think the public have been really shielded.  If they had seen what I had seen with my father, they would not be behaving in this way because they could risk that happening to them or to their loved ones.  If they're not bothered about it happening to other people that they don't know.  I think.  I think, as I said, for 14 years as a doctor and two weeks ago, some of the most harrowing things I've seen in medicine and it happened to be my father.  Sadly, my father died on the 28th of December.  We're still coming to terms with this.  I still feel enormous guilt that I wasn't able to protect him.  enormous guilt that I look after other COVID patients.  I'm always giving advice to others on how to protect themselves.  And even though my father was shielding, somehow it got in.  I mean, this is, you can't negotiate with COVID.  There's no discussions to be had with it.  If you are not careful and respectful of it or catching it, it will win.  It will win.  It will win on a number of ways.  It will make you ill.  It will incapacitate you, it will be debilitating, it will risk others from catching it, and it might strip you of your ability to breathe properly for a while, it could kill you.  I just, I think, you know, whilst I was there, bedside with my father, and we were on this tier four scheme, Someone said to me, oh, we're going into tier five.  I thought it was a joke.  I thought it was a joke.  I said, well, why stop at five?  Call it any number you want.  It's not damn working.  Whatever you're doing is not working.  I will talk about what I witnessed at Queen's Hospital.  I saw staff on their knees.  You know, they were exhausted.  An intensive care doctor came to review my dad because just knowing what I knew, I knew that... He was critically ill.  He was extremely ill.  He was on a covid ward.  He was on maximum therapy.  I. You know, the only place left to go was intensive care.  So he was assessed, but he was not for intensive care.  This level of treatment was still.  the treatment was still the same.  It just wasn't within the intensive care unit.  We discussed it.  We agreed.  And frankly, they had no room.  They had no room.  for a patient like my father with all the other factors put in, they had no room.  And the ITU doctor that came to assess my dad, she'd been on shift since eight in the morning.  She came to see us at five.  She had been scheduled to see us at one.  She hadn't eaten or had a break all day.  This was five o'clock in the afternoon, you know, I don't know what she was running on.  She was incredible.  I obviously was extremely upset.  She even had space and empathy to sit down by me and comfort me in my worry and my grief because I knew what was coming.  This pandemic, COVID, has been managed and controlled by the sheer determination, the sheer professionalism, the goodwill, the dedication of the staff.  has been hampered by the government, I'm afraid, by their turns, by their chopping and changing, by their indecisiveness, by their efforts to just play catch up.  They have two things.  They have two really important things.  They have time.  And they had warnings.  They had time looking ahead to the winter right from wave one.  They had warnings about what will happen in the winter.  They couldn't make up their minds about Christmas, for goodness sake.  Obviously, it's like you could have sat there like Gypsy Rose with your crystal ball and said, Two weeks after Christmas, it's going to be really bad.  Guess what?  Two weeks after Christmas, it was really bad.  We weren't joking.  We weren't just scaremongering.  This was real.  And that's really tragic.  That's really tragic.  If we didn't know, fair enough.  But we knew.  We are where we thought we would be.  I just hope one day that there's accountability because there are over 100,000 people and over 100,000 families like me.  And I feel connected to them in a way that I never thought.  But I do hope, you know, the very basics that can be done.  I'm not for, you know, curbing people's freedoms and liberties at all.  But this isn't something that we can negotiate with or, you know, be soft about.  If we've got to help people stick to the rules so that the infection rates can fall then I think we need to help them do that.  and that means things like you're not wearing a mask you're not going shopping.  how badly do you want to go shopping?  how badly do you need your groceries?  well put on a damn mask then.  I'm sorry I'm being angry but it just beggars belief.  I'm sorry I've gone on and spoken. ",
