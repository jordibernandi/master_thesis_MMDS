Let's discuss now.  Andrew Yang is here, the former Democratic presidential candidate who during the campaign had a plan to put money in Americans' pockets.  Also seen in political commentator Catherine Rampell and Anthony Scaramucci, the former director of communications in the Trump White House.  So good to have all of you on this evening.  Catherine, Treasury Secretary warning that the unemployment rate could hit 20% amid this global pandemic.  I mean, that is wholly, you know what, that number. ",

Some private sector indicators that have come out, not from the government.  So you have like open table restaurant reservation numbers showing that they're down something like two thirds year over year for a bunch of cities.  That was even before there were mandatory closures of restaurants.  There's zero now.  So we have some numbers trickling in suggesting the scale of this, but we just really don't know.  To put in context that 20% unemployment number, though, the unemployment rate during the Great Recession peaked at about 10%.  And during the Great Depression, it peaked around 25%.  So if, in fact, that estimate is correct, it's truly terrifying. ",

Hotels, cruise ships, bars, restaurants, movie theaters, personal training, nail salons, like it just goes on and on.  So 20% unemployment, to me, is what we need to avoid.  And the tough truth is that we need to put money into Americans' hands as fast as possible so that families can even feed themselves and weather this storm.  But even after this money goes into people's hands, it's not going to revive small businesses around the country.  It's not going to revive all of these restaurants and bars that employ many, many people in every community.  This is going to be terrible.  It's going to be less terrible if we plow money into people's hands as quickly as possible. ",

I just personally think it's not enough.  And when I did the calculations today in World War Two, Don, we spent 20 percent of the GDP in deficit spending.  We are now fighting an invisible virus globally.  And we need a $3.2 trillion stimulus.  $800 for the Andrew Yang program.  That's $3,000 per adult.  $1,500 for children.  This is for people below making $85,000 a year.  They need a $2 trillion stimulus.  gift and granting or lending program for large and small businesses around the United States.  And the large businesses have to commit to no layoffs and no share buybacks.  And then the last piece of this is $150 billion going to the nation's hospitals and to create hospital tents where they're going to be necessary. ",

And I think this would put the United States in a economic pole position for the next five or 10 years if we don't let the economy right now fall off the cliff.  And remember, at these interest rates, borrowing the $3.2 trillion It's roughly $100 billion a year.  And we need to do this.  They're not thinking big enough.

I want to talk about that.  But I just want to bring it to the table, because I agree that we don't want the economy to fall off a cliff.  But here's what people are asking.  Where's all this money going to come from?  Either of you guys can weigh in.  Where's all this money going to come from?  Because... We look back at the airlines.  The airlines got, you know, and many of these businesses got these huge tax cuts from this administration.  And they used the money to buy back their own stocks.  They used it to enrich themselves.  They didn't go back out into the economy as the administration had promised.  Even the airlines from the last, when they got the bailout money or they got help, they took the gas tax.  They added it to the customers, right?  They took the money that you do when you have to pay for your luggage.  Those became baked in.  They never let those go once the economy got great again.  So people, I mean, honestly, they're not feeling sorry for these businesses.  They're not feeling sorry for the airlines.  And they say, why are you bailing these guys out?  And instead of, you know, you're trying to help us at least this time. ",

Another thing I would add is, yes, it will be very expensive for us to do, whether it's something like what Anthony is proposing or something more modest.  You know what's more expensive?  Having a depression.  Having a depression.  Right?  I mean, this is going to be a huge upfront cost.  But what we are trying to prevent is a prolonged economic recession or even depression.
