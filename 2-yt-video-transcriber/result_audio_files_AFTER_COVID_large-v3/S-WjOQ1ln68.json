I think that what's going on with the coronavirus in Israel is the same thing that's happening in the United States and other places in the world.  There's a huge panic.  And I think that as believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we have to have a little bit of a balance, a biblical balance, when we approach this type of virus.  As you mentioned before, it's a flu, it's a bad flu, and there are more people dying in the world from the flu than there are the coronavirus.  And I think that the government of Israel... the leftists are doing everything they can to make this virus much more serious than it is and scaring and panicking the people.  Because pretty much every night here on the news, people are waiting for an update and they're panicking from these updates.  So that's what's happening here in Israel.  I think that it's not as serious as they're portraying it to be.  I'm not saying that, you know, we don't have to take precaution and and have wisdom, but I am saying that we don't need to panic. ",

Let me just ask you, so have there been any government mandates, government decrees to close down synagogues and big meetings and meetings in auditoriums and schools and universities?  I mean, all of that is going on.  In the United States, it's hard.  You get into stores and the shelves are empty.  I mean, it's just crazy.  And right now, as we're making this recording, there's like 225 deaths in the United States.  Yet the whole nation is pretty much brought to a standstill.  And at the same time, there's 225 coronavirus deaths.  At the very same time, there are upwards of close to 55,000 deaths for the flu.  According to the CDC, the low end of the scale is 25,000 and 61 million infected.  I mean, it's just crazy.  So how is Israel responding as far as edicts and orders and large groups? ",

            "text": "Well, Israel right now has shut down the schools, universities.  They're beginning to shut down the markets.  They're only meeting supermarkets open for people to go shopping there.  Fifty percent of the country has been shut down already.  And there's like 500 cases here in Israel.  But there's more cases of the flu.  That's the truth.  And nobody's died from this in Israel yet.  We pray that nobody will.  But, again, they're panicking.  And they've never shut the schools down for the flu.  They've never shut the schools down for even in wartime.  We shut down part of the schools, not all the schools like they've done right now.  So I think that what Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken to the people and told them, stop cleaning the shelves in the supermarket.  There is enough food here in Israel.  You don't need to do that.  In fact, you're going to the supermarkets, and if you're so afraid of being contagious \u2013 and being, you know, getting the virus.  That's where you're going to get the virus.  Why are you going to the supermarket and emptying out all the shelves?  So there's a big panic.  So they've decided to open 15 branches in Israel 24 hours a day in order to get people to come at different hours so they won't get the virus.  It's an outrage. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it is.  Not only is it an outrage, but it really, truly is completely irrational.  And I mean just statistically it's irrational, but also medically.  And a lot of our medical professionals now are really speaking out on this.  Dr.  Drew Pinsky, just a couple of days ago, just lamb blasted.  He was on a mainstream media show.  panel show, and he lamb blasted the mainstream media for being such a part of causing this panic, this irrational panic.  And he deals with internal medicine, and he's all over media for years and sits on several important boards of major hospitals and universities.  So the guy, you know, he knows what he's talking about, and he sees it best.  basically the very same way you and I are seeing it.  So I don't know, Zev.  Look, there's some demonic powers behind this for sure.  Obviously, it is a real disease, and it is a real sickness, and it is a real strain of the cold virus.  That's what coronavirus is.  But it's a very dangerous strain, and I get that.  And we should wash our hands and take reasonable measures.  But at the same time, everybody is absolutely panicking and thinking, cowering in corners.  the flu virus is ravaging the nations and killing by the hundreds of thousands around the world.  and and it does this almost every year and there's we never shut the world down because of that.  so death is.  death is the way i'm looking at it.  zev like in the united states 55 000 deaths including hundreds of little children and nobody says a word.  And there's 225 deaths, most of it 80 years and older, and the whole world's in a panic.  So I just think that not only is this real as far as the disease, of course, goes, but I think there's... Other powers behind this.  I think there's some political geopolitical forces, some some globalist powers behind it.  And I also think the wicked people are watching us as they're watching us in Israel.  They're watching us in the United States.  They're watching how we respond like a bunch of sheep.  And that's what I'm concerned about.  And I'm ashamed of the Christian community overall in the United States, their reaction.  So that's just me.  But this is your time.  So do you agree, disagree?  How does that compare to Israel?  What do you think? ",

It's going to pass even before they get a vaccine for it.  They will get a vaccine for it.  And he said something that I thought was very, very brilliant.  He said if they didn't have a vaccine for the flu in the world, what would happen? ",

And hopefully, Benny Gantz can swift his way inside to being in the government.  So it's demonic, that's for sure.  And It has to do with panic, and if you know anything about panic, the word panic comes from the goddess Pan.  I don't have time to get into that right now, but this is all demonic, and I think that the governments have a lot to do with it.  There's a lot of spiritual warfare here.  At the end of the day, you talk about the Christian community, the believers.  This should be a time for believers to unite together and to be a light in this dark world.  And not going and panicking, because that's not a very good testimony for Jesus.  The Bible is clear.  God did not give us a spirit of fear, but he gave us a spirit of wisdom and of a sound mind.  And if we panic as believers, not only are we a bad testimony to those who don't believe in Jesus, we're a bad testimony to our family members, and we're certainly not lifting up the name of the Lord.
