And this assault weapons ban ordinance has been fighting for its life since July of 2013.  Now there's a lot of little nuances here.  I'm going to do my best to explain it to you where you can understand the craziness.  But in July of 2013... There were a couple laws passed in Illinois.  If you're in Illinois, you'll recall these.  It's the Conceal Carry Act and the Firearms Owners Identification Card Act, otherwise the FOID Act.  And that has been involved in its own fight alone.  But the passing of those two laws gave a 10-day window for each municipality to institute their own assault weapon regulations.  Now let's circle back to the village of Deerfield.  In 2013, Deerfield set up their own assault weapon ban regulations, but they were regulating the possession, not the ownership.  Okay, so it's possession and transportation.  And the 10 days passed and that was their ordinance as allowed by the original infringement.  And let me say that again, these are all infringements.  They're all illegal, according to the Constitution.  But in the 10-day window, that's what they did.  And it started being attacked, and people pushed back immediately with lawsuits, groups such as the Second Amendment Foundation, the Illinois State Rifle Association, Guns Save Lives, and more.  Then Parkland happened.  That's 2018.  And the mayor of Deerfield instructed the trustees, that's what they're called, the selectmen there, instructed them to draft an amendment to the original assault weapon ordinance, the one we were talking about from 2013, to draft an amendment and ban assault weapons altogether.  And in that amendment, which they did and they passed unanimous, They also lumped in high capacity magazines because in the wording of that ordinance, they are a part or component of a quote unquote assault weapon.  Now, if you're looking at that ordinance, what it did was it took the 2013 ordinance, which allowed possession, Now the new 2018 amendment destroyed possession, totally wiped out that previous ordinance, which would be determined to be a new quote-unquote law, an ordinance.  So this new law was not passed when it comes to regulating assault weapons in that 10-day magical window that the original infringement allowed municipalities in Illinois to do.  I hope you're following, it's kind of crazy.  So last year, a Lake County judge put an immediate restraining order on this new 2018 version that banned everything and followed up with a permanent injunction meaning that nobody could enforce this assault weapon ban.  The judge said it wasn't done originally like it should have been done.  So sad, too bad, cry me a river.  But what's interesting is the judge, no judge yet, has said that it violates the Second Amendment, goes against Howard McDonald, and should be stricken from the record and burned, but... I guess America, right?  That brings us to this week.  A three-judge panel in Illinois' Second District Appeals Court uh, reinstituted the assault weapon ban.  Basically what they said was, yeah, the village of Deerfield, uh, did this ordinance within the ten days, and they believed that this was just an amendment to that, and we agree, therefore this is cool and copacetic.  No.  But the dissent, the judge, the one judge who said that this should not happen, said that this is a new law, wiped out the old ordinance, created a new one, and banned what was previously allowed under the previous ordinance.  Again, didn't say should be stricken.  It's a violation of everything that we have.  Yeah.  So if you live in Deerfield, they could technically start enforcing this assault weapon ban.  Possession, transportation, magazines, and their version of AWBs.  I haven't seen anything specific, but I assume that this will be appealed.  And this cannot be allowed to happen again, like yesterday.  The line... is drawn in the sand.  We are not going to give up.  what is America for?  the feelings of the groups that want everything taken away because they're scary rifles, they make us scared.  The problem is right now, two-thirds of America are living in fear.  and a population that lives in fear is very easily controlled, especially if they're unarmed.  So Joe Biden's promise to delete guns and make everything a fairyland full of bubble wrap unicorns and rainbows is starting to empower all of these, I like to call them communists in hiding, But the tyrannical government, whether it's federal, state, or local, they all feel empowered now because they think Sniffin' Joe is gonna be the captain of the ship.  Guys and gals, I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The gun culture, the gun community, the hunting community, the tactical community, whatever you wanna say you like, we have to pull together.  We're the most fractured group in the nation.  And the more we get together and the faster we pull together, the more we'll be the most powerful group in the nation.  And as we act as one, and our voices become heard as one, good things will follow, trust me.  All you have to do is look at history to understand that.  So guys and gals, I just wanted everybody to know in Deerfield, Illinois, be careful.  The Gestapo has a new power.  And for police officers in Deerfield, in and around Deerfield, don't enforce an unconstitutional ordinance just because your fiefdom wants it.  and your mayors and your governors are not kings or queens.  They don't empower you to violate the Constitution or the civil rights of the people you're supposed to serve.
