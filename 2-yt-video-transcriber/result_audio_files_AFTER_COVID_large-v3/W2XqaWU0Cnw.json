            "text": "Hi everyone, Sandman here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Clements, and here's what he has to say.  Hey Sandman, I'm a 23 year old guy and I have a question regarding women.  Do women lose interest if you don't bang them?  Most of the girls I met lost interest if I didn't bang them or at least they started to ghost me after two weeks or so.  I only canoodled and did everything else but sex with them, but I didn't bang them.  Because the risk of becoming a father is way too high for me.  I prefer going to a brothel because it's not my problem if that working gal gets preggers.  I'm just curious, do women lose interest if you don't pork them?  And why?  And a message to all the younger guys out there, if you start going your own way and do what you love, women will come to you.  I didn't believe it.  But since I started getting into the acting business, I don't have much money, but the women are interested in me more than ever.  Even younger attractive ones.  But as soon as they're easily accessible, they become uninteresting.  Especially if you swallow the red pill and can't overlook the patterns.  Guys, endure the red pill rage, find your purpose, afterwards women will come to you, and you won't care anymore.  True freedom.  Thanks for your daily dose of red pill.  Sandman, thanks for freedom.  Will Clements, thanks for your donation as well as supporting my channel.  I couldn't keep doing what I'm doing if it weren't for guys like yourself.  But before I discuss your topic in more detail, let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, the MGTOW Book Collection.  Tim Patton has written five MGTOW books.  MGTOW is Forever is the latest and is a great introduction to MGTOW.  If you've been injured on the job and need help, Disabled and Unable to Work is for you.  MGTOW Building Wealth and Power helps you empower your finances.  Masculinity is Our Future is about how the world sees masculinity as toxic and what it means to be a man.  Finally, MGTOW Why I Cheat.  When a woman named Marcia read this book, she wanted to scream out loud, why is MGTOW a real thing?  Thanks for pushing her buttons, Tim.  All five books can be found at the sponsor link down below.  Anyways, now back to the video.  First of all, Clemens, I've got to say that I've never been in a relationship before where I cut a woman off from sex long enough to know if she would actually lose interest in me.  I don't know exactly what you mean by your questions and comments.  I'm guessing that you meet a woman and she likes you, and you guys fool around without having sex, they lose interest in you and run off to find another bloke.  A man that'll sleep with them, perhaps.  If you aren't sleeping with them, they might get self-conscious that there's something wrong with them.  They might think that they have a funky body odor or that they aren't as attractive and irresistible to men as they were last week.  So that might make them run out and try and see if they still have that magic with another man.  I don't know why a woman would lose interest in a man if he doesn't sleep with them.  I never asked one to find out and honestly, I'd expect her to be dishonest about any of the real reasons for it.  Up to the age of 25 from my experience, women just can't get enough sex.  And even in the 90s and early 2000s, they were aggressively ripping my clothes off and demanding it.  They wanted it more than I did.  I think that's just nature.  I strongly believe they project their insatiable sex drive onto us men.  They say things like, all you guys ever think about is sex.  When in reality, when they're young, that's probably all they're thinking about.  I don't know how old you are, Clemens, but if the women you're describing are in their late teens and early twenties, that should give you a reason.  Clearly you want sex, but you just don't want to get trapped by a baby.  I don't know why you're afraid of getting them pregnant.  I've used condoms literally thousands of times before, and there were never any real problems.  Unless your purpose in life is to rod dog those road whores.  But a condom will do just fine.  You also say that once a man goes through the red pill rage he's going to find his true purpose and the woman will come to you once you follow your path in life.  And that this is true freedom.  I would go one step further and say that you haven't found your true freedom yet until you go through that second red pill rage stage.  Then after that you won't need to go to the brothels either.  the urge will be completely gone.  Besides experiencing extreme anger at myself for dating women and putting my mind through the dating experience over and over again, where I was emotionally damaged and finally said enough is enough, I have no idea how I got through that red pill rage part two.  Many of you asked me and that's my best explanation.  As for women losing interest if you friendzone them without sex or interest in being with them, from my experience they might just hang around for a while, a month or two, to see if you eventually fall at their feet and worship their future forming cankles.  But at some point they'll get the message that you would rather masturbate than be with them.  Your words also make me wonder about my high school years.  I was also interested in canoodling with girls and not going all the way.  That might have led to their sexual frustration, and they gave me plenty of chances to bang them all those times that I was at home with them, all alone, while their parents weren't there.  Plus, a lot of the times, things started getting hot and heavy.  I guess I'll never really know unless I go back in time.  Also, besides using a condom, I know you can't trust that women aren't going to be on the birth control pill when they say they are.  But odds are, a woman in her early 20s doesn't want to have a kid inside her until she gets the entire extended male cast of Cats the Musical to scratch their way through her cooch.  Clemens, since you're an actor now, maybe you'll get a part in that play off-Broadway once the coof is done.  You also say something really interesting.  You said that once women become easily accessible, they become uninteresting.  This is something I noticed when I first started using Tinder and found a few girlfriends back in 2015.  I learned that it was easy to find women to have sex with online.  Much easier than going out in person and meeting them that way.  Once I went through the process five or six times, I found it a lot easier than when I was younger.  But the quality of women weighed down for my youth.  So the volume of Vajayjay increased, but so did the volume of CrayCray.  I've heard from many guys on my channel that they're desperate to no longer be interested in dating, relationships, and sex anymore.  That they, very much like myself, would become zombies once we feast on her flesh.  Our minds are no longer our own.  Clemens, there has to be a part of a woman out there that gets off on seeing a man lose control for them in that particular way.  Perhaps it's the same way we get when a woman compliments us and tells us how much she supposedly values us.  A woman might feel the same way when she knows a guy is her slave, and it might satisfy her in a way that female validation satisfies us more than sex ever could.  Does a woman get satisfied by turning a man into a zombie with a flesh-flavored stick who has no choice but to use his dick?  If he doesn't, then she probably doesn't feel that satisfaction.  Plus, when women are younger, you have to tell them you love them all the time and that you want to have sex with them all the time, too.  Otherwise, they become incredibly insecure, as I mentioned earlier, that there's something wrong with them.  Because you're not going cuckoo for vagina puffs.  She needs to feel wanted sexually, and if you're not going to fulfill that need, there's an army of guys dressed up as cast members from Cats behind you waiting to give it to her while she goes into heat.  Plus, women are hedonistic and they want pleasure.  And if you don't give it to them, they'll bore easily and blow you off so they can find someone else to blow.  I've also heard many guys over the years on my channel say that if a woman isn't having sex with you, usually referring to wives and girlfriends of other men, then they're having sex with someone else.  Why wouldn't they?  Women seemingly never tire from hedonistic pursuits like eating and going out to fancy restaurants and weddings.  Why would they tire of sex so long as they're fertile?  Hell, even women in their 40s are known to be freaks these days.  Even a woman in her 70s was once after me.  Most men in their 70s that are single just sit in solitude in the corner and that's all they want.  Sex also ties you to them emotionally, and if what I said about women not having sex with you means having sex with another man, maybe women think the same way about us.  Maybe they think that if you're not giving it to them, you're going out there with some other gal.  Maybe they also think you have some sort of sexually transmitted disease and that you don't want them to find out about it, so you aren't sleeping with them because of it.  If you're not showing your naked body, maybe they might actually be thinking that you have some kind of mutant or maybe three-inch penis.  that's the perfect size for hobbits, but way too small for her hoo-ha.  Those are possibly some of the things running through a woman's head when she wants to give you some.  Again, I have no way to be sure, but those things sort of make sense.  She wants to make sure she's wanted, she wants to get pleasure, and she's impatient if she doesn't get it, and other men are around if you aren't.  As for putting women in the friend zone and being their so-called friend, from my experience, they probably think we think the way they do.  For example, I was friends with a woman, and in her mind, she probably thought that I had put her in the friend zone until I was done with my current relationship, and then I would get together with her.  But when I got out of that other relationship, I didn't get together with her.  But instead, I got together with another woman, and it really pissed her off, and she stopped being my friend.  Odds are she realized she'd been friend-zoned and meant nothing else to me.  Instead of me going and using her as a backup or breakup Betty that I would play batter-up with.  She didn't want to be friends anymore because she probably thought it wasn't going to lead to more down the road.  And now she knew for sure.  But from my experience, when a woman friend-zones a guy, she tends to get angry or pretends to be all surprised when he figures it out and ghosts her.  So that being said, Clemens, maybe the women you weren't sleeping with thought that you actually put them in some sort of a friend zone.  A make-out friend zone, but not a situation where you would actually sleep with them.  I don't know, but that's certainly another possibility.  I don't know, because the last time I was with a girl and I only made out with her was back in high school.  To end this video, I just want to give guys a warning about women that want to sleep with you on the first date.  If they do, then they usually think you're a catch, and they want to get you emotionally connected to them. ",
