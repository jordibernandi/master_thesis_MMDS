When they, the CEO of the team at the time, Adam Aaron, who is now the CEO of AMC Theaters, you occasionally see him in the news for like doing something stupid.  And obviously movie theaters are not the greatest business right now.  so adam aaron said that he like talked to people on twitter.  he went on wip he read a poll in the inquirer and the first one of the first things that he and josh harris who's the the main owner of the team said that here's here's adam aaron's quote hip-hop wasn't the right image for the team we wanted to create and the product we wanted to offer 76ers fans um so like um.  But the important thing, I'm really rambling here.  The important thing is that at that time, they said that they were in... they were in well advanced discussions with Jim Henson's creature shop and Dave Raymond.  Dave Raymond is the guy who was the original Philly fanatic and helped create the costume and sort of the character.  So like literally the Kings of mascots, Jim Henson and, and Dave Raymond, he said they were in deep discussions and he said that, uh, He said that he wanted it to be related to Ben Franklin.  Here's his quote.  Ben Franklin is a human being, and these mascots are usually more animals.  I don't think our pure mascot will be Ben Franklin walking around on the court.  But if there's a way to work in the founding fathers or the colonial era, or even Ben Franklin, that would be a nice feather in the cap. ",

And they had three choices.  And it was a Ben Franklin, just like an old Ben Franklin dude.  And these were all just drawings.  So, you know, like, we weren't seeing the actual costume.  There was a dog named B. Franklin Dog with two Gs.  And he, like, kind of looked like hip-hop, but a dog, but, like, in colonial garb.  And then there was a mascot called Phil E. Moose, which was just like a moose.  And so they had to put a vote on it.  And so obviously there were two fake choices, Ben Franklin and Phil E. Moose, and B. Franklin Dog.  So the contest did not go very well, apparently, because it was never mentioned again.  Yeah.  So my theory, and I've never been able to confirm this, is that they just didn't \u2013 like, everybody voted for Philly Moose because that was the only one that was, like, interesting.  So then \u2013 okay, so they talked about how in 2011 they were going to have a Ben Franklin dog mascot.  Yeah.  And in February 2015, they finally introduced their Ben Franklin dog mascot. ",

And they're all screaming because they're like hyped up on sugar and they're not in school.  And it goes great.  And this went really well, except that Franklin was supposed to begin with a dunk and he was way far away.  And he sort of like, flicked it into the basket from far away.  So then they did a second take, which was amazing.  And he dunked again, and he landed flat on his back when he dunked.  So it was... This is not unusual for Philadelphia.  Mascots swoop.  Like, the Eagles mascot parachuted into the vet when he debuted, and he crashed into the sidelines.  Um... Shit, we broke Alice.  My point is, is that it took them four years to create a dog like Ben Franklin.  Three and a half, really. ",
