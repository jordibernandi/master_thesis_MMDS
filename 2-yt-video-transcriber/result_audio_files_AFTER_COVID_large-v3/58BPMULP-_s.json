            "text": "Right.  And if you're talking about an identity, then I mean, it's it's irrelevant to the issue.  I know if you are tempted with homosexual desires or any sort of sexually sinful desire, your temptation is not a sin.  giving and yielding your heart to it so it becomes fantasizing or if you yield your life and your body to it so it becomes the action then it's a sin and in that case yeah um it's a sin.  and the response to this isn't like christian saying pray the gay away that's that's the verse.  that's the quote i always hear.  i never hear anybody saying it like they mean it.  it's always saying it like sort of caricaturing right the conservative oppressive christians that we all that we all are.  and um That's not actually the goal biblically.  It's die to self.  It's resist temptation and honor Christ with your life.  And there's going to be a host of things.  You know, number one and two of these first two questions, they're about liberating a person to relax and just kind of be who they are, be who they want to be.  And they see Christianity as oppressive to the person.  In reality, Christianity is very oppressive to the flesh.  Yes.  It's very oppressive to my sinful desires and my sin nature.  And there's no.  there's no like freedom or liberty to the flesh in Christianity.  It's death to self.  Yeah.  And that's what we're being called to.  So I think that the short answer is this, is the Bible is super, super clear on this, that homosexual behaviors and actions are sinful.  But the modern concept of an identity that I was sort of born or have become this and this is who I'm supposed to be, that that's just an unbiblical concept.  That idea just doesn't belong.  Regardless of however you feel you were born, the cliche is be born again, is come into this newness of life in Christ, follow him.  Honor him.  Yeah, and there's been a lot of attempts from people.  I did a whole four-part series on this years ago Where I went into like Matthew vines and the Reformation Project and those were trying to reinterpret the Bible to fit with homosexual behaviors.  And if the Bible is okay with it, then I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna be like I want to preach what Scripture teaches on this.  God has the authority to tell me what to do with my life.  but all the attempts to reinterpret the Bible to endorse homosexual actions sexual actions and have utterly failed.  The Bible's really clear on it.  It's not the only issue that matters, but it is an issue that matters.  Yeah. ",

And I also have a couple of episodes with Alan Schliemann, where we directly addressed the points of the Reformation Project and what they call their biblical points, and we talked through those.  But I think that was very well put, Mike.  And I think that also as I'm kind of reading through this list, what's standing out to me is that, like you said, it's sort of liberating your flesh and saying, just relax, it's all fine.  But really underneath some of these biblical mandates is true freedom.  It's real freedom.  When we surrender our lives to Christ and we repent of our sin and we pick up our cross and we follow Jesus, There's a freedom in that that I don't think the world can understand.  There's a freedom in not relying on yourself anymore, not depending on yourself and fulfilling your own desires.  There's such a rich relationship with God and freedom that comes when that takes place.  And I think that side of the coin never gets presented in lists like this. ",
