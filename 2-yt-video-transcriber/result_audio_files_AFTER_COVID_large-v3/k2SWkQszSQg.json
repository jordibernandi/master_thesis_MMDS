            "text": "Well, if you're doctrinally pre-committed to these things, all existing independent of humanity, then of course you're not going to be satisfied.  Truth is a property of statements, and statements are contingent upon people.  Beauty is a reaction that people have.  And what does ultimate meaning mean?  Is that the same thing as ultimate purpose?  If it is, then the answer is no.  Purposes are contingent on people too.  I haven't heard a satisfying account of these things being any more than human constructs from theists or atheists.  The only kind of truths that are of any use or consequence are a priori truths, that is, tautologies whose affirmations are coherent and whose negations are incoherent, like logical and mathematical truths, and empirical truths, which are statements which are coherent, parsimonious, falsifiable, and consistent with observation.  The apologist Cytan Brugenkate once said that truth is whatever God says is true, by which he really means whatever the Bible says is true.  Such an epistemology leaves us with some pretty incomprehensible and useless truths.  Beauty is just finding pleasure in something.  That doesn't require a god, and anything a god had to say about what is beautiful isn't going to change what I find to be beautiful.  And even if there is a god who dictates an ultimate purpose, I see no reason why I ought, therefore, pursue that purpose.  Apologists and theologians sometimes argue that the purpose of humanity is to glorify God.  Why?  That seems like an entirely arbitrary purpose to me. ",

Even if there is a God that has his own ideas about truth, beauty, and meaning, that doesn't make any of these things objective, because there is no objective reason why God's position on those things ought to be mine.  The mere idea that he created us does not denote any obligation to adopt his views.  In fact, if ought implies can, it is especially nonsensical to say that I ought to find beautiful whatever God finds beautiful, because I have no control over what I do or do not find beautiful. ",
