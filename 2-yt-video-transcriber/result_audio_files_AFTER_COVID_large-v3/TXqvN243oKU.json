            "text": "Hey Pickle.  Come here.  You want the snackles, don't you?  Just carry on with the snackles.  I know.  Oh, but you can't even see me on the camera.  It's all just focused on you.  Alright, I'm still off camera, but this will do because it won't be close to you.  Okay, I'm like crouching on the floor so you can see me here, but um hi everyone.  I'm here with Karu today, and she knows I have snacks.  so she's very excited aren't you?  and today We are gonna be together me and this little one.  these little ones are gonna be writing some poetry.  We have some prompt cards It's basically Madlib style where I have notes with gaps to fill in and she's gonna be picking words on cards And we are gonna be using snacks to convince her.  It should be fun.  I hope it's gonna be fun.  You're excited, aren't you, Bean?  We have some turkey nibbles from Tails, and we also have cheesy nibbles with a little bit of beef.  We have some beef and poultry flavors, little marrow bone thingies.  Basically, I'm gonna be putting some cards down on the floor, putting snacks on them and whichever one she chooses first.  is the word we're going to use to fill in the blank in the poem.  We'll see if this works or not, okay?  I have no idea.  I'm probably crouching in front of the camera awkwardly like this for god knows what reason.  Because I love you, eh?  Come here, Bean.  I know.  Good girl.  Alright, sit.  Good girl.  Paul, thank you.  Here's your first one.  There we go.  Now, don't judge me.  I don't mean to be a terrible person, but all the poems I'm going to be doing today are parodies of Gabbie Hanna terrible poems that we've talked about and critiqued in the past.  So with that... Hello.  With that, we are going to start on the first poem by Kyra, which is called Boyfriend.  And we're going to decide who your boyfriend is first, aren't we?  Yes.  Who's your boyfriend, Kyra?  All right, Schmoogie Bear.  Are you ready to write a poem?  Okay, so the first choices are your boyfriend.  Is your boyfriend going to be Ronnie or Harry?  Ronnie, gorgeous little cocker spaniel.  Harry, fluffy little Pomeranian.  She loves them both.  Don't you?  I know.  Alright, sit.  Good girl.  Okay, let's put these down so you can see who they are.  Okay, you've got Ronnie and Harry to choose from.  Wait.  I'm going to go with the cheesy nibbles for now.  This one for Harry.  This one for Ronnie.  Alright, wait.  Oh, Ronnie's the first choice.  Kyra loves Ronnie.  Okay, so now we have to figure out what are you doing with Ronnie?  Okay, apparently these pens are not waterproof.  I can see the smudging.  S-N-O-R-I-N-G-R-U-C-U-D-D-L-I-N-G.  Are you snoring or cuddling with Ronnie?  So we have cuddling here.  We have snoring here.  All right, wait.  Ready?  Go!  Oh, they're snoring together.  I see.  Kyra and Ronnie.  Oh, sorry, no, we've missed a line.  Okay, next up we have to find out where you and Ronnie are.  Are you?  Kyra, did you find your tree?  So are you gonna be on the bed or in the park?  I know they are two of your favorite places, aren't they?  All right, okay, sit down.  Go.  Oh, in the park?  Straight away you made that choice.  Next up, we have some choices of what happens first and second.  And these, we have a lot of choices here.  We have chasing.  We have... We've already used snoring, so we're not going to have that one.  We have bouncing.  We have pooping.  We have chewing.  And let's go for sleeping.  That's a cute one.  Save them for later.  Okay, you ready?  So we need two choices here.  I'm looking for which order you go for these in, okay?  Good girl.  Okay.  Well, you're already on top of these, so.  Wait.  Wait.  Good girl.  Wait.  See what you and Ronnie do together, okay?  Go.  Sleeping and bouncing.  Now your first choices.  Okay.  You're getting such a treat today, Mish. ",
