            "text": "Because do you remember Dilbert?  That bald guy with all the tumors on his head who hung out with a talking egg?  Well, he was drawn by someone, and that person was named Scott Adams.  And you don't have to remember that name or pay much attention to it after this, but Adams is one of the funniest people on Twitter right now when it comes to the absolute denial of objective reality.  You know how people like Elon Musk and Neil deGrasse Tyson are really smart and successful about one or two specific things.  And then assumed that meant they were smart and successful about everything.  And it was kind of funny, but also a little bit of a bummer considering that they have a lot of followers and power.  Well, Scott Adams is like that.  in that he has a lot of followers and thinks of himself as some kind of intellectual.  But the one thing he was successful about was drawing basic shapes to form characters for Sunday morning comics.  And that's not nothing, but also close to nothing.  Isn't that right, Mr.  Reverend?  Wiggle Bum Bum Cigarettes?  I didn't do the work in post.  Sorry about that.  Future Cody.  Hey, there's no time for you anymore!  You're done here!  Get out!  You're ugly!  Anyway, um... At some point, one assumes Scotto started reading a bunch of power of persuasion type books, then figured that was enough qualification to write one himself.  The first words of his Amazon biography describes him as a trained hypnotist and a lifelong student of persuasion.  And that's kinda all you need to know about Dilbert's dad, you know?  I don't need to sell you on Scott Adams being a grifter clown, but he's just, Really fun to blast.  Like, listen to him.  completely misunderstand what it means to be influential or persuasive. ",

            "text": "One of the biggest traits of a master persuader is that they don't get embarrassed.  Imagine if you were an ordinary person and you went on TV and you answered a question and you just got savaged by your critics.  Like how you don't know anything, your numbers don't add up, just, you know, you're dumb, you're a fraud.  You just got savaged.  What do you do if you're a normal person?  Well, you retreat into your shell, you get out of politics, you become less effective, you become tentative, you become nervous in public, you try to avoid questions, you become worse.  What happens if you're a master persuader?  You say to yourself, huh, that didn't work as well as the next thing I'm gonna try.  All right, I'll try something else.  But by the way, I got a ton of attention.  Everybody's talking about me. ",

            "text": "Boy, is that telling.  So according to Scott, one of the traits of a master persuader is the inability to be embarrassed.  which also happens to be the same trait as a shameless narcissist.  That's how weird, how weird and telling that you think a person who feels bad about criticism becomes worse and that the real brain champions ignore it when an overwhelming number of people say you're wrong and a fraud.  How weird.  Now I could do an hour long video documenting every time Scott Adams said a dumb grifter thing, but honestly, he's just not worth the time and would think all the attention means he's winning some game of 3D chess, which by the way, is a thing he coined when praising Trump back in 2015.  Like whenever people sarcastically talk about Trump playing 4D chess, because it's such a dumb idea, That was actually Scott's term that he unironically believes.  He correctly predicted that Trump would win in 2016.  And because of that one right guess about something that had two possible outcomes has doubled down his entire reputation on the theory that Trump is secretly a mind wizard, which makes every video and tweet from him a very transparent and entertaining battle between reality and ego.

            "text": "Have you noticed that the big news drops, I think it was Friday, on how good the economy is, and then the president just sort of went quiet.  He's just letting it hang, right?  The economic news is so big and so good for him, he just puts it out there and then he just backs up into the shadows.  You don't really realize how good he is at this until you look at the negative space.  You have to look at what he doesn't do as well as what he does to get the full picture. ",

            "text": "Yes, of course, you see plebs, it's the tweets Trump doesn't make.  that you need to pay attention to.  Like jazz, sorry, jizz.  By the way, that video where he praises Trump for not rage tweeting and says it's a strategy, happened on July 29th of 2018, mere hours before the president rage tweeted for the rest of the day.  the exact opposite thing Scott said he was doing.  But that is just the kind of hilarious wrong Scott is.  He makes predictions based on his seminar wisdom, is usually wrong, and then ignores anyone who might later point that out.  You know, like a true master persuader.  So when the good brain president pondered about injecting disinfectant, Adams was obviously one of the first to argue that actually, He was being very smart, and gee whiz, did he use every single strategy we've mentioned.  Like a grifter Voltron, he combined semantics, diversion, and just bat fantasy into an entire day of tweets.  First, he focused on the wrong thing, tweeting about how our very smart president was actually aware of experimental UV light treatments and was actually very smart.  Then when people pointed out the part about disinfectant injecting, Scott beautifully switched over to the semantic argument by saying, geez, how dumb are people to think he was talking about bleach or isopropyl alcohol?  specifically, geez you people, even though he was literally referring to a guy talking about bleach and isopropyl alcohol.  So now he has established that he thinks Trump wasn't talking about chemical cleaners and is actually a very smart boy indeed.  He's all in, pot committed on the idea that Trump will come out and say that he was misunderstood or that the fake news twisted his words or some other kind of excuse.  But then came that beautiful moment, the moment where Trump said that yes, he was in fact suggesting the injection of chemicals, but was being sarcastic to trick everyone.  that wonderful gift that blew up everything Scott Adams was saying up until this point.  But being a master persuader, he reached into the old bag of tricks or ball sack of lies, if you'd rather, and pulled out a complete rewrite of reality, completing the trifecta and assuming a totally new meaning to Trump's words and saying that he was actually being sarcastic.  about saying he was sarcastic.  You see, folks?  It's all just a part of his 3D chess that conveniently allows Scott to not have to admit he was wrong about anything.  Ego saved.  Let's all move on.  It's just... Absolutely incredible to watch a person short circuit that badly.  And not just any person, but a person who loves to talk about Trump derangement syndrome while ironically maintaining a high tech force field of denial about a very obvious grifter president. ",

Now, they're usually using it somewhat defensively, as in, we don't have that, or we're being blamed for that.  But it feels like both the left and the right are talking about Trump derangement syndrome as though it's just a real... Well, not as though, that it is a real thing.  It has an actual medical... diagnostic quality to it, and that there are millions of people suffering from it.  That feels to be now medically demonstrated.
