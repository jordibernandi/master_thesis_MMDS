A listener named Bruce had brought this story to my attention.  A woman named Kathy, given a terminal cancer diagnosis, she was already a cancer survivor, but it returned in another form, spent most of 2020 in and out of hospitals, massive medical bills.  And then she and her wife have just received the news.  They have $1,000 in car repairs that they cannot pay.  I mean, it's just been one kick in the teeth after the other.  And they didn't really want to start a GoFundMe.  They didn't want to go out and ask for money.  They know that people are burdened.  in this particular time.  And so Bruce dropped me a line and said, maybe we can help.  And so we set a goal of $1,200 and did a live stream a couple of days ago.  And in a half an hour, this community raised more than $1,200.  And Kathy and Christy, her wife, were sort of given this surprise gift.  And I know that you want to know how this turned out.  I called Christy, and with her permission, let me play that phone call for you right here. ",

I didn't want to overstep bounds while we were working on your behalf, okay?  But we're working on your behalf, Kristen.  We had heard that the car repair was in the neighborhood of a thousand dollars.  So I went to the community that I'm a host of.  We are heathens.  We are atheists.  The community is called the thinking atheist.  And I don't know where you stand religiously.  And honestly, I don't really care because that's not why we're doing this for you.  But we put a goal of $1,000, and within about a half an hour, we had reached almost three grand.  We let the fundraiser cook overnight.  Thanks to 207 donors, we are going to gift to you and your wife $4,935.  Okay? ",
