            "text": "Today I rise to address Bill C-231, which on the surface appears a noble attempt to direct our pension funds exclusively towards the common good.  But the old adage is that the how is even more important than the what.  And the devil is in the details.  Because the honourable member who proposes this bill is afraid of the devil, he has avoided the details altogether in his bill.  The member proposes an amendment to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act.  The amendment would create a new requirement, and I will read it here.  that the investment policy standards and procedures taking into account environmental, social, and governance factors shall provide that no investment be made or held in an entity if there are reasons to believe that the entity has performed acts or carried out work contrary to ethical business practices, including the commission of human labor, or environmental rights violations.  Well, what is meant by all of the terminology that the member puts in but does not define?  We don't know what is meant because the member does not tell us, nor does he provide us with an arbitrator anywhere in the Canadian system that would determine when any such business practices have been violated or when human labor or environmental rights have been in some way offended.  So he leaves it to our imagination.  to determine what he means by each of these terms.  So ethical business practices.  We know there are some members of the NDP that consider it unethical for businesses to run a profit at all.  So excluding profitable businesses from the CPP's portfolio would guarantee impoverishment to Canadians who rely on the fund's returns in order to live out a dignified.  Now, let's move on to an additional criteria the member says would exclude a company from receiving CPP investments.  Environmental violations.  Well, this particular member has written that it would be a violation to invest in oil and gas companies.  and I'm quoting him here, he laments, the CPPIB is investing billions of your pension dollars into the oil and gas sector, something presumably he would ban from happening if this bill were adopted.  And thereby, we would ban our pension fund from investing into Canada's largest exporting industry, the oil and gas sector, which produces more jobs for Indigenous Canadians than any other private sector industry, our resource sector.  It would be banned from receiving funds invested by our pension system.  This at a time when Albertans are considering pulling out of the CPP altogether because of the fact that they are demographically younger and contribute more on a per capita basis than the other eight provinces that are members of the fund.  So you're going to look Albertans in the eye and tell them they should stay in the CPP pension fund while that fund specifically bans its managers from investing in Alberta's biggest industry.  What an insult to the men and women who have worked in that industry for so long and done so much good for our Federation.  On the broader definition that the Bill provides for unethical business practices, I reached out to the CPPIB and I said, which kinds of companies in Canada would be banned from getting Canadian investment under this legislation?  And they came back and said, oh, only the 10 biggest companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  All 10 of them.  by valuation would be banned from receiving investment from the CPPIB.  Companies like Shopify, Enbridge, Royal Bank, that on a combined basis, literally, these 10 companies employ millions of Canadians, would be banned from receiving investments from their very own pension fund.  Now, whether that is the member's intention, I don't know.  In fact, I rather doubt it.  But that is not important.  Because writing laws are like programming computers.  The machine does what you program it to do.  And if you program the CPPIB to ban all of these entities from receiving investment, that is what the managers will be forced to do.  In fact, I wonder if the principles in this bill were actually applied.  Whether... The fund would even be able to buy bonds in the Canadian government.  I mean, the CPPIB said we'd only be allowed to buy bonds in the Canadian government if this bill passed.  I don't even think they'd be allowed to do that.  Think about it.  This is a government that can't provide clean drinking water to First Nations people, violating human rights.  So now we're going to ban, because of the incompetence of federal ministers who can't keep their word and provide clean drinking water, the government itself might be banned from receiving bond investments from the CPPIB.  A government here who violates its own environmental promises.  It hasn't planted a single tree.  This could be perceived as an environmental violation.  This is a government that signed off on letting the city of Montreal pour millions of liters of raw sewage into our waters.  Another violation of environmental rights.  Could we possibly buy bonds in the city of Montreal or the government of Canada when such violations have occurred?  Of course not.  Therefore, this legislation, because of its poor drafting, however well-intentioned, cannot reasonably be implemented, even if it were desirable.  But it does give us an opportunity to discuss a new and growing risk that I have worried quietly about for a long time.  The CPPIB was depoliticized back in the 1990s.  It is a credit to the then-liberal government that they took what was a nearly bankrupt shell that was highly politicized and whose funds were directed by politicians.  and they said, we're going to get the sticky fingers and incompetent hands of politicians out of the pensions of Canadians, and we're going to put it in the hands of effectively a group of private sector professionals to invest it and obtain a return.  And since that time, the fund has grown from insolvency to $456 billion, almost a half a trillion dollars.  Now, I hesitated to say that in this place because a lot of politicians just got really big eyes thinking, oh my goodness, what could we do with that?  All the schemes they could come up with to deploy a half trillion dollars, my goodness, they're rubbing their hands together.  If you could see it, viewers back home, there are politicians rubbing their hands together thinking about that very thought right now.  And, you know, our government, and let me give you an example of how they are already leveraging that wealth.  This Prime Minister constantly says we have the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7.  True, it was an inheritance, had nothing to do with him, but the only reason it's true is because you deduct that $456 billion from our gross debt to give a much lower net debt and the appearance that we have a low national debt.  And so already that money, which represents 20% of our GDP, is being leveraged in the minds of this government to justify their irresponsible spending.  How long will it be if they keep spending at this pace?  before they start to say, oh my goodness, we're out of money, we're broke, and now we need to start looking at that big pot of gold that Canadians had set aside.  We on this Conservative side will fight tooth and nail to keep the hands of politicians off of the pensions of Canadians.  We see it already with the former Minister of Environment urging the CPPIB to invest in her pet environmental project, similarly to what happened provincially in Ontario when they almost bankrupted our electrical system doing the exact same thing.  We know many would like to defund our energy sector.  We on the Conservative side will fight to keep the CPP depoliticized with the single purpose of giving an honest return to our hardworking Canadian employees and the retirees who depend on that fund.  Thank you. ",
