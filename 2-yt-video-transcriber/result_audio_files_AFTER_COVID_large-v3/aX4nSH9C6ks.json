            "text": "Greetings all, Paladin here.  Just want to make a short brief announcement.  We will be broadcasting a live stream on Sunday night, July 26th at 9 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time.  Lady Justice and I will be interviewing author Christopher Fulton, who wrote the book The Inheritance, Poisoned Fruit of JFK's Assassination.  I think in the last live stream that we had, we did discuss that a little bit.  I have had two conversations with Mr.  Fulton in the last few weeks.  One earlier this week with Lady Justice on the line.  It was a two-hour conversation.  two-hour-plus conversation.  So Mr.  Fulton has agreed to come on Sunday night.  So just wanted to get the word out there so you could mark your calendar and block that time period because this is an interview that you do not want to miss.  Okay, so we'll see you then.  Paladin out.  Thank you. ",
