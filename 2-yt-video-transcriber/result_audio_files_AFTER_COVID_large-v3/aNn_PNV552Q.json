            "text": "Hey, welcome to see my news network.  I'm Linda Forsyth and we have some exciting things going on right now.  Let me tell you what's going on around the nation.  It's mind blowing and it's actually making history.  We are all in history right now and every single one of us what we choose to do.  will be remembered for a very, very long time.  And since we're all working together as patriots to quite frankly help save our country, then this is something that is going to be in the history books that our children and our grandchildren will hopefully read because we're going to actually get our republic back.  That's what this is all about.  And the great big rally that's going to be going on on January 6 in just a couple of days, which is on Wednesday, is going to be starting at 11am Eastern Standard Time, which is 8am.  Pacific Standard Time, which is where I'm at in California.  We have multiple people from Seabine, Seabine members that are over there right now in Washington,  D.C.,  citizen journalists.

We're going to be live streaming for the very first time on January 6th.  This is coming up here, and we're going to be having a lot of people out there taking access and to report on many different things going on.  And then also during the day when we are going to be reporting, we're going to be doing some regular news reports.  When there isn't anything coming in specifically from Washington,  D.C.,  I'm going to be here.  In Temecula, talking about news reports, we're going to be having the live chat on and we're going to be discussing many different things.  So it's just going to be family, family of patriots getting together on Wednesday.  We are going to be starting at 7 a.m.  Pacific, which is 10 a.m.  Eastern, right here on the Seafind Channel.
