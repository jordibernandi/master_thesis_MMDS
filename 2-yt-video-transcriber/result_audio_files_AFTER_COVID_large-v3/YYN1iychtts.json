            "text": "Welcome to the Dark Stream, VoxDay, voxday.blogspot.com, and unauthorized.tv.  Last Dark Stream, we talked about how we are now entering the demoralization season.  And every day, we're seeing new polls, new numbers, Biden's up 16%, Biden's up 18%.  I mean, these numbers are obviously ridiculous.  Obviously, just not even remotely credible.  An incumbent US president does not lose by 16 points.  Never happens.  Never happened before, not happening now.  But it's all designed to try to make people who are supporting Trump to feel despair and not show up.  It's also meant to try to convince those who are susceptible to wanting to be on the winning side that they have no choice but to jump in and support Creepy Joe's campaign for the Senate, which apparently he believes he's running for.  It's borderline cruel what they're doing to the guy, but he asked for it, he sold his soul for it, so we can't have too much sympathy.  But what we can do is explain why I'm so confident that the polls are not just wildly exaggerated, but are fundamentally wrong.  Like I said, it keeps getting worse.  Today, The Economist came out and in forecasting the US elections, they actually claimed that Biden has a 91% chance of winning the electoral college and a 99% chance of winning the popular vote.  Now, why an English magazine thinks that it knows anything about U.S.  elections, well, we'll just ignore that.  The point is that this is the extent of exaggeration that we're seeing in this demoralization season.  The demoralization season is going to last another week to two weeks, and then you're going to see them start backing it down so they don't look completely ridiculous when the election actually rolls around.  They don't want to have their 16-point predictions out there when Trump wins by three points or four points.  I mean, being wrong is one thing.  To be that completely and utterly wrong is going to destroy their credibility permanently.  They shouldn't have any credibility anyhow.  I don't give them any credibility, but a lot of people still do just because it's in the news every day.  Now let's look at the various reasons, the various non-poll reasons that we can be confident that Donald Trump is actually winning this election.  This is a chart of the growth in the S&P 500 the year of the election.  And the number just under 12% is the average performance in a year when the incumbent party wins the election.  So generally speaking, if the Democratic Party is in office or if the Republican Party is in office and the S&P 500 does over 11.5%, the party usually holds on to the presidency.  Now you can see why things were so close in 2016.  It was just under 12%.  It was right at that average line.  And of course, there was a relatively close election.  But now look at what has happened in 2019.  The S&P 500 is up over 18 points.  And so this indicator strongly indicates that Donald Trump is going to win reelection.  As a general rule, people don't vote out incumbents when the economic situation, the financial situation is generally good.  Now, obviously, COVID-19 has thrown the economy completely out of whack, especially because of the various lockdowns and so forth.  On the one hand, we've had more than a 30% decline in quarterly GDP, in the second quarter.  However, the third quarter numbers are going to show something like 34% growth.  So I think that trying to look at the GDP numbers and trying to figure out exactly where things are there is probably a mistake.  And obviously, the great state of Wall Street does not mean that Main Street is doing well.  We've talked about that many times.  But the point is, As far as the predictor goes, it strongly indicates a Trump reelection.  Now let's look at the next indicator.  This is an increasingly famous one.  It's actually an interesting model in that it pays no attention to what practically everybody else pays attention to.  It's the Norpoth model, which is named after the gentleman in the picture.  I think his name's Helmut Norpoth.  And he has, this model, Of course, you have to be dubious about back testing, but even so, it served to correctly predict or retro-predict 25 of the 27 presidential elections since 1912.  The two that were incorrect Or 1960, which was the JFK Nixon election and 2000, which, of course, was incredibly close and could have very easily gone either way.  It's based on.  mostly on the performance in the party primaries and there's.  it's not just about um it's not just about that.  it also um it is also tied in to uh the vote the previous vote.  but um he was very confident.  along with me and a very few other number of individuals, Nor Poth anticipated that Trump would win.  In fact, he gave Donald Trump an 87% chance of winning in 2016.  We'll have a look at what he says about 2020.  He says Donald Trump has a 91% chance of winning compared to 9% for Biden.  Not only that, but there is a variant that he's created that allows him to predict the electoral college votes.  And he predicts a 362 to 170 mini Trump slide.  And the fact that Norpoth is predicting that is significant because his model is usually correct.  So that's another indication.  Now, this one is getting a lot more press because it's predicting narrowly a Biden victory.  However, I'm going to explain why it's being misinterpreted and offer my own spin on it.  And this is, oops, that's the wrong one.  The keys to the White House.  You might see coverage of this in the media because, of course, they're focusing on stuff that supposedly looks good for Biden.  And it was created by Alan Lichtman.  It's been generally correct from 1860 to 2000.  It was incorrect in 2000.  The way that it works is eight of the 13 keys are required to win.  They actually tend to report this backwards.  They say, if five or fewer of the keys are false, then the incumbent party will win.  But it's easier, I think, just to think about it in terms of what's true.  So basically, in order to win, the incumbent party needs to score eight of the 13 keys.  The problem here is that these keys are relatively subjective.  Some are objective, but some are definitely subjective.  And that's why even though Lichtman is only coding six of the 13 for the Republican party, for the incumbent Trump administration, however, the way that he's coding them is obviously incorrect.  And I'll explain that.  So at six out of 13 for Trump, That would indicate that Biden will win narrowly.  So let's look at the keys themselves.  Number one, the party mandate.  The midterms.  Did the incumbent party win congressional seats in the midterm elections?  No, that's false.  Contest.  There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.  That's true.  Nobody ran against Trump.  Incumbency, the incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.  There's always an advantage to an incumbent.  Trump is the incumbent.  That's two keys.  Six to go.  There is no significant third party or independent campaign.  That's also true.  I don't think you can count Kanye West as a significant third party campaigner.  The Green Party doesn't have a significant candidate.  The libertarians are no longer a factor.  So that's also true.  So that's three now.  The campaign or the economy is not in recession during the election campaign.  Again, you've got that massive COVID swing, but it's not in recession now.  I believe that might be one that he had coded, but it's not in what we would consider to be a conventional recession.  Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.  That is true.  Even with the up and down swing, the reported GDP has been very good because of Trump's trade war.  We've talked about this before.  When you limit imports, you automatically increase GDP.  policy change.  The incumbent administration affects major changes in national policy.  That's definitely true.  Trump has instituted major changes, which is why he's always at war with the courts.  The next one, social unrest.  There's no sustained social unrest during the term.  Well, that's obviously false.  So there's a tremendous amount of social unrest, Antifa, BLM, et cetera.  However, notice we're already at one, two, three, four, five, six.  We're already at six.  That's all.  And that's he needs two more.  Now, this is one I'm guessing where he coded it against Trump, but I don't think it should be.  The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.  Well, you've got the Russia, Russia, Russia collusion, which is false.  You've got the impeachment, which nobody even talks about.  So I don't think that you can count any of these things as scandals when no one cares about them.  I mean, not even the Democrats.  So I would rule that to be true.  Now this is one where I think he definitely got it wrong.  The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.  He hasn't.  Trump is the first president in years to keep us out of war.  No wars, no lost wars.  He's pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq.  He's avoided war with Iran.  He's avoided war with Russia.  And that brings us to the next question.  The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.  Lichtman coded that one false.  I disagree.  North Korea is a massive success.  Avoiding the war in Syria was a significant success.  So we'll find out who's right in a few weeks.  This was the other one that I think he ruled against.  The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.  Trump is obviously charismatic.  It'd be ridiculous to claim otherwise.  And then finally, The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.  Well, it's very clear that Joe Biden is not charismatic.  He's not a national hero.  He doesn't even know what state he's in or what office he's running for.  In fact, he's barely campaigning at all.  So if you look at the keys to the White House, I actually score 11 out of 13, which indicates, surprise, surprise, a Trump slide.  Now, the betting markets are another indicator.  However, it's important to remember that everybody knows that now.  So, of course, they've been corrupted.  The betting odds currently show 66.8% in favor of Biden.  You can still go out and make some money on Trump winning.  I told people to do that back in 2016.  You can probably do the same thing now.  One of my readers, I think, actually made something like $10,000 by putting a sizable bet on Trump.  What's interesting here, though, is that, first of all, Biden's odds are nowhere nearly as good as they should be if he was genuinely up by 16 points.  I mean, if The Economist is giving Biden a 91% chance of winning... How come the betting odds are only 67% in this favor?  It's because people don't believe the numbers and they shouldn't.  But here's why the number, the betting odds are not legitimate.  If you look at the amount of big money, if you look at the total amount of money that's being bet on Biden, something like 82% of it is being bet on Biden versus 18% on Trump.  But if you look at the people who are actually betting, this number is not quite right.  It's actually 52.8%.  So it's more like 53% of the people betting are betting on Trump.  So what we're seeing here is not an indication of strength for Biden or a belief that Biden is more likely to win.  What we're seeing is big money being used to, again, create a false impression.  More people who are betting, 53% of them believe that Trump's going to win.  But of the... 47 percent that are betting on biden.  some of them are betting a lot more money on that and that's what influences the odds.  it's not about the the numbers it's about the total amount of money.  so if you take all of these factors into account i think that you can see that These are collectively much more important and carry a lot more weight than the ridiculous fake polls from the fake news, which are specifically designed to demoralize Trump voters and try to convince more people to join the fake winning side.  And that's why I don't think that there's any cause for dismay.  I don't think there's any cause for alarm.  And I think that you can move through this demoralization season full of confidence and good cheer that in a few weeks, we're not going to see joe biden win by 16 points.  we're not going to see joe biden win at all.  what we are almost certainly going to see is a trump slide 2020. i'm vox day and this is the dark stream.
