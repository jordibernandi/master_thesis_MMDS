We're here today asking students if President Trump should move forward with the Supreme Court nomination just weeks before the election.  But what will they think when they hear Ruth Bader Ginsburg's view of the situation in her own words?  We're going to give them that quote.  We're going to tell them that she said it and then find out what they have to say.  All right.  So there's a vacancy right now, obviously, for the Supreme Court.  Big debate going on as to whether President Trump and the Senate should fill it right here, right before the election.  What do you guys think about that?  Do you think it should be filled? ",
