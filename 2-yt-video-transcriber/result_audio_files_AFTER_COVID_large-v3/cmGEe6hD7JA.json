            "text": "You're on the phone with customer service.  They do their job and take care of business, and then they say, is there anything else I could help you with?  No, no thank you.  And then the very last thing they say just as they're hanging up the phone is, have a blessed day.  What do you say to that?  Well, you can't say anything to that because they're already gone.  But why did they say that?  I mean, instead of have a nice day or, I don't know, something else, why have a blessed day?  Well, because here in the United States, religious fundamentalists own and control every level of state and federal government, and they want to enforce their religion on everyone else however they can.  That's why Christians get upset when atheist teachers or Jewish shopkeepers wish their Muslim students or Hindu customers happy holidays.  No, no, no, you say Merry Christmas, damn it.  You force the unbelievers to submit, not just to acknowledge our Christian dominion in this land, but to honor and to bow to our majority.  This is a Christian nation, founded by Puritans and based on a covenant between God and Moses, with a manifest destiny of divinely guided exceptionalism.  All of that is bullshit, of course.  The United States was the first secular government ever founded, and it was designed to be the very opposite of the type of government that is associated with Moses.  If Moses existed, he didn't.  He would hate everything about our system of government of, by, and for the people rather than for God, like every other nation was until that time.  So believers think they're waging a culture war to try and get back to a greatness that never was.  back when only the rich, straight, white, Protestant Christian men had rights and everyone else could be denied as not being true Americans, if not abominations.  They've been so successful in this alleged culture war that when they yell at other people's children that you will be burned alive and roasted in everlasting hell unless you beg almighty Jesus to forgive you for being the sinners that you are.  Everyone acts like they're okay with that.  But if you assure the kids that there is no boogeyman, I mean, God, well then it's... How dare you!  And if you're the only person honest enough to tell them that there's no good reason to believe in such a thing, that's somehow even worse.  Well, men's justify the mean, so it's okay to tell a white lie, as long as you're lying for Jesus.  But don't you tell those kids not to believe everything they're told.  That's why they don't want to teach actual factual lessons in science, sex, or social studies classrooms.  We oppose the teaching of higher order thinking skills which have the focus of behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging students' fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.  Yeah, the religious right really do think it's unfair to teach critical thinking to developing minds, so they censor lessons politicizing the classroom and making the secular sectarian to indoctrinate sequestered students into believing Protestant propaganda.  And to inoculate them against the false teachings of evolution and other satanic, communistic, cannibalistic lies from the pit of hell.  Then, once they crush the students' curiosity preaching religion from a position of authority, Then we can let these impressionable children decide for themselves to believe what we told them they better believe or suffer a fate worse than death.  And then we won't have to worry about them running off to college to learn forbidden knowledge.  Because remember that religion is literally make-believe.  They want to make you believe.  Because it's a lot easier to pretend yourself when everyone else is playing the same game that you are.  I mean, if you're the only one that believes that, that makes you delusional.  But if everybody else around you shares the same delusion, well, then that's religion or culture, which is the way they're sharing it.  And you don't want some cynical skeptic to come in and harsh your buzz, except that they know that we wouldn't do the same thing to them.  I mean, imagine if you ended all your transactions at work with, thank you, there is no God, all your cherished beliefs are silly superstitions.  We don't act like that, at least not on the job.  But believers are encouraged to do that, to spread what they think is their culture.  So when you're in the grocery line and you grab your bag and receipt to go, they throw in that last little dig, that have a blessed day, because they know that you're not going to stop and hold up the line to stay there and protest.  Not when they said something so nice.  Besides, you know the cashier doesn't even know they did anything wrong, and it would take an hour-long lecture and a history lesson to explain it, which of course you're not going to do.  if they even cared about it then, so they get to feel like they're blessing you and that you're happy to receive those blessings.  But what is a blessing?  What does it mean to have something blessed?  I suspect those of you who have dabbled in the witchcraft of dungeons and dragons may know the answer to this one.  In some role-playing games, you roll dice.  If you need to roll high, it helps if you have a magical artifact allowing you to add three or five to whatever you rolled.  Of course, your character can also carry a curse, too, requiring that you subtract two or four from your saving throw.  And these are modern gaming terms, of course, but they're based on what the religions actually believe.  So there are people who really do think that you can bless your golf clubs for a better game or put a curse on your neighbors.  Those are both in the Bible.  Blessings and curses are positive or negative magical enchantments.  That's really what they are, honestly.  So remember this.  If you're a Christian cashier or a customer service agent and you say, have a blessed day, what we hear is, have a magically enchanted day.  Because that is exactly what you really are saying.  And maybe that's how we should reply when we leave the checkout counter. ",
