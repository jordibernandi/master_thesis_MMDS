So we've just got to start, everybody.  Fasten your seatbelt.  Stephen is back.  We have, you know, here in the Northwest, we have all the volcanoes here are filling with magma, all of them.  We are ready to slip into the ocean.  Rainier, Adams, Baker, St.  Helens, Wood, Crater Lake, Mammoth is constantly shaking.  The magma is rising in Mammoth.  We have a financial reset.  We have digital currency soon.  The globalists are asking the Bank of England, are they ready to go into negative interest rates?  So, you know, everything is coming.  to one place here.  And the globalists, I think, are ready to make their final play.  With that being said, Stephen, let's go where you want to go. ",

And one thing I can share with people that I think will be really a blessing, and that is what you're talking about, all the... movement that is going on on the planet right now is absolutely correct.  I mean we're seeing it.  there's one video.  I actually have it up on the screen on my channel here right now.  Dutch sense good friend of mine Johnny Brown had sent this to me originally.  I guess ours showed me about this guy how he's always following these earthquakes and the move yes and things.  and And I'll tell you, Bonnie, the guy is so accurate. ",

He's an engineer with FEMA.  And he's got a very... Very well-informed source as well, deeper in the government.  But FEMA, I'll start off with this.  FEMA has been fully activated.  They're setting up.  They have had meetings recently.  discussing.  uh let me stop just for a moment by.  let me say one thing the sources that i do have are all believers and even though they may not agree with what's going on in their respective branches of the government they want people to know what's going on.  and i i feel i need to say that bonnie because sometimes people think oh my gosh fema oh the crooked horrible fema.  Well, the people I know know this.  They know that.  But there's still there's some people in there that are good people that, you know, they know what's going on.  And so they're willing to share and expose the things that are happening. ",

And what's very unique is the information normally just dovetails right there with the information that I get from people in the Pentagon.  And I've got multiple sources through the Pentagon.  So some of the things I'm going to be saying tonight, I may not be able to say where it's from because it's that sensitive of information in some cases.  But this is all dealing with what's going on.  The Earth is shifting.  And It is literally being caused from the fact that the Earth is absorbing a tremendous amount of energy.  I'll go into that a little bit later, but let me first back up to the FEMA engineer that I'm a good friend with.  He clearly told me that they've activated FEMA.  They're expecting a massive... The way he said it to me, they're being told and prepared and they brought in the high ranking people in FEMA reconfirming their commitment to what they do.  They said because they're about to face a catastrophic, as they call it, weather or earth related event that will bring about a mass loss of life. ",
