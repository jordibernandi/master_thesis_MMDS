Also, check out the join button for channel memberships.  And check out the merch.  Let's get into this, folks.  Last night, Monday night football between the New England Patriots and the New York Jets.  It happened, folks.  And the Patriots actually had a comeback win.  They won 30 to 27.  I was actually sitting on my couch before the game started and it was pregame.  And this was on ESPN, by the way.  And then I was absolutely shocked by what happened.  ESPN actually showed the national anthem.  Now, if you remember going back to week one, all of the networks were showing the national anthem, okay?  So players were actually kneeling for the national anthem, and a lot of fans got turned off.  The NFL ratings have suffered this season.  Some weeks are better than others, but for the most part, they are down, okay?  And a lot of you guys that actually watch our videos here, you said, all right, enough is enough.  Week one, that was enough for me to tune out the NFL.  And, you know, the same with the NBA.  We talked about them, and I'll get to them in just a moment here, okay?  But ESPN decided to show the national anthem because this is the week of Veterans Day, okay?  And when they said everybody rise for the national anthem, I was like, oh, my God, what is going to happen now?  Because, folks, they had members of the military.  Each branch had a person singing the national anthem and the cameras were tuned in on to the players.  And I'm thinking, oh my goodness, if somebody kneels for the national anthem while the military is singing the national anthem, this could be a huge PR blow to the NFL.  But folks, I must say, not one player kneeled for the national anthem that I actually saw, okay?  Now, the Patriots, I believe they had some players doing week one kneeling for the National Anthem, but I think as of late, all of the Patriots players have been standing for the National Anthem.  Now, they were playing the New York Jets.  Now, the Jets, they have not actually been on the field for the National Anthem.  They've actually been staying inside the locker room, okay?  But they actually stood up on the field.  This was a home game for them.  And they stood for the national anthem.  Now, my question is, were they actually pressured to stand for the anthem or actually be on the field for the anthem?  I guess you should say.  Maybe the NFL stepped in and say, hey, guys, you guys need to be on the field because this could look really, really bad.  We have members of the military actually singing the national anthem.  And if you guys kneel, if you guys are on the field, this is going to look very, very unpatriotic.  And I completely agree with that, man.  if players are actually kneeling for the anthem, when veterans actually singing the anthem, and this is in honor of, you know, a veterans day, which is actually this Wednesday, but of course, you know, there's no football games on Wednesday.  This could have been a horrible look for the NFL.  No doubt about it.  Now you remember nine 11 actually happened inside the NBA bubble during the playoffs.  And the, they actually had members of the military singing the national anthem.  And guess what?  All of these NBA players were taking a knee, kneeling, being very, very disrespectful to the members of the military that was singing a national anthem.  And I just could not believe that, that the NBA was stooped to that level to where just about all these players were kneeling for the national anthem.  It was absolutely disgusting.  Okay.  Now with this being Veterans Day, I was really hoping that the NFL would not go down the same route.  and he didn't, at least for this week, okay?  They had enough respect to actually stand for the anthem, be on the field at that, because a lot of teams just aren't even showing up on the field for the anthem, and none of the networks are actually showing the anthem.  Pretty much after week one, we haven't really seen the national anthem at all.  I can't remember.  I remember Clay Travis actually talking about the networks were not going to show the national anthem, but I guess ESPN decided that We need to show the national anthem in recognition of veteran state.  Maybe ESPN talk to the NFL, maybe the NFL talk to the teams that we want to show the anthem.  And by the way, folks, there's no fans in the stands.  So if ESPN wanted to show the national anthem and you actually don't have teams on the field, it's going to look really, really bad, you know, worse than even before, you know, when we actually had fans in the stands.  So I do believe that the NFL, because, you know, the NFL actually do has a contract with the military that the military, that they'll actually have players on the field doing a national anthem to help with recruiting.  You know, I get that.  But now, you know, so many players, well, not so many players, but there's still some players that are absolutely kneeling for the national anthem.  Still, it's just not a good look.  Okay.  But it is nice to see, you know, for this week, during the week of Veterans Day, Veterans Day is tomorrow, that the players had enough guts to actually stand up for the national anthem.  The Bills actually showed up on the field, you know, because they had been hiding in the locker room all season long for the most part.  But man, this was a risky move by ESPN.  And for this week, it paid off.  Now, will ESPN actually be showing a national anthem going forward?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  You know, they have Monday Night Football.  I don't think they're going to take that risk.  Because... It's a very, very bad look.  It just really, really is.  But that's just my thoughts on this.  What do you guys think of this?  ESPN showing the national anthem for recognition of veterans on Veterans Day.  Risky move.  I don't think they're going to show it again next week.  I really, really don't.  I'm just glad that these teams did not go the route of the NBA kneeling for the national anthem while veterans, who are actually active military people, are actually singing the national anthem.  So I guess hats off to the NFL.  But if you guys saw a player kneeling for the anthem, let me know.  But I didn't see one player kneel for the national anthem.  Anyway, guys, let me know what you think about all this in the comments.  Make sure you subscribe to Black and White Sports, and we'll catch you next time. ",
