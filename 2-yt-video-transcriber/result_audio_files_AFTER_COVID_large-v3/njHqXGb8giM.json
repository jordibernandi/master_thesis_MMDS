            "text": "All right, good morning, good evening, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of U2, Pastor Dow here.  Well, we're seeing it from Governor, so-called Governor Cuomo, as well as the rest of this country that the fix is in.  I remember 20 something years ago, and I'm going to keep on repeating this because I know many of you didn't know me 20 something years ago or definitely wasn't listening to my channel.  Because I don't think I got on YouTube until 2008.  And when I did, I was just on there just posting up old videos and didn't really get serious about YouTube until 2010.  But I remember saying that Walmart and these big corporations, mainly Walmart, is going to be the distribution center for the New World Order.  In order for that to take place, you've got to take away the people's ability to be able to trust in small businesses.  And mind you, small businesses are allegedly supposed to be what?  The backbone of our economy.  Well, we're sitting here watching our economy being destroyed right before our very eyes.  We're watching people go out of business.  We're watching people being fined to the hilt because they're, you know, the government or whoever it is are making laws.  And, of course, here we go again.  You know, anytime you contract with the government, i.e.  through business license, you subject yourself to their jurisdiction to do whatever they tell you.  And then, of course, people say, well, what do you do?  What do you do?  Well, you know, with the way that they have conditioned the American public today, you can't expect too much out of anybody.  And I really, truly mean that, too.  You literally, truly cannot expect too much out of anybody today.  Because if you're expecting for... yourself to open up your own private business on your own land and property.  First of all, you've got to live outside the city to do that, and you need some private property.  And then you can build your little shop, and then you can have people come down and pay you an old-fashioned check or cashier's check or cash or something like that.  You could probably succeed and do it.  But because people today are not willing to be inconvenienced, and they like the convenience of you being out there inside of the city limits, you have to go along and play along with their games.  And, of course, when you go along and play along with their games, they get to pick, choose, and determine any time they're going to pull their games away from you.  That's what they're going to do, too.  So you think about this for a second.  We got all these businesses all across America, all across the United States of America that are gone and will never come back.  I remember when this Walmart came up here in this town right here and you had these idiots.  I'm talking about, I heard them talking.  Well, we were glad that Walmart came because we liked the competition.  I shook my head.  I go, where does this mindset come from?  come from.  This mindset literally doesn't make any sense whatsoever at all.  How in the world can you be sitting up there talking about that?  you love the competition and your building ain't even 900 square foot and you're gonna go up against a giant like Walmart who gets good service and products for pennies on the dollar?  Well, how you like the competition now because I can take you through this township up here and turn this camera around on this phone and literally let you see all, what is that about, wind environment?  Literally let you see all of the empty shops, closed up doors, storefronts, empty, gone.  Ain't nobody renting, ain't nobody putting out a place, nobody, excuse me, nobody's starting any businesses.  So the ideal is, and this is the new world order standard, is to get everybody to depend on the government.  Are you folks hearing me?  To get everybody to depend on big government.  Get everybody to depend on big government.  I'm going to say it again.  Depend on the government.  You know, instead of you preparing yourself, and I'm not getting on y'all because I know somebody brand new is going to watch this video and they're going to thank me for it later.  See, instead of you waiting on a national disaster or some type of natural disaster to hit, instead of you doing that, You know what you could do?  This is what you could do.  You could start storing up some food.  You could start trying to store up clean water or get a source of water.  You know, what's a good source of good clean water?  I'll tell you something.  You may not like it, but, you know, you can live out in the country and have somebody dig a deep well, hit a spring.  And even if you don't have an electric pump, you can get a tin can, a coffee can, and a rope, and you can stick it down in there, and you got all your water supply, all that you need.  to do anything.  You might have to take a couple of dips, but hey.  You see what's going on?  The destruction of the American society.  And mind you, all empires have got to come to an end.  All empires is gonna come to an end.  All empires has gotta come to an end.  And it looks like the first thing that they're doing is destroying the economics or destroying the economy.  All right, well, then after you destroy the economy, what happens?  Well, the people end up into a depression.  I would like to call it an inflationary depression, but you know what?  We've since been done past that.  The only reason why we're not experiencing the pain of all these so-called ideals of finances is because we keep continuing to keep going to the Federal Reserve and printing thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars Hold on, let me see, I'm being modest.  Trillions of dollars.  Kicking a proverbial can down the road and think that we're never, either in this generation or the generation next to come, that we ain't got to pay somebody for all this.  It's sad.  So what did Pastor Dow always say?  And here I go with my one-string banjo theology again.  This is what I've always said.  Forget about your government.  Forget about the House and the Senate.  These people have enriched themselves and made themselves fat.  Forget about them.  Leave these folks alone.  Get out into the country.  You find your little homestead, even if you've got to go to Home Depot and you buy you one of those nice little two story barns that they sell for like twelve or thirteen thousand dollars.  And then you put another $5,000, $6,000 on insulation and sheetrock and drywall and get you a nice little iron wood stove.  I know, passed out, you sound stupid.  I know.  I just got finished leaving California a few months ago.  And I bet them people think I sound pretty intelligent, especially after all the tents I've seen out there in the middle of cities.  And ain't nobody trying to do nothing to help these people.  You see, with knowledge comes wisdom and comes power.  And when you've made moves, because watch this.  I remember when I started talking like this, my face was completely black.  I did not have one gray hair on my head.  Now I've got gray hair on my head.  You can clearly see it.  Check this out though.  I saw this as a young man in my 20s.  You know, having the ability to be able to see afar off.  That's what I saw in my 20s.  And you know, there's a wise book that says, if you have sown nothing in your youth, what can you expect in your old age?  Boy, these words ringing true.  I saw this many, many years ago.  Not only have I actually prepared my house, but I've actually, by my wisdom, have helped other houses to be prepared.  You see that?  In the city, I remember in the book, it says there was one wise man.  Watch this.  And that one wise man, by his wisdom, was able to deliver the whole entire city.  Your natural family is not going to deliver you with their philosophy, their traditions, their perspectives, their ideology or theology.  Your friends, your colleagues, your buddies, your chums, your pals, your work, the people who you work with, all these people.  None of them.  Because if they think just like you do and you ain't done anything, y'all going to suffer the same consequences.  If you continue to keep watching the news and expecting the news to give you all that, all this information, you can forget it.  If you expect for the American Red Cross and FEMA and everybody else, now FEMA is coming, though, because FEMA is going to have plenty of tent cities and counties for y'all, I promise they are.  But if you don't prepare, And some of you have refused to prepare.  And of course, now all you have is anxiety and fear that's continuing to keep tormenting you day and night.  Because you remember what this big-eyed preacher said years and years ago, and now it's resonating in your eyes, in your minds, in your conscience, in your ears.  There's some spirit.  that is spitting in your in your ear telling you man that that preacher was right wasn't he?  man?  you better at least do something.  yeah like you better go since you ain't getting many you don't lost them old um fancy.  uh know-how of canon man.  probably the best thing for you to do is just probably go to Walmart or go to Kroger or some food store and buy a whole bunch of canned goods, as much as you can.  And if Congress, you know, they try to tell you they're going to give you a $600 stimulus check if you make $175,000 a year.  Donald Trump said, I don't want that deal.  I want $2,400.  I want a $2,000 stimulus check.  Rather than going out and buying an Xbox or a PlayStation, you know, the new stuff, or worried about your children having Christmas, buying them a bunch of toys, which after a week or two, they're going to get tired of and just leave them sitting there.  And pretty soon you're going to end up throwing them in the trash because you're going to get sick and tired of tripping over them.  You probably better be thinking about self-preservation.  I can tell you this, your government ain't thinking about you, your pastors, your preachers, your mamas, your daddies, your meemaw, your ha-ha's, your GGs and seesaws and every damn thing else.  No, it takes people like me.  A sitting can be delivered.  A people can be delivered if they just listen to one wise man.  I can only hope that some way, somehow, Apple, iPhone, whoever it is, YouTube or whatever it is, they fix this because I've recorded this on my iPhone right here.  And when I can record stuff on my Droid, have no problems.  I can only hope that you can Have the ability.  I'm going to say I have the ability to hear this or see this.  But I can tell you this.  It ain't looking good.  It ain't looking good.  And I don't trust in this system.  I don't trust in politicians because I realize when their mouth is moving their line.  I do trust in what I'm able to produce and the wisdom and knowledge that the Most High has given me to be able to articulate.  and to be able to give people wisdom, knowledge, and understanding.  I can't live life for you, but you know, there's an old saying, I can't do this.  I am not going to go fishing for you and provide fish for you, but you know what I'll do?  I'll take you down to the watering hole, take you to the lake.  I'll get you, you know what I mean?  I may even buy you a fishing pole, a couple of hooks.  But you're the one going to tie the knot, put the bait on the hook, and catch the food.  And when I'm gone, guess what?  Not only did I teach you how to fish, but I've given you enough wisdom that you know how to fish for yourself and you can possibly live another day.  Probably be good if some of y'all would really truly take up the skill and learn how to hunt.  Because game, they just don't come sit in front of you and say, here, shoot me.  You probably need to learn how to hunt too.  And that in itself, is a steep learning curve.  Hope I said something to stimulate thought.  If you can, try to listen to me, okay?  There ain't another pastor out there on camp or church.  They're not talking like this.  They're depending on the good men.  Well, hand down. ",
