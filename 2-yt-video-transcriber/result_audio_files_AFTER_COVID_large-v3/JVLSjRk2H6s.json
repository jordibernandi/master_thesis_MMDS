            "text": "Who is coming all the way to Africa to get some?  Who is it?  is it the black men that drag them here?  is it the african men that drag them here?  no hello fam.  welcome to the african diaspora news channel.  i am wengil zalal.  i'm bringing you this report.  today's report is about old white ladies specifically from europe going as tourists to gambia and basically scoring a night with different young men that are from gambia and They are being accused of exploiting those young men for their pleasure.  Let me read you the article and we'll be back.  A new documentary on the UK's Channel 4 network that was broadcast on Monday reveals how the West African nations of Gambia has become a hotspot for older European holidaymakers, usually women, looking to show romantic love to young men in exchange for money or gifts.  An elderly white female tourist who spoke with British journalists on the Sex on the Beach documentary attested to how easy it was to hook up with the young men who are locally referred to as bumpsters.  She said it's paradise.  You could have a different man every night.  Face-to-face reported, Alka, a 32-year-old Gambian who is married to a Belgian woman twice his age, told Rhodes some of the women come to the coastal nation in search for love while others come for flings, referring to the latter groups as holidaymakers.  Sometimes they're not good tourists, they're holidaymakers, he said, someone who comes to f*** you and leave you.  alka added it really really hurts me referring to the sex tourists and how wealth disparities put some of the cougars in positions where they can pray and take advantage of the young men.  to be honest i really love this approach because i've heard we've all heard about the stories of this black african man exploiting this old vulnerable women.  they told them that they loved them and they took their money and they run away with it.  we hear that a lot But we've never heard of it from the other side.  How does that young black man feel?  Did he really fall in love with her?  Didn't she get anything from him in return when she was just giving him gifts and money?  Wasn't it an exchange between the two of them?  He's the only one taking advantage of her.  He's just exploiting her, but she's not.  Is she not a predator?  So all these things... We haven't heard from this side and I like the way that this report covered it.  They showed us the other side of it as well.  We've always, the mainstream media or the stories that they have told us so far is this young men exploit this old women.  They take advantage of them.  But who is coming all the way to Africa to get some?  Who is it?  Is it the black men that drag them here?  Is it the African men that drag them here?  No, they come for whatever reason.  They say they're coming there to be tourists and to visit.  Let's say the specific report is about Gambia.  So they go all the way to Gambia to visit.  And then what happens?  They're the ones that pick and choose which young man they want.  And some lady even said, you can get every night a different young boy, whichever one you want.  So you can't tell me.  this woman is being exploited.  She knows exactly what she's getting herself into.  She comes here to, she had a focus to come here to get what she wanted and she did.  So if she gives him a gift and he uses it or he takes that money, why?  why?  why is he the one that is an exploiter?  so i love this report the way they um talked about things and i think i believe that it's an honest way of looking at things like aren't there two people involved here?  both of them are grown-ups.  if anything she's way older than him.  this white old ladies are way older than this man so they should know better than even this young man because some of them are half even triple.  they can be their grandmas and they're here living their best lives like.  so why are we blaming this?  uh young boys?  because they see an opportunity and they're like.  i'm not i'm not condoning it i'm trying to see it from both sides.  perfect perspectives matter and context matters.  so if you're always going to be on the side of this old lady being uh lied to and manipulated how about this young boy?  he if anything she should know better than him.  so when they're coming and exploiting these young men nobody says why are they doing this to our boys?  they're not saying that this this boys are starting from teenagers to 20 something max 30 because they don't want no old man.  they want the young and the brightest and the strongest and somebody that can you know Whatever they're there for.  So yeah, I wanted to bring this report to you because I thought it was an interesting take on what is happening in Gambia and how the white ladies come, the old ladies, they're actually mostly old, they come there and they do what they want to do and when they go they want to cry and tell people for sympathy and say that this young man took advantage of them.  Really, who took advantage of who?  That's the main question.  I feel, me personally, I feel like it's a mutual, What do you call it?  Benefit between these two parties and they know what they're getting themselves into.  Yes, some people might fall in love and get hurt from both sides, I would assume.  But both of them are responsible for their own actions.  And I really don't feel sorry about these women that go do what they want to do and then go run to the media and run to them and cry to them and say this is what happened to me.  this is my story and this nigerian man did this to me.  this gambian guy did this to me.  this ghanian like you asked for it.  i'm not saying everybody the ones that go online and fall in love.  i i'm not in the business of judging okay maybe i am but in this case these women are flying across the world to be in that place and they know exactly what they're doing and they're there for exploiting this young man.  and if the young men are also using them i don't.  i don't feel sorry for them but anyways i like the way the report was done.  that's why i wanted to bring this to you guys down below.  tell us what your thoughts are about this old white women coming to africa to basically use our men and Crying when it doesn't work out.  Let us know down below.  I am when gives a lot.  I'm bringing you this report.  I'll see you on the next one.  Bye. ",
