            "text": "If you're an American, like me, first of all, FUUUUU-.  Second of all, we live in a country that for half a century has been defined by something called neoliberalism.  I don't love using that word because it sounds boring.  And talking about neoliberalism is like basically asking to get, well, actually, by the worst people on the internet.  Okay, that hurts.  But it's important, so here we go.  Neoliberalism is the idea that society works best when it's run by the free market and not the government.  It's the belief that the most efficient way to distribute goods and services is by handing them over to the private sector.  I know that sounds abstract, but you've definitely heard neoliberal thinking a lot in your life.  Do you really want the government in charge of your healthcare?  They're so slow and wasteful.  Why not private insurance?  Neoliberalism.  If you keep giving people government handouts, they'll never learn to fend for themselves.  You're creating a country of dependence.  Neoliberalism.  If you really want to help people, you should cut taxes and regulations.  Let the private sector flourish.  It's like they always say, rising tide lifts all boats.  Yeah.  Neoliberals oppose government control of the economy.  Which is why, unlike a lot of developed countries, the US does not offer things like universal healthcare, free college, paid sick leave, or a bunch of other basic shit.  If you want something in this country, you need to buy it on the free market.  And that means you need to work.  You want medicine and a place to live?  Get a job.  You want time off so you can be with your family?  Get a better job.  This is America, baby.  If you don't have enough, you're not working hard enough.  Hashtag no days off.  Hashtag sleep when you're dead.  Hell yeah.  Thank you.  we don't really have a government safety net here.  So if you don't have a job, you are shit out of luck.  America has one of the worst unemployment benefits programs in the industrialized world, giving people less money and covering them for less time after they lose their job.  Even basic government aid programs like food stamps and Medicaid often have work requirements, which means if you don't work a certain number of hours per week, you don't even qualify for help.  Now, you may be watching this and thinking, yeah, that's the way it should be.  If you don't work, You don't eat.  And I have to admit, there is something primally seductive about the brutality of the free market.  It's almost Darwinian.  We're not a country of takers like those lazy Europeans.  Work will set you free.  We're not welfare queens looking for government handouts.  Work will set you free.  We're Americans.  We pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.  Work will set you free.  And then, work will set you- Something happens, and suddenly millions of Americans are out of a job.  The coronavirus has left millions of Americans out of work.  6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.  Countless more are sick, or tending to the sick, or trying desperately not to become sick.  The entire US economy is essentially at a standstill.  Entire sectors of the economy evaporate.  and won't be back for months.  For example, in the restaurant industry, one in four of those jobs is never coming back.  The thing about neoliberalism is if you can't work, if you don't have labor to sell at the free market, you are essentially worthless.  So now we have millions of Americans with nothing to trade for basic shit like rent and food and medicine.  And a government that believes it's not its job to interfere with the free market.  So what happens now?  You selling those bootstraps?  A neoliberal would say, this is what savings are for.  It's not neoliberalism's fault.  these people didn't prepare for a rainy day, or weeks, or months.  But actually, it kind of is.  And I should say, before I show you this next sketch, that I haven't really had human contact for like three weeks.  So if this is dark and disturbed, that's why.  Wait, what?  Okay, here we go.  Ugh, neoliberalism.  What is it?  Who owns it?  And can I make it work for you?  Let's say you're a boss, trying to win big on the free market.  And trust me, in this economy, you wanna be a boss.  Your job is to maximize profits.  So, what salary should you pay the employees? ",
