            "text": "Aloha, everyone.  I want to tell you about a new project that I'll be launching very soon.  Over the last several years, one of the most beautiful things that I have experienced and appreciated throughout my service in public office and in the military are the people I've met from all across the country, from around the world, and the incredible conversations that we've shared.  So whether it was visiting a farmer in Iowa or a pastor in South Carolina or a small business owner in Syria, we are all connected.  Children of God, brothers and sisters, and we have so much more in common than we may realize.  Now more than ever, during these dark and divisive and dangerous times, we have the opportunity to be a positive force, to help heal the divide, to treat each other with aloha, with respect and love, and better understand each other.  So on my show, I will go beyond the soundbite and share in-depth information, insights, and thought-provoking discussions.  And I'll answer your questions, whether they are about foreign policy, politics, the environment, or maybe just questions you have about life, yoga meditation, music, surfing, or food.  We will tackle the great challenges of our time together.  We will go where others won't.  We'll gain new perspectives and we will never shy away from the tough conversations.  So I hope you'll join me.  Click subscribe and I look forward to seeing you soon.  Aloha. ",
