I'm talking about Meghan McCain, who is back at The View.  And full disclosure, I know this woman.  I know her from cable newsrooms.  Generally speaking, and I'm saying this intentionally because I do think that this is where people get lost.  She reaches across party aisle.  I mean, on the show, clearly, there's some drama happening there.  But off the show, she talks to everybody.  She quotes Democrats.  You're in the newsroom with her.  Her mother, I think, is a little bit more progressive than we all know.  But there's a danger in that.  And what I'm going to show you right now is, I think, highlights this beyond.  So let's play that clip of Meghan McCain with Senator-elect Raphael Warnock. ",

And right now, what is the Senate doing?  They're engaged in a shameless exercise of privilege and power.  challenging the basic norms of our government.  The people of Georgia rose up and rebuked that kind of policy last night, and I intend to represent their interests in the U.S.  Senate to make sure they have health care, to make sure that they enjoy livable wage, and that their voice can be heard in their democracy.

She could have said, if she were operating in good faith, she could have said something like, Do you think it is appropriate for a new majority to expand the Supreme Court to protect their own interests at the expense of the greater good?  Now, I wouldn't agree with that, but that's a little more honest, right?  But we've done it before.  There's nothing that says we can't.  We can do it in the right way, or we could do it in a shabby way.  We could actually expand the size of the Supreme Court to have more diverse and highly competent justices on the Supreme Court.  Even irrespective of their political ideology, they're very competent and smart people who do not share my political philosophy.  I do not believe those people are idiots.  I believe they're wrong.  Right.  There's a difference.  So what he has done and some conservatives agree that a number of their of his appointments and nominees are not actually competent for the roles that they serve.  And that's a bigger issue.  And that's something that even and I was not a fan of John McCain as as an elected official.  His Maverick thing, I think, was way blown out of proportion.

The problem, of course, is if Biden doesn't cower to Joe Manchin's bullying, um, potential bullying and he switches parties or he, or he becomes an independent and caucuses as has happened, you know, obviously that's something Bernie Sanders has done caucus with the Democrats and he caucuses with the Republicans.  Um, then, um, you know, Biden is not, I would hope that Biden does not reward him for that defection.  It'll make it hard for him to do things back home in West Virginia.
