            "text": "Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to a special Wednesday edition of the Watchman Newscast.  We have some breaking news to report overnight.  Wednesday, January 13th, the Israel Defense Forces reportedly carried out massive airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria.  yet again.  The Middle East never sleeps.  And we've got all the breaking details for you.  before I get into it.  I just want to encourage you to subscribe to the Watchman News channel right here on YouTube and click the notification bell so you get alerts every time a new video is posted.  Breaking news updates like this, we want to be your one-stop shop for all the latest breaking Middle East news and how it affects you no matter where you live.  So let's get into it again.  in the wee hours of Wednesday, January 13th.  Israeli warplanes reportedly struck at least 15 Iranian targets in eastern Syria.  Now, that's right along the Syria-Iraq border line.  These were mostly, according to reports, warehouses that were housing Iranian weapons, in particular Iranian missiles.  We've talked a lot here on previous newscasts about that growing Iranian ballistic missile program.  So these warehouses were home to Iranian missiles, number one.  And according to some reports, may have also contained components of for Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Wow.  So a major, major hit to the Iranian regime.  Israel has not claimed responsibility for these strikes, but as we've told you many times here in the newscast, over the past few years, Israel has carried out probably hundreds at least, of similar strikes against Iranian and Hezbollah and other various radical targets, military and terror targets inside Syria as Iran continues to entrench itself in that country with the goal of pushing up against Israel's border, the Syria-Israel border on the Golan Heights.  But back to last night.  At least 15 of these warehouses struck.  There were Iranian assets, Iranian foot soldiers, I presume, on the ground, probably including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, the elite IRGC.  This area in eastern Syria along the Iraq border has long been a hotbed of Iranian activity.  So number one, you most likely had IRGC members there, Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, overseeing these missiles and these warehouses.  Number two, most likely foot soldiers from the Assad regime in Syria, which is hosting Iran.  Number three, probably some Hezbollah presence there.  And fourth, these radical Iraqi Shia militias also likely had a presence in the area.  According to various Syrian opposition groups, at least 57 of these radical fighters were killed.  In these strikes overnight, another report I read said 30.  It's hard to verify right now.  We don't know the exact number.  But it is pretty clear that these were big airstrikes that took out these warehouses with vital Iranian weapons components.  And I would think that since the scale of these airstrikes was pretty large, according to reports, that some of these Iranian and Iranian linked fighters and terrorists who were there were killed in these strikes.  Now, an interesting wrinkle to this story, according to a U.S.  intelligence official who is unnamed, Various media outlets are quoting him.  He remained anonymous.  They're quoting him.  He said that during a meeting yesterday, the head of the Israeli Mossad intelligence service, Yossi Cohen, a meeting in D.C.  at a restaurant between Yossi Cohen, the head of Mossad, and the U.S.  Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, the details of this strike were discussed.  Reportedly, during that meeting between the head of the Mossad and the US Secretary of State.  Very interesting wrinkle there.  Again, this is an anonymous, unnamed US intelligence official sharing those details with the media that Pompeo and Yossi Cohen discussed these pending strikes, which I'm sure any time Iranian assets and Iranian weapons are struck and weakened and neutralized, I'm sure the U.S.  is very happy about that.  The United States and Israel have clearly worked very closely together to thwart this Iran threat over the past few years.  I'll give you a great example.  Just last week, Israel supplied two Iron Dome missile defense batteries to the United States, which U.S.  forces will undoubtedly use in Iraq.  where we've seen so many of these rocket and missile attacks against the U.S.  Embassy in Baghdad carried out by these Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militias.  No fallout yet from this major overnight strike.  Another black eye for the Iranian regime.  They've been hit and hit hard over the past year plus by the United States and by Israel.  But you have to wonder, folks, when we talk about these warehouses that were struck, storing components of Iran's missile program, that makes me think right away of those precision-guided missiles, PGMs for short, that Iran has been hell-bent on supplying to Hezbollah.  That Syria-Iraq border is a crucial transit point, right?  Think about it.  When you're moving from Iran through Iraq, through Syria onto Lebanon at Israel's doorstep.  So that is a crucial transit point for the Iranian regime to get weapons into the hands of Hezbollah, not only in southern Lebanon, which is Hezbollah's home base, but in Syria as well, where Hezbollah also has a presence, along with other various radical Iranian-backed terror organizations right near Israel's border there in the Golan Heights region.  With the precision-guided munitions, folks, they do exactly what their name says.  They are precision-guided.  Many times, Hezbollah rockets over the years have not quite hit the mark, not for lack of effort, and still very dangerous and deadly.  But when you upgrade your missile stockpiles to precision-guided missiles, PGMs, you will, unfortunately, hit your mark.  And that's exactly what Hezbollah is seeking to do.  Now, many times... Iran is not shipping the entire intact missile these days through Syria onto Lebanon because they know that Israel is very closely tracking these various convoys and shipments of missiles.  So what they're doing is shipping precision guided missile parts.  that Hezbollah can then assemble in Lebanon or in Syria once it arrives.  So again, no surprise that these strikes happened.  The third such strikes, these were the biggest last night, but the third such strikes in the past two weeks alone, including about a week ago, some airstrikes near Damascus, the Syrian capital.  And again, this is just the latest in a series of hundreds Some say thousands of such strikes carried out by Israel against Iran and its various terror allies in Syria over the past few years.  So we are keeping a very close eye on this.  Will Iran retaliate?  Obviously, I mentioned at the top, total tinderbox.  We've been giving you frequent updates here in the newscast practically every day over the past three weeks or so.  So I really encourage you to subscribe if you want to know what's going on in the world's most dangerous... most strategic, most chaotic region, this is your place.  We are bringing you these updates on a regular basis, serving as watchmen on the wall for such a time as this for you.  And man, we really, really appreciate you.  So we will continue to monitor any potential Iranian response.  We've talked about the tinderbox, Israel and the U.S.  sending messages, various messages and shows of force to Iran in the form of submarines surfacing in the Persian Gulf at Iran's doorstep, in the form of the United States flying B-52 bombers low over the Persian Gulf, again in plain sight of the Iranian regime, in the form of the U.S.  aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, Staying in the Persian Gulf again to send that message to the Iranian regime.  Israel, of course, also sailing a submarine into the Persian Gulf last month as well and surfacing.  So it's a tit for tat thing going on right now where both sides are trying to send messages.  on the Iranian side.  They carried out a major drone drill just last week.  You can check it out in our archives here on the Watchman Newscast.  A major drone drill involving hundreds of Iranian-made drones that can be equipped with explosives and used as suicide drones.  We also had Iran revealing yet another underground missile base just last Friday.  We also reported here on the newscast on that development.  And Iran, of course, upping their uranium enrichment.  to really dangerous levels.  where?  to the point where a top Israeli minister who's close to Prime Minister Netanyahu, Zaki Hanegbi is his name.  I've interviewed him a few times on the Watchmen TV show on TBN.  He basically said today, look, if the Biden administration, if the United States under a President Biden would reenter the Iran nuclear deal, which was disastrous, of course, and empowered the Iranian regime, he said, hey, all bets are off.  And so take that with what you will, what he said, but I think kind of laying down the gauntlet, and this is, again, an Israeli minister who's close to Prime Minister Netanyahu, but I think on either side of the aisle, whether it's a moderate Israeli prime minister, a so-called right-wing Israeli prime minister, whoever, all are united when it comes to the Iranian threat and not allowing under any circumstances the Iranian regime to acquire the bomb.  Now, both Republican and Democrat presidents have said the same here in the United States.  Do they really mean it in the case of a Biden administration?  We are about to find out.  If they are really committed to preventing the Iranian regime from acquiring the world's deadliest weapons.  Two last quick notes when we talk about this tit-for-tat that's going on right now with the U.S.  and Israel and the Sunni Arab nations like Saudi Arabia on one side and the Iranian regime and its proxies on the other.  That includes these radical Shia militias that we mentioned in Iraq.  That includes Hezbollah in Lebanon.  That includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.  That includes the Houthis in Yemen, who the Trump administration, before they leave office, just announced that they will designate as a foreign terrorist organization.  And of course, that also includes that Iranian axis, the Assad regime.  in Syria.  The battle lines are very clearly drawn.  Two last notes before I go on the tit for tat going on right now.  Iran today, again on Wednesday, January 13th, is holding a missile drill at sea with two apparently brand new Iranian battleships at sea.  and holding missile drills there in the Gulf of Oman.  Again, sending that return message.  U.S.  and Israel saying, don't even think about it, Iran, when it comes to these revenge attacks for Qasem Soleimani and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.  And Iran responding, hey, we're not scared.  We're on the offensive and we're coming for you, West and Israel.  So we're keeping a very close eye on that tit for tat.  The last note, and I may get into this in greater detail tomorrow because it's fascinating, In a completely troubling way, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech yesterday in D.C.  where he said that Iran is now essentially the home base for al-Qaeda.  Very interesting speech and detailed by the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Again, as the Trump administration prepares in a week from now to leave office, laying the groundwork, not only designating the Houthis, but You know, apparently signing off on the airstrikes overnight against Iran in Syria against those Iranian targets.  And now announcing for the world that Iran has become an al Qaeda safe haven where al Qaeda can plot and plan with perhaps some assistance.  from the Iranian regime.  Kind of a nightmare scenario, depending on what happens overnight and the rest of today and tomorrow morning.  I will likely, on tomorrow's newscast, break down this Iran-Al Qaeda relationship.  Folks, it's very important.  You won't want to miss it.  Thanks for joining us today.  God bless you.  Remember, God Almighty still sits on the throne.  Why do we share this information with you?

We believe you'd rather know than not know what is happening in real time in the world's most strategic region, the Middle East, and most importantly, how it affects you, your nation, and your family, no matter where you live.  So God bless you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  And remember, never.  Hold your peace. ",
