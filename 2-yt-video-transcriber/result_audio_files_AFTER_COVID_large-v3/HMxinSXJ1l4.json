When I was 15, my voice changed.  During one of the most tumultuous times in my life, I was outed, subsequently forcing me to also deal with the societal bigotry that many out LGBTQ people face on a daily basis.  However, from that point on, I noticed that I also began to speak differently with others.  It's hard to remember exactly what changed, but from what I can tell, I started speaking in a more nonchalant way and didn't worry as much about whether or not my pitch was consistently low and masculine.  I was still interpreted to be cisgender and heterosexual by those I met, but while with fellow queer people, I noticed that my voice felt more natural and I didn't have to pay as much attention to how I was speaking.  My voice flowing in and out of different types of enunciation has gotten me to receive a number of comments over the years.  Some people have told me I sound while others have told me that I sound straight.  Even though I'm non-binary, many people interpreting my voice will still think about this within a gay-straight dichotomy.  It's always been difficult for me to figure out why my voice had changed.  Was I trying to speak in a queer way?  What does that even mean?  And what does speech have to do with sexuality or gender?  As you might imagine, there's nothing inherent in the way that someone speaks that indicates their sexuality or gender.  These ways that we interpret sound depend on cultural context.  However, as a closeted person growing up in the United States, I was raised to believe that speech did reflect sexuality and gender.  Mainstream American society has very tight categories that tie gender to voice, with any deviations from a gender binary being indicative of some type of queerness.  For a lot of LGBTQ people, navigating this minefield of stereotypes can be dangerous and disheartening.  But where exactly did this come from?  And why would people associate the tone of my voice with whether or not I'm gay or straight?  The 2015 documentary Do I Sound Gay?  attempts to answer this question.  In the film, director David Thorpe works with speech therapists to help him gain more control over his voice, allowing him to change aspects of his voice that might be perceived as gay.  In addition to this, the film interviews people whose voices don't necessarily correlate with stereotypes about sexuality.  In the movie, a heterosexual man has a voice that makes people think he's gay, while a gay man with a deep voice is often presumed to be heterosexual.  As you might imagine, this also affects gender presentation and perception.  For writer David Sedaris, it's not uncommon to be addressed as ma'am when speaking on the phone.  At the end of the day, there's no definitive answer to why people sound a certain way.  There are too many variables and cultural distinctions that make it almost impossible to pinpoint one source.  But that's not why I'm talking about this.  I'm not that interested in finding answers regarding why people sound the way they do, because that's ultimately a subjective and contextual thing.  Instead, I do think there is something to be said for learning more about how stereotypes influence our perception of sound.  Because that's the part that LGBTQ people have to deal with on a daily basis.  Societal stereotypes placing them in boxes that dictate how they should sound and how they will be heard.  As you might imagine, Disney has also played a role in reinforcing stereotypes regarding speech and queerness.  Like I've described before on this channel, there are numerous examples of queer coding and parody within the Disney catalog.  My video on Ferdinand the Bull is a good example of this, showing how a story mainly about pacifism could be turned into a vaguely queerphobic critique via a song.  that implies Ferdinand's pacifism makes him effeminate and therefore less manly?  If you want even more examples of this, it also doesn't take long to find the numerous Disney villains that continue the cinematic tradition of linking gay stereotypes with villainy.  However, did you know that the most stereotypically queer Disney film was actually released in the early 40s?  Let's talk about The Reluctant Dragon. ",

            "text": "It's fun.  It's fun.  To be free.  But to be free.  Released on June 20, 1941, The Reluctant Dragon was a Disney film that was part studio tour, part animated feature.  Taking its title from the children's story of the same name, the film follows Robert Benchley, the protagonist who spends the movie trying to sell the rights of the aforementioned story to Disney, but is sidetracked with the tour of the studio.  However, the focal point of the film is the animated short based on the children's story, depicting the relationship between a young boy, a knight, and a dragon.  After the boy's father incites hysteria in their village due to having seen a dragon, the boy meets the dragon, only to find out that he isn't violent at all.  In fact, the dragon loves poetry and is quite personable.  However, upon arriving back at the village, the boy finds out that the dragon slayer, Sir Giles, has already arrived to kill the dragon.  After introducing Giles to the dragon, the boy finds out that Giles also loves poetry, leading him to develop a kinship with the dragon.  To satisfy the village, a fight is then staged, with Giles and the dragon faking the fight, unbeknownst to the onlooking villagers.  After pretending to slay the dragon and telling the village that the dragon is reformed, the village is then accepting of the dragon being different, and he promises to never roar or scare anyone ever again.  At the heart of the story, it's a tale about accepting someone who is different.  The dragon is painted as this vicious beast that will harm anyone and anything, but in reality that couldn't be further from the truth.  Similar to Ferdinand the Bull, the original story is more about pacifism than anything else, with the ending actually being a positive portrayal of being inclusive and open-minded.  Now what could be wrong with that?  Well, in The Reluctant Dragon, also like in Ferdinand the Bull, the titular character is queer-coded to be effeminate and supposedly queer or gay.  Of course, when I refer to queer-coding, I'm referring to the specific method of portraying LGBTQ characters that became popular in cinema after the implementation of the Hays Code in 1934.  Because any type of quote-unquote sex perversion was prohibited from films of the time, filmmakers began writing characters that were heavily implied to be LGBTQ through stereotypical behavior, but not through explicit statements.  This played a role in not only emboldening queer stereotypes, but ingraining them into the medium of film.  For example, queer-coded Disney villains are not explicitly said to be queer, but a lot of their mannerisms and speech are part of the lineage of villains that personified LGBTQ stereotypes.  By doing this, stereotypes long associated with LGBTQ people also became just general characteristics that people associate with villains, therefore conflating the two.  The character of the dragon in The Reluctant Dragon is very queer-coded.  Sporting a very effeminate voice and being drawn with effeminate features, his speech and presentation are presented at odds with society.  He's supposed to fit within the archetype of being a scary dragon, but can't help but express his delicate and dainty nature.  Sir Giles arguably operates in a similar way, with his suit of armor making him look more tough than he really is.  Disney also added elements to the story to reflect this.  For example, in Disney's version, the dragon is constantly interested in drinking tea.  In the final battle, he not only fakes the battle while having tea with Sir Giles, but they also waltz together in a brief scene that almost feels romantic in the way it's presented.  If anything, the effeminacy of the reluctant dragon in the title segment of the anthology film is even more pronounced than Ferdinand's.  Like the bull, the dragon sports long, emotive eyelashes and contains not an aggressive bone in his body, with the dragon prancing and pirouetting throughout the story.  However, at the center of the dragon's queerness is his voice, one that follows societal stereotypes about what a queer person sounds like.  Oh, he did, really?  I say queer instead of gay because though many people interpret the dragon to be gay, queer stereotypes and queer coding affect many people across different sexualities and genders.  And at the end of the day, my point is to not say that the dragon is something, but rather that his character deconstructs societal binaries of gender and performance.  That being said, the incredibly effeminate performance by Barnett Parker not only sets the stage for the dragon to be queer-coded, but also provides context from an actor also known for playing queer-coded roles.  In Live, Love, and Learn from 1937, Parker glistened as an interior decorator named Alfredo.  In one scene, Alfredo enthuses over the boldness of his chosen fabrics.  His client, Robert Montgomery, continues Alfredo's flouncing manner to respond that one design would obviously bring out the beast in a man.  The queer coding I'm talking about isn't me just projecting modern sensibilities onto an old text.  Despite the movie asserting that the dragon is male, referring to him as he, both the New York Times and Variety referred to the dragon as a woman in reviews of the film from 1941.  This shows that the way the character was presented and portrayed not only fit within the story of being a societal outsider, but also played into gender ambiguity.  And just to be clear, I think this type of coding is ultimately harmful.  Even though The Reluctant Dragon ends with society accepting the queer-coded character, upholding beliefs that queer people act certain ways does more harm than good.  By positioning LGBTQ individuals as outsiders from a given society, movies like The Reluctant Dragon perpetuate stereotypes and also shift the blame to LGBTQ individuals.  In order to get respect from society, they must be accepted by it, something that's a different stance from society having to do the work and analyze its own prejudices.  However, why do we associate a character like this with queerness at all?  To bring it back to the beginning of this video, why do many people hear the dragon and think, gay?  Where did this stereotype originate?  It's hard to definitively say where it originated, but there is something to be said for the particular way in which the dragon is portrayed.  The dragon has a voice, a high-pitched voice with the accent of an English dandy.  In fact, the dragon's long, black, fluffy ears often droop around the sides of his face in an approximation of the English dandy, Oscar Wilde.  Rather than fight battles with knights, this dragon wants to play music, hold high tea, and write poetry.  At one point, the dragon is specifically referred to as a punk poet, at a time where the common slang definition for punk was homosexual male.  The key word in this excerpt is dandy.  From the perspective of American culture, this stereotype is all too well known.  The vaguely British-sounding, prissy character that has effeminate mannerisms was something that I grew up with, with the implication being that all the characters that acted that way were either gay or queer.  But what does dandy mean?  In this situation, the definition is more akin to what the Oxford English Dictionary describes as one who studies ostentatiously to dress fashionably and elegantly, a fop, and exquisite.  It can be said that an American equivalent of dandy is the word pansy, which isn't very common today, but it was common in the early 20th century to denote a similar stereotype.  There's nothing inherently queer about being a dandy, but historically a lot of the characteristics that we associate with words like dandy are also associated with queer stereotypes.  So when did sexuality become a part of it?  This is debated, but Alan Sinfield attributed the link between dandies and same-sex attraction to the Oscar Wilde trials of the late 1800s.  As one of the most famous dandies of the time, Wilde was essentially publicly denounced as a homosexual during the trials, tarnishing his reputation for the rest of his life and bringing to the forefront a direct link between dandy culture and a queer underground.  Even in our modern-day society, we see lingering effects of the dandy stereotype.  Contemporary stereotypes linking gay men with fashion and femininity bear a remarkable resemblance to the same type of stereotype employed in The Reluctant Dragon.  That's why it's no surprise to me that the portrayal of the dragon gets down the dandy aesthetic to a T. It was an easy way to communicate to the audience that the dragon was an outsider.  The animation and presentation also feel comical, making the dragon's personality comic relief when juxtaposed with societal stereotypes about femininity.  And, by nature of being a Disney movie, there was a song to be marketed along with the film.  Similar to the titular song that was released with Ferdinand the Bull, The Reluctant Dragon highlights the fact that the main character is a pacifist, but is also very effeminate. ",

The lyrics of the song also poke fun at the dragon's gender, with a specific reference to him aspiring to becoming the Queen of May, a tradition associated with women, therefore making this comment a bit of a queerphobic insult within the song's context.  As Disney begins dipping their toes into fairly portraying the lives and experiences of LGBTQ individuals, it can be interesting to look back and remember how their relationship to the community has changed over the years.  Today, the reluctant dragon, at least the short contained within the movie, holds its place as, in my opinion, the most stereotypically queer Disney movie out there.  with the entire thing just being one big punchline for a dandy stereotype.  However, I also look at it as a subtle reminder.  Over time, I've actually come to love the character of the dragon.  Even though I know it wasn't necessarily intended to be that way, I see him as an unapologetically queer dandy in a viscerally queerphobic era.  And ultimately, I think that spirit captures the resilience that makes me love and admire the LGBTQ community so much.  Like I learned while discovering my voice, being queer also means having a complicated relationship to culture and having to spend almost your entire life disentangling how your personal self-discovery has been hindered by stereotypes.  The Reluctant Dragon reminds me that there's power in reclaiming things.  When I see the dragon pouring tea instead of fighting, I empathize, because I too understand how it feels to put on a show for others and use a voice that isn't yours.  What was intended as a punchline can become a compliment.  And that's not necessarily a testament to the cartoon, but to the power of queer experience.  It's not about what you're expected to feel, but how you really feel. ",
