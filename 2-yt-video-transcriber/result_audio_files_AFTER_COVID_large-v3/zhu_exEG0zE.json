The president's attorneys moving forward with legal challenges to the 2020 presidential election.  President promising big cases showing unconstitutionality.  Joining us now is Jordan Sekulow, the executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice, also a member of the president's legal team.  Perfect person to talk to.  Jordan, thanks for coming on.  Where does it all stand this morning? ",

They got there late.  So we've got to stay out of the Supreme Court on that.  That has been referred to the full court.  I think what the Supreme Court's looking at is whether or not there will be enough cases put together that could make their way to the Supreme Court where it would be outcome determinative.  That's the key.  this week is GETTING IN ENOUGH CASES AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL WHICH ULTIMATELY WOULD BE OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE.  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  ENOUGH VOTES WOULD CHANGE, ILLEGAL VOTES WOULD BE THROWN OUT.  THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD WIN.  JUST FILED AGAIN OVER LAST NIGHT WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA AN AMENDED COMPLAINT BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THIS CALLS ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO HALT ANY CERTIFICATION.  BUT IT ALSO GOES TO THE HEART OF AN EQUAL PROTECTION CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIM.  which is that in some counties, you were actually called if you submitted a ballot and did something wrong, and you were allowed to correct the ballot.  And that happened in Democrat counties.  And in Republican counties, they followed the normal procedure, which is they don't call people back to correct a bad ballot.  They just toss that ballot out.  So there's equal protection claims there.  Also one arising in Georgia relating to the signature verification difference between mail-in ballots and in-person voting.

Because I think a lot of people are saying there's not going to be enough to flip Pennsylvania back to Trump because it's like 60,000 votes. ",

So we've got that.  We've got the state, the Supreme Court on the ballots that came in.  So I think you start combining that together.  And you look at also the entirety of the processes, as we have argued, was failed.  And I will tell you that you could start thinking about what that term may mean when we talk about failed elections inside states.  The Constitution and federal law has a procedure to fix failed elections. ",

We've heard so much about it.
