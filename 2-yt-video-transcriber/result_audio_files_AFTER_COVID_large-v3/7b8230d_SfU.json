            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to Clownfish TV.  This is Neon, and we have kind of a... I guess a big story?  I don't know, I'm just kind of like... It's another day, another day, another news story.  Yeah, Ellen Page is now Elliot Page.  This is just breaking news, it's all over the media.  Ellen Page is now Elliot Page, saying that... pronouns are he and they, and my name is Elliot.  I feel lucky to be writing this, to be here, to have arrived at this place in my life.  This comes not long after there was some controversy about Ellen Page starring in a GamerGate movie from BuzzFeed.  So we're going to talk about that.  We're going to stick to the facts, right?  Because this is a big celebrity news story.  So before I get into it, please subscribe for more pop culture news, views, and rants.  Guys, we're over 156,000?  156,000 subs.  Thank you for this support.  So yeah, this literally just broke a few minutes ago.  Everybody's talking about it.  I think Variety broke it first.  Oscar-nominated Umbrella Academy star Elliot Page announces he is transgender.  Elliot Page, the Oscar-nominated star of Juno and Netflix's The Umbrella Academy, has announced he is transgender.  Elliot, formerly known as Ellen Page, addressed his social media followers saying, I want to share with you that I am trans.  My pronouns are he, they and my name is Elliot.  I feel lucky to be writing this, to be here, to have arrived at this place in my life.  I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey.  I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.  I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community.  Thank you for your courage, your generosity and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place, I will offer whatever support I can and continue to strive for a more loving and equal society.  I love that I'm trans.  I love that I'm queer.  And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows, and the more I thrive.  To all the trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse, and the threat of violence every day, I see you.  I love you.  I will do everything I can to change this world for the better.  Page continued.  Page uses both he, him, and they, them pronouns and describes himself as transgender and non-binary, meaning that his gender identity is neither man nor woman.  Nick Adams, GLAAD's director of transgender media said, Elliot Page has given us fantastic characters on screen, has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people.  He will now be an inspiration to countless trans non-binary people.  All transgender people deserve the chance to be ourselves and to be accepted for who we are.  We celebrate the remarkable Elliot Page today.  So I have some questions as to what's going to happen with the Umbrella Academy, because Elliot Page is still playing white violin, who is a woman.  Now, Elliot Page is non-binary.  So does that mean that Elliot Page is going to continue to play white violin?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But this is interesting.  This comes a couple of weeks after Ellen Page had a bit of controversy agreeing to be in a Gamergate comedy produced by BuzzFeed.  People were not happy.  They were not happy.  In fact, they were calling Ellen Page out for supporting a movie that seems to poke fun at Gamergate.  Now, I'm sure one probably doesn't have anything to do with the other.  But it's interesting that this was just a few weeks ago.  And earlier this year, they wanted her to replace Ellen DeGeneres.  They wanted Ellen Page to replace Ellen DeGeneres.  So let's see what the reaction is.  This is now Elliot Page verified as the Elliot Page, not Ellen Page.  Boring.  Says Twitter.  Piss off.  Oh, cool.  What?  We're dreaming?  He's so cool.  Well, Elliot, one thing I know is you're a wonderful actor.  Happy you found the words you need to define yourself.  Happy holidays.  Beautiful.  Cool.  Hell yeah.  Good for him.  I'm proud of you.  Oh, come on.  Give me an effing break.  No, you can't.  Wonderful actor and charming person.  Wishing Elliot all the best in his future.  That's nice.  I'm happy for him.  They already fixed his Wikipedia page.  That was quick.  I'm sure this was going on behind the scenes.  This is sad.  How is this sad?  You're a bigot if you think it's sad.  Yeah, so that is an interesting development, I guess.  I just thought I would talk about it because it's like all over the freaking place.  And so is MatPat.  I don't know what's going on with MatPat.  Do I want to know what's going on with MatPat?  So there we go.  There we go.  Ellen Page is no more.  It's now Elliot Page.  Yeah, so I'm going to wrap it up.  Please subscribe for more pop culture news, views, and rants, and we'll talk later. ",
