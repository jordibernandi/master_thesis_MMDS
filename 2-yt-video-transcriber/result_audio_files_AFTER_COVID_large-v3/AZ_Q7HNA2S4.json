You're in public, and you can say that.  If you don't, I'm going to f*** you up right now.  We're not deleting anything.  Delete the footage.  No.  Because I don't like that shit.  And that's why everyone hated on you when I was watching you.  Why would you?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, why would you?  Cool.  Why wouldn't you be honest with us and tell us who you were when we asked you?  Because people act like this because people are really rude and mean about my opinions.  It has nothing to do with that.  That's why I never brought an AK to school.  You know who I'm talking about.  I never brought any AK to school.  But maybe I will next time.  That's the craziest girl I've brought in front of school on the news.  These are the type of people out here in Miami.  These are your natural out here voters, your everyday voters.  Yeah, natural voters.  Us here.  Would you rather have a conversation rather than being nasty and threatening to beat me up?  I mean, that's kind of outrageous, isn't it?  It's not outrageous that you brought guns to school, girl.  You crazy for that.  I mean, why would you threaten to beat someone up if you think they have guns?  When I ask you who you are and then you take a video of me, you need to tell me who you are the first time around.  I didn't.  So why, like... Because people like you act like this.  You guys act like this.  No, girl, you're... Yeah, you do.  You act like this.  Hey, welcome to Miami.  Literally.  Girl, like... You're just out here trying to like... See, you guys don't even know anything about what I did.  You're claiming I have a different type of gun.  You're claiming you don't even know what I did.  What's the point of my picture and what I did?  Do you know the point?  No, I don't care about the goddamn point.  I'm just... Yeah, but you're going to out here insult me and threaten to beat me up over it.  That's insane.  I don't care about the goddamn point.  I asked you who you were the first time around.  You didn't tell us who you were because if we knew who you were, we would have never stopped by.  I would have left you to go about your business.  You know who I am now.  Why are you still around me?  Leave.  Because I don't want you to have this video.  on the internet.  It's gonna be on the internet.  You're in public.  If you have, if it's illegal, if it's if it's illegal, go get a cop and we'll.  we'll figure this out right now.  I encourage you guys, go get a cop, go get a law enforcement officer, go get security and then we'll see.  So, this girl right here is giving me free advertisement telling people who I am.  Hello, how are you?  Nice to meet you.  Happy New Year.  Okay, if you guys don't like me, then I would encourage you to leave me alone.  Just leave me alone.  That was rude.  What was rude?  You threatened to beat me up.  Because I asked you who the f*** you were and you didn't want to tell anybody.  So you want to beat people up for that?  Sure, yeah.  I think that's insane.  Okay, I think it's insane that you bring guns to school, girl.  Why did I do that?  Why do you need a gun at school for?  Why did I take my picture?  I don't give a f*** about what your reasons were.  Because it's my right to defend.  offend myself anywhere that i am like.  why do you like?  if i'm asking who you are and you want to take a youtube video of me why would you like not tell me who you like?  what was up with that?  because your behavior and match exactly how i thought you guys would be.  you just trying to beat me up away bro i would have walked away.  i would have never took.  i know.  you guys know who i am.  that's new.  okay All right, as you're shaking your ass in public.  That's very cool.  And we live in America.  Can we not do that?  Shake our ass in public?  Can I not have a firearm?  Okay, but you're, like, you're... Yeah, you can do it, but people are allowed to call your behavior disingenuous and degenerate.  No, because you're... You can eat on that attention, girl.  That's crazy.  Then walk away.  If you guys don't like me, then walk away.  If you don't like me, walk away.  I don't have... Okay, I don't know you personally, but I just don't f*** the fact that we asked you who you were and you didn't want to tell us.  Get over it.  You either get over it or you won't.  If you won't get over it, walk away.  No, I'm not apologizing because you threatened to beat me up.  Girl, I asked you who the fuck you are.  You result to violence immediately.  That's not okay.  That's not okay.  You result to violence.  When have I ever been violent?  You weren't violent, but you're, you know, with the guns and shit.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  That's incoherent.  She's giving me free advertisement.  The one with her boobs hanging all out, the really cool, you know, clad lady.  She's so trad and cool.  She's telling literally everybody she comes by, that's the girl that was on the news.  She likes to defend herself with firearms.  Okay, these are liberals.  Those are leftists.  So when I went up to them, they said, are you the girl that did X, Y, and Z?  And I said, no, I'm not.  And I got an interview from them.  And then they kept claiming things about me that weren't true, that I am a shooter, that I brought an AK-47 to school.  These people hate me so much.  They don't care why I did my graduation photo.  They don't care to know the facts about my graduation photo or even what firearm I had.  And they want to come out here, ridicule me, shake their ass like a .  but uh that's that's what we have in 2019. hopefully in 2020 we can curb this degenerate behavior from our society.  we don't need it.  if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to like and share hit that subscribe button and click the notification bell so you won't miss any of our videos.  if you want to support my work, you can become a patron at patreon.com slash caitlinbennett and receive cool perks like an autographed photo from me in the mail each month.
