            "text": "To be fair, some people likely have parents who genuinely do say horrible stuff.  I am not denying that this happens.  However, there are some lines that just shouldn't be crossed.  You can disagree with your parents, siblings, or whoever all you want on political and social issues, but this should be done in private.  If you really can't stomach living around them and in close proximity to their beliefs, then simply wait until you're old enough and can afford it and then move out.  Talking about familial disputes online can bring untold damage to your parents and family overall due to the fact that cancel culture has become so prominent and hostile.  As we've witnessed countless times, there are severe consequences to being the target of an online mob.  Personally, whenever I see these videos of young people exposing their parents online, I'm really not that surprised.  Young people, particularly teenagers, they often go through a rebellious phase.  What I find to be way more disturbing is the fact that so many people uphold these public denunciations as a positive thing, something to celebrate and revel in.  This trend of teenagers publicly denouncing their parents is actually more common than you might think.  There have been thousands of young people shaming. ",
