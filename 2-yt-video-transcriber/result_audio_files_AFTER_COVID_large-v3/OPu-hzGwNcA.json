            "text": "For the first time in our memory, many Americans are asking, does history still have a place for America?  Tonight, let us say that America is still united, still strong, still compassionate, still willing to stand by those who are victims of police states.  I believe we can fight corruption while we work to bring into our government women and men of competence and high integrity.  You will be making a choice between different visions of the future.  Are you more confident that our economy will create productive work for our society?  Are you pleased with the ability of the elderly to live their remaining years in happiness?  of our youngsters to take pride in the world we have built for them.  Let us resolve tonight that young Americans will say of our generation that we did keep faith with our God, that we did act worthy of ourselves, that we did protect and pass on lovingly that shining city on a hill.
