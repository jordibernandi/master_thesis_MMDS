            "text": "An estimated 2 million children are trafficked for sex around the world.  Since being founded just seven years ago, OUR has made a significant impact in the fight to end sex trafficking and sexual exploitation by rescuing and supporting thousands of survivors in 26 countries and 28 U.S.  states.  Join us on Giving Tuesday, December 1st, for a global movement of generosity.  Every year on this day, OUR works closely with survivors to inspire others to join the fight to end human trafficking.  This year, we have compiled artwork, poems, and stories from many of our survivors from around the world into a book called Not For Sale.  Help us magnify their voices and stories.  Donate $39 or more today and receive a not-for-sale book.  This book will be available for 24 hours only.  With you, we can shine a light on the dark issue of human trafficking and exploitation. ",
