We're meant to be much more than this And find a home which we all miss.  So it's time to grow up As we're ticking down the clock Forever.  keep in mind We're fighting for our kind To learn from those before Our future made secure.  We were meant to survive To transcend, go forth and thrive Find the light, leave behind All the things that made us blind.  It's up to us to show the way To hold the torch, up come what may We will do all we can Till time's not running through our hands Forever.  keep in mind We're fighting for our kind To learn from those before Our future made secure.  All is well.  you. ",
