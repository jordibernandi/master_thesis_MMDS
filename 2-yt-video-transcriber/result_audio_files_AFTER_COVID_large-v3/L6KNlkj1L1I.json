            "text": "The Bible has made it plain that we have an enemy who has nothing good planned for us.  The devil is not going to be kind to us.  He's not going to do good to us.  He's a thief.  Jesus Christ makes this known to us.  Thieves do not have good intentions for their victims.  Satan's ultimate plan is to steal our souls.  But if he can steal our joys, our hope, our peace, he will.  We are also told that his motive is to kill, steal, and destroy.  He has many ways to get to these, but that is his endgame.  God has given us prayer and his word as two very important tools.  When we go to God, we must do so boldly.  We are his children, and we do not need to be shy or timid as we approach our Father.  God is willing to hear and act on our prayers.  God honors his word and declares that all his promises are yes and amen.  As we approach him to cancel the evil plans that the enemy has toward us, let us pray the following with full assurance that he hears and that he will respond.  If you can pray this prayer every day.  Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, I thank you that I am your child.  The Word declares that you have given the right to become a child of God to all those who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.  I am grateful for this assurance.  I belong to you, and as your child, I am under your protection.  Thank you for making me aware of the plans of the enemy.  You told me that he comes only to kill, steal, and destroy.  Because I know these schemes and plans of the enemy, I can stand firm against him in the name of Jesus Christ.  Father, I thank you that you did not leave me ignorant and as such vulnerable to his schemes.  I declare and decree that the plans and the purposes of God shall prevail in my life.  I declare and decree that the plans of the devil shall fail and not prosper.  As you have made known the schemes and tricks of the enemy, you have also given your word as a weapon against him.  Your word is mighty, for the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.  It penetrates even to dividing soul, spirit, joints, and marrow.  It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.  Thank you for your word.  I pray your word in the name of Jesus as protection over me.  I use your word to cancel the plans of the enemy.  I clothe myself in the armor of God so that I will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  Your armor gives me the strength to combat all that Satan sends to harm me.  Father, when I am hard pressed on every side, I pray for you to be my hiding place.  Be my refuge and shelter me from the wickedness that Satan is plotting against me.  Lord, when troubles set upon me, I pray that you will preserve me from trouble.  Surround me like the mountains around Jerusalem.  Lord God, be my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  Father, I pray that when Satan comes to kill, you will give me life.  Your word declares that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  So give me your life when death pursues me.  I pray your word over me that declare that I shall not die, but live and declare the works of the Lord in Jesus name.  Alleluia.  I stand now in the name of Jesus and declare that there shall be no more demonic attacks, no more demonic lack, distress, disease, depression or drama in Jesus' name.  Lord, any plan plotted against me by humans or devils, I reject under the authority of the name of Jesus.  Any negative words said against me or my family, I reject under the authority of the name of Jesus.  I shatter all generational curses and generational spirits.  They all end now.  Poverty and lack will not be in my house.  In Jesus' name.  Lord, you have declared that you will restore the years that the locust, the canker worm, and the caterpillar, and the pomba worm have eaten.  Nothing stolen will be lacking in my life.  I cancel the thieves plans against me.  You have given me everything I need for life and godliness and the devil has no right to these things.  Thank you for your power to restore in Jesus name.  When the enemy comes to destroy, I stand on your word that states we are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed, perplexed, but not in despair, persecuted, but not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed.  You will not allow the devil to have charge over me.  Your spirit gives me the victory over all that Satan will bring my way.  I am victorious.  I am a victor.  I am a conqueror in the matchless name of Jesus.  We command that the powers of the enemy be broken off in our lives.  Be broken off of our marriages.  Be broken off of our home.  Be broken off of our mind.  Be broken off of our wallets.  I cancel every feeling or thought of fear in Jesus name.  You have not given me a spirit of fear, but you have given me a spirit of power, of power, of power, of power, love and a sound mind.  Because you are my helper, I will not fear what the enemy can do to me.  I will not fear what he can do to my body because my soul is safe with you.  Lord, I declare that I am strong in you.  You will never leave nor forsake me.  You are my strength.  I am not afraid because you cannot fail.  And with you, I cannot fail.  My loved ones cannot fail.  My children cannot fail.  I thank you, Lord, that no weapon that is formed against me or my family shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against me in judgment.  you have given me the authority to condemn.  I stand in this heritage because I am a servant of the Lord, and my righteousness is of you, Lord.  Heavenly Father, I declare that I can do all things through you.  I am more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus.  Nothing shall separate me from the love of God in Jesus Christ.  Nothing.  And I mean nothing will separate me from your love.  When distress comes, it will not separate me from your love.  When persecution comes, it will not separate me from your love.  When famine or nakedness or peril or sword comes, they will not separate me from your love in Christ Jesus.  Nothing shall separate me in Jesus' name.  I pray the verses of Psalm 91 over me and my family as I cancel all that Satan would try to send against us.  Most High God, please help me to dwell in your shelter and abide in your shadow.  God, help me to take refuge in you.  Deliver me from the snare of the enemy and any evil he sends against me.  Cover me, Lord.  Hide me in your wings.  You are faithful, O Lord.  I will not fear the terror by night nor any evil by day.  I will not fear pestilence of the dark nor destruction by night.  A thousand may fall at my side and ten thousand at my right, but it will not come near me.  I repeat.  A thousand may fall at my side and ten thousand at my right, but it will not come near me.  Lord, as I cancel all that the enemy has planned for me, I trust all that you have in store for me.  You have declared that your plans are to prosper me and not to harm me.  You plan to give me hope and a future.  I stand on your plans in the name of Jesus Christ.  Reveal to me, O Lord, any openings for the devil in my life, so that I may close them through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Amen. ",

            "text": "Now I just want to read these verses over your life.  Let each of the promises in these verses be true in your life.  Isaiah 41.10 Fear not, for I am with thee.  Be not dismayed, for I am your God.  I will strengthen thee.  I will help you.  I will uphold thee with the hand of my righteousness.  Thessalonians 3.3.  But the Lord is faithful.  He shall establish you and keep you from the evil one.  What a wonderful verse.  God is going to keep you from the evil one.  He who dwells in the shelter of the highest shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  I will say unto the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.  My God in Him will I trust.  Surely He will deliver you from the fowler and the deadly pestilence.  He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge.  His faithfulness is a shield and buckler.  Psalm 91, 1-4. ",
