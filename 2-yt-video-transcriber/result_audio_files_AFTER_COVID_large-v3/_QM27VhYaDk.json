            "text": "We have a lot to pray about.  We still have an election that seems to be in process and change in our nation.  And we certainly want to add our voice in prayer because prayer does change things.  We are seeing change.  Great things have happened, but we are believing that more is yet to come.  And I want to describe a prophetic word to you today, and then we're going to decree into it.  And I also want to start with the prayer of Daniel for his nation, because I believe within that it will speak to us concerning our nation tonight.  Daniel prays this.  This is in Daniel chapter 9.  And it begins in verse 17.  One of the wisest, most powerful prayers that we have in all of scripture.  Daniel prays, so listen God to this determined prayer of your servant.  Have mercy on your ruined sanctuary.  Act out of who you are, not out of who we are.  We are making our appeal to God.  Turn your ears our way.  Listen, open your eyes and take a long look at our ruined cities.  We have a lot of turmoil that is happening in our cities.  We know that we don't deserve a hearing from you.  Our appeal is to your compassion.  This prayer is our last and only hope.  Master, listen to us.  Master, forgive us.  Master, look at us and do something.  Master, don't put us off.  Your people are named after you.  You have a stake in us.  I'm glad that we can declare that.  God has a stake in us. ",
