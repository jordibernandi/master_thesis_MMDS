            "text": "You stay right there because I'm about to send the police over there to get you escorted out of there.  You understand that?  Why?  The United States Post Office in Tallahassee, Florida with Rogue Nation.  My eye on you, Dutchman and Ford Dirt Farmer.  You're going to go in here and find out if they respect our right to record.  And if not, hopefully we'll calmly educate them.  Hopefully they'll be receptive.  Is there another entrance there?  No.  No?  Okay.  Lady next to me?  On the first.  Yes, ma'am.  Just act like we're not here.  Just act like we're not here.  No, you don't.  I promise I'll tell you when we're done.  How's that sound, sir?  To be fair?  Okay.  You're not calling to get us put in a cage, are you?  Don't call the police, sir.  He's calling the police.  That's how his screen is red.  He called 911.  Wow.  We're not barbecuing in a public park or anything, sir.  With charcoal.  We're keeping our social distance.  Except for Dutchman.  I didn't know if there was something wrong I could help you with.  I didn't know... I'll get back in my corner here.  Language, young lady.  Language.  Hi.  Hello.  Can you help me, please?  Yes, I can help you.  I'd like a one cent, a two cent, and a three cent stamp, please, Cynthia.  It's one of each.  Actually, let me get two of each.  I'm sorry, four of each.  There we go.  I'm really terrible at mathematics.  That should come out to 24 seconds.  So four ones, four twos, and four threes, right?  That's correct.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Good, good.  What's your last name, Cynthia?  Oh, we don't give out last names.  Yeah, you do.  Richburg.  Yeah, when you're a government, well, postal employee, you're supposed to, it's in your policies.  That's why we asked.  We got ones, twos, and threes.  We're going to get a record of that call.  You better not be making a false police report, sir.  Cynthia, did you get the memo that we're allowed to do this?  Oh, there was a memo sent out after, I think it was 2010, 2008 and then 2010 again.  Anything else today?  No, that's it.  Four cents?  Yes.  And it pretty much says, you know, not to engage unless we're conducting business.  Yeah.  And if you're curious, you don't have to do it now, but after we leave, you can go around the corner there, and there's a poster 7 on the wall, and you'll see where it says that we're allowed to do this for news purposes.  Well, who are you with?  We the people.  I'm an independent journalist, and we're with Bolt Action News Group.  Okay, you can look it up.  How would you like your receipt?  Print only?  Yes, print only, please.  Okay.  Thank you.  Do you need an envelope, please?  No, no, I'll just put them in my pocket.  Thanks for your professionalism, Cynthia.  You showed people how it's done.  That's what we were waiting for.  We don't want an altercation.  We don't want him to call the police for no reason.  People do that too much today.  And then we get thrown in a cell.  We get thrown in a cage.  Why?  Because I wanted to buy some stamps and make sure that you guys are treating everybody right?  That's great, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You have a beak.  That's my favorite, the bird.  Go to YouTube.  Seriously.  Go on YouTube.  You can cut the passive aggression with a knife.  What's the point of having a civilization if no one's interested in being civil?  He called the cops on us.  He's calling them again.  You're not calling the police?  Citizen journalist.  You got the memo then.  Good, good.  Perfectly legal.  Thank you.  You guys just passed.  Thank you.  I'll tell you when we're done.  We're done now.  I'm done at least.  Yeah, you just passed because you told us they said it's okay, so I'll tell you.  This is called the First Amendment audit, sir.  Correct.  We're making sure that you respect the First Amendment of the United States, the first law.  Like your hat.  Excuse me.  Hey, Paul.  Yes, sir.  I can hear you.  We are the people of the United States and we're exercising our freedom of the press, sir.  Why?  It stopped recording.  It's 10 minutes.  I didn't get any of that.  You got it all right.  Here we go.  Come on through, sir.  Read that part right there for me, please.  Voyage, lobbies, devil dog.  Semper Fi, Levenick.  Semper Fi.  So since we have not committed a crime, don't call the feelings police.  Well, no, I have to do what I'm told.  Okay, okay.  I already did.  I didn't, you know.  We just came from the police station, sir.  Okay.  Well, this little poster sign says, with the permission of the postmaster.  Correct.  And we have the permission of the postmaster.  But the postal inspector... No, it says local postmaster.  Yeah, you have his card in your pocket, don't you?  Let me explain it a little bit better for you.  Yeah.  Ma'am, I was eavesdropping.  It would defeat the purpose of an audit if we announced what we were doing up front, okay?  Wrap your head around that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Who were you with, counsel?  Huh?  Who were you with when you were in?  I was with 4th and 5th.  Oh, wow.  That was excellent, counsel.  That's how it's done.  You're going to look like a star.  Make him be proud.  I was with 3rd Mar Div.  Lima Battery 312.  0811.  Field Artillery.  Thank you.  Take care, counsel.  You too.  Stay safe.  Police?  Yep.  So we're not going to be able to see a game today here, folks.  Oh, thank you so much.  I thought we were going out of the side door.  Thank you very much.  I like your hat.  I was going to tell you that in there.  All right.  They get a C+.  Are you Tallahassee Police?  Yes, sir.  All right.  You were called here for a suspicious person?  Yes, sir.  What are you doing?  Well, I was asking some questions.  What's your name and badge number?  My name's Officer Alt.  And what's your badge number, sir?  734.  And yours?  662.  662.  That's why we're here.  That's a penguin or something, right?  That's a bird or something, right?  I appreciate it.  Did you order that?  Thank you, counsel.  You guys are dismissed.  Excuse me.  Yes, ma'am.  RZ masks.  RZ masks.  RZ masks.  Okay.  Hey, can I get your incident number for this, please?  No.  Call the department.  You can get it.  So you're denying me my statutory right, huh?  Yeah, the record is readily available.  You have that number right in your car right now.  Why are you doing this, man?  You saw we went in there to educate and we did.  Now you're going to come over here and ruin the whole show with tyranny?  So you're going to refuse the incident number, huh?  Officer?  Officer?  You got any hand sanitizer in your car?  Can I get some of that?  No?  How about you, sir?  You gonna be cooler about it?  Nah, I don't got any on me.  I used mine all up.  Did you?  Yeah.  I don't believe you.  That's alright.  You guys are gonna look dumb for YouTube instead of good.  I'm a fair person, just like they just showed you.  Honor your oath.  1013175.  No hand sanitizer, huh?  That's the first time someone's failed on that.  You're the first cop that's ever denied that.  Congrats.  I think I can get down from this.  Alright. ",
