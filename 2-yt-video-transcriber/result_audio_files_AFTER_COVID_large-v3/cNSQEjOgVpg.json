            "text": "Time for an ammo update.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premier source for Second Amendment news.  If it's Second Amendment news you're after, you have found your home here on Guns and Gadgets, so please consider subscribing and joining this growing freedom family.  Now I get a lot of questions, as you might imagine, and I'm sure every other gun channel does as well.  Where's all the ammo?  When do you think it'll get back to normal?  And you even see people commenting on different types of posts saying people stop paying this price because if you don't, then the market will never come back down to normal.  Well, with... a potential Joe Biden presidency, you're not going to see a normal again is my prediction, at least for four to eight years.  But we do have one update that kind of gives us an idea of what to look forward to and what's going on with the ammo.  So I actually just saw an article on Fox Business that said Vista Outdoors is behind by one year on orders for ammunition and over a billion dollars in orders.  and it's gonna take them a long time to catch up.  So Vista was reporting their quarterly earnings for the second quarter and the CEO, whose name is Chris Metz, he detailed and announced what he said was an unprecedented backlog for Vista Outdoors.  Guys and gals, they're gonna make all those orders right before they have any excess going to the market.  And they're not the only ones.  I'll give you some quotes from Chris Metz here.  He said, we currently have a year's worth of back orders for ammunition in excess of $1 billion with a demand for outstripping supply and inventory levels in the channel at all time lows.  We see strong demand continuing and this metric informs our viewpoint of what a recovery or normalization could look like.  Now Vista, if you remember, they are the successful bidders for Remington arms accessories and ammunition business.  they spent eighty one point four million dollars to acquire that and That is not enough to make a single dent in the ammunition backlog even for this one company.  so basically the future is bleak as far as ammunition supply and ammunition costs, unfortunately.  You might remember I've reported on other companies that were reporting huge backlogs as well.  Some were purchasing millions of dollars in new equipment, and I have heard back from companies based off of those videos that they're running 24 hours a day, had extra people working the shifts, but the demand has been astronomical.  It's never been seen like this before for a myriad of reasons.  We have the presidential election year, which always causes an issue with ammunition.  Last time, four years ago, you remember you couldn't find .22 caliber anywhere.  Now you couple things like the COVID-19 issue, the civil unrest issue, the millions and millions of people who have decided to join the Second Amendment community in Valuing their rights over the propaganda they've heard for decades.  So that that's a lot.  I mean that is a lot of people buying ammunition.  Yes, you can still look out and find it places here or there, but I'm not like many people I just right now.  I just can't seem to purchase a little item that used to cost 17 cents and is now going for a dollar or more.  I just can't do it.  But I'm lucky that I have some magazines full.  But I don't think we're gonna see anything change for quite a while, folks.  Just wanted to get that information out there for everybody because I get a lot of questions every day about what do I see happening in the ammunition area?  Will it ever get back to normal?  A couple months ago the target was like springtime next year.  I doubt that's happening now.  Especially with the election results as they are at the moment.  It's going to be a long time if we ever see those prices and that availability again.  It's going to be a while.  But figured I'd just put that out there.  If you could all do me a favor and pass that along, I would greatly appreciate it because no matter where you're watching this, they don't want that information out.  Trust me.  So please thumbs up the video to crush the YouTube algorithm.  Leave a comment down below to help that as well.  And until we see each other again, be safe, stay vigilant, carry your weapon, and I will see you on the next one.  Take care, everybody. ",
