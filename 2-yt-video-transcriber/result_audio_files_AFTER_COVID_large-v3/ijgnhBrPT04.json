Hello, Brave Awakened Ones, QV here.  What's up?  We have the victory.  Something I need to share with you guys.  I kept getting... to tell me to make sure I listened to the Queen of England's speech.  She gave a speech, which is an impromptu speech that was announced.  And I kept being told to keep an eye on it because she's going to send a message.  And I was just taking care of business on the computer right now, right?  It's morning time.  And again, I was told, you didn't watch the speech that just aired, right?  So I went to watch the speech, and needless to say, I'm still shaking, okay?  I'm literally still shaking.  My teeth are chattering.  My entire body's reacting to what she said.  And I'm going to show you why.  And please, you guys on Twitter, My Twitter handle is savinggenz.  Please share this.  I don't know.  You tell me what you think after seeing this.  I'm gonna play this portion, then we're gonna get into this, okay?  Here we are in the royal family Twitter.  And I'm gonna play with the, is she the mum?  Or the one that died is the mum, whatever.  Get ready for this. ",

            "text": "Over my dead body.  Sorry.  I can't even.  I'm shaking uncontrollably.  Okay, so let's go to this quick little thing.  What happened?  World War II, 1940, right?  Let's go over here.  Let's do some background.  Okay, with the reaming of US forces, the Great Depression was finally beginning to ease.  The Americans were earning more and buying more.  What does that sound like?  What we had been going through.  More, so being able to buy goods and further fueling for the economy.  But outside of America, things were not good.  as Germany invaded France, which meant between Germany and Italy, most of Western Europe was controlled by them except for England.  What I'm taking is that The alliance has taken over, the White Hats have taken over most of Europe, except for England.  Okay, that's what I'm taking from that.  Now let's go down to the UK.  and what else they did besides evacuating children.  We're gonna get further into that.  What else did they do?  At the beginning of World War II, which was 1940, Great Britain begins to ration food.  So this goes into the food rationing.  So keep an eye out for that.  I feel that's their plan.  They're going to start saying, oh, for the safety of the children, give up your children for their safety so they won't get sick.  And we're going to start rationing food.  Okay?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me because I don't trust this damn lizard queen.  I trust nothing that comes out of her.  All right.  Especially with the prime minister who is supposed to be in the hospital right now because he said he was diagnosed with COVID.  or is he being held in safety?  I don't know.  Let's see what happens because Trump did not would not go into it.  He did not talk.  About it, really.  Okay, the evacuation scheme of 1939, 1939 to 1940.  Here we go.  Look at all these kids.  Parents willingly walking their kids to slaughter.  Leave this to us, Sonny.  You ought to be out of London.  This was the propaganda being sent around.  This was the propaganda being sent around.  This is an advertising.  Literally, this was the advertising being sent around.  Look at all these children being evacuees.  Okay?  The evacuation of civilians in Britain during the Second World War was designed to protect people, especially children, from the risk associated with aerial bombing of cities by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk.  Operation Pied Piper.  We're gonna get into that.  Operation Pied Piper, which began on the first September 1939, officially relocated more than 3.5 million people, the majority being children.  There were further waves of official evacuations and re-evacuations from the South and East Coast in June 1940.  June 1940, okay?  See the seaborne invasion was expected and from affected cities of the Blitz began after the, I'm sorry, and from affected cities after the Blitz began in September 1940.  There were official evacuations from the UK and other parts of the British Empire.  The government evacuation scheme was developed during September, I'm sorry, I'm still shaking.  The government evacuation scheme was developed during summer 1938. by the Anderson Committee and implemented by the Ministry of Health.  Okay.  Now, this is actually a real picture from then.  Does it look familiar?  Does it look familiar?  Children appear from bomb shelter.  Why are the kids away from their parents down in a bomb shelter?  Anyone else find this disturbing but me?  And this is a train porter escorting the children.  And again, a lot of these children's never, these kids never made it back home.  And it was called a scheme.  Listen again to what she said, okay?

Child welfare system could weaken further blah, blah, blah, okay.  Because I know I read an EMS worker, she's currently fighting to get her kid back.  She's fighting to get her kid back.  They're taking them away from at-risk people.  CPS, Child Protective Services.  We all know it's the complete opposite of what they really are.  That's what they do.  All their freaking stinking organizations, their not-for-profits, all of these institutions, it's the complete opposite.  All right?  So this is going on in different states.  You guys could look it up and read it yourself.  All right, that they're actually taking children away.  CPS is taking children away from their parents because they're saying they're high risk, so therefore they're taking them away.  And we all know what happens in the foster system.  These kids get disappeared and they get trafficked.  All right, and again, I canceled kids who went through that.  And even ritual abuse, who were trafficked, prostituted out, okay?  I canceled these kids.  So, I have firsthand experience as to what really goes on when it comes to child protective services, okay?  So, I wanted to drop that there, okay?  And there's something else that, was pretty cool that I saw.  Let me share this with you guys.  I'm literally having problems catching my breath from what I just saw.  that Trump posted, what is this?  Oh, that's Junior.  Here we go, POTUS himself.  Okay.  44 minutes ago, he posted this, this morning.  Light at the end of the tunnel.  It's 7.55 this morning.  I just found that very interesting because it also goes with, and I shared it on my community page.  There was a Q post that had the numbers 1010.  You guys, it's in my community page.  You guys could go look at it.  All right.  Light at the end of the tunnel.  So, yeah, I just, I wanted to share that.  And here he is.  Wishing Prime Minister how very interesting Boris Johnson is speedy recovery.  that he's posting this right now.  How very interesting.  All right, I just wanted to share that link in the description below.  What do you guys think?  Makes me very uncomfortable to say the very least.  I'm extremely uncomfortable.  And the fact that I was constantly being reminded to watch that speech, that there's a message in there that, yeah, makes me even more uncomfortable.  All right, so, yeah.  I don't have anything else to say.  QV out.  Like Trump says, like POTUS says, light at the end of the tunnel.  Let's pray.  Let's pray, pray, pray that this is finally, things are coming to light today.  Alright, bye. ",
