            "text": "Welcome to the Shigama Live Show with your host Shigama.  It is Saturday.  Today is my big day, but I'm still sick, so I know I don't want to go to the doctor and get tested to see if I have the pandemic, but YouTube sent me a check for $200 as my monthly paycheck without any explanation, and all of their people are out of the office, so nobody can explain what's going on.  They simply have a thing that says that they're not in the office, and So I'm $500 down.  So if just five of you, no, 10 of you donate $50, or 25 of you donate $20, or 50 of you donate $10, I'd be okay.  I'll leave the links to how to donate to the channel in the information box and the description.  I think I have a doozy.  This is good research, and I believe it's going to settle some history and some myths and some conspiracies that have been just hiding in plain sight.  What you don't know is that there are people who are dedicating their lives to making sure that this information does not get out.  Why it's so important to them, I don't know.  I have no idea.  I don't know why.  I can guess why, but is it so important to hide history?  Now, a lot of you all have asked me to do historical things, and here we are.  I have the most quintessential historical secret in the United States.  Abraham Lincoln was the first black president.  Now, I'm going to give you my opinion and the historical facts.  Some people believe this, but I don't.  Oh, it's not that I don't believe Lincoln wasn't black.  He was definitively black, but I know he wasn't the first black president.  But, I'll leave that up for another video or for you to discover or if you want me to do an entire video on who the first black president was.  It's a pretty strange tale.  I'll do that if you leave a comment and say that's what you want to see.  Now, Lincoln was definitely black.  or like Barack Obama and six other U.S.  presidents, Lincoln was a mixture that included black.  Now, Notice I didn't say biracial.  Biracial is a term that black and white people have come up with to deny the accepted term black.  Because the general public doesn't accept anyone mixed with black to be anything other than black.  Obama is considered black, although his mother was fully white.  And here's a controversy worse than biracial people.  Biracial usually means black plus some other form of Caucasian, if you take the strict definition to mean all other groups that are not black, meaning there's black and then there's not, or the rest of the world, right?  Outside of the continent that we named Africa, which is a white man's name, has nothing to do with the actual people that live on that continent.  Bi means two.  Now, what if I introduced to you a new term that is older than dirt?  Melangean.  Here's the problem.  There is a group that is dedicated to expunging and eradicating all concepts of Melangean.  On one side of the debate are the Society of the Observation of Melangeans as an entirely new racial group.  And then there are the anti-Melangeans.  I'm pretty sure you didn't know that this even existed.  Now, the anti-melangeans have been very successful in expunging the entire notion that the word even exists.  How many of you even know the word existed before I even told it to you?  Elvis Presley was a melangean.  He's a very famous racist, but when you expose that he was a melangean, it puts an embarrassing perspective to him.  For some reason, humans don't like melangeans.  because they also tend to create the best humans.  So, for strict definition, a Malingian is a person born with three distinct racial groups, if you believe the whole Caucasian, Africanoid, Mongoloid, and then whatever Native American is considered.  Native or Pacific Islander, whatever you consider that, or whatever that racial group is considered.  So for strict definition, a Malingian is a person with three distinct racial groups, always including black.  So Lincoln was black.  plus white, plus some other Native American.  I want to say Cherokee, but I'm not definite on that.  And supposedly Cherokee is a made-up thing, and that's not what they actually used to call themselves.  They may call themselves Cherokee today, but that's not what they used to call themselves.  That's not what they were originally called.  Fun fact there.  If you want me to look into that, leave a comment below.  When you then discover that Lincoln was Jewish white, Then you realize a whole bunch of things and why his life was the way it was.  The denial that he was Jewish was so strong.  And then on top of that, the claim that he was Malingian didn't stand a chance.  This need for all U.S.  presidents to be considered white was so strong, it's still so strong.  I mean, to this day, they're not going to go back and say, oh, by the way, all the U.S.  presidents were not all white.  that some of the president's relatives were hidden or even assassinated to make sure no one found out.  That's as recent as the 1950s, I want to say.  The medical team, seeking historical proof that Lincoln had several diseases, who were given the green light to go extract the DNA from his presidential library, were denied at the very last minute when the Genealogy Society was invited along with them to participate in the DNA study.  For the record, Jewish scholars not only claim Lincoln is Jewish, but also point out his features as being stereotypically Sephardic Jewish.  Now, why does no one talk about Melungeons anymore?  Biracial is still around.  The reason is, once you start realizing that Melungeons exist, people who are considered white start to disappear.  And the idea that black people have contributed nothing to society falls apart.  Now, the whole idea that black people have contributed nothing to society, while of course an obvious lie, the thing is, it's one thing to deny if fully black men didn't invent 90% of the common things that we use today in our homes.  But it is a whole nother ballgame when you start believing in the existence of Malingians and not calling them white people.  And seeing that... ",
