            "text": "My daughter got an interesting letter in the mail the other day.  It's from some kid we'll call Vanessa.  I asked her if it was okay for me to share it and she said sure, so let's give it a read.  It says, Hi Kylie, my name is Vanessa.  I know your grandmother, Jennifer, and met when you went to visit her.  Also wanted to say hi, and wondered if we could be pen pals.  Well, this is starting off nice, right?  If you've been following my channel for a while, you'll know my mom is a Jehovah's Witness, and that's made our relationship kind of rocky, to say the least.  Let me put it all on the table.  I think the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses is a destructive cult that does nothing but ruin people's lives.  and I've made a career out of talking about exactly why it's harmful and how to identify other harmful groups.  One might say I'm one of the most well-known apostates in the US.  The letter makes it clear that little Vanessa is a Jehovah's Witness and wants Kylie to be one too.  So needless to say, Vanessa picked the wrong kid as a pen pal.  We're gonna read the rest of the letter and then we'll take a look at a clip from a Jehovah's Witnesses convention.  Let's get into it.  Okay, now let's read the rest of the letter.  It says, My name is Vanessa.  I know your grandmother, Jenny, and I also want to say hi.  And I wondered if we could be pen pals.  Maybe you can write me your favorite thing about Jehovah.  Mine is that he created life and is going to make a paradise on earth.  Pen pals, signed, Vanessa.  Okay, interesting.  So what's the big deal with this letter?  Well, Jehovah's Witnesses have gone out of their way to claim that they don't force children to adopt their faith.  That's a pretty strange letter to receive from an 8 or 9 year old kid if they aren't cramming the religion down their throats.  So let's read Jehovah's Witnesses' short article on it.  This article is entitled, Do Jehovah's Witnesses Force Their Children to Adopt Their Faith?  They had somebody read it on their website, so let's listen. ",

But they won't be punished by the religion for not shunning the kid.  They'll just be frowned upon.  They'll be pushed out of the community.  The only group of people they know.  They'll be considered bad association because they have friends that are outsiders.  That's not really allowed within the religion.  But technically, the religion won't crack down on them for doing it.  Just the people within the congregation.  That's the main difference.  Now, if the kid gets baptized at, say, eight years old, and then decides the religion isn't for them a few years later, the family is instructed by the leadership to abandon them.  don't have anything to do with them.  They're mentally diseased and controlled by Satan.  And if you don't follow their very strict rules about it, then you risk being kicked out and shunned by your friends and family.  My brother got disfellowshipped when I was about 10, and I didn't talk to him again until I was 16.  Let's watch this clip from a Jehovah's Witness convention about shunning family members. ",

            "text": "First of all, what specific fear has at times challenged you in your service to Jehovah?  Well, a specific fear deals with one of my sisters who is a scholarship, and she had contacted me before my baptism and was encouraging me to keep in contact with her.  And even though I do miss her and love her, I know that if I didn't maintain contact with her, it would be difficult to stop communicating with her if I started.  Okay, well, thank you for sharing that.  Now, Melody, how has Jehovah helped you overcome that fear?  Well, Jehovah has helped me cope in many ways.  He gave me the courage to stand up to her and tell her that I couldn't communicate with her at all because I didn't want to ruin my relationship with Jehovah.  And he also helped me with so much sorrow and loneliness in missing her.  So, growing my relationship with Jehovah through prayer and studying has really helped with this and all my fears.  Okay, well, thank you for sharing that, Melody.  So what was all that about not forcing families apart if they make the wrong decision, quote-unquote?  This isn't even just about backing away and being cautious.  This isn't about avoiding conversations about the religion.  This 10-year-old's kid has been convinced by the people around her that her sister is evil and sick, and opening the door by talking to her even one time puts her eternal life in jeopardy.  That's wrong.  There's no way around it.  There's nothing good about how this religion operates.  And I think it's pretty obvious that their website post about not forcing kids to adhere to the religion is an attempt to direct people away from this subject at best.  Now, after listening to that clip, let's listen to the article again. ",

            "text": "This doesn't sound as neutral as they wanted it to in the beginning.  I've talked about propaganda before, but this is a pretty clear example of it.  Propaganda and logical fallacies go hand in hand.  In most cases, there's a propaganda technique to go along with each logical fallacy.  There's the poisoning the well logical fallacy, and there's the poisoning the well propaganda technique.  There's the appeal to emotion fallacy and the appeal to emotion propaganda technique.  They don't always go hand in hand.  There are some propaganda techniques that aren't directly tied to fallacies, like firehosing propaganda.  Spread a bunch of misinformation around, as much as you can, through as many channels as possible.  Twitter, sympathetic news networks, Facebook, whatever.  Most of it isn't going to stick for the people who hear it, but a percentage of it will stick.  Or the propaganda technique called the big lie.  Make up some big elaborate story with a bunch of detail.  People are more likely to believe it if it has details.  In this case, Jehovah's Witnesses are using a propaganda technique where they start out at a neutral position and seem to quell concerns that they're forcing kids to join their religion.  They say they never do that.  It's against their religion.  People have to make decisions for themselves.  And as you go deeper in the article, they start to back off that position more and more.  So the reader starts out sympathetic to their religion because they're denouncing something most people can agree is bad, which opens the reader up to be more trusting.  And as you move through the article, they use the trust you have for them from the first couple of paragraphs to move you over on the issue.  They are disturbingly good at using propaganda, and have been for a long time.  But being able to recognize it is a step in the right direction.  Once you see exactly what they're doing, it takes everything you have to keep from vomiting every time you see it.  To get back to little Vanessa and the letter she wrote to the daughter of one of the most recognizable apostates in the United States, I told Kylie she should write back to tell her she doesn't believe in that garbage.  She opened the door.  She invited Kylie's opinion into her life.  Writing a letter to somebody who might or might not be sympathetic to the religion was a risk.  In this case, the risk didn't pay off.  But Kylie's heart is too soft for it.  She says she isn't going to write back.  To each their own, I guess.  I hope Vanessa finds her way out one day.  Anyways, that's all I've got for you.  If you like what I do and you want to see me continue to do it, you can support me in a few ways.  First, there's Patreon.  That's probably the best way.  But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check me out on Teespring, or you can check me out on Etsy.  I have a store where I sell all kinds of interesting stuff.  Mostly it's 3D printed game stands.  But I also sell these 2020 dumpster fire candle holders.  Or just regular dumpster fire candle holders.  And I sell these signs.  If you want to keep Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons from knocking on your door, put these out front.  Jehovah's Witnesses aren't afraid of anything, except apostates.  And you don't have to be an ex-Jehovah's Witness to be an apostate.  The term applies to anybody critical of the religion.  So if you want to keep them away, then consider getting one of these signs.  All links can be found in the description and the pinned comment.  Okay, thanks for watching, guys. ",
