One source says that the key point to understand is that this Smartmatic system has a backdoor that allows it to be or that allows the votes to be mirrored and monitored, allowing an intervening party a real time understanding of how many votes will be needed to gain an electoral advantage.  Are you saying the states that use that software did that? ",

In every one of those states, though, we have more than enough illegal ballots already documented to overturn the result in that state.  Because not only did they use a Venezuelan company to count our ballots, which almost should be illegal per se.  Number two, they didn't allow Republicans in key places to observe the mail vote.  That makes the mail vote completely invalid.  Now, they didn't do it everywhere.  They did it in big cities where they have corrupt machines that will protect them, meaning in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Detroit.  They didn't have to do it in Chicago and New York or Boston.  They could have.  They have corrupt machines there.  They did it absolutely in Phoenix, Arizona.  They did it absolutely in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Republicans were shut out from enough of the count so they could accomplish what Smartmatic wanted to do.  And that pattern that you have there, we have evidence that that's the same pattern Smartmatic used in other elections in which they were disqualified.  In other words, this is their pattern of activity.  And yes, there is a backdoor.  And we actually have proof of some of the connections to it.  Right now, our cases are the most developed in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.  But we already have enough affidavits from people who were pushed out of being able to observe.  So in each one of the states that he lost narrowly, he won those states probably by two or three percent.  I mean, it's a terrible, terrible thing that happened. ",
