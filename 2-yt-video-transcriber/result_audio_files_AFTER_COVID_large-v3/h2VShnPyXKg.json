We learned of this tragic news during the garage party today, and we dedicate that episode to Simon's memory.  He leaves behind, as far as we know, a wife and a lovely daughter whom he told us with deep love and pride that he had recently reestablished a connection with her and he was helping her to go free.

            "text": "Let me just say before Simon answers this question, because what I observed at the Patriotic Alternative Conference, where he was put up on a big screen and he spoke to all of us as a speaker, will absolutely play into the answer that he is about to give, because he is a master of sharing the truth of white well-being and bringing people over to going free.  He obviously did this with his daughter.  He did this with a great many.  He has an erudite mind.  He is level-headed, if you will, when he speaks, and very enjoyable.  Everybody loved Simon when he spoke at the conference.  And, I mean, the fact that he wasn't actually physically present, but he was just digitally present.  He was visually plastered up on the screen, and yet it was still enough.  for everybody to be enthralled by what he had to say.  Everybody was, including myself, on the edge of our seats as we listened to the information that he had to share.  So it is a great pleasure to have been able to, in a way, share a lectern with Simon, even though it was digitally, thanks to the white man's technology.  So it's great to have you here.  And let's go ahead and hear your answer about your daughter now. ",

            "text": "Jason, thanks.  I mean, yeah, I mean, you're going to make me blush now.  Yeah, I suppose I need to be give some people some contact context.  I went through a very unpleasant separation about eight and a half years ago.  And as a result of that, I was kind of forcibly separated from, well, I'm not going to go into the details of this, but I was unable to see my daughter for about eight years.  And we finally made contact again in November.  And yeah, to be perfectly honest, this is something you haven't asked me, but being back in touch with her, it gives me much greater motives to be involved in this fight.  She was always there.  She was always with me, even when we weren't in contact, but having her so close and seeing her so frequently and having this wonderful relationship back again, My investment in the future hits me in the face all the time.  So it convinces me that the reason why we do what we do is for love.  And I suppose that's the first answer to the question.  The reason why I changed her is because I love her and she loves me and she hadn't seen me for a long time.  So she hadn't been subject to my gentle influence, my gentle guidance for all those eight years.  We last saw each other when she was 16 and now she's just turned 25.  So it's a big chunk of life and a big chunk of influence.  And the first day we met, It was exciting and fantastic, and we clicked immediately.  But I kind of realized that there were some political differences.  But I didn't want to upset that first meeting.  So I said to her, I'm going to tell you my real opinions once you know I'm one of the good guys.  And she said, I already know you're one of the good guys, Daddy.  And basically what I did for the next month is \u2013 And I did this with full of love, but we didn't really talk about politics for a month.  She came around most weeks, one night a week after work.  And on Sunday lunch, we have a big Sunday lunch with my wife's family, my new family.  So we have a lot of people around.  So she just became part of things.  And we kind of talked about, again, the whole way of connecting with people is, firstly, I'm a father and she loves me.  Then we talked a lot about Catalan history, how it fits in with the European story.  I talk a lot about identity with people.  Obviously, I was talking to her about how I'm English and I can't be Catalan.  So I can connect with her on this.  And then one night, I don't know what got over me, came into me, but one night she came around after work and I just decided, okay, I am going to go for it big style now.  It just, you know.  But also the important thing is when you have a close relationship and you know somebody's going to come back, then you have a lot more leeway.  Red pilling somebody like that is very different.  Somebody you meet in a bar, it needs to be a red pill in a certain kind of way.  My daughter is my daughter.  She's always going to come back.  She might say, oh, daddy, don't be ridiculous.  But I'm always going to have another chance.  So hit her really hard with this.  And I mean, she was shocked.  And I accompanied her to the bus to get home.  And she was barely speaking to me.  Then on Sunday, she stood me up, stood us up for Sunday lunch without warning.  And, you know, imagine I'd not seen her for eight years.  I thought, have you blown this?  But we kind of maintain WhatsApp contact.  And luckily, the next weekend was her 25th birthday.  And so we organized a little bit of a family party.  And she came and we didn't speak about it again until Christmas, but obviously she thought about it and we didn't touch the subject.  And then we had the kind of Christmas festivities.  And as we were saying before the show, I'm a very enthusiastic cook and I do, we have a nice flat.  My wife is a wonderful host, a lovely sociable person, and I am a good cook.  and a grumpy polemicizer.  And we're a great combination.  Very, very happy.  We've got a symbiotic relationship. ",

And she's kind of, watch this.  And then every now and again, I'll kind of draw the, often with a knife in my hand as I'm about to carve something, I'll draw the table together and come up to some kind of conclusion along the lines of, say, the patriotic alternative policy for repatriation.  Okay, this is why we need repatriation.  And this is why it will work and go through a policy statement.  and then get on with the food.  And my daughter had been completely silent for this, except one time.  She looked at me as I started one of these things.  She rolled her eyes at me and she turned to my wife's niece, who is now her new cousin.  It's very a happy situation.  And she said, I know every damn argument he's got.  Isn't he boring?  And both of them laughed as the older people kind of lapped it up.  And then a little bit later, then in January, my wife was away for the weekend, but we had our Sunday dinner anyway.  So she came round and we had a chance for a much longer talk about, I mean, we generally talk about what she's doing, what her life is.  I mean, it's not politics, politics all the time, but we had a whole day on our own together.  And we got onto the subject of relationships.  And she said things like, you know, To be perfectly honest, Daddy, you know, I had never really thought about it before.  But, you know, I wouldn't have a foreign boyfriend anyway.  I'd kind of like an English boy.  I'd like like an English boyfriend because I kind of she thinks it's cool to be.  She likes her English side. ",

It does make sense because Catalonia has to be for the Catalans and we are special.  And I've done it in a very easy way.  But she did say to me that you can be a little bit extreme, though, can't you?  So then I pointed out to her that, okay, the reason why I do this, and I am, because I'm pushing the Overton window.  I don't know if you're familiar, I was a teacher for many years.  I don't know whether you are familiar with Vygotsky's Law of Proximal Development.  Okay, my degree is in psychology as well.  So I studied psychology at university.  And then when I came to teach English, the whole trick with teaching people anything is always set the level just above their competence level.  So that's the same with language.  It's the same with pretty much anything.  And it's the same with radical politics.  So just push it.  And this is what the left does all the time. ",

She said, Simon, you love England.  You love Catalonia.  You love Spain.  You're a good man.  And it's one of those things where, you know, the message, it isn't a message of hate.  It's because a lot of the time I'm talking about what we've got, why it's worth defending, why I love it.  Why am I here?  You know, I often say to them, look, I love this place as much as you do, because I've made a positive choice to come from a country where I love and live here.  I've got I'm just as motivated as you for it not to be destroyed because I've made a conscious choice that I love it.  And I've fallen in love with it in the process.
