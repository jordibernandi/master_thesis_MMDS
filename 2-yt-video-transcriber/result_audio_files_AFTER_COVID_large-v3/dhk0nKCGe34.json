I'll be right back.  When I've run your license, just sit back and relax.  Step out of the vehicle, son.  Come with me.  Gonna book you on ADWB.  You put your hands up.  So naturally, I thought you had a gun up there, hidden somewhere in midair.  You said don't shoot, you tried to flee, which I took as an attack, shot you five times in the back.  I chased you down cause you had a pocket knife.  Thought you might be joining the Swiss Army.  Or stealing skittles.  Or passing twerthies.  Or otherwise compromising western civilization.  Oh, you can't breathe.  No, you can't breathe.  You can't breathe.  You can't breathe.  That's what they all say.  Come quietly.  I'll book you on A-D-O-A-W-B.  Thank you. ",
