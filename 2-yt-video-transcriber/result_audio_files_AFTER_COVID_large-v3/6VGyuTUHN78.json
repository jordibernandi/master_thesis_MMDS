            "text": "You're talking about reaction to identity politics.  Dog, half the people that were tweeting at me in response to what you were saying to me were literal Nazis and white supremacists.  Look, man, it's this guilt by association shit.  Why don't you denounce all the communists in your movement?  They killed 100 million people.  What's wrong with communism?  Is that what you just said?  Wait, what does communism have to do with any of this?  Well, what do Nazis have to do with this?  The people, it's a political and race ideology.  Communism is just an economic thing.  Oh, it's an economic thing.  Okay, Nazis were a movement in 1930s.  Hey, what's up?  All right, so all the other soy boys, socials, want to argue like morals and dumb shit like that.  I'm going to red pill you on the empirical evidence for socialism.  So what's the strongest empirical evidence against socialism?  What would be the strongest empirical evidence for it?  I don't think you have empirical evidence against it.  It just doesn't seem like it's been done on a large level yet.  Oh, sure.  So I should clarify.  I am a democratic socialist, and I think that the USSR came reasonably close to implementing a bad... What is your big problem with socialism?  Do you not believe in a democratic workplace?  No, I think that it could work.  I just don't know if I agree with the abolishment of capital or the abolishment of capitalists.  Does that make sense?  I don't think owning capital unilaterally should be bad.  Okay, but what about the means by which you derive that capital?  Because theoretically, in a democratic workplace, all the workers can get together.  I'm okay with reforming.  If we move in directions that are empirically proven, I'm fine with that.  That's fine.  I'm already in favor of that.  I'm already in favor of single-payer health care.  I'm already in favor of greater redistribution of wealth.  I'm already in favor of probably more worker representation in terms of unions and whatnot.  These are policies I'm already fine with.  I just don't know why I need to be a full-on, like, all labor is exploitative, the fucking proletariat.  I don't think I need to go like that full fucking age in order to have those conversations.  I can continue to push for programs that may be.  So at least it's fair to say that you are not like one of these fans of Nicolas Maduro.  No, aren't there?  like a lot of I've seen reactions to this.  Aren't there a lot of like lefty people that are kind of like championing him and saying, well, the U.S.  is only trying to kick him out because this is capitalism versus socialism again or something like that.  And then some people are getting mad because they're kind of excusing what are probably human rights violations of this guy because he seems to represent.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yeah.  I mean, so far, you're limited.  A perspective matches up with mine, which gets me criticized on.  I'm sorry, guys.  Workers are fucking stupid.  They are.  I don't know what you want me to say.  I don't know how anybody can disagree with this.  I don't know how anybody could work a job and come away thinking, yeah, my fellow co-workers are so smart, I wish they ran the workplace.  I don't know who could possibly fucking think this, besides white college kids that haven't worked jobs before.  I'm being elitist.  Getting blasted off was a collapse.  They were like, they were not able to bend, so they broke.  But the notion that capitalism is somehow responsible for China's growth, well, you could argue that.  They've traded with capitalist countries, but they've pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.  I think China's achievements are an inspiration to the entire world.  I'm kind of curious.  In other countries \u2013 wait a minute.  Can I ask him one question?  Let's only address points that he's making and not \u2013 I'm more of, if you want me to get really, really explicit, I'm more along the lines of an anarcho-communist.  I wouldn't call myself that specifically, but I would say that I trend in that area.  I come from the more contract-oriented exchange of goods and services, products, labor,  etc.,  okay i i just basically i just don't see how organizing this company in a different fashion like the issue that you have with the company of people being susceptible to cessationalist headlines.  i already told you i'm not here to completely defend vietnam.  i'm just here to set the record straight that there's a lot of misinformation about vietnam and the the capitalist media makes it seem a lot worse than it is.  but that's not to say that i will defend every single action that the vietnamese government does because i'm not a marxist.  Okay, well then what's the alternative?  Because every socialist system has miserably fucking failed in a much quicker amount of time than the capitalism we have right now.  Wait, why would your personal income decline?  Because you lost your job at a union steel worker and you became a stupid Walmart creator.  Fuck the union steel workers!  I don't want every single working family in America to pay more for all of their goods because we're trying to protect one narrow sect of the economy.  Why the fuck should I make every working family in America... This is why I got big on the internet is because you guys on the left absolutely suck shit at confrontation.  You're not willing to defend any of your ideas.  You can't substantiate anything outside of like a huge video circle jerk.  And all you do is you mischaracterize the fuck out of everybody to discourage you.  This is why I got popular.  It's because I filled a void that none of you were able to do.  So what you've done here... Shut the fuck up.  What you've done here is you've made me tired.  You're literally laying on his ass, firing shots at people 20 feet away who weren't even moving towards him.  Hold on.  Have you watched that video?  Uh, I mean, I've watched, I think, that video, yeah.  Can somebody link the second video so that we can watch it together?  Because I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about.  Hold on.  I'm not defending the shooter running across to some other fucking state so that he can live out his LARPing, zombie-killing fucking fantasies, alright?  And it's... The thing that I don't understand is that when I watch so many videos of these protests, you always see these, like, black kids in the group screaming at everybody.  Watch out for agitators.  Don't get violent.  Don't let people get you off message.  Like, this is what I see.  And now I'm seeing, like, fucking videos of, like, a lot of it is fucking white people running around torching shit.  Like... It's not right!  It's not right!  It's not right what y'all doing!  As a result of that... let's go over, you haven't followed my stuff.  lately, I've been getting into a lot of fights with lefty communities, because I noticed that extreme lefty communities oftentimes employ the same rhetorical strategies, then that became like the new fun, hip, cool, sexy thing to be.  Then after that, that kind of got bored, we got a little bit of centrism coming out, we had the Tim Pools, Dave Rubens, and now we're coming into the era of the online lefties, the champagne socialists.  The people that are making so goddamn much money on Patreon, they're embarrassed about it, so they hide it.  And then they said, um, we're terminating your agreement, removing your partnership on October 9th.  I think that the examples that you gave... Oh my god!  You can't answer a question!  Holy shit!  This is unreal!  Are you guys watching this?  I can't believe this right now!  Why can't you just answer the question?  Oh, I think for the moment, I think you're a secret tankie.  I do think that.  Don't you still have, like, all that, like, your name is Central Committee, don't you still have all that Soviet shit or whatever on your phone?  Oh, I understand 100%.  That's just the fucking answer I'm given every single fucking time.  somebody tells me that I think communism is ridiculous.  I understand that the fucking communist men, that fucking dust capital is not, this is how communism works.  It's a critique of capitalism that says it will inevitably lead to the rise of socialism.  I know that.  I understand that.  Do you have an argument for communism, socialism, or did you just come here to drop that totally fucking retarded... I'm banning you because I've literally said multiple times that the shooter is a fucking moron.  I've literally said it multiple times.  But you can't hear it.  You can't hear me saying it because you're so emotionally invested in this.  You so want to be Nantito.  Oh, you're saying VSA tried to pay you?  Liar.  No, no, no.  I'm saying, I'm not saying that.  I never said that.  I'm saying that if you're going to make a very strong claim like this, it's obvious that there's people.  Okay, so I'm, yeah, sorry.  So I'm Destiny, and I try to make sure that when we talk about breaking news, we're not rattling off some dumbass bullshit that we have no fucking idea we're talking about.  That's what I'm doing tonight.  And I'm Nina and I go through my life not being a white piece of shit.  Nice to meet you, Despy.  Don't ever fucking address me like that again.  Thank you.  Kardashians are lying to you.  I mean, it sounds like a might is right then kind of thing.  Then the person who ends up being right is just the person with the most amount of force behind whatever they think?  No, because it has nothing to do with being correct.  But it does have a lot to do with what wins. ",
