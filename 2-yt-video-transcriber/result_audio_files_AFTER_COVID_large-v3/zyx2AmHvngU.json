And a lot of new discoveries are being made all around the country.  But this one is so exciting.  At the Garden of Gethsemane, The Catholic Church, the custody of the Holy Land, is developing a new underground passage between the garden and the Kidron Valley.  Because the Kidron Valley is believed to be the site of the final judgment at the end of times.  And the church wants it to be more accessible.  And while they were doing that dig, they made two very interesting discoveries.  First of all, they found another church.  Another Byzantine period church, which was quite a surprise because the current church at the Garden of Gethsemane is on top of a medieval and a Byzantine church.  So what's another church? ",

            "text": "Yes, 4th to 7th century.  The new church is dated to the last part of it, like 6th to 7th century.  And in the news press they released just yesterday, they said, we don't know what to make of it.  There's an inscription in it, but it's an inscription in Greek that is praising the sponsors of the church.  It doesn't mention what is this church commemorating, if anything.  But I think that maybe, maybe that church relates to the Last Supper because we do have some visiting period pilgrims mentioning the commemoration of the Last Supper next to Gethsemane.  So there's definitely more research that needs to be done.  I'm not also, I didn't excavate that church, so I don't know all the details, but I would investigate that possibility.  But that's just one of the discoveries.  Beneath the Byzantine church, much, much deeper, under bedrock, they found a Jewish ritual bath.  And Jewish ritual bath with those steps leading into the water zone is typical to the time of Jesus.  Okay, Eric, this ritual bath is actually from the first century, from the time of Jesus, and found right next to Gethsemane.  2,000 years old.  Yes, but I think that that might be a very important clue to the function of Gethsemane, which its name already implies.  Gethsemane is really Hebrew, Gat Shmanim, the oil's press, the press where you make oil.  What oil?  Olive oil, of course, because you're beneath Mount of Olives.  And olive oil had a great need, especially for lighting.  Now, if you have a ritual bath next to it, it means that maybe it was done in purity because it had a sacred function, a sacred destiny.  Okay?  Now, you're right next to Jerusalem.  In fact, you're right opposite the temple.  Maybe the olive oil produced at Gethsemane was intended to light Jerusalem.  the Temple of Jerusalem.  Maybe its menorah was lit from olive oil coming from Gethsemane.  Wow.  Okay?  The ritual bath makes it at least a possibility.  And I found that to be an amazing, amazing discovery.  It's not the first time that we found ritual baths in the context of oil presses and wine presses.  There's actually one in Norvingia or somewhere I used to live like 20, 30 years ago where you have these combined again.  And also then they said maybe this was for the purpose of sacred use offerings in the temple.  And here you have one at Gethsemane itself. ",

            "text": "Yes.  From the Byzantine period, we know of several churches which started there.  sanctifying the mountain by Christians from the fourth century.  Up on the top, you had the Eleonid Church.  Now it's called the Paternoster.  You have the Dominus Flevi Church.  You have the Chapel of the Ascension.  God in Gethsemane, Mary's tomb.  But finds from the first century are pretty scarce because it was an open area where you grew olives or olive oil.  And here in Gethsemane, we have the first time evidence of some daily use there in the form of a ritual bath.  And Byzantine pilgrims also documented round stones.  They associated these round stones with where the disciples fell asleep when Jesus went to pray by himself.  But without being aware of it, they actually probably documented components of an olive press.  Unfortunately, today, we don't know what these big round stones are.  They were taken maybe as souvenirs by pilgrims.  But that and the ritual bath is pretty significant testimony to the existence of an olive press in the time of Jesus at Gethsemane.  Now, if Jesus was in Jerusalem in the autumn, I don't think anyone would let him stay there because that's the high season.  But Jesus was in the spring, right, around Passover.  No one was using Gethsemane.  It was an abandoned site, so he could stay there, he and the disciples, and the rest is history. ",

There's another discovery they just announced for Hanukkah made not too far from my home where they found a potter's workshop who specialized in oil lamps.  And what was so nice about this discovery, it was already made like 70 years ago.  in the British Mandate period, but the location was forgotten.  And now doing some salvage archeological work, it was rediscovered.  So there's a lot of miraculous archeological discoveries related to olive oil these days, which I find to be more than coincidence. ",
