            "text": "This is Richard Wolff from Democracy at Work responding to another Ask Prof Wolff question that comes in from our Patreon community.  And today I want to deal with the question sent in by Brandon Chavez.  Brandon asks about Venezuela and the relationship of Venezuela to the issue of socialism and its consequences.  And he references an appearance by Cornel West on the Tucker Carlson program on Fox News and how Tucker immediately went to work with Cornel equating socialism to Venezuela and its problems.  This is a cheap shot.  This is the kind of thing for which Fox News is famous.  Their job is to diminish and demean socialism so they associate it with everything negative they can think of.  It's got all the subtlety of a 10-ton truck.  And Cornell was very wise in skirting around it and getting to other issues.  Brandon, however, wants us to focus in on this notion that socialism is somehow equatable with, or defined by, or exemplified by Venezuela.  Okay, so let me deal with that.  First, there are many countries in the world that refer to themselves, or at least have large numbers of people referring to them as socialists.  And unless we all have some definition of socialism that rules all those folks out, then we would have to take them at their own estimation, that they live in socialist societies, rather than deal honestly with what they think.  So let's start.  Most of Scandinavia will refer to itself as a socialist society.  Large numbers of people, 30, 40, 50, sometimes more percent of populations in other European countries likewise refer to themselves as socialists.  Let me just pick one because it shows you the absurdity of Tucker Carlson.  Portugal, a country I'm sure most of you know, has been governed now for five or six or seven years by a coalition of three parties.  the Socialist Party of Portugal, which is the major partner, and two junior partners, the Communist Party of Portugal and the Green Party of Portugal, which defines itself, half at least, as socialist.  So there's no question that Portugal is, by at least the definition of what their people vote for, a socialist country.  Does it have the problems of Venezuela?  No.  Does it have anything like the problems of Venezuela?  No.  Is it a society that most Americans think of as more or less like ours, with the understandable differences?  Yes.  So Tucker Carlson could just as readily have used Portugal as an example, and had he done so, he would have discovered that Portugal has enjoyed a better economic recovery from the crash of 2008 than most other countries in Europe, that its unemployment rate is lower,  etc.,  etc.,  that it has come through the COVID crisis much better than the United States.  If you wanted to attribute to socialism good things, you would pick Portugal.  But Tucker Carlson doesn't want to do that, so you will find Portugal discussed on his program all roughly never.  But he will discuss Venezuela.  How interesting.  It's as if I were to say to you, you know what capitalism is?  It's Saudi Arabia, who only recently allowed women to drive cars, who seems to specialize in butchering oppositional journalists, etc.  That would be the equivalent of Tucker Carlson.  He would be picking a very bad example, equating capitalism with that, and it would then take Tucker Carlson five seconds to say, well, wait a minute, why didn't you equate capitalism with, I don't know, Canada?  stupid games designed, I suppose, to persuade people who are not well educated or who have the same bias that Tucker does, and that's an overlapping group.  In any case, it's not serious.  But I want to be serious for a minute and talk about Venezuela.  Are there aspects of Venezuela that are socialist?  Yes.  Are there aspects of Venezuela that I think most people would agree are not socialist?  Yes.  Is what happens in Venezuela exclusively the consequence of the socialist parts or of the other parts?  And the answer is, it's a stupid question.  What happens in Venezuela is a function of all the different aspects of Venezuelan society.  Well let's then look at a couple of those.  Venezuela, like so many countries, both in Latin America and in Asia and Africa, over the years that it was a junior partner to a foreign colonial society.  In the case of Venezuela, the United States.  Yes, yes, I know, Venezuela was not a formal part of the United States Empire, but it was an informal one.  Take a look at Venezuelan history for the last 200 years and you will see exactly what I mean.  One of the results of being a colonial possession, formal or informal, is that you become dependent on a particular product that the colonial master country wants or needs to have.  East Africa produces coffee.  Because they drink coffee?  No!  Because they were part of the British Empire, which wanted them to be a coffee producer.  the United States needed oil and Venezuela had oil.  So Venezuela made money by producing oil.  The socialists who came in with Hugo Chavez and now with Mr.  Maduro inherited an economy debt-ridden and dependent on oil.  And in case you haven't noticed, over recent years the price of oil has collapsed, and that has badly hurt the Venezuelan economy.  It has had bad results for other oil-producing economies, Nigeria, Russia, and many others.  Part of the problems of Venezuela have to do with its dependence, bad luck for it, on oil.  But that was not Mr.  Chavez's doing, and that was not Mr.  Maduro's doing, and that has absolutely nothing to do with socialism.  Well, what is socialist in Venezuela?  A commitment since Hugo Chavez to enhance the position of the poor To bring the poor, the vast majority of Venezuelans have always been poor.  One of the results of the many decades of non-socialist society in Venezuela was to create the poverty that hobbles that society, just as it does literally everywhere else in Latin America.  No socialism produced that long tradition of poverty.  The opposite.  Capitalism did that.  And so Chavez and Maduro have tried to bring medical care, to bring food, to bring education to the mass of people.  Have they done that in a perfect way?  Of course not.  Have they violated civil liberties and over-reliance on the military along the way?  Yes.  And that too is a very old tradition in Latin America having nothing to do with socialism as you can see in so many of the other Latin American countries right now.  Enough said.  The story of Venezuela is a complex story, high points, low points, bits of socialism, bits of capitalism, woven together in a tense relationship, which is true of most countries, more or less. ",
