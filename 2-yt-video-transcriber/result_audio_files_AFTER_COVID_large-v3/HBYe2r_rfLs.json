And on the front, we're gonna clad it with wood paneling, so it's gonna look like wainscoting.  But what I really wanna show you is this.  This is actually really cool.  You'll notice, unlike all vault doors, most vault doors have pins that come out of the edge of the vault door, and they go into holes that are on the frame.  But you won't see that here.  And the reason is because that is not a very effective way to keep people out.  If you go onto YouTube, you type in break into safes, you'll see these guys that take like six foot pry bars and they just pop open a safe door.  So we have a different system where we have these slots here and then over here on the frame, there are these tabs.  And when the door closes, the tab goes into the slot, and then there's a pin inside here that goes vertically.  It goes up and down, and so it goes through a hole here, through this hole, and then through another hole here.  And so that's called double-shear locking. ",
