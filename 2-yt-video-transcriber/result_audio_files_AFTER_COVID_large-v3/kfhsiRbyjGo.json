            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor.  I thought I should make a little recording here and share something with you that it's very troubling, very concerning about a direction that we're seeing happening in our country among some evangelical Christians.  Exhibit A, yesterday, this is January 4, so this is January 3, this recording was made, opening of Congress, and traditionally they invite a chaplain to have prayer.  This chaplain in particular was Methodist minister Emanuel Cleaver, and he prayed a prayer, and there were some nice things in the prayer, some was a little bizarre, but I want you to notice how he concludes his prayer.

            "text": "Well now, that really covers the basis.  We're gonna pray in the name of the monotheistic God, whichever monotheistic God, that could be Islam, it could be Judaism, it could be Christianity, it could be all kinds of different religions, and in the name of Brahma, that's the Hindu religion, And the God who's known by many different names, we don't want to be too specific about a God.  It's basically saying the gods, which is really paganism, polytheism, any old God out there that happens to be listening.  And you might think, well, Pastor Doug, that is actually the politically correct thing to be doing right now.  Well, that's a far cry from what our founding fathers did.  So let me read to you from the first prayer that was offered in the Continental Congress.  And this is in 1774.  And it was a prayer offered by Reverend Jacob Duchesne.  He begins by saying, Here it's saying there's one God.  We know what the name of that God is.  He reigns over all things.  He wasn't saying any old God and any old religion.  And notice how he concludes his prayer.  He says, He quotes from Psalm 35.  It's a biblical prayer.  And he concludes by saying, all this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, thy Son and our Savior.  Boy, things have come a long way from the days when the chaplains, when they prayed in the Congress, they knew that... the founding fathers were largely Christian.  I know some were deists and some had varying views, but they recognized that the country was founded on biblical principles.  And, you know, Roger Williams, he was very clear that the government should make no laws that command us to keep the first four commandments.  We don't want the government telling us about what God to worship or what his name is or when to worship him or how to worship him.  But they all believe that the principles of Christianity and the last six commandments must be upheld by the government.  And people were not ashamed to say the name of Jesus in the halls of legislation.  But things have just gone crazy lately where They're bending over backwards and doing all of these verbal gymnastics to prevent from saying the name of Jesus, the only name given among men whereby we must be saved.  And then they're so self-conscious about gender equality that even if you say the word men in the word amen, which has nothing to do with gender, amen simply means let it be.  that then you must quickly add the word woman or they'll think it's unequal.  Friends, I think this is a sign of things to come.  We really need to be praying for our country. ",
