            "text": "Hey, it's Tyesha, and I am all packed up.  All my stuff is behind me.  I am hitting the road to drive across country again.  But this time, I am not coming back to Washington.  F-word Washington.  I'm never coming back.  So I'm going to document this journey across country.  I'm going to tie in some of the footage from last year's journey across country, answer some questions or, you know, just some thoughts and, you know, document this.  Atlanta, Georgia.  Someone on Facebook guessed it this morning.  I'm like, oh my gosh.  I've been putting posts on Facebook about Georgia being on my mind.  Like, oh my gosh, I may be here in Washington physically, but my mind and my heart is, well, half my heart is in Atlanta.  The other half of my heart is in Virginia.  So I'm getting closer and my hearts can be as one.  I have all of my stuff here with me.  The rest of my stuff is in the back of a tractor trailer.  Hope you watched my video on moving across country.  And you'll see how I did that.  Here in the car with me.  What I am drinking.  This is going to be my first drink.  This is like a protein.  It's a chocolate.  veggie-based protein drink, and it has some caffeine in it.  So I'm drinking that.  And then this here in this cup, this is a blend of water and sweet tea.  Yes, I'm going to the South to get some sweet tea, baby.  Yeah, just have my purse, some glasses, just everything I would need up here.  People laugh at me because I still buy CDs.  Yes, I do.  Because on this journey, I have about 40 hours on the road.  So it comes a point in time where stuff like that happens.  But you get tired of XM radio.  It ain't playing nothing.  And you can put in a CD and listen to some old jams and you'll be good to go.  So in the CD player right now, I have David Banner, Baptized in Dirty Water.  Yeah, everything is in here with me.  And I'm out.  Let's go.  Goodbye, Washington.  Forever.  Now, this is a story all about how this place called Bremerton had me all the way messed up, okay?  I am driving out of Bremerton finally, and I got the idea to kind of record that, but talk to you and just tell you why.  I don't recommend anyone, anyone, especially if you're a black person, coming to live in Bremerton, Washington.  I don't recommend Washington, period, for anybody.  Starting out, people ask, well, Tyesha, how did you end up there?  I ended up here because I was married to a sailor.  And when we were in Pearl Harbor, his submarine came up here to be decommissioned.  It came up here to die, pretty much.  And pretty much up here, this is the place of broken dreams.  This is where a lot of people do come to die, unfortunately, because there is a high rate of suicides here at Riverton.  I hear stories all the time about, you know, people, you know, fighting bodies.  They went to a scene of a suicide.  And pretty much a lot of the stories that I heard, the common denominator is people would go and get a case of reindeer beer, drink the whole case, mix that with some drugs, and just die in their sleep.  Quite sad, you know.  And, you know, my condolences to the families and whatnot.  Uh-oh.  You know, like a speed thing going on.  So, yeah, State Patrol want to do what they do.  But anywho, yeah, up here, it looks just like this.  You see these clouds.  The sun comes out for a hot minute.  It's just precipitation all the time.  And it's not just like a thunderstorm or nothing like that.  It's just in a very drizzle to whatever, a mist to a heavy fog to pour down rain into a bit of sunshine.  All in a stretch of like a mile.  Like you are trying to figure out how to adjust your windshield wipers the whole time.  So my experience here in Bremerton, I met a good brother when I first got here.  And we eventually worked together.  And the brother told me, like, look, I'm trying to get up out of here.  You know, I kind of suggested she do the same.  And I'm like, I got you.  I'm going to, you know, try to do what I can because the job I had, it was just strictly survival.  I had no loyalty or no plans to retire at this job.  Nothing.  Cause when I saw, when I first went in there, I saw it was chaos, but that'd be another video.  Cause I know a lot of the trolls, they waiting on me to just say something about it.  Cause they, they know they did me wrong.  So, you know, we'll go ahead and save that for another video.  Go ahead and thumbs down the video with your hate.  But this place, Bremerton, Washington, this whole area, okay, it's in the county of Kitsap.  And that's after Chief Kitsap with one of the Native American tribes up here.  And so because it's Kitsap, it's nicknamed Kidnap County because you really feel like you got kidnapped and brought here.  And it's just the attitude, like many non-black people I encounter, you know, white people kind of act like they never saw black people before.  They were so freaking rude to me.  Now, I'm not saying everybody was, but it was enough to where I'm like, I don't belong here.  I don't want to be here.  This place sucks.  It's terrible.  And I want to try to get out of here.  And I was always on high alert all the time, all the time.  And for instance, when I would go somewhere or let's say I'm in a store and I'm coming down the aisle and a white person is coming down the aisle, they'll just do a real out of nowhere, open mouth, hard coughing, you know, like that.  And my mom taught me when I was younger that, you know, bigots do that, you know, just to be rude and show that, you know, you're not welcome.  And that happened to me a lot.  I was at the Fred Meyer in Bremerton, and I'll be in the aisle, you know, trying to get something or looking at something on the shelf, and there's about a one-foot gap between me and the shelf.  I'll have some rude-ass person bogart their way, step in front of me, or, like, reach around me, just so freaking rude, you know, and they just think nothing of it.  And I had people just stare at me, you know, just out of nowhere, like, what are you looking at?  You know, just it made me so uncomfortable.  And I'm like, I don't want to be here anymore.  And, you know, I felt the same vibe.  That's why the two times I went up to Vancouver, I have that video, the two videos on my channel.  I'll link those in this video so you can watch them.  And it was just the same thing, like, rude-ass people in Vancouver, British Columbia, just rude as fuck.  And I'm trying to say a bad word.  Rude as I don't know what in Vancouver.  So I'm like, this is some bull.  Come to find out, I was talking with a good friend the other day, shout out Kate, Kate maybe.  She was like, yeah, that is the common attitude, you know, especially it's like the Canada attitude bleed down into this area.  And that's why I really did not like being in Seattle a whole lot because Seattle is People are just really, really rude.  It was kind of like a New York, like a Manhattan vibe where people just about their own business.  And I'm not saying that's everybody, but just the rudest behavior you can think of.  It was common practice here in Washington.  And especially for me, because it's definitely a culture shock.  Because I would come here, and I'm used to like, you know, Midwest, Southern hospitality, courtesy, things like that.  No, especially, I won't say, I'm not saying all.  Now, the thing is, if I say something, don't take it as I'm saying everybody in Blakeney.  But I'm just saying the majority.  exhibited this behavior, especially Black males.  And the majority of the Black males who are here, they have some kind of ties to the military.  And what I've noticed with a lot of the Black males that I came encounter with, I was used to, you know, Southern gentlemen, you know, when they see you, it's an instant family connection.  Negative.  Because I don't, I guess because I'm not a white female, They just treat me like the scum of the earth.  If I even speak to them like I expect, you know, where I come from, brothers speak to you first.  Black men speak to you first.  No, not around here.  When I speak to them like, hey, brother, how you doing?  They about jump out their damn skin when I speak to them.  As far as culture, like me, I grew up with culture.  We just didn't... I mean, once I joined the military, it's celebrated that you observe other people's heritage and stuff like that.  But I find in being a Black woman... you know things of my culture embracing my my ancestors my history here in america and in africa and all over.  it's not celebrated here like it's really hard to you know find a african culture store things like that and so i gotta travel way out yonder to get to it.  um there was a situation where I had to call out some bigots a couple times.  And the more unapologetic I was and the more I stood up for myself, I became more and more empowered and bold to, you know, not let people get away with this subtle racism, you know, because nobody will come to my face and call me a digger or a bitch or nothing, but I know they do it behind my back.  And you know what?  That's perfectly fine because I know you're going to see what you're going to say about me behind closed doors, but you're not going to bring that to my face.  And that's why I advocate, you know, being a hard target up here.  Speaking of being a hard target, now, right now, we're in Port Orchard, ",
