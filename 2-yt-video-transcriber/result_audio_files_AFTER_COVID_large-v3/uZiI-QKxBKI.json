            "text": "We've already talked about commodity fetishism and alienation.  Hopefully, if you've watched those videos or are familiar with those concepts, you have seen how closely connected they are.  In this video, we will cover Georgi Luk\u00e1cs' concept of reification, which in many ways builds on Marx's commodity fetishism.  Luk\u00e1cs' argument for reification draws generously from Marx's first volume of Capital, in which Marx outlines how commodities are exchanged and what kind of repercussions this system of exchange has on society as a whole.  Luk\u00e1cs points out that the question of reification becomes pertinent in a system where the commodity form is the universal structuring principle.  whereas prior systems have had the commodity as one form among many regulating the metabolism of human society it is the capitalist mode of production that introduces the systematization of commodity production and exchange.  this universalizing process is important because it requires the establishment of new norms and methods that override the ways of the past.  In the past, pockets of commodity production and exchange did not require a complete overhaul of the social and economic rules.  But now that the commodity form has become dominant, only a system based on strict standardization and quantification can be utilized.  Thus, the labor process in capitalism is systematized, universalized, mechanized,  etc.,  contrary to the incongruous, organic process of past systems.  In the end, this change inherently alters the nature of human labor.  Here's what Luk\u00e1cs says happens to the status of the individual under this new system.  This fragmentation of the object of production necessarily entails the fragmentation of its subject.  In consequence of the rationalization of the work process, the human qualities and idiosyncrasies of the worker appear increasingly as mere sources of error when contrasted with these abstract special laws functioning according to rational predictions.  neither objectively nor in his relation to his work does man appear as the authentic master of the process.  on the contrary he is a mechanical part incorporated into a mechanical system.  mechanization destroys the organic interpersonal bonds in society creating atomized individuals.  This dying out of the natural, organic, and the systematization of the automatic and mechanic is Luk\u00e1cs' reification, the construction of a structure of dynamics and impersonal forces that permeate society.  Reification produces and reproduces the whole mechanical system, and every reproduction solidifies that status quo as a natural reality in the reified mind.  For many of us, the sense that we are cogs in a machine, that we are being moved by forces alien to us, is nothing strange at all.  We likely feel that way at work or in school.  In fact, those of us who are fortunate enough to not feel that way are in the minority.  That's where we'll end the video today.
