            "text": "Let's be clear, guys.  She's a business owner.  I have to say that when I was sent this video by Vice about sugar babies, I was not expecting this.  A 31-year-old chick who isn't even hot.  When I imagine some rich guy buying a girl a $5,000 purse, paying her rent, and paying for her useless humanities degree, I picture a girl who is much more attractive.  So, to all you feminists who say that men have standards that no real woman could obtain, here is your counter-evidence.  Even a 31-year-old, below-average single mother can supposedly get a rich guy to pay.  Anyway, this is Molly Turner.  Molly claims that she is a business owner and a brand ambassador for a popular sugar baby website called Seeking Arrangement.  Now, I've done a little research on Seeking Arrangement or Seeking.com, and I noticed a very familiar smell.  Have you guys ever had some douchebag former friend of yours trick you into going to a meeting for a pyramid scheme?  Well, I've been lucky enough to have two such people in my life lie to me and invite me to the exact same scam life insurance company two separate times.  They called their sales associates financial advisors.  One of their financial advisors was so terrible that she told me to go into debt so I could invest in their crappy life insurance policy.  Have you ever heard of the rule of 72?  The interest rate you pay on your debt is 8%, but our interest rate is 10%.  You are losing 2% of your money by not investing with us.  Yeah, you idiot.  Except your 10% was a maybe.  The 8% interest on my debt was a guarantee.  I laughed at her and walked out.  That is the kind of business owner Molly is.  Her business is either prostitution or to pretend that she's getting all these rich guys.  so Seeking Arrangement can use her to scam other girls into buying their premium sugar daddy package.  The reality is that she likely paid Seeking Arrangement a fee to become a brand ambassador as an advertisement.  That's how these scams work.  Or maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I just misunderstand the kind of person a sugar baby is. ",

Just for transparency, though, I did cut off a defense from Chabrayan because it was edited awkwardly, but basically he says that sugar babies aren't lazy because they are business owners.  Yeah, Instagram social media influencers call themselves business owners too.  Being born attractive is not a skill and it doesn't make you the owner of a business.  But you aren't lazy, you aren't self-indulgent, you aren't narcissistic.  Why don't we get the opinion of a more honest sugar baby who also uses seeking arrangement? ",

Your ex-husband cheats on you and destroys your relationship, so now you get paid to help men cheat on their wives and destroy their families.  What kind of message does that send to your son?  The stupid defense that women always give for this kind of crap is, Oh, he doesn't know what I do.  He never sees me with these men.  I tell him to be a good boy and teach him how to be responsible.  Yeah, except if you pay attention, kids don't listen to what their parents say.  They watch what their parents do.  It's not a happy accident when the daughter of a single mother becomes a single mother.  It's modeled behavior.  People in general do not listen to what you say.  They are always reading your actions.  That's why giving someone advice doesn't work if you don't actually take the advice for yourself.  If you are a drug addict, it doesn't matter if your kids don't see you snort cocaine because they are being raised by the parent who snorts cocaine.  molly's complete lack of self-awareness which causes her to perpetuate the problem that ruined her marriage is going to show up in her son.  he is going to be just as unaware as she is because she approved of that behavior with her actions.  you have to embody the value or people won't listen or they won't be able to absorb the material.  If you don't even do the thing you're recommending, that's just saying that you don't feel it's valuable.  That, or you don't know how to motivate yourself to do the positive behavior, meaning that you aren't qualified to give the advice.  Just like a fat personal trainer, you either don't value being thin, or you don't know how to be thin.  How is Molly supposed to teach her son how to be disciplined when she is a lazy sugar baby?  How is she going to teach him to be honest when she constantly lies about what she does for a living?  How is she going to teach him to self-criticize when she openly recreates the problem that destroyed her marriage?  You can't teach principles that you don't embody yourself. ",

Speaking of successful businesswomen, check out this article from Jezebel called, Why have I been dating for free when I could have had a sugar daddy?  Writer Amy Lutkin went to one of the Seeking Arrangement conventions and attended a main stage panel called Sugar for Entrepreneurs.  Amy states, Some of the hopefuls wanted Daddy to provide seed money for a whole company.  That's their business plan.  Blow some rich guy and have him pay for everything.

            "text": "Basically what you're getting here is an overpriced prostitute.  At least the prostitute is honest about what she does.  And again, I come back to the misconceptions.  You want us to think that sugar babies do hard, respectful work and are fiscally responsible, but all you are doing is handling depreciating assets.  A $20,000 purse depreciates in value.  A MacBook depreciates in value.  A car depreciates in value.  The only person who mentioned that he has an asset that will actually get money was the guy.  He said he was gifted some stock, and that's about it.  Also, did you happen to notice that everyone in these videos was young?  Attractiveness is a depreciating asset that you will eventually run out of.  If all you can do is be attractive, then after about 35 or so, you are going to be broke.  As for you guys watching, if you want to talk about the number one problem with people's finances, it's the fact that most people have a whole truckload of stuff in the depreciating assets pile and almost nothing in assets that gain value over time.  Worse, they buy all those things that go down in value with debt.  They don't actually own their stuff.  It's all rented from creditors.  You want to know the secret to wealth?  Show some self-control and stop spending all of your cash on things that don't earn you money.  You don't need a brand new car unless you are already rich.  Cars lose most of their value within three to four years.  You don't need the biggest house or all the nice gadgets.  What you need is to pay off all of your debt and start putting time and money into things that grow in value over time.  The very few sugar babies that are successful are laughing now, but they won't be when they're all used up and don't have anything to show for it.  As always, learn from their bad example and don't make the same mistake.  But with that said, I think that will be enough for this video.
