            "text": "Why oh why do women have unrealistic expectations of men and a skewed sense of self?  I have some ideas.  Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Molliskey.  This is my YouTube channel.  Today I just want... I've been thinking about this a little bit in the whole mess of brain soup that I think about every day.  And I just came up with some opinions.  Now, these are not solutions.  They're just reasons why it might be so.  Reasons why it might be so.  So stick with me if you want.  And if not, I'll see you another time.  So here we are.  We're moving from a pair bonding culture to a promiscuous culture.  or the culture is trying to decide where it's going to settle.  And we used to have a great system that was created out of evolutionary necessity rather than the top five, 10, 15, 20% of men getting all the women and the other 80% just moping and being without.  the A pair bonding opportunity was created where men realized that if they agreed to share their provisions to a valuable woman, that she would stay with him and be true to him.  And this was really wonderful for the human experience because now every man, regardless of their looks or their height or their... I don't know how fast I could create a fire, would have a woman to have a family, to cook, to be with, to love, a warm body, to lighten the load.  The system worked really well.  But with the advent, I think, of birth control, we have women who are going back to the promiscuity model.  In a large part because of feminism and women going into the workforce, men have less of an ability to make enough money for themselves, let alone a woman or a family.  This is a tough time to be sure.  We are in flux.  But men are taking advantage of this promiscuity model.  They can get women to have sex with them, and they don't even have to spend any money.  They don't even have to offer any provisions at all.  And that's great for men, but it's very bad for assisting women to help them understand what their actual value is.  With a pair bonding model, it was just too risky outside of commitment to have sex.  with a rando because that could create a child.  And at the end of the day, the woman's risk was greater than the man's because she was stuck with that responsibility.  So she would choose a man who would offer her a life partnership and provisions for her and her child.  So the pair bonding model distributed some of the control to men too.  So they weren't just on the outside waiting for a woman to choose them.  They were part of the choosing process.  They had power.  They got to choose who they'd share their provisions with.  And in order to be offered a provisionary relationship, the women had to have some value.  So she acted valuable.  She learned valuable things.  She did valuable things.  She became valuable.  But now men will have sex with practically anyone.  So in a woman's mind, she's confusing that sex with her value.  She thinks that men, if they have sex with her, they see her as valuable.  Here's something, sex is not valuable in a promiscuous culture.  hey just a quick just a quick thing.  a lot of people say that this message is not getting out to women because there's men in the comments men.  a lot of you also say that it'll take a woman to help change the minds of women.  share this video with a woman.  just share it with a woman or not.  of course you have freedom.  if you like this message share it with a woman.  Number two, promiscuity skews the woman's idea of her value and it also skews how she sees her beaut.  beauty because women naturally want the best they can get right the top tier kind of man just as you probably would.  if you're a man listening right you'd rather have Giselle than me or a Chelsea Clinton doppelganger.  that's normal.  it's okay I accept it but when you have a promiscuous society and a woman who's playing in that game she's getting multiple partners because she thinks she's so pretty now she has an unrealistic idea of her value and her beauty.  she's starting to become spoiled.  Number three, because women are brought up in this feminist society, they tend to think that men hire, like hire, vet women as a partner the same as they do.  Many women think that the resume, the resume that they are looking for in a partner is is the same resume that the man is looking for.  So did you guys see the video that I was poking fun at Tomi Lahren?  I was making fun of her a lot.  And I'm sure she's a nice girl.  That was just red pill rage maybe.  She was looking for a strong, ambitious, attractive man that had shit going on.  Because that's what her and her friends were doing.  That's who her and her friends were.  So she thought that men of that kind of value would value her and her friends the same way that she valued a man that had those characteristics.  It's not the same.  It's not true.  Men and women are different.  Men and women are different.  Women are not taught that anymore.  They're being taught that we're the same.  Everyone's the same.  It's not true.  Number four, they watch TV.  They watch TV.  I can't find any scientific data to back this up, but think about the news source that people watch.  They watch it every day, every day, every day, every day.  And they begin to believe it.  That is true, true, true.  It's the same with movies and TV show.  You become familiar with the character.  Just like if you watch me a lot, you start to become familiar with my character.  You think that, well, I don't know what you think, but if I had a TV show, you might think that they're.  That's how real life is.  And with feminism taking over this culture's media and being in control and being the creators of movies and TV, women are being force fed like gooses.  being fattened up for foie gras, they are force-fed.  this idea that life is a certain way, that women are strong and capable and can do anything and they don't need a man until they decide that they're ready for a man.  And then they'll just find one and life will be perfect.  That man will be perfect.  What does that mean exactly?  I don't know.  And neither do they.  They just know they'll be happy.  Number five.  Number five.  Oh, yeah.  OK, so they don't know what exactly it is that will make them happy because not many women have taken a deep dive into how they would actually construct or what a awesome, blissful life means or as close to bliss as we can have it right now.  I think that bliss is having a solid relationship with someone that you respect, someone who you can't a man who you cannot walk all over.  But as far as they're concerned or some are concerned.  As far as they know, as some know, as far as they see from TV, this is how it works.  They rule the man.  The man is weak.  The woman is strong.  Bliss.  Number six, fewer and fewer women truly love themselves.  Lots of reasons for this.  Here's one.  Absent fathers is a big one.  The one man in their life that was supposed to be there to show them love and teach them love wasn't there.  They're going to be desperate to find someone to fill that void.  They don't know how to do it.  They didn't have a man and wife, a mom and dad who showed them the child, the woman, the girl, how to love each other, what that even means, what that even takes.  Now you add that with a false sense of beauty and a false sense of value.  I think that women kind of know that their value and their beauty is not as high as they are taught it to be.  And it's a crush.  It's a crush to them, but they can't, they refuse to come to terms with it until they do come to terms with it, because I think a lot of women do.  But until then, they're not able to give solid love or receive solid love.  For anyone watching this, there is not one man out of you who can gain the favor of a broken woman.  Don't try, please.  Number seven, have you, whether you're a man or a woman, ever asked a woman what she brings to the table?  We need to be asking this of ourselves.  If you're a woman, I'm a woman, I ask myself this.  Ask your female friends, men out there, ask your female friends because they're not asked it enough.  They consider everything about what a man has to do to be worthy of them and they don't do much considering what they bring to the table.  And I think if more women actually thought about some of these things and asked each other the question, then things would start to move.  things would actually change.  And my last one, my last one that I have is men and women are allowing some women to think and be like this.  Too many men are allowing these women to think like this and act like it around them.  I would like men to up their standards of who they'll sleep with.  I want men to respect their dick a little more and don't enter an unworthy person.  Be stuck up if you have to.  I don't care.  Question your female friends about what they bring to the table.  Start a woman's group where you learn from each other about femininity, not how to compete with men.  Not a woman's group, a woman's goddess group that competes with men.  Go back to ancient old school feminism.  No, I'm sorry, feminist.  Go back to old school feminine nature.  Tap into that.  Tap into it.  I said I wasn't going to offer any solutions.  I guess that is the only solution that I have.  Start asking that question.  What value do you bring?  They'll be offended.  Fine.  They'll think about it.  And once we start getting people, women, to think more deeply about who they are and what they offer and what... what their value would bring to a man and how that value could be matched.  Then we'll start creating some healthy, beautiful women in relationships and it'll be really great for everyone.  That's my call to action.  Ask that question.  Here's another call to action.  Who's going to the men's 21 convention?  You know who's going to the men's convention?  I am.  I'm a girl, but I'm a girl.  So I would love to meet you.  I would love to meet the people that interested in my message.  I don't even think you have to agree but if you're interested I think this I think this convention is going to be awesome.  it's this October like soon right the first through the fourth.  okay so you should go.  there's what.  I haven't have links in the description so you can just click on it and then you can get your ticket.  It could be so fun.  Okay, everyone, that's it.  Have a grand old day and I'll see you next week.  Okay.  All right.  Bye. ",
