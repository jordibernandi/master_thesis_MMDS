He was pressed on whether or not there's anything that reporters should know about his health.  And he said, of course not.  So we have continued to push his office with questions about if there's anything they want to clarify, if they can provide any explanation for what's going on with those bruises and those bandages.  that we have seen on his hands and they said there's nothing further that they plan to add.  we should also note that it's been a busy week like you said on capitol hill and it's going to be a very busy weekend.  there's a procedural vote on sunday to move forward with the supreme court nominee amy coney barrett.  then the final vote will be on monday and we should note that we have seen mcconnell regularly coming to and from senate lunches into the capitol.  we have seen him giving speeches on the senate floor so he's very much up here on capitol hill.  but but of course continued questions from reporters over what is going on with those bruises and those bandages.

            "text": "All right.  Well, you know, there's other people.  that was quite concerned, Mitch.  You know, I don't you know, I know you upset.  You don't want your business in the street, but I have to do what I have to do.  So let me refresh that and we'll leave that right there.  I'm going to play that again a little bit later, my real family.  And so let's see.  So, Mitch.  Not only is your hands look all fucked up, but what's going on with your bottom and upper lip?  You know?  Now, based on my research here, my royal family, you know, I wanted to know what causes the hands to look all busted and battered and bruised.  And so they say skin becomes thinner and more fragile as people age, which makes it more susceptible to injuries.  Bruising can happen so easily that a person may not remember how the wound occurred.  And, you know, maybe he don't know.  That's why he's saying ain't nothing wrong.  And I'm going to reveal all of that.  Just be patient.  So let's see right here.  With the skin injuries occurred more easily and also might take longer to heal.  Thinning skin is more likely to show up in areas with sun exposure.  Oh my goodness.  Are you trying to tan, Mitch?  You a lost cause.  Let's see here.  So like the hands and arms, while the skin changes naturally with AIDS, using sun protection like sunscreen helps protect the skin over the years.  In latter years, if skin become hurt more easily, protect it with moisturizers and by preventing bumps and scrapes.  Now we know Lisa Cabrera, that's her genre over there covering the sun news.  And... you know they are banding um i know for sure in hawaii sunscreen and they saying that stuff is not good overall to put on.  you you know.  so just make you just wonder.  you know and i've been just like researching throughout.  and um one reporter literally said earlier this week Or maybe even last week, they didn't see his hands like that.  Then bam, he pop out like that.  Yeah, anybody would be like, what's really going on with you?  I'm going to get there, my royal family.  So now there's some issues with the lips.  Now they're seeing here a bruise from on or both lips following an injury.  Following an injury.  This can cause your lips to be partially or entirely purple or black.  Dry, cracked, and severely damaged lips, including burns, can also turn lips dark.  So there's a combination of things going on.  Now, Mitch is in his late 70s.  And this thinning of the skin usually happens to the coccozoid race.  But we are looking at my royal family and we will continue to see, even though I'm bantering and joking, I'm serious as I speak.  We know that Mitch is pure ass evil to the core.  He lives to be evil.  You know.  And he's working overtime to get one of these supremacists on that bench.  So he just got evil overall.  So you see where I'm coming from when I said I have never ever in my life seen instant karma like this ever.  Ever since we have came up out of our captivity.  And this sucker is trying to damage as much as he can before he's six feet under.  One of his own just said that little snippet that I showed y'all, he looked like he's decomposing before our eyes.  So him having, it's obvious that he has health issues, but he got some other issues on the home front.  And let me show y'all what I'm talking about.  See, y'all remember back my royal family when we found out that Mitch had busted up, I think his shoulder or his collarbone or something like that.  And they said that he had fell.  And I was like, I don't know about that.  I'm empathic.  I'm picking up some other energy, my royal family.  So I did some deep meditation and eventually i just uh meditated so hard i became the fly on the wall.  so what really happened?  my royal family is um mitch's wife.  do you think she when she met that she was like oh that's gonna be my husband.  see i've been telling the royal family for the longest mitch's wife is a straight ass gangster All right.  And she getting as much money as she can because she going back to where she came from.  Well, Mitch found out about all of that.  you know, a few days ago, and she whooped his ass again.  And not only did he end up on the bottom of the stairs, and he was trying to defend his life with his hands, they came up all battered and bruised, you know, and she got a good one in when she jumped all up in his lip.  It is what it is, Mitch.  You know, I'm letting your family know.  Not the royal family.  Your family know.  The ones that sneak over here and do the thumbs down.  Or, you know, even the supporters.  They may be some of our own.  But they're doomed, too.  Look at that, my royal family.  I'm seeing his hands.  And then his lip.  And then when he speak, he can't speak.  That shit hurt.  I mean, check it out.  Let's go back over here and look, my royal family, I'm not playing.  Let's reanalyze this shit.  Let me blow this up.  Put a little sound on it.  All righty. ",

            "text": "Okay, I'm going to go back again.  Okay, listen to how he speak.  Got a little lisp there, you know, because, you know, if he just opened his mouth all together, you know, ah, ooh-wee.  So let's listen again.  Signature accomplishment in our effort to put on the courts, the federal courts, men and women who believe in a quaint notion that may be the job of the judge.  All right.  It speaks for itself, Mitch.  Really?  Let me take this down, my royal family.  I don't want no pop-ups.  So, you know, Mitch, why are you looking like that?  Oh, well, my royal family.  Mitch is letting me know not only is his lip busted and hands and all that, he got bruises all over his pale ass body.  She whooped his ass because not only not only.  Oh, Lord.  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and tell it.  See, Mitch ain't satisfying her.  You know, see, as a woman get older, sexually, she starts to reach her peaky even more because she learned and discovered things about her body.  Keep that real brief.  So Mitch been taking that pill and ain't nothing kicking in.  See, it's more than a notion of taking that pill, Mitch.  Some men have been impotent.  years and they just think oh bam I take that pill and you know it'll kick in yours don't work like that.  and she pissed so you're not fulfilling any of her needs.  and she ready to get up out of here.  now Mitch what I would tell you?  you could pull rank you know and see if she is truly you know, supposed to even be in this country?  Hint, hint.  You know, you can deport her ass.  You got that type of power.  And then you gonna be walking all around with your lip busted, you know, head hung low and all of that.  Because when it go that far and she don't mind you even being out in the public looking like that, Mitch, you got problems.  Are you scared to go home, Mitch?  Are you really scared?  I know I would be, Mitch, ending up on the bottom of some stairs.  I don't see nobody there for your rescue.  Where is your wife at?  Is she way above you?  And she's just looking down and say, lay your ass there.  I'll tend to you whenever I get ready to tend to you.  Because you don't serve no purpose around here.  Your gravy train about to run out anyway.  Old, cantankerous, about to drop dead.  Can't wait to do evil.  You would think somebody that would be this age would be chilling and burning up in the sun.  No.  He is driven, my royal family.  He is burning.  pure ass evil.  he is driven in more of this to come.  i know some people saying true royal Are you talking out your head?  No, not at all.  I'm speaking core in what I'm perceiving with my spiritual eyes and overall being.  All right.  Now, the last thing I want to add as I close out, there can also be a possibility that, um, o'connell got rona.  rona could have showed up in his life because remember when we all been you know we still learning a lot about rona that some people's feet and hand i think feet and hands and face literally turned black.  it could be that my royal family it could be but i'm pretty sure that it was really what.  what that that that ass kicking of the century that he got in the middle of the week you know.  and um He's so driven, he don't want to miss nothing.  He want to make sure he leave his mark on America.  And your wife is making sure she leave a mark on your dusty, evil ass.  So, Mitch, it is what it is.  I done.  put your business in the street and the royal family.  Do what you do best.  Render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I shake. ",
