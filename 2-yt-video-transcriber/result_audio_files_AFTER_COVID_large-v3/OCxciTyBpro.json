So the videos that we're going to show you, they're pretty short, so it's going to be just one sort of continuous thing here.  So the first one happens on December 26th, so we're going to stop the steel style things.  And then the next one is going to happen on January 8th, which is after the insurrection shit.  So this guy's name is Steve K or something, C-E-H, I don't know.  Steve Kerr.  I don't know.  Anyway, I was watching a little bit of this and I was like, I got to stop.  These are too good.  I got to show chat.  So this guy is obviously he's a Trump guy.  He's a. he's a. He's the white guy with the sunglasses and the hat doing a car video.  Yeah, I mean, he's like literally a meme.
