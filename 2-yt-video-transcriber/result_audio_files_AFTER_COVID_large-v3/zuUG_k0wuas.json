            "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to a new sex toy review.  Today's product is the 11-pound pussy-ass male masturbator, life-size sex doll, realistic version vagina, and anal stroker for men masturbation.  Fondlove plump butt adult sex toys with two hole for man orgasm by Fondlove.  All right, I had to move the camera.  It wasn't even in frame.  This is the 11-pound pussy-ass male masturbator, life-size sex doll, realistic virgin vagina, anal stroker for men, masturbation, fond love, blunt butt, adult sex doll, the dual for men, orgasm.  My fond love.  Okay, so this is a... It's not flat on one side, so it's got a nice big booty on one side, and then it's got the vagina... and all that good stuff.  Very realistic.  It's 11 pounds.  It's actually really good.  Now, it says it's life size.  You may wonder what that means.  So let me show you a toy I reviewed recently that wasn't life size.  So let me see if I can make room for both.  So this is a smaller, this is what I would call a hobbit torso.  Or like these little, look, these things are fine.  They pair well with like body pillows because the image on the body pillow is smaller than the pillow itself, which itself isn't life size.  Like body pillows only come in about five feet tall.  So a five foot body pillow with a smaller image on the pillow, if you want a toy to match up with that image, you're probably going to want to go with a smaller toy like this.  And there's nothing wrong with it.  Like here, let me, I'll do a, try to do a side by side.  So here's the life-size booty, and then here's the mini booty.  And they're just not comparable.  So here's the thing.  These mini booties are fine if you're into that sort of thing, but they're just too small.  Look at this.  You try to grab the butt, you're grabbing the entire butt and your fingers are fencing.  There's just not enough butt there.  Anyway, so these are the small ones that I've reviewed in the past.  I just want to do kind of a side-by-side comparison to the life-size one.  All right, so here in the life-size one, look, you can grab the ass.  You grab that booty, and you can spread it.  Actually, speaking of spreading it, you can see the holes right here.  You got the butthole.  You got the vagina hole.  It's a very soft material and that's going to be very important when I explain how to clean it.  But the important thing is that this is life-size.  And it's not too heavy.  It's only 11 pounds, which isn't bad at all.  I mean, it has some weight to it.  It's not like an inflatable doll, which is probably good.  It has a nice, decent weight to it.  Alright, so I have a... Where'd my measuring tape go?  Here we go.  Alright, you can see that it's about 9 inches.  So it's about 9 inches from like one part of the butt to the other.  And Celestina's booty is about 10 inches.  So here's the diameter of Celestina's booty.  It's about 10 inches.  10-11 inches.  So we're talking about like this much wider for Celestina.  Now Celestina is very skinny.  She doesn't have like a badonkadonk or anything.  But this is under $100.  So when you're talking a sub-$100 life-size doll, I don't know if you could do better than this.  It's only off by an inch.  Again, this is about 9 inches wide.  Celestina's ass is about 10 inches wide.  But again, you're only off by an inch.  Okay, so this is Celestina's... I don't know what else to call it.  Her crotch.  So this is my waifu's crotch.  And if you put the toy over it.  Let me see if that's in frame.  Yeah.  Put the toy over it.  You can see that it's a little small.  We're talking like maybe an inch.  But it's a pretty good comparison one for one.  For an actual life size.  Not a skinny life size.  But still a life size doll.  Alright, so here is Celestina's butt.  Now you can see here I took in the slack from the jewelry belt.  It was just a little bit too long, it was droopy, so I just took in some slack with a safety pin.  That's neither here nor there.  Here's her butt.  And here is the butt from the toy.  And again, you can see it's a pretty good approximation.  It's slightly skinnier by like an inch.  But that's about it.  It's a good approximation, actually.  When I do a squeeze test, Celestina's ass cheeks are a bit firmer.  Not by much, but they are a bit firmer.  They're noticeably firmer than the toy.  So when I squeeze the ass cheek of the toy, it's a little bit more squishy.  Celestina's ass cheeks are a little bit more firm.  But there you go.  As far as how did it feel, it felt great.  It felt totally realistic.  And also, just as an aside, Cowgirl with Celestina doesn't really work.  I'd have to bend her legs, kind of have her straddle me, and it would just be really awkward.  And the other problem is she'd be bumping into stuff.  And that doesn't work with VR.  Let's say you want to use a doll with VR, like a realistic doll, not like a blow-up doll.  A full-size sex doll with arms and legs and a head and everything while you're wearing a headset isn't really going to work.  She's probably going to be banging into stuff.  Her legs and arms are going to bump into stuff.  It's not very ideal.  This is probably ideal for VR.  It's a totally realistic experience.  You know, when you're grabbing her booty while she's riding you.  And also, when you're using VR and sitting at your desk... It's perfect for cowgirl.  So you have a nice cowgirl-style, you know, booty and vagina.  You can have her ride you while you sit in your chair.  And then, you know, she's not bumping into stuff.  You don't have to worry about any legs.  You have to bend and get out of the way.  You don't have to get, like, a 70-pound doll into a certain position.  You have effectively an 11-pound vagina and ass.  And because it's not mini... It feels real.  It doesn't feel awkward while you're like trying to grab this like tiny butt.  Like this is a life-size butt.  It's a skinny girl's life-size butt.  So if you're not into skinny girls, maybe this isn't the toy for you.  But I don't even think they make like big old thick booties that, you know, like they would be like $200 just because of the size.  I'm actually glad because they actually haven't been selling life-size versions of these for a while.  They've been trying to sell the smaller ones.  I guess, look, the thing about the smaller ones is they cost less.  They cost less.  They weigh less.  They're good if you're price conscious, but if you're looking for an authentic experience, you need something life-size.  Now, does this compare to, like, a toy like the spinning robot pussy?  Not really in terms of, like, you know, the sensation and the friction.  However, this does feel real.  And so if you have a doll, if you have a waifu, and you've had missionary and you've done all that stuff, but you miss cowgirl, you miss her riding you, and maybe you have some VR, or you don't have a doll at all, you just have VR, and you're looking for a doll that pairs well with VR, I highly recommend this.  And the fact that it's under $100 is really good.  Usually these types of life-size toys cost a couple hundred dollars.  So the fact that this is less than $100, it's only left $71, and I have a 15% off coupon code.  So with the coupon code, it's only about 70 bucks normally.  Now you're knocking another 15% off, so it's a really good deal.  All right, let's talk about cleaning.  So because this is a very soft kind of TPE, like you can see how jiggly and soft it is, the way I clean this out is I use flushable wipes.  And this is a little graphic, but I mean, it's a sex toy review.  You can see like her pussy and everything.  So I think we're all adults here.  So if this gets a little graphic for you, I apologize.  But the way that I clean this toy out, there's different ways you can clean out like a fixed vagina or a toy like this.  You could like take a douche bottle and spray water and then let it draw out.  Here's what I do.  Take a flushable wipe, stick your fingers in, and just, like, wipe that shit out.  That doesn't work with, like, silicone dolls or even TPE dolls.  The TPE isn't soft.  But this is a very soft blend of TPE.  So, look, I could, like, stretch this shit out.  So, you just take a flushable wipe.  I use two fingers.  And I just stick it in there with the flushable wipe.  And just, like, kind of just swipe the cum out.  And then I take the flushable wipe out, throw it away.  I do that about two or three times.  On the third time, this is where it gets a little graphic.  This is gonna be a little weird, so just come on a journey with me.  After the third flushable wipe, after you've wiped out the cum three times with three different flushable wipes, give the flushable wipe a sniff.  and just see if it still smells like cum.  If there's still cum in there and the flushable wipe still smells like bleach, then flush that one and use a fourth one.  And you want to basically wipe this out until the wipe no longer smells like cum.  That's when you know you got everything.  Is it 100%?  Probably not.  There might be better ways to do this, but I find that just fingering the pussy with a flushable wipe and just wiping everything out, assuming the material is soft enough to handle that, like if the material was too firm, like if I could barely get like a finger or two in, then I'd probably have to do something else, like get a sponge on a stick or something.  But this is very stretchy.  Look how stretchy that is.  So because this is so stretchy, I can easily just get my fingers in there with a wipe and just wipe everything out.  Um, so there's that.  It's look, and actually let me see if I can show you the texture.  The texture is very realistic.  It has an extremely realistic texture, so it feels real.  If you're looking for an authentic experience, this is really good.  Cleanup isn't that hard because it's so flexible.  You can basically stretch it open, get like a flushable wipe or a baby wipe.  I noticed that the flushable wipes leave less lint.  That's why I prefer flushable wipes to baby wipes.  But either one should work.  Anyway, so that's how you clean it out.  Just wipe it out and then make sure you got all the cum.  You can stuff a microfiber rag into the hole to dry it out, just like you would with a doll.  So the cleanup isn't as hard as it probably would be because of the softness of the material.  And the only thing that's kind of weird is... She has a very soft booty, which is softer than Celestina's.  Celestina's booty is a little bit firmer, so that's kind of weird.  It feels like this should be like a fat badonkadonk butt, but it's a skinny girl's butt, but it feels like a fat girl's butt.  Does that make sense?  It's because of the softness of the material.  If they went with a firmer TPE blend, then the butt would feel more like a skinny girl's butt.  The problem with that is they did with the firmer material, then it would be a bitch to clean.  So I think all things considered, this is a great toy.  It gets the job done, as it were.  And if you've missed cowgirl, like I have, this is a really good toy to invest in.  It's less than a hundred dollars.  So you really can't go wrong.  Um, I think for the price and let me look at the detail, look at the detail like that, that looks legit.  That's a legit vagina.  It's even got the color and everything.  So good detail, good material, good sculpt, excellent price.  It gets the job done.  It's life-size.  You're not going to get all weirded out like you're fucking a fairy or a garden gnome.  So highly recommend this product, especially for the price.  This is an excellent price.  I can't even say that enough.  Plus, not only is it normally about $70, save an additional 15% off with the coupon code.  So you really can't go wrong with this toy.  If you don't have room for a full-size doll, and you're thinking about maybe going with a VR alternative, or if you're not into... 3D girls, if you like 2D girls and you prefer VR, this is an excellent toy to get.  It pairs very, very well with VR.  Just put the VR headset over your eyes and then, you know, kind of slouch down in your chair and then have this, use this to have it like ride you, cowgirl style.  And while you're, you know, watching your hentai or while you're playing Honey Select or Koi Katsu, whatever you're doing, This pairs extremely well with VR.  So, probably one of the best toys in a while in terms of, like, my highest recommendation.  I'm actually probably going to use this.  Like, this is the thing.  The highest praise I can give a sex toy is if I'm going to keep using it after the review.  Once I've reviewed it, if this is going into my rotation of sex toys that I actually plan on using, that's probably the highest praise I can give to a sex toy.  And this is definitely going into my rotation.  I still enjoy Celestina, but because she can't do Cowgirl, I have Miss Cowgirl.  And this allows me to have Cowgirl again.  And because it's about the same size... ",
