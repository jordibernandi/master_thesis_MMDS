            "text": "What do you know about the American Civil War?  Just saying these words, the Civil War, probably brings some familiar images to mind.  Northern soldiers in Union blue marching against Southern troops in Confederate gray.  Epic battles at Shiloh and Gettysburg.  Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the end of slavery.  The victory of the Union over the Confederacy.  But there's something else you should know about that era, something that ties these events together and that you probably didn't learn in school.  The Civil War was also America's greatest left-wing revolution.  Here's how.  In the early 19th century, African slavery was the foundation of social and economic life in the American South.  Millions of black workers were owned as property by wealthy planters who denied them education, controlled their family lives, and reaped the fruits of their labor.  This system was wildly profitable, and the wealth it produced allowed a tiny elite to dominate southern and national politics.  And before the Civil War, it was expanding all across the Western Hemisphere.  In 1860, between the United States, Brazil, and Cuba, there were more enslaved people than ever before.  For years, a small group of American abolitionists had denounced slavery as an abomination.  These radical activists were scorned by much of society and ignored by both the two mainstream political parties.  But in the 1850s, as slaveholders tried to extend slavery across the West, their opponents made a breakthrough.  The old two-party system melted down, and the new Republican Party won massive Northern support by opposing slavery's expansion, while putting bondage itself on a road to ultimate extinction.  The abolitionists broke through, in part, because they named the slave power as the oppressive ruling class that it was.  They pointed out that slaveholders were just 1% of the population, but somehow controlled every branch of government.  They argued that black bondage was not just morally wrong, but a threat to free labor everywhere.  The struggle between anti-slavery and slavery, said Abraham Lincoln, was part of the eternal struggle between the common right of humanity and the divine right of kings.  The same spirit that says, you toil and work and earn bread and I'll eat it.  It was the common worker, black or white, against the rich.  These populous assaults on the ruling class helped Lincoln's party win the election of 1860.  Contemporaries called it a political revolution.  Its threat to slaveholders was so serious that they formed their own separate republic, the Confederate States of America.  In the Civil War that followed, the stakes were clear.  The Union fought against human bondage, for a democratic majority, and for the dignity of all labor.  The Confederacy fought to preserve bondage and elite rule.  Confederates fought, as Lincoln told Congress in 1862, to put capital, that's wealth measured in human beings, above labor in the structure of government.  Enslaved laborers understood these stakes.  Hundreds of thousands fled to Union lines even before emancipation was proclaimed.  Radical abolitionists knew it too.  Frederick Douglass barnstormed the country, rousing black men to enlist in the Union army.  By war's end, around 200,000 black soldiers and sailors had taken up arms to crush the rebellion.  The cause of the Union was the cause of the international left.  While conservative aristocrats and capitalists in Europe sympathized with the Confederacy, radicals and labor organizations supported the Union.  In 1864, a German journalist named Karl Marx declared that the American anti-slavery war would launch a new era of ascendancy for the working class.  Emancipation, as Marx understood, was not a middle-class reform project.  It was a true social revolution.  Only in the United States and in Haiti was emancipation sudden, uncompensated, and enforced by former slaves themselves.  That revolution remains incomplete.  After the war, former slaves and radical Republicans were defeated by what the scholar W.E.B.  Du Bois calls a counterrevolution of property, led by former slaveholders and conservative businessmen.  Under the terror of Jim Crow segregation, many of the Civil War's victories for labor and for democracy were rolled back, but not all.  The destruction of American chattel slavery was a historic and enduring victory.  It meant that black Southerners were able to create the schools and the churches that seeded their later fight against Jim Crow.  It radically expanded American democracy and made the modern labor and civil rights movements possible.  The Civil War was America's greatest left-wing revolution.  Even now, its work remains unfinished.  But every left-wing struggle\u2014for the rule of democratic majorities, for the rights of labor over property, and for meaningful freedom and equality\u2014can claim its legacy.
