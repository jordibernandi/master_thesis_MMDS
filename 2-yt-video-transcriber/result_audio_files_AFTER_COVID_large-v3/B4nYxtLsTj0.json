So they realize, oh, wow, this has been a false economy the whole time.  We need to switch to pale malt.  But pale malt couldn't brew a dark enough beer to disguise the disgusting flavor of London water.  And pale malt had only recently become possible because of the invention of coking coal, right?  And coking coal is coal that's been baked, essentially, which lets it really do a smokeless flame.  It's mostly used in steel production, but it's also useful for... If you don't want to impart a smoky flavor into the beer you're brewing, right?  And it lets you control the flame and control the malting process.  So if you brewed with pale malt, you couldn't disguise the flavor of disgusting London water.  You couldn't get the right flavors, either.  You couldn't get the right color, of course.  So, the brewers tried a few things to start out with, to make these beers cheaper, right?  They started adulterating the beer with all kinds of stuff, right?  So, molasses, brown sugar, licorice, okay, whatever, right?  Uh-huh.  And they also tried ferrous sulfate, cocculus indicus, which is a kind of poisonous berry, sulfuric acid... ",

No, so none of this worked well and it sort of reduced the public's opinion of porter, which is gonna be important in a bit, but a guy named Daniel Wheeler had an idea.  Rather than using brown malt for the whole beer, what if you deeply roasted some of the malt to a very dark color?  and then add it to the pale malt, right?  So he came up with what was called patent malt, which is what you're seeing here.  You can see it's a much darker color than the malt we've looked at earlier.  Wheeler's patent malt came out in 1817, and you could use a very small amount of this in addition to pale malt.  And that's like less than 3% of the mash bill.
