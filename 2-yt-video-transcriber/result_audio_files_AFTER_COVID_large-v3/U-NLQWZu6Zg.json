            "text": "A recent wave of anti-Semitic attacks.  Hate crimes in the U.S.  jumped again.  The El Paso attack was the deadliest at the hands of a white supremacist in half a century.  The suspect punching, kicking, and stomping on a Muslim teenager.  One of the largest upticks in the history of hate crime reporting.  I'm very fearful for my life.  There's no place for violence.  There is no justification whatsoever for violence.  We have to stand against violence in every form it takes.  Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.  The suspect yelled the word flop as he hit the East African man.  Part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.  More than 50 criminal cases where Donald Trump was explicitly invoked in relation to violent acts.  Knock the crap out of him, would you?  This is for Trump.  This is an invasion.  When you see these caravans, that's an invasion.  A racist manifesto posted online before the shooting claimed this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.  The president and his words appearing in scores of police reports and courtrooms.  The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly I have ever seen. ",
