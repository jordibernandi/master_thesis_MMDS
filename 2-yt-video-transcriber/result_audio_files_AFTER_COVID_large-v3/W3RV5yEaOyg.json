And it's because when protesters were outside of the White House, he fled as far underground as possible to the bunker.  Or did he?  Because he wants you to now believe that that's not actually what happened.  It was all just a coincidence that he was in the bunker.  What could you tell me Sunday night was like for you and your family? ",

There was no problem during the day.  The problem I saw Leland got.  Whacked pretty good, but that was during the night.  And this problem, these problems are during the night, not during the day.  And I go down, I've gone down two or three times, all for inspection.  And you go there, someday you may need it, but you go there and I went down... I looked at it.  It was during the day.  It was not a problem.  And I read about it like a big thing.  There was never a problem.  We never had a problem.  Nobody ever came close to giving us a problem. ",

It was just a coincidence.  I needed to inspect the bunker.  After all, I've done it.  He goes on to say, I've inspected the bunker two and a half times as president.  Okay, you've been president for three and a half years.  So on average, you do it not even once a year.  You just happened to inspect it on the day of the protest.  That is a mighty fine coincidence for you, bunker boy. ",

So for the half a time you went, how short was it?  the time, so a half of a tiny amount of time to inspect.  What did you inspect?  What did you check out to make sure that the Berber carpet was clean?  What are you inspecting about this bunker? ",

It's not like he goes in if he likes the decor.  He's not going to, it's not gold.  He has to go in there if it's an actual threat.  It's just, it's such BS.  And look, I understand, does this matter?  No, the nicknames don't matter.  None of it matters.  Substantively, the issue is that he has no interest in bringing people together and he has no interest in any sort of reform because he is an authoritarian.  and authoritarians don't constrain the power of the police state, obviously, that's the thing.  But if this can get through to one red hat wearer that thinks this guy is some sort of alpha or tough guy, he ran to the bunker when there was no threat to him whatsoever.  The same guy who had bone spurs during Vietnam, who told you that if he was outside of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, he would have run in even without a gun.  He would have run in to take down the shooter.  He doesn't walk over to protesters with guitars because of how scared he is.  He flees the bunker even for that.  And so substantively, does this matter?  Perhaps not.  But if you still follow this guy, and if you follow him out of some belief that he's tough or strong or what this country needs, this is who he is.  He's good and soft. ",

And so one of the reasons, one of the driving factors behind his assault march on protesters and journalists in D.C.  for his photo op, half the reason was he was tired and annoyed with the negative coverage of the Bunker Boy and all those hashtags that went for him running and hiding in his bunker.  That was part of his motivation.  He's like, I got to show them I'm a tough guy.  That was it.  He didn't like the negative coverage of what had happened.  So now he's still stuck on it.  This guy is absolutely obsessed with his image not being seen as a weakling because he is a weakling.  It's just how it works.  And number two, the folks that are jumping on my tweets talking about, oh yeah, you know, the Secret Service makes these decisions.  It's not Trump's decision.  Stop saying it's on him.  You know what he said during that interview?  Kill me to ask him.  He goes, so did the Secret Service whisk you away and just listen to them?  He goes, no, I do what I want.  Secret Service can suggest what they want, but that wasn't what happened.  I didn't listen to them.  So next time you tell me that I don't know how it works and that Trump actually had to get whisked away by Secret Service because that's the professionals behind him, listen to what he said.  It happened 100% of the time.  Anyone who defends him He comes up with some BS excuse for why he's doing what he's doing.  He blows up your excuse right there because he doesn't have any excuses.  He shoots himself in the foot, and you guys lie down on top of his feet to take the bullet in the back. ",
