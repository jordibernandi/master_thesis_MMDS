            "text": "Hey guys, welcome to the Liberal Hivemind, a channel solely focused on exposing the abundant hypocrisy of the left.  Well, he finally said it, guys.  He finally addressed the concerns and the theories that have been going on for probably over a month at this point.  Joe Rogan and his, I guess, battle with Spotify.  And while Joe clearly wants to keep it out of the spotlight and probably doesn't want to tell you how he really feels, you can tell just from what he's saying that behind the scenes or under the surface, he's pissed.  Now, Joe Rogan isn't the extremist that liberals like to paint him as.  He's actually... very moderate, probably more left-wing than he is right-wing.  But what he is, unequivocally, is an advocate for the First Amendment and free speech, freedom of expression.  And of course, that's why the left absolutely hates him.  Because he respects other people's opinions instead of trying to shove his thoughts or his beliefs down your throat.  And that's what gets him in trouble with the left.  That's why he's being censored.  Because he's willing to have discussions with people that he may disagree with and get to the bottom of things.  He wants to hear a different perspective and have a dialogue.  And of course, you know how dangerous that is to the cult-like dogma of the rabid radical left.  Dissenting opinions are not allowed.  Discussion is not allowed.  It's my way or the highway.  Do as I say, but not as I do.  We are at a turning point in society.  Are we going to bend over and submit to the radical left?  Are we going to let them limit free speech, limit what can and can't be said, based on their rulebook that changes every second day and is implemented and enforced by tech oligarchs?  Are we going to succumb to the tech overlords of the 21st century, or are we going to take the power back?  The power back to just speak about things, regardless of whether they're controversial or not.  Speaking is not a crime.  Entertaining an idea, even less benign, is not a crime.  But the left is trying as hard as they can to turn them into thought crimes.  Ladies and gentlemen, you are living in an Orwellian dystopia waiting to happen.  That is not hyperbole.  It is a mere fact.  So we gotta get into all of this.  We gotta cover this whole Joe Rogan thing.  And I just gotta talk about it.  Give my opinion.  And frankly, say what I think just needs to be said.  So we're going to get into all of it, but before we do, please make sure to leave a like, a comment, subscribe, hit the notification bell to be notified every single time I post a new video, since that's by far the best thing you can do to support the channel.  And of course, us here from the Liberal Hive Mind, we're wishing the President well in his recovery from the COVID virus.  Our thoughts and prayers go straight to the White House, and of course, the Walter Reed Military Hospital.  Now with that out of the way... Let's roll the tape.  Okay, so before we get into what Joe Rogan said, let's cover the backstory.  Check this out.  Spotify employees threaten strike and protests if Joe Rogan podcast isn't censored.  report.  I mean, just think about the backwards world that we're living in.  People in authoritarian regimes across the world are fighting for less censorship.  They're fighting for freedoms that we seemingly take granted in the Western world.  Meanwhile, bourgeoisie liberals are fighting for... But of course, Yuri said it best himself.  These so-called liberals, these modern Marxists, will not realize the error of their ways until a soldier's boot is on their neck.  And look at this right over here.  Spotify employees were demanding direct editorial oversight over the recently acquired Joe Rogan Experience podcast.  That would include the ability to directly edit or remove sections of upcoming interviews or block the uploading of episodes deemed problematic.  The employees also demanded the ability to add trigger warnings, corrections, and references to fact-checked articles on topics discussed by Rogan in the course of his multi-hour discussions.  Wow.  The thought police are in full effect.  I frankly find it patronizing.  I mean, we're all adults here.  I'm not offended by speech no matter what somebody says.  Yet these lefty bozos want to give me a trigger warning or cut out sections that they think will be hurtful to my safety or mental well-being?  Yeah, I don't need that.  i can make my own decisions and i have free will and the ability to just not listen to something that i don't want to listen to.  we don't need social studies majors dictating what is appropriate and what is not or what is problematic and what is acceptable.  this is a joke we'll fast forward to today and joe rogan finally addresses the controversy.  joe rogan responds to claims that spotify is censoring him and take a listen to some of the things that he had to say.

            "text": "they have literally said nothing to me about it.  zero right it's never come up.  Now, is there someone at Spotify that's complaining about the Abigail Schreier episode?  I'm sure.  But if you say that I can't talk about something when a woman wrote a whole book and researched it deeply and is talking about not just these children themselves that have... grown up and then gotten out of school and then realized they've made a horrible mistake and it's irreversible.  That's the name of the book, Irreversible Damage.  We can't discuss this.  It's not transphobic to say that some people will regret transitioning.  It's just a part of being a person.  Because I'm saying it?  because this is a podcast.  And if you have a problem with people saying terrible shit, you work for Spotify, maybe you should listen to some of the lyrics.  Because some of the lyrics and some of the music that you guys play over and over and over again makes my shit. ",

            "text": "And so you see he's trying to be as respectful and decent as possible to the company because they did take him in and they have treated him well at least for the most part.  But you can tell he's planting a message and he's not exactly ecstatic over the fact that some of his episodes are just missing.  Here are some of the names, some of the people that Joe had on his podcast that were left off the platform.  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, Owen Benjamin, Stephen Molyneux, and Charles C. Johnson.  All of which you would say are probably on the right side of politics.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Goes against the leftist dogma.  Therefore, it's not allowed.  They must be deplatformed and depersoned.  I've watched every single one of those shows.  And you know what?  Frankly, I disagree with some of the things that they said.  Controversial?  Sure.  There's some lefties that are controversial as well, but we don't see the same type of censorship.  And whether or not you disagree or agree with some of the views that these people are making on his show, or that these people represent, this notion of censoring them is absolutely ridiculous.  Not only is it ridiculous, but it's naive.  Pretending something or someone doesn't exist doesn't make that thing... or person go away.  And frankly, there's probably the forbidden fruit element that makes it even more desirable and makes it grow even further.  This is America.  You have the right to be wrong.  You have the right to have a quote, wrong opinion.  How are we supposed to get to the bottom of things if we can't even have a discussion?  How are we supposed to change people's minds if we can't even entertain their ideas?  It's the same approach that lefties take when it comes to, let's say, white supremacy.  I disavow it, absolutely.  I am on the same side as lefties when it comes to finding these types of people absolutely disgusting.  But my approach is completely different.  I would rather have a discussion with them, bridge the gap, and try to show them a different way of thinking than ostracize, demonize, and deperson them from society.  I think that's, frankly, much more productive.  And, you know, we're getting to a point where people are trying to deplatform and deperson people with just wrong opinions.  You know, it's kind of like give them an inch and they'll take a mile.  There's certain people, egregious offenders, people with absolutely terribly irredeemable ideas, sure, that I guess from a bipartisan perspective could be argued should be pushed out of society.  But it's gone beyond that.  It's gotten to a point where lefties want to just de-platform and de-person people who have different political views.  That's craziness.  They're attacking Joe Rogan, who was openly supporting Bernie Sanders during the Democrat nomination process.  Just let that sink in.  The liberal hive mind is a locust swarm descending on anything and everything that combats their narrative.  And it's possibly the most antithetical thing that I could think of to what American freedom and more importantly what American freedom of expression and freedom of speech is all about.  They very often say free speech is not hate speech.  But questioning things... And having a different perspective is not hate speech.  And even in the case of hate speech, because of course it does exist, to say that hate speech doesn't exist would be a flat-out lie.  But hateful speech and hateful rhetoric is something that needs to be addressed with better ideas.  To shove it under a rug and pretend like it doesn't exist is like being diagnosed with some terrible disease and the doctor not telling you because it's going to hurt your feelings.  You need to understand that there's a malignant tumor in your body.  How else are you supposed to address the issue?  How else are you supposed to deploy antibodies?  And in this case, antibodies is just open dialogue, discussion and combating bad ideas with good ideas.  It's a very simple concept.  And Joe Rogan is really the final frontier in that battle.  Everyone else, and even some conservative commentators, have given in to the mob.  And frankly, it's got to stop.  This authoritarian leftist tactic of suppressing discussion is by far the most dangerous concept in Western civilization right now.  And so I'll end this video right here, pretty much like I always do with these videos when we talk about free speech.  Let's use a leftist thought leader against the left.  A quote from Noam Chomsky himself, If we do not believe in freedom of speech for those we despise, we do not believe in it at all.  Something that modern leftist academia has seemingly thrown away a long time ago.  That's what I got for you guys on this one.  Hopefully it wasn't too preachy.  Hopefully you guys understand exactly where I'm coming from.  And if you did, please make sure to leave a like, a comment, subscribe.  Hit the notification bell to be notified every single time I post a new video, since that's by far the best thing you can do to support the channel.  Follow me on Twitter, link's in the description, and check out my Subscribestar, link is also in the description.  We send our best wishes and prayers to the president and his speedy recovery.  But who am I kidding?  He's not going to need it.  The man's an absolute tank.  He's a pitbull.  He's America's pitbull.  And hopefully, he slams the coup virus just like he slams phony leftist narratives every single day.  So it's time for me to get back to cooking up some more content for you guys.  I want to thank you for watching, and I'll see you on the next one. ",
