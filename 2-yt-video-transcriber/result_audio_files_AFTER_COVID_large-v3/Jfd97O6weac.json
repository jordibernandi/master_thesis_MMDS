            "text": "Thank you.  There are many of us who are stuck with having a linear way of thinking when it comes to human history.  In order for us to better understand what is happening today, we have to keep looking at what happened a long time ago, what really happened.  Most people go with the timeline that human beings started off primitive and then over thousands of years slowly developed better, more advanced civilizations and technology.  And this is a reasonable understanding, just not the true one.  The ancient world was a very different place, but it was not a primitive one.  Do you guys remember the twin towers in New York City?  Do you guys remember those towers?  You know, there are many, many videos, photographs, and even paintings of those towers.  But let me ask you something.  Where are the towers?  Where are they?  They no longer exist, right?  Instead, what stands in their place is something else.  But yet we have images and evidence that they existed.  We have eyewitnesses, people who have experienced what happened, the memories.  But see, the evidence we have now will deteriorate over time.  Have any of you ever traveled on a steam engine?  You haven't, right?  That's because they don't make trains that way anymore.  Just like many things we have in this world, they don't make them that way anymore.  and only very few people hold on to what become antiques.  Do you see?  I want you to think about this.  If today's world was buried and it remained buried for decades, centuries, millennia, if you were to start digging up pieces of this world, what do you think you would find?  Is knowledge of the old world beyond our comprehension?  or just hidden.  So when you look at archaeology today, when they present something to the public, whenever someone discovers a pyramid, an old temple, things of that nature, what are they showing you?  A bunch of stone, right?  So what happens is people begin to think that is the way people lived thousands of years ago, like the Flintstones.  They think everyone walked around in long, drab clothing.  Robes, held to the body with ropes, carrying sticks and stones, right?  This is what people think and it is very hard to get that image out of your head because we have indigenous people today who live in a tribal society.  So you think that is how early man lived all around the world.  But see, when it comes to tribes, most people would never think of some of these tribes as cults, would they?  Let me put it to you this way.  Think about the world we live in right now, with all our advancements, documents, records, electronics, vehicles, buildings, facilities, plants, farms, etc.  Now let's say something happens to us.  Let's say there is a great ice age or deluge.  The earth gets flooded again.  Even though we are promised that wouldn't happen again, let's say that it did.  The human race has been wiped out to near extinction and everything else gets buried.  the few humans on earth begin to repopulate and they build homes, towns, cities.  so what happens is they start to dig and they start to dig things up from our old world things close to the surface.  what do you think they would find?  they wouldn't find paper.  they wouldn't find much of any organic material like wood.  they wouldn't find any metal Like the beams of skyscrapers, the windows, the pipes, the glass, even the plastics, all gone.  The earth took it all back.  So the only thing they would find are what?  The remains of sidewalks, some traces of roads.  They would find the stone monuments that we had up all over the place.  There would be no vehicles because all vehicles are composed of these elements that the earth would absorb.  Railroads would be gone and you'd have nothing left but maybe impressions of where track used to be.  Think about skyscrapers.  You'd be left with nothing but the first floor foundation, which would look much like the ruins they find near megalithic structures.  Let me tell you something.  There are coral reefs near Australia that have coral towers under the water that are taller than the Empire State Building.  Folks, do you know how coral grows?  It attaches itself to hard objects.  Yet here, they would have you believe that the coral is just piling on top of itself.  because that's just how some coral grows sometimes.  Cell phones, computers, wires, all gone.  They wouldn't find much of the homes we live in, the remains of some apartment buildings maybe, the concrete foundations of some homes with basements maybe, someone's concrete patio, remains of a mansion with a fountain out front, So all there is left is the foundation of the mansion and the fountain.  People of the future would think, wow, how did they carve such artwork with such primitive tools?  Look at how they lived.  They wouldn't find any of our clothing.  They would have to go based on art, carvings, statues, preserved paintings.  They would think we were a primitive people who didn't have much of anything.  That is what they would think, and they would start to form tales and stories about us.  They would talk about the gods of Mount Rushmore.  They would talk about how we worship the Greek gods because of everything that they would find left behind in Washington, D.C If they dug up Washington,  D.C.,  it would resemble ancient Greece, right?  Maybe with a touch of Egyptian influence.  If the people of the future dug a bit deeper, they would find all the underground bases and tunnels, subway systems.  They would find buried nuclear reactors, the remaining tunnels of particle colliders.  What about satellites?  What about them?  They would eventually all come down, right?  The ISS would have come down.  What would remain of that wreckage?  Think about all the ancient artifacts we have in museums.  They would dig up the same old swords and shields and sarcophagi.  They may find some jewelry.  They would date the artifacts that they found in the ruins of a museum and date that stuff according to the age of the museums.  What about weapons?  They may find remains of some firearms, maybe some missiles or within an old missile silo or buried submarine.  Most of those things they would have to dig deep for.  People of the future would look at us and think all types of things.  They wouldn't find paper money, maybe some coins if they were made of gold and silver, that is.  corrode.  most of our money is electronic anyway.  people of the future would think wow these people were as poor as dirt.  no wonder they had nothing they couldn't afford anything.  are you guys beginning to see how this works?  see if I told you that the world during Enoch and Noah's time period if I told you that their world was much like ours if not more advanced is that really too far fetched?  Look, not many people are concerned with what time was like back then.  Remember, some people do not believe in the biblical narrative, but it doesn't really matter.  The oceans are packed with ruins of old civilizations and they find the craziest things down there.  Now listen, some things do get preserved under certain circumstances.  Do you guys remember the Baltic Sea anomaly?  People were saying, oh, that's a UFO that crashed into the ocean.  It certainly doesn't look natural.  They estimate it to be 14,000 years old or more.  So they definitely ruled out this possibility of it being man-made.  We don't really know what it looks like because most of the images we've seen are artistic renditions.  There is sonar and other scans of this anomaly, including a 3D scan.  It's the same thing with Omanwa.  That's an artist's picture.  We don't know what Omanwa really looks like.  Just like we don't know what every asteroid that flies by us looks like, do we?  The Baltic Sea anomaly, it's not the only anomaly in the area.  And it is actually more of a building than it is a ship.  The question is, what was sitting on top of it?  You hear it all the time.  Man could never have done that.  Why?  Because we can't do it today.  Understand, a lot of the ancient technology was lost.  They haven't uncovered everything.  Much of it is buried deep.  And what they do find, they wouldn't show you.  But some things have leaked or have become declassified.  Many of these places are places you can visit.  They have lied about what these places really look like, however.  Egypt is a great example of this.  That place didn't look like that when they were built.  They put stones back up.  They've refurbished structures and artifacts.  The whole place is lied about.  People lived amongst giants and beasts.  Those paintings in Egypt, those aren't exaggerations.  Those are to scale.  They weren't like, oh, we got to make the king look bigger than everybody.  No, the king was bigger than everybody else.  You know what happened in Egypt?  The exodus?  That wasn't an isolated event.  That was global.  That's why the Hebrews were taken out into the wilderness.  It would be just like if you were to live in a big city like New York, and then the ten plagues hit, right?  You would want to get out of the city.  I mean, how do you find numerous giant sarcophagi with nothing in them?  How does that happen?  Folks, it's not like they found one giant sarcophagus with nothing in it.  They have found several over an extended period of time.  And they're empty.  Who keeps removing the remains of these sarcophagi?  Let me ask you guys a question.  Egypt has had many kings or pharaohs, right?  Where is that throne room with the throne?  You see it all the time in movies.  You see it all the time in paintings and drawings.  I mean, if you had a main palace, you'd think there would be a throne room and maybe a throne or two.  Ever hear of the temple of Abu Simbel?  Just Google that.  And that should give you a better understanding of why I brought up the throne room.  I mean, you have giants sitting on thrones outside.  With little people in between their legs.  It's symbolic.  No, they were literally telling you guys what the ancient kings were like.  And they wouldn't want to be forgotten.  And they would want the world to remember their stature.  Their size.  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if these thrones were there first and the statues were added later.  But you know, oh well.  By the way, the entire structure was cut apart and moved and reconstructed.  Just like the Sphinx.  That's why they look like they were put together in pieces.  Which they don't tell people about anyway.  See, it has a lot to do with lies.  Where have you seen an authentic ancient Egyptian throne that was not a replica?  Show me the room.  Let me ask you guys another question while you are thinking about that.  How does a kingdom like this get buried in the first place?  Where did everybody go?  It wasn't always a desert, so what happened?  What happened to the huge city in the Amazon?  that's all covered in jungle?  There are highways there.  While we're at it, Think about some of those places over there in South and Central America.  They show you these ruins, these megalithic sites.  How come all the settlements are missing their roofs?  It's like the top portion was cut off.  Maybe that's because they found nothing but the foundation.  It would be like knocking down someone's house.  leaving nothing but the basement, right?  Then somebody comes along years later and digs up the ground surrounding the basement, exposing the foundation.  Our leaders want you to depend on them.  If you had clear knowledge of our history, they would lose a lot of that control.  Their system would be broken down and they would, become mere managers of our society instead of owners and rulers.  We would abide by the rules of God set for us to live healthy lives.  There is much more to come, folks.  Stay tuned.  I am working on things every day to bring content to you guys.  I do get backed up quite often, especially this time of year.  But things will continue forward for Woodward TV.  Be sure to visit woodwardentertainment.com.  I do have big plans for the site as it is still in its infancy, and I am working to keep that going and to keep it updated and improving.  Until next time, ladies and gentlemen, as always, stay awake, stay aware, stay safe, and I'll talk to you all soon.  Thank you. ",
