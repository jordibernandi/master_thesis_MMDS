And then, for good measure, draw every single mascot, every single cartoon character, every single logo that you have such vivid memories of from your childhood.

See, you think you have some sort of perfect photographic memory, but for most people, this exercise will prove pretty quickly to them that they actually don't.  That things that they feel vivid memories of, they don't actually have precise memories of.

Well, that's not gonna work, cause Bible Gateway doesn't have William Tyndale's New Testament.  Should've tried BibleHub.  Now, the first full edition of this particular translation was published in 1526.  Tyndale was strangled to death and burned at the stake for it.  You know, the usual.  This was long before the King James Version existed.  That wouldn't come along till 1611.  Now anyway, even though the Catholics did their damnedest to destroy this translation, it still made its mark, both on subsequent translations like the King James, and apparently on the people, as is partially shown by the fact that this version of this phrase is what became common in English.  Now, of course, even if there weren't such an obvious, simple explanation, it still wouldn't be that impressive if people repeated what they heard around.  Not the exact text from some specific translation.  If the Tyndale Bible didn't exist, it could have come from somewhere else.  Some famous sermon, some king spitting out a half-remembered quotation, or just however all the thousands of other random phrases in English get started.  Someone said it that way, a small group of people said it that way, and it just spread organically.  I mean, people are much less likely to go to the source than they are to just follow the crowd.  Anyone who believes what you just said is doing exactly that.  They could have just gone to the source and found out about the Tyndale Bible. ",

Sure, people might not know where it comes from, but that's the case with most phrases.  And most words, and most names, and most everything to do with language.  And with culture.  People don't learn Bible quotes from 16th century Bibles.  Maybe in the 16th century they did, but not now.  People learn Bible quotes from their parents, from their friends, from their pastors, from their... whatever, the internet.  Books.  Movies.

Anyway, this is going to seem kind of abrupt, but I think this is that point I mentioned where I stopped going with you.  Not because of anything you're saying right now, or really because of anything specific you say later, but just because for one thing I feel like I've said everything I really want to say about what you're actually saying, and for another thing because after this point you kind of get off in the weeds a lot.  And that goes on for like another nine or ten minutes.  So now I'm good.  Instead of doing that, I'd like to switch to a video that I found while I was searching for videos about the Mandela Effect to respond to, and this is not one that I think is stupid, it doesn't contain any claims I need to dispute, it doesn't deserve mockery.  Now instead, what I want to look at is a sad consequence of leading people to believe in and invest themselves heavily in conspiracy theories that are so outlandish.  That's always a good way to get people coming back, right?  Bring everybody's mood down right at the end?  It's never worked for me, so might as well try it again.  But before I get to that, I have a few closing words about this video.  However perfect you wish your brain was, it's just a fact of life that your memory can and will betray you.  Cultural and social and other influences will change.  some of your memories that you swear are true.  Even just recalling the memories will do that, as your brain reconstructs the scene.  We all have false memories.  This doesn't mean we're crazy.  It's just an inevitable consequence of how the human brain works on a physical level.  And if you pay attention, you can identify some of them.  In fact, that's what the Mandela Effect crowd does.  They just don't quite seem to realize it.  I personally am aware of some facts about my younger life, ranging from my childhood all the way up to not that long ago, which I know are completely false because the dates of things don't match up remotely, or they involve people in places they've never been to, and yet these memories are as real and as clear to me as any other memories I have.  You need to rely on your memory to an extent, of course, just to get through the day.  And there are a lot of things that you will have memories of.  that may be false memories, but there's not really any consequence to that.  But don't take the truth of your memories for granted.  Don't assume that they can't be influenced by things that you encounter later, or by other people, or by some relation to some pre-existing memory, and your brain trying to make the world make sense.  To do that is to deny your humanity.  Now likewise, outside of individual memory, there are some things that society more broadly gets wrong on a wide scale just because misinformation spreads like a meme through any of a million different avenues.  So don't take society's memory for granted either.  After all, a society is nothing but a bunch of human beings chattering at each other, putting ideas in each other's heads and confusing the shit out of each other.  Now all of this is, for better or worse, and let's face it, probably worse, just a fact about what we are.  And you have a choice about how you respond to this.  You can fall to the temptation to just deny it, search desperately for any other explanation, no matter how far-fetched, just to reassure yourself that the problem is not with your own brain, not with human beings at all, but something outside of all of us, uncontrollable, something that none of us are responsible for, something we can't do anything about, putting imperfect thoughts into our perfect heads.  It might be more comfortable to believe that you have an infallible, godly mind, After all, for a while, that might let you salvage some of your misplaced pride about being wrong.  But in the long run, all you'll actually succeed in doing is to give yourself a pass for laziness.  For not bothering to double-check the factual basis of your beliefs.  For not performing your duty of monitoring and maintaining your own mind.  And ultimately, your memories will only diverge further from reality.  That's not very productive.  On the other hand, you can accept your humanity, your flawed nature, your susceptibility to just being wrong for reasons that range from outside influence to your brain fitting things into some pre-existing context.  You can accept that the people around you are just as human as you, and that information you take from them might have just been taken from someone else.  And so on down the line, all the way to someone who got it wrong.  Or to someone who wasn't even talking about what you think they were.  So if you take this path, instead of rejecting all of that, you can accept it, and then get to work mitigating it.  Instead of fighting like a demon against the fact that you definitely have false memories and false facts in your head, and that you can acquire new false memories that you think that you've had for a lot longer than you actually have, and that you will acquire more of these in the future, you can just accept with humility, and with some amount of pride, that you're more complex than some perfect video recording machine.  Your brain is incredible, it can do incredible things that no video camera can, but partially to enable some of the incredible things it can do, it's imperfect at things like memory, and it needs to be monitored and taken care of, and doubted to an extent, and handled carefully.  if you ever want to apprehend anything that approaches the truth.  You can adopt a strategy by which you diligently fact-check yourself, at least when you feel it's important, even about things you think you know.  And you can serenely accept the facts that you're never gonna change.  Difficult, brutal facts, like that the Fruit in Fruit Loops has two O's and always did. ",
