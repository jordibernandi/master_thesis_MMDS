I'm not saying you necessarily, but I've seen it several times, man.  I got video evidence of it.  If that was one of us, our car would be impounded and we'd be paying heavy fees to get it out.  Can't impound a car for not having plates.  I've seen it happen several times.  Like I said, I got video evidence of it.  I mean, don't us taxpayers give you guys enough money that you can afford plates?  I mean, it's exempt.  You don't even have to pay registration on it.  And it's not even coming out of your pocket.  If you were a good officer, you'd probably refuse to drive a car without plates.  But nope, another bad apple.  Don't worry, we'll get that changed like we did with your blue line masks.  And what's your name and ID by the way?  Well, 7319.  Thank you.  Make sure I add that to my report.  I'm going to let you off with a warning this time.  You guys don't like being talked to the way you talk to us.  Mind if I search your car? ",
