Okay, may I ask you why you're videotaping our police department?  You can ask.  Okay, can you tell me why?  I don't answer questions.  I mean, are you trying to figure out how to break into our police department?  I don't answer questions.  Okay, do you have some ID on you?  I don't answer questions.  Okay.  Again, can I ask you why you're videotaping our police department?  Have a good day.  Okay, I'm Sergeant Arnold with the Greenland Police Department.  I want to know why you're videotaping our police department.  I don't answer questions, sir.  Okay.  Have a good day.  I'm on a public right-of-way.  Leave me alone.  That's none of your business.  You're trying to figure out how to break into our place.  It's none of your business.  Is that what you're trying to do?  It's none of your business.  It is my business.  No, it's not.  There's your news now here out at Greenwood Headquarters Fire Department.  This kind of... Do a little walk through Greenwood today and thought I'd come down.  I'm out here with Omaha Cop Block.  He came to visit.  Do a little bit of recording in the area.  Tuesday, July 28th, about 10.30 in the morning.  Thought I'd come and do a little bit of recording.  Thank you.  At the BMV across the street here.  Patrol cars sitting over there as well.  Some look like they haven't been used because they're pretty dirty.  I didn't know you either.  It's a fine.  This includes the police department, the courts.  Full Justice Center, so then maybe that's what they're doing.  Making it into a pool.  Old deal.  Over there, new court, new everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry?  What are you doing?  Just recording.  Oh, how come?  My own use.  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.  I'll see you later, champ.  How's it going?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Can I ask you who you work for?  I'm working.  What's that?  I'm working.  Please don't bother me.  Okay.  May I ask you why you're videotaping our police department?  You can ask.  Okay.

Back up a little bit.  Back up.  Back up away from me, please.  Back up away from me, please.  Greenwood police.  Here we go.  Idiots.  Idiots.  Behave yourself, fellas.  Should have closed your laptop.  It's a violation.  How you doing?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Done whatever you want.  Thank you.  What is your name and badge number?  I don't have to give it back in front of you.  I haven't asked you for anything.  But you made contact with me, sir.  I have not made contact with you.  Your policy is to name and badge number for the citizen.  I'm trying to get in the department here, so you guys are free to take whatever you want.  You got out and got involved, sir.  You guys are free to take whatever you want.  I need your name and badge number so that I can get that video.  Have a good day.  So I can get your... Have a good day, sir.  Sir.  You guys are good to film whatever you want?  Okay, well, there's a complaint.  Can I get a complaint form?  Thanks.  Get away from me.  You don't like people standing behind you, do you?  Listen, guys.  I don't have to listen to you.  Shut up.  I don't need your cop-splaining.  I don't need your bullshit.  Here's the deal, though.  I'm going to tell you.  If you come onto the private property, you will be arrested.  That's not private.  Yes, it is.  Do you see this?  Am I in a vehicle?  Do you see this sign?  Police vehicles only.  Police vehicles only.  It does not say no trespassing.  I can walk in there and video anything, and you arrest me, you're going to have a lawsuit.  Walk in there and do it.  Let's see what happens.  Go ahead.  I don't care if I've been warned.  That does not clearly state no trespassing and no unauthorized personnel.  Change the sign if you don't like it.  We're done, guys.  Go in service.  Goodbye.  Way to go, losers.  Have a good day.  that's exactly what they're doing.  no we're testing you.  that's what it is and you failed.  so what is that illegal?  is that illegal in your car?  yeah you are.  i need your name and badge number.  just get in your car and go talk.  I need your name and badge number, officer.  You guys are welcome to fill in whatever you want, alright?  Duncan?  Okay, I'll be filing a complaint.  Good job, guys.  Way to fail.  Duncan passed until he didn't give his name and badge.  I know.  These other idiots think that they can do whatever they want.  Watch out for that car.  I know I saw him coming.  I'm glad you say so man.  I was thinking.  I know I was trying to get your attention.  I whistled a couple of times.  Oh, I didn't know that was you.  I thought that was somebody else.  Yeah, it's all right.  Don't go nowhere.  Let's just wait.  Yeah.  They saw me when I walked around the front, came out on that side.  I'm like, damn, he's all the way on the other side.  It's over.  Thank you. ",
