            "text": "This will be a short video for us.  Today we wish to share an observation and leave you with a question that nags at us.  First, the Philippines declared independence on June 12, 1898.  We all know the Americans continued to subdue the Philippines after that and we understand some don't recognize that date, at least the year, necessarily, but June 12th remains Independence Day nevertheless.  and that is its origin, we decided to take a deeper look at that day, however.  For instance, on the Hebrew calendar, as we have noted all along, there is a connection to the Philippines and Hebrews.  that we prove is undeniable.  This day of June 12th, in the year 1898, on the Hebrew calendar, is Sivan 22 in that year.  Sivan being the third Hebrew month, also the birth of Messiah, we prove.  Another video, another topic.  From the Book of Jubilees, we can restore the biblical feast day of Shavuot, or Pentecost in Greek, to Sivan 15, the middle of the month.  Not the rabbi report from the first or second century where a rabbi changed it, when he said, everybody knows Shavuot is Sivan 6.  Well, everybody did not know, because... It was observed, according to the Book of Jubilees, on Sivan 15, since very ancient times.  Now, Shavuot is the plural for weeks.  The Feast of Weeks is what it's called in Scripture as well.  From the root word Shabuwa, which is the singular of Shavuot.  Shavuot is plural.  Weeks.  Sheba and Sebu are both Hebrew derivatives of this word, even in meaning and event.  Shavuot is the day of covenant renewal, the day in which Adam made his first oath, even today.  before entering the garden on the seventh day of creation or the first Sabbath day of rest.  Shibuwa means seven.  for this reason and so does Sheba, which we believe leads to Cebu, recorded on maps as S-E-B-U, not C, and also known on A 1646 map we show you as Isle of Sabbat or Shabbat in Hebrew or Sabbath as we would know it.  So Sheba or Seven.  So check this out.  This makes Philippine Independence Day in the year 1898, that year on the Hebrew calendar, exactly seven Sheba days.  after Shavuot, Shibuah, Sheba, Savu.  Is this a coincidence?  You decide.  The Philippines, formerly known as Ophir and Tarshish and Sheba or Cebu, really known as Maharlika as well, which in Hebrew would translate to his bride.  Imagine that.  We cover that as well.  It's steeped in history like no other nation on earth.  A history wrought in gold and resources above any other.  Yes.  It is the only land which can fit all the biblical markers of Ophir, King Solomon's source of gold for the temple, and it has mega history to support it, and we cover much of it.  Sure, they erased much of the local writings, which were documented to exist by the Spanish when they came, so there's no questioning that.  Thus, there were writings.  And where did they go?  Well, the conquering empire took such responsibility for this history that they were responsible to preserve and did not, regardless of whether they erase it or are just plain negligent.  In either case, guilty as charged.  However, much survives in the Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian records, as well as the Chinese, Indian, Greek, Malay histories, that one can reconstruct the history of the Philippines with accuracy, and it coalesces with the Bible, the biblical Ophir, especially.  Though few try in academia, we understand.  As that would be frowned upon in such paradigm, especially, oh no, using the Bible!  Ah, you can't do that, right?  Well, the Bible is history, whether you like the theology invoked or not.  It is history written by historical characters.  Therefore, there is no actual logical definition where you can discount it as history.  So basically the origin of this narrative of Ophir, this land of gold, these isles of gold that have been lost, originate right there in the Bible.  You can't prove such location without it.  Over three years ago, the God culture began documenting its research journey on YouTube in our Solomon's Gold series.  we find the abundance of information is so overwhelming, when one takes all the cards and lays them on the table, there is a complete match.  The history, the Bible, geography and maps, science, linguistics, they all converge to reveal what the world actually once knew, all the way up until about a century ago.  And then, somehow, they lost it.  Now imagine, have you ever lost an earring or maybe even a gold watch?  Certainly.  But how do scholars, rabbis, the church lose an entire land of gold?  We'll show you, and we will restore it.  The conclusion becomes extremely obvious.  The Philippines is in fact Ophir, the ancient lost isles of gold in which King Solomon first built a navy and port to go there.  It has remained important throughout history all the way back to yesterday.  creation we prove.  And its role in prophecy is among the most significant of all nations, all the way to the end.  Even the gold is in prophecy to the end and in the beginning.  In over three years, the extent of challenges to our finding of fear consists of either attempting debate with side notes that aren't even points within the case.  Come on.  Raising scriptures that don't even apply or misreading them.  ignoring the restoration of history, which, by the way, leads to the restoration of prophecy, but, and we hear this every now and then, because it is not the single topic of salvation, which this view dismisses Almost all the rest of Scripture, that's ignorance.  Don't be one of those who ignores Isaiah and Malachi especially.  As Yahuwah God warned, his people perish from lack of knowledge.  There is none of the Bible that we should not be studying and understanding.  None.  One goes backwards and quotes the British, who covered this up, or their pawns, whom we even demonstrate some on the Rothschild payroll even.  Yes, we do.  Or they'll even quote a rabbi who has done no research and has no clue what he's talking about.  He's no expert on this topic.  See, we are because we have researched it, and we'll prove it to you.  Don't worry.  Or even a Bible dictionary, which, in this series, we shred on this topic handedly.  Or perhaps one goes to just outright lies and they attempt to make a point by cutting off half of the directions to, say, the Greek accounts of Ophir or Christ in Greek, same land, in order to mislead.  We see that here.  where especially the British have reformed history, and we catch them cutting off these directions especially.  They're not going to get away with it, and you'll see that if you watch this series.  All of this can be. ",
