I'm having some pretty intense regrets about- what's going on.  everybody hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  like usual you guys read the title.  let's get into it.  so me a 31 year old female with my ex-partner who's 33 of seven years i feel intense regret.  after cheating and losing him She starts off with, Hi all, I am a 31 year old female looking for help with working through my thoughts.  But I am looking to move on and make things right.  Part of that is opening up about my predicament.  Thanks for any advice you have, harsh truths or otherwise.  I was in a relationship with him, 33, for 7 years.  which broke up around one month ago.  we broke up mainly because i was having an emotional affair with another guy for around two months.  my ex-partner found out our relationship was in many ways perfect and he is a perfect life partner.  We were compatible in terms of our views, life goals, careers, some hobbies, interests in food, etc.  We were best friends and I could rely on him for anything.  He is smart, funny, incredibly emotionally balanced.  He seriously has his crap together and probably the kindest, most self-disciplined and just one of the most genuine and easy to get along with people I know.  Everyone likes him and finds him very impressive as a person.  We were long distance for the last couple of years, but we really made work despite being in different states.  Towards the end, he was traveling to see me a lot.  We were due to end the LDR in the coming months, when his work project finished.  At this time, he was pretty stressed with work, and I could see that he was looking a bit run down during our daily chats and becoming a little difficult to speak to.  He always said that some days he just didn't have much to say, would be a bit silent.  for a while I was having doubts about our relationship because I felt like we were only friends and the spark had gone between us.  I wasn't feeling attracted to him and if I'm honest I'm not sure if I was physically attracted to him after the first year or so of being together.  our sex life wasn't always that frequent maybe two to four times a month max when we lived together and sex was becoming less enjoyable for me as time went along.  he had a much higher sex drive than me had brought up the issue a number of times and wanted to have more sex with me make me fulfilled too.  he is a very considerate lover and at the start of the relationship we had some of the best sex of my life and it was frequent.  when he brought up the issue of sex i tried to improve in frequency but always slipped into the same patterns of not being in the mood and that was frequently and basically rejecting him a lot.  the ldr didn't necessarily help that much with the issue.  The thing is, my previous LTR also ended in a similar fashion, but in that case, my ex had also lost feelings for me, which made splitting much easier.  I did sleep with another guy towards the end of that relationship also, so I know that this is a character trait or coping strategy that I have to work out.  My current ex was very open to trying to improve things with me in our sex life.  But I have to admit that I was pretty bad at communicating to him and didn't try that hard overall to improve because I guess I just wasn't feeling it anymore and didn't know how to tell him.  This problem of communication has been an issue for me.  I now realize.  My parents are terrible communicators and I have not had the best of relationships.  And some of my early relationships and sexual encounters occurred very young.  And we're not the best starting points.  Anyway, my ex and I are broken up and he has been completely no contact with me.  I'm having some pretty intense regrets about both.  How it all ended and that it ended.  It was having a stupid emotional affair with a guy I'm still in contact with, who I basically just had a load of lust for upon meeting and who wanted to sleep with me too, knowing I was in a relationship.  While I refused his advances, I liked the attention and just continued speaking to him.  We are too far apart for anything to happen.  Recently, many of my friends have been looking for love also and I think they're And I think their escapades highlighted to me that I didn't have the same fun anymore with my ex.  So when this guy came along and showed me so much attention, I couldn't resist staying in contact.  I guess I'm looking for some words of advice, how I can move on from this, how I can face my issues, and whether anyone has gone through something similar.  I know what I have done is highly disrespectful and I need to address these issues head on.  Also, I am now feeling so much regret that I want to contact him and try again but know that I should wait before I do to get my own stuff sorted out and that it's probably incredibly selfish of me.  I can't help but think that while I could find someone I am more attracted to in the long term, they probably won't have the same qualities as my ex.  I now realize that I messed up.  In some ways, I don't feel like I deserve to find someone like him again.  Before breaking up, he still wanted to work on our relationship, but I was just confused with myself and actions that I couldn't commit to making the necessary changes.  Thanks for any advice you have, harsh truths or otherwise.  Wow.  To sum everything up, I cheated and left my great ex.  I feel intense regret.  How can I best move on?  Can I ever entertain reconciling with him?  Hmm.  Let me give my thoughts. ",

            "text": "Here's, this is the thing that bothers me.  So, you know, we have this 31 year old female and I, I'm trying to understand where you talking about two different, I think she's talking about two different relationships here, but the main one was, uh, was it your husband?  Let me go back down real quick.  She didn't say it was her husband, but listen, You regret.  You regret.  I don't understand this regret.  She wants help getting over the regret she has for leaving such a great, perfect person.  Like she says, our relationship was in many ways perfect.  And he is a perfect life partner.  We were compatible in terms of our views, life goals, careers and some hobbies.  Yet and still, you felt the need to betray this person.  Now, I totally understand you can be with somebody for a while and it starts to feel like friendship.  And for the record, the long, long distance relationships, they always fail.  Like, come on, they always fail.  They're not a good idea.  They're not a good idea.  But.  Don't go.  I don't understand the whole.  I'm a cheat.  Now I feel bad or I'm a keep cheating.  But now I feel bad because I lost that person.  I dumped that person.  like you feel like crap now.  Is it because you see him doing better in life?  Because that's what you probably want.  And you want to look back and see that he's doing bad and he's begging for you to come back.  But you clearly have a problem.  Like you said, because I think you were talking about two different situations.  Yeah.  You said your current situation ended the same way.  So, I mean, at least I'm glad you at least acknowledge that you have an issue and that you have a problem.  It's just stupid little things like.  you guys remember the story yesterday.  The lady was saying she was lonely.  So she went on IG to post her pictures and got some attention.  Yada, yada, yada.  Like you're saying here that you refuse this guy's advances and everything.  So you didn't actually sleep with him, I guess.  But you like the attention and just continued speaking to him.  Come on.  It's ridiculous.  They do.  It's all for attention.  This attention is annoying.  You need attention.  that bad.  Like you'll ruin a perfect thing, a thing that you call perfect.  You'll ruin it because you need attention.  That's ridiculous.  Guys, let's check out the comments.  Someone called out something, she said.  Also, I am now feeling so much regret that I want to contact him and try again, but know that I should wait before I do that.  You should wait indefinitely, as in do not try to reconnect.  You effed up, you broke up.  Take time to process your feelings of guilt and resentment until you come to a place where you can look back on this situation and understand that you've changed as a person.  hopefully having this experience will better equip you for the future.  someone called out something i wasn't feeling attracted to him and if i'm honest i'm not sure i was that physically attracted to him.  after the first year or so of being together wasting people's time why are you with this person?  then?  Someone said, you can't fix this.  You will wind up cheating on him again if you two get back together.  Move on.  Right.  Look at it.  She's mad because in the story she said he went no contact with her and now she wants to reach back.  She's upset that she can't reach back and control him.  She wants to play games with this person, like cut it out.  It's ridiculous.  Someone said, please leave him alone before you call irreparable damage.  Someone says, it sounds like you get bored.  You claim you weren't that attracted to your ex, but then you say you guys had an awesome sex life until you created a dead bedroom.  And the same thing happened to your previous relationship.  That doesn't sound like an attraction issue.  If I were you, I'd get a therapist.  Someone said, leave the poor man alone.  You broke his heart by your own doing.  You still are only thinking about your own feelings and not the man's that you just destroyed.  Grow up is my only advice and stay away from this man.  Someone said, keeping it real, no BS.  If cheating is your thing and a constant spark is what you're looking for, stay single and do your thing.  Your ex-boyfriend will live his life better, but this is what you get.  And if he lives a better life, good for him because that's what he deserves.  You should know that this is the life you have chosen.  So you got to live with it.  Consult therapists, et cetera, et cetera.  But every decision you have made is yours.  Nice.  Guys, on that note, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  Wow.  Yeah, I like this comment.  She likes the constant sparks and it dies down quickly.  That's a personal problem.  You need to stop getting in monogamous relationships with people.  It's ridiculous.  Guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  I will put the link to this in the description like usual, and I'll catch you guys at the next one. ",
