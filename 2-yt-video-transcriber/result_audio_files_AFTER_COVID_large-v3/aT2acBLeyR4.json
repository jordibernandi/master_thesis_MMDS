We've got a lot of a lot of other things.  But you're if I didn't cover this, you'd really be missing a lot of important sort of narrative changes that are taking place right now from the White House and in the context of the 2020 presidential election.  Donald Trump did both a press briefing and an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last night.  I'm going to start with the interview with Laura Ingraham, which Donald Trump was promoting all day, multiple times, tweeting things like, for example, I will be interviewed on Ingram Angle tonight at 10 p.m.  on Fox News.  Enjoy.  And there are a lot of really interesting sort of psychological dynamics going on right now in terms of Donald Trump taking on these interviews and winging rallies, as he said, in New Hampshire over the weekend and so on.  Because remember that Donald Trump believes he always is the smartest person in the room and that no matter what people throw at him, he's going to come out looking good.  And this is why Donald Trump at least seemed open to the idea of sitting down with Robert Mueller back during the Russia investigation days, something which his lawyers knew would be a terrible idea that Donald Trump would lie.  He would perjure himself.  It would be a disaster.  And they were able to keep him from doing it.  And so the context of Trump coming in thinking he's going to be super effective went bad really quickly yesterday in this interview with Laura Ingraham, where she regularly would try to sort of interrupt and redirect Trump because she realized that he was going in a completely wacky direction.  There are probably more than just these instances.  I'm going to play for you, and we'll look at some of these in more detail.  But look at all of these moments where Laura Ingraham just interrupting Trump to try to divert or redirect what are disastrous paths for him to be taking, essentially trying to save Donald Trump from himself.

But I did the math for you on herd immunity yesterday.  So here are the numbers for the level of contagion.  For how easily spread coronavirus is to get to herd immunity, you need 50 to 83 percent of the population to be immune.  If you pick a number in the middle, it's 67.  It's like two thirds.  Now, with a one percent death rate and 331 people, 331 million people in the country, if you do some back of the envelope math, if two thirds of the country gets the virus, That's about 220 million.  If one percent die, it's about two point two million deaths, meaning we still have two million deaths to go to get to herd immunity.  If you think the death rate is more like point seven five, then you're still looking at about one point five million dead.  from where we are today.  So the herd immunity idea is downright dangerous.  And Donald Trump, understanding nothing, is pushing it.  OK, let's continue.

Trump said during the Chris Wallace interview in July, within two weeks we will have a signed and delivered new health care law.  It's going to replace Obamacare.  It's going to be done in two weeks.  That was in July.  That came and went during August.  Trump was asked about it.  He said, we're going to do it at the end of the month.
