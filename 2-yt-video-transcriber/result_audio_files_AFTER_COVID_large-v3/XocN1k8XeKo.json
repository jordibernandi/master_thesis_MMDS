            "text": "I stepped into a spirit realm that I want to release now, not later in the service.  I feel like it's something for our nation and I want us to pray into it as we end our worship time.  I heard the Lord begin to talk to me as I was in this realm about the ecclesia and their decrees becoming word missiles.  They're like bombs in the spirit realm.  They're missiles that we send that can explode on a target.  They can explode against the powers of hell.  When I woke up this morning, I was very burdened about our nation.  I don't know.  I couldn't get my bearings.  I was like, Lord, what are you saying and what are you doing today?  I've just been trying to pray into that.  But he talked to me about that.  And then I heard him say that he was going to be releasing, because of these word missiles, he would be releasing the battering rams of heaven against the kingdom of darkness today in our nation.  That the angels are carrying these battle rams these battering rams and they're going to begin to knock, they're going to begin to knock off the principalities and powers from thrones with these.  And I could see that these angels were beginning to swing with these battering rams and knock powers of darkness off of positions of authority, knock them off their thrones.  And when I saw that, I saw, you know, where prophetic things are concerned, they're symbolic.  But I saw when that happened, when they would hit these powers of hell or these giants, because they were swinging and taking out giants also.  We're in giant season right now.  But I saw a bowling, like bowling pins when a ball hits them and they just scatter everywhere.  And I heard the word strike.  So I believe today some kind of strike is happening from heaven because of the prayers of the saints.  The angels are involved in taking out powers of darkness, giants.  Something's happening today.  Heaven's called for a strike.  So in due diligence, let me pray that and please agree in prayer with me as we activate this now.  That's not just for here.  This is for our nation.  Father, today we set ourself in agreement.  Our words come into alignment with as missiles that go forth from the Ekklesia in this nation, all across this nation and in Washington,  D.C.,  in the capitals of our land.  And we believe, Lord, according to your word and activate in agreement, you said, Lord, that you needed a people that would agree with you.  They would say what you say.  They would intercede according to your word and so we do today.  Release the battering rams of heaven.  Release the angels that are carrying the battering rams and begin to knock off the principalities and powers of darkness that have taken place A subversive place of authority in our nation.  Take them out in the name of Jesus.  Giants in the natural realm of government, anti-Christ agendas, deep state.  Take them out.  Let the battering rams of heaven.  We agree, Lord.  Let the strike begin.  Let the strike force of the living God come into this nation.  Strike today, Lord, the powers of darkness.  Strike against your adversaries today, Lord.  We say let the strike begin this morning in all 50 states.  Let the strike begin all across Washington,  D.C.,  Let the strike happen over the government buildings and the powers of hell that reside there.  in the name of Jesus.  The government institutions and systems that have been polluted by darkness.  strike against them today.  Take them out.  So Lord, this house and thousands that are watching now, we raised our voice in agreement and we declare let the strike of heaven come into this nation, come into our land, Lord, and change it.  Take out giants today.  take out the rulers of darkness today, scatter them.  May they fly every which way as bowling pins.  So Lord, the ecclesia now engages our faith all across the nation, even in parts of the world, And we declare our agreement with heaven that the strike begins today in Jesus' name. ",
