            "text": "In a few minutes, I'm going to be going down to the floor of the Senate to vote against the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court Justice.  And what really bothers me is that at this particular moment, we should not be voting for a Supreme Court Justice because over 50 million people have already voted, cast the ballot to determine who the next president of the United States should be.  Now is not the time to be voting on a Supreme Court justice, but I will tell you what we should be voting on.  We should be voting on a major COVID-19 stimulus package to protect the working people of this country, who by the tens of millions have lost their jobs.  They're struggling right now as to whether or not they can pay their rent, whether they can get health insurance, whether they can put food on the table to feed their kids.  That is the issue we should be dealing with right now.  And if I have anything to say about it, and I do, the next US Senate, democratically controlled, will make a major COVID-19 stimulus bill the first order of priorities. ",
