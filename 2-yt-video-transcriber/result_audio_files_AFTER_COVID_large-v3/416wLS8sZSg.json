            "text": "today we're going to take a look at what happened to the awards of elizabeth holmes like for instance the horatio alger association honouring perseverance integrity and excellence.  well she had one of the three integrity and excellence.  yeah not so sure.  so uh this is just full right.  so it turns out they didn't sort of strip her of a reward because they're lifetime awards.  uh but some of the quotes in her acceptance uh spiel are just so perfect.  if you can imagine it you can achieve it never never never give up Never give up, never surrender.  Even when your company has gone from $9 billion to $0.  Throughout her work at the engineering school in Stanford, Holmes had been thinking about better ways to conduct lab tests.  Yes, I'm sure someone just starting out in their first year at Stanford in an engineering school has so much to contribute today.  to how they conduct medical tests.  In 2003, she applied for a patent for a wearable patch that would help administer a drug, monitor the variables in the patient's blood, and adjust the dosage to achieve the desired level.  Yeah, that was pure fiction.  The pure Star Trek.  And it stuns me today that anyone ever took her seriously after that.  Shortly after, you know, she proposed her impossible device, she decided to drop out of school and start a business.  Holmes established what was then named Real Time Cures in Palo Alto.  But yeah, apparently, real-time cures?  Really?  A random patch is going to cure you of everything?  She later changed the name to Theranos in a multi-animation of the word therapy and diagnosis, which is basically exactly the same thing.  Therapy and diagnosis.  Well, what did Theranos end up doing?  It was just diagnosis.  Oh, right, right.  So it wasn't going to be therapy and diagnosis.  It was therapy in time for diagnostics to be useful.  For more than decades, she led Theranos from concept to reality, enabling a new paradigm of early detection and prevention.  This really hasn't aged so well.  The company's breakthrough advancements have made it possible to quickly process the full range of laboratory tests from a few drops of blood instead of numerous tubes at unprecedented low costs.  oh boy those advancements were made directly accessible to people and their physicians through theranos wellness centers.  This really could do with an update of some sort.  Ah yes, in an offering advice to college students.  I'm sure that's what every college student wants is advice from the biggest billionaire scam in Silicon Valley history.  She points out the importance of finding one's passion and realizing one's full potential, especially likes to quote Winston Churchill, who said, never, never, never.  give up.  Actually, let's do that as Churchill.  Never, never, never.  give up.  As well as her own belief that if you can imagine it, you can achieve it.  Yeah, this really hasn't aged so well.  We live in such an incredible country.  A 19-year-old can drop out of school and build something like Theranos.  Yeah, this is indeed an incredible country.  I don't believe that this can happen only for me here.  Anyone who has a dream in our country can make it a reality.  Holmes encourages girls and young women to pursue science and technology.  Okay, that's fair enough.  I hope to help young women that they can be the best in the field, success in business, great mothers.  Being able to do whatever I can to contribute in the context matters deeply to me, and I strive to live my life in such a way that I might serve as a proof point for others.  This really hasn't aged so well.  But apparently she got an honorary degree from Pepperdine, Pepperdine University, which Pepperdine told the street that it has no intention of rescinding Holmes's honorary degree that it awarded last year.  bestowed the honorary doctorate of humane letters degree on holmes last year when she was delivering the commencement speech to two thousand and fifteen graduates.  pepperdine touted holmes and theranos for its blood testing technology for supposedly being able to simply simplify the way the lab diagnostics are conducted.  yada yada yada early detection of disease.  But this one is maybe the most epic.  So this is actually written by the guy who was dean at one of the Harvard medical schools or something when this was all going on.  My goal here is not to recount or explain the disaster, but explain how in the midst of it, Holmes became a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows, if only briefly during my time as dean.  So, yeah, this is the thing.  You don't get a dean of Harvard without being fairly decent.  So... I mean, there is this sort of element that, you know, once you get into the higher echelons of universities, they tend to become more administrators and scientists.  But even at that, you've earned your chops by the time you're, you know, Dean at Harvard of anything.  All schools at Harvard have a single fiduciary body, the Harvard Corporation, the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  But, you know, this is one of the reasons why places like Harvard have a fairly respected name.  With 13 members and meeting monthly, most of the schools create non-fiduciary boards of accomplished people to advise the deans and other senior administrators on important matters.  Who's just a little different, though?  You know, she didn't really have any qualifications at all, and she was still invited on.  The Harvard Medical School's Board of Fellows is truly an extraordinary group with accomplishments in diverse areas of health, education, business, and philanthropy.  I appointed many members, and my interactions with the Board of Fellows was invaluable to my deanship.  Many became friends.  Indeed.  The sole regrettable member was the aforementioned Elizabeth Holmes.  How did this mistake occur?  We're always on the lookout for a member of the boards.  We sought youth, record of entrepreneurship and domain of health, and we were conscious of the value of greater gender balance.  No, no, no, there is no value in greater gender balance.  There is only value... in actually having qualified people on the board.  i mean if they're all women i don't care.  But gender balance does nothing for you here.  Enter Elizabeth Holmes, who I'd heard of through the New York Magazine, through famed journalists, describing her impossible rise to multi-billionaire status.  CEO sounded like the future Apple company of medical diagnostics.  Should have smelt a rat straight away.  I mean, I did.  And... It's just one of those things to maybe do something 10 times better, 100 times better, fine.  To claim to do everything 100 times better on 100 times less blood, 100 times cheaper.  No!  Anyway, shortly thereafter, her office let me know that she would see me speaking in Harvard and invited me to have lunch with her, happily accepted, to explore the possibility that she might be on the Harvard Medical School.  So according to him, he's still not done any sort of scratching around.  During our lunch at the Harvard Medical Faculty, she gave me the Theranos pitch, and it was predictably transformative.  I pushed back on several issues, including her view that everyone was terrified of venous draws.  I didn't agree.  And my concern that too much testing would lead to over-diagnosis.  This is another serious concern that basically... You give a load of people a bunch of results.  They really don't know what they mean.  And so they're going to need Doc to explain to them anyway.  Anyway, her response to my queries was disappointingly bland.  And in retrospect, I should have accorded these concerns more weight.  Yet I asked her to consider interacting with the Harvard Medical School in some way.  She told me she turned down numerous board appointments but would be thrilled to join in support of our school.  In line with our board of fellows not being a fiduciary body, the process of adding new members was relatively informal.  He meets with the board and they sort of agree.  As if written in a crazy movie script, on the morning of the Wall Street Journal published its front page story by Curry Room.  That's the one basically saying that Theranos is a fraud.  Lightly based on a fraud, Elizabeth remained unimaginably calm and unflustered during the meeting.  Of course... People have been telling her for years that it didn't work.  Why should she pay any more attention now that it's some journal saying the same thing?  Throughout the two-day meeting, everyone talked privately about the cosmic anomaly.  Turned out that Gardner, a Harvard Medical School graduate now at Stanford and a member of the Board of Fellows, knew and had a very negative view of Elizabeth, but hadn't been asked about her.  Over the next several months, we had an internal debate between keeping her on the board for a while out of fairness and due process.  So the knives were basically out already.  Or asking to resign to limit potential institutional reputational damage involved.  Yes, of having someone who is basically a complete fraud and the antithesis of competent healthcare on your board.  Anyway, as information became public, the balance decisively swung and she was quietly asked to resign from the board of fellows.  What lessons did we learn from the involvement in Theranos Gate?  Greater due diligence is indeed, even the non-fiduciary board.  She might have been the next Steve Jobs.  To avoid getting burned by the hot iron, both diligence and good fortune are required, as they are in so many aspects of institutional government.  And this is a distinguished service professor.  Eh, seems sort of... Formerly Dean of Harvard Medical School.  Anyway, so there are three comments, and this one is by far the most damning.  When I was called for interview to Theranos and could not even get a word out of them to explain the workings of their apparent marvellous contraption, I realised that there was something... Just not right.  That was a year and a half before the Wall Street Journal article, and the alarm bells rung even for me then.  It's time for academics to start using their own God-given intuition.  Yeah, good fortune has nothing to do with such debacles.  Failure to give skeptical oversight to Theranos, the Theranos miracle, and instead to see it for what it was, a too-good-to-be-true piece of alchemical, wishful dreaming promoted by an attractive and persuasive, true believer young woman.  is what self suckered the harvard med folks into joining the theranos bandwagon.  history repeats and repeats itself.  anyone wanting to buy stock in my dutch tulip import venture.  just give me a call so stunningly Even though she was going around telling people that she had basically achieved miracles when she hadn't.  Basically lying to people's faces.  One of the most antithetical things to good science.  A load of these people didn't see fit to actually strip her of her awards or honorary degrees.  Anyway, so if you enjoyed that, give the video a thumbs up and hope you enjoyed it and see you next time. ",
