These people were recording in public and specifically recording the police.  They showed us the culture of law enforcement agencies and individual police officers engaged in misconduct long before the George Floyd protests erupted all over America.  And these people taught us to record in public, which is a fundamentally protected right under the First Amendment.  and whether you agree with speech or believe it has a legitimate purpose or not, people have a right to record, in public and their public officials.  We have a right to transparency and accountability of our public officials, even when those public officials serve in our local courts.  And it is the duly elected district attorney in a community that determines whether or not police officers will be prosecuted, the truth will be pursued, crime victims will receive justice, and whether public corruption will be investigated when it's called to their attention.  Over here at the .  As mainstream media starts to focus on law enforcement agencies, we're going to continue to focus on the district attorneys, because they are the leadership behind these law enforcement agencies.  And if they are corrupt, so are the police departments.  And when there is corruption in our courts, there's going to be injustice.  And so, we've looked closely at the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office.  And last week, something remarkable happened during the course of our investigation.  So when you spend Father's Day, do you stay at home all day, or do you go out and see other people with their children? ",

Sergeant Benitez is seen hitting Alvarez at least once before lifting the handcuffed man's head and slamming it into a car windshield.  Last week, the DA's office says there wasn't enough evidence to charge Benitez with felony assault.  Now the DA's office says it's reconsidering the case, saying in a statement, quote, after months of requests and after we closed out our review, we receive from Mr.  Alvarez's attorneys access to potentially relevant evidence.
