            "text": "Hello beautiful ladies and welcome to today's video where we're going to be talking about why you should stop hooking up.  If you're a woman in 2020, you've heard you need to be empowered.  You do you.  The patriarchy is holding you back.  Sleep with who you want, when you want.  But this is a bunch of lies.  Maybe you wanna hook up with a guy because you care about him and you don't wanna let him get away.  Sleeping with him is the easiest way for him to take you and your feelings for granted.  Holding out will tell you whether he's willing to wait and will tell him that you're worth waiting for.  I've seen it happen before.  Maybe you want to have sex with a guy you really like and can see having a future with.  Hooking up with him could mask all of the problems in your relationship that would lead to your eventual breakup and just prolong the inevitable.  Sex will only muddy the waters and prevent you from making a clear-headed decision.  Maybe you want to have sex with someone because you're lonely and it will fill up the time until you meet the right person.  Having sex with the wrong person is the easiest way to prolong your loneliness since you'll be too distracted to find Mr.  Right.  Maybe you want to have sex because, hey, it's fun.  You know what's not fun?  STDs, pregnancy scares, waking up next to someone you have no emotional connection with, and wasting your time.  Now let's get the record straight.  I'm not saying sex is bad.  In fact, sex is wonderful.  But sex with the wrong person is not.  Sex by itself is nothing.  It's regret when the act is done and sadness knowing nothing else will come of it.  Love, marriage, a family, a future all fit in with sex and make sex so much more than a physical act.  You know how you crave ice cream, but if you ate ice cream all the time your healthy lifestyle would go out the window?  It's the same with sex.  That healthy lifestyle you want disappears when you have sex with anyone and everyone, wherever and whenever.  There's a reason that women who wait until marriage to have sex are happier on average than women who do not.  A good guy will wait for you, no matter what.  A bad guy won't.  When you wait, you respect yourself and your body enough to share it with someone on a healthy timeline.  You're just waiting to have that ice cream until the moment is right.  So listen up, ladies.  Let's be classic.  Stop hooking up.  It might be harder now, but it will be better in the long run.  Thank you so much for watching today's video.
