            "text": "Welcome to the Day on Injection program.  This is show number three.  This is the most radical show that I've put together thus far, and it comprehends what has happened yesterday, what was through Stroud yesterday, which I am telling you, we are testing the limits of our way of life right now.  About 36 years ago, so in July 1984, there was a woman that went into labor and the child inside of her was about 10 pounds, a big, big child.  And the doctors couldn't figure out how to deliver it.  And they had to use a vacuum.  So when you suck the baby out, With vacuum, many things can happen.  The first thing is you get these eggplants-type shaped heads.  So that was the first thing.  That baby looked weird.  He had a very long head.  The second thing, when he came out, his collarbones broke.  And basically, his two legs were also upside down.  So he came out very deformed.  And the doctor told the mother, you will have a paralyzed child.  Your child will not be normal at all.  He may not walk.  but you know the you you're in for a world of problems.  and she just refused to accept those facts.  and because Those the heads, you know, they they become normal very quickly.  The collarbones because it's so agile the the bones she put the child on his stomach for three months and the collarbones Became totally straight with the feet and everything like that.  He had casts on both of his legs and he had upside down shoes to put the bones back into their place.  By age six, totally normal child.  That child is talking to you right now, and that is the true story of the first few years of my life.  Age six, I think I'm out of the woods, desert storm happens, and every day I spend with my mother and my four-year-old brother at the time, a 1986 born, in our shelter with the masks, with the gas masks, because Iraq is firing in all cylinders on our country.  Now, crisis happens.  Big crisis happens.  My grandparents, they're Holocaust survivors.  And the world goes on.  The world goes on and learns from these things.  And we will learn from this one.  I want to talk about what's happening right now on the ground because it's been a crazy two days, the 17th and the 18th.  I'm doing this on the 19th.  And here's one thing.  So helicopter money in the  U.S.,  they're considering now two checks of $1,000 each to most of American individual.  Now, this would have to have an immediate stimulus response.  So I assume there will be many restrictions on what you can spend your money on.  And I also assume there will be an expiry date on it.  But let's see what.  what they come up with.  The Federal Reserve, the last two chairs, Janet Yellen and Bernanke have both come up and said in public, the Fed should now start buying corporate debt.  America on the go is changing into Japan.  That's what's happening right now.  If the Federal Reserve starts buying corporate debt, basically outlawing defaults for corporate America, there's the loss of our way of life as a capitalistic society altogether.  The fiat monetary system, I have zero trust in it right now.  It's just not built for these sort of events, just not built.  Washington, Larry Kudlow has said, we are considering, the treasury is considering entering the markets, basically putting a floor on stocks.  So Washington will start owning corporate America, taxpayers money, whatever that even means anymore because of deficits will own corporate America or some of corporate America.  Again, another move that brings America closer to Japan.  Okay, next subject.  What's happening with the coronavirus?  What is the strategy?  So we know that in its most popular strain, the coronavirus, it gets host in the body for 14 days.  So the idea is basically to put restrictions and curfew and quarantine on everyone for 14 days.  And theoretically, this thing is over.  That's not gonna happen.  So what they're doing is buying time so that the healthcare system would be ready.  when they start releasing the herd back into society.  Banking, high tech, industry, you know, insurance, manufacturing, et cetera, they're gonna start releasing people back to the workplace in the next month or two, and then, Everyone's going to get it, right?  So you're either going to get it hard, bad, or you're going to get it easy.  And then we need to put these people into hospitals, mobile hospitals, casinos that will be treated as hospitals, hotels, et cetera, wherever there's space, military bases, et cetera.  So FEMA was invoked for this and for other reasons.  And I think that's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to buy time so that they can mentally and physically logistically get ready for the situation where there are, even if 1% of America gets it, we're talking about 3.3 million people.  So in big countries, that's what I think the idea is.  China, whoever... Take it with a grain of salt.  They're saying they haven't had any casualties yesterday, but it's very hard to believe.  What I think will happen is as they open up Wuhan and Hubei and they see where the new centers are, they're going to start closing here, opening, closing, opening, closing, opening.  This will probably go on until 2023, 2024.  Because that's the way it is.  Now, in the meantime, vaccines will come along.  The body will be more immune to it.  They will understand the virus.  And that's what I think our life is going to be in the next three, four years in big, big countries.  Small countries like the one I'm at right now, we have one international airport.  This could be easier to contain if we don't allow people in or out.  So major decisions and major social decisions are coming towards us.  I want to talk about values and end the show with that today because there's so much more that I want to get into.  I put everything together in slash v2wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash v2.  100% you have to see it because it goes through the charts and the graphs.  We are hitting the limits.  of what can happen with the dollar system.  There is a dollar short squeeze right now to the point of $12 trillion.  The Fed, consider it, it's just pumping $500 billion every day into the market, pumping 500 billion.  Let that number sink in because that's America's annual interest payments to its bondholders.  So if you think the national debt is a problem, think about 500 billion getting pushed every day into the marketplace.  We are in a hyper deflation.  And in a hyper deflation, many things change.  So I want you to think about your own values.  And what are you?  Who are you?  What is most important to you as a family member, as a friend?  I've reached out today to many of the people that friends of mine that live in the city next to me.  I've asked them, hey, if you're outside the city, let me know if you need any help for your parents, for your loved ones, anything I can do.  to make sure that if uh that your parents the elderly are not taking any chances if you're overwhelmed with the kids and overwhelmed with uh work you know.  uh let me help you uh find solutions for that.  um we have to uh unite and i think that will really help to put everyone in the same mindset.  so think about that.  think about your values here.  And lastly, let's talk about Italy.  We've seen armies on the street actually taking bodies because there are bodies out there that can't be dealt with.  They have a real problem on their hands.  And I want you to learn the lesson from this.  There is a lesson and there's a price to pay for not being prepared for crisis.  From here on, please do not underestimate the importance of having a duffel bag of cash always around.  Just make sure you have, think about the second residency or second passport.  Think about your life insurance and what happens in the case that you cannot provide anymore for your family.  Precious metals, think about that.  Think about the fact that silver is selling for about $10 above spot for the physical metals.  And it takes two, three months to get it.  And then lastly, think about your career.  and where you are.  If you were easily told to go home, get sacked, if you were fired, think about your skills and your values to the marketplace.  What are you worth?  How agile is your business?  How nimble is it?  Can you close it and open it real quick?  Can you do it from home?  Do you need a secondary income?  This is a time to self-reflect because we are in... Seriously, we are in unprecedented territory.  Now, I want to talk about market closure last and then end the show.  I don't think the markets will close unless there is some sort of a... a crazy escalation.  We are in an in-motion event, and there is no reason to close it now.  If they wanted to close it, it should have been on day one like they did with the Kennedy assassination, like 9-11, or in 1933 in the Great Depression, or, you know, the markets have been closed for months in World War I, but Definitely not there yet.  I don't think the markets will get closed.  There was a trader on the floor in the stock exchange that got the coronavirus.  So there are no live people on the floor today.  They'll only be bots and algorithms.  Consider the fact that America will probably stay open.  The equities are not gonna find a floor that easily because there's so much that we don't know.  And therefore there are many companies that are just getting withdrawals.  from baby boomers, they're just saying, I wanna cuddle my cash, I don't wanna hear about the stock market ever again, give me my money.  So a lot of the selling is forced selling.  Funds have to give their clients their funds back and it's not that they feel, oh my God, American Express is going under, I have to sell American Express per se, I'm just giving an example.  I've got a big holding in American Express.  These clients need money.  I need to sell American Express.  And it's called force selling.  When those happen, there are opportunities.  And I'll cover them in the newsletter this upcoming Sunday.  So today's the 19th.  That'll be the 22nd of March.  I'll cover that in detail and even some positions that I'm taking right now.  So wealthbusinessgroup.com forward slash V2.  Definitely make sure that you get it.  And I've just published my new ebook, my first ever book.  And it's going to be free for the month of March and April because people are home and they want quality content.  I hope they enjoy the book, wealthresearchgroup.com.  forward slash book.
