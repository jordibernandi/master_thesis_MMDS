I'm going to be uploading probably every hour of the main 9 or 10 a.m.  to 5 p.m.  schedule today.  There's an absolute ton of news.  This news coming out of Twitch's Trust and Safety Council.  Now, Twitch has been largely silent on... the issue, one of their Trust and Safety Council members' heinous statements about gamers.  And we've seen some movement in Twitch's seeming removal of the Twitch ambassador, who was publicly very toxic.  Now, there is a lot of pushback going on right now about ferociously Steph, her use of edibles on stream or consuming it.  I don't know what's going on there, to be honest with you.  Again, So I don't know that that would be a reason for removal, especially if they live in a state where everything's fine and dandy in terms of usage.  But interestingly, they finally spoke out a note from Emmett about the Safety Advisory Council.  Last week, we announced the formation of a safety council, a group of online safety experts, and Twitch creators we brought together to advise on issues related to the trust and safety of Twitch.  You have neither.  If I'm being very clear, you absolutely don't have anybody's trust, especially after everything going on.  I suppose you could argue that people are in general at least safe.  And I want to provide some clarity to help everyone understand our thinking about the council's role and what we're doing next.  The role of the council is to advise, offer perspective, and participate in discussions with internal teams pertaining to the work we do to keep our community safe and healthy.  We made an intentional choice to recruit advisors with strong independent opinions.  So this, I believe, is probably them reacting to... Directly to the promotion of Ferociously Stuff, they're saying we purposely found, we purposely promoted people with terrible opinions, is how I read this.  Our goal is to hear a wide range of points of view informed by truly different people within Twitch and outside of Twitch.  Because a position on the council is not a test of ideology or an endorsement by Twitch on a specific viewpoint, we expect that members of the council will sometimes have very different viewpoints from each other, the Twitch staff members or from the official Twitch policy.  Well, let me ask you this very simply.  I'll lay it out for you in chapter and verse.  Why isn't there an openly conservative member on the Twitch Safety Council?  Why isn't there an anti-progressive on the Twitch Trust and Safety Council?  It would appear to me that you aren't interested in diverse opinions or diverse people.  I'm sorry, diverse thought.  You're only interested in diverse people who all think exactly the same.  We said in our blog post, we were looking for the council to advise on a variety of things from advising on new policies to promoting healthy streaming habits.  Yes.  Like eating herb.  Um, but we could have been clear about what tasks the council would not be involved with.  council members will not make moderation decisions, nor will they have any access to any details on specific moderation cases.  So they're basically coming out and saying, uh, okay.  The Twitch safety console has no power.  That's what Twitch is really coming out and saying.  This is a response to ferociously Steph saying, certain people should be afraid of me.  Grass.  How's my impression?  I suppose it's probably not very good.  They are not Twitch employees, and they do not speak on Twitch's behalf.  Again, Why not have an openly conservative member of this or somebody who provides a position counter to what is clearly the adopted position of those at Twitch?  Again, not really interested in diverse thought at all.  All participants care deeply about the Twitch community and want to make it a better place.  It's a commitment of time and energy around them, and we're grateful for their contribution.  At the heart of the Safety Advisory Council and all of our work at Twitch is to desire to foster a safe and inclusive and creative community of passionate people.  Unless you're a white cis male... In that case, my friends, you are, what, according to a Twitch council safety member, a terrible human being.  As with every community, there will be disagreements and differing points of view, and we are committed to considering a diversity of perspectives.  What?  Are you just word stuffing the word diversity?  First of all, you say we're committed to considering a diverse group of opinions, a diversity of perspectives.  I guess I don't think that that's what you have now.  I don't think that's what you ever wanted.  And we can see ferociously stuff almost immediately that same day points out.  And I think that I think that they were probably scolded is probably what I'm guessing.  The Safety Advisory Council had its first meeting today, and I'm honored to be a part of the team.  Very glad to bring my voice and perspective to the council.  It's been a hectic few days.  I've made comments that were taken out of context and sensationalized that do not represent my role at TOR.  I believe ferociously stuff was reprimanded.  I don't think we need context around what you said about the majority of gamers being white supremes.  That is, in or out of the context in which you were saying it, a fact that it is your opinion.  You didn't say, ha ha ha, you didn't use it as an example.  You didn't say, I'd be crazy if I said something like this.  You said it, you meant it.  I am not Twitch staff.  I understand that what I said was misinterpreted and will continue to iterate on my communication to leave less room for misunderstandings.  No, ferociously, Steph, what you said was very clear.  I love when people use this as their shield.  Oh, well, you just didn't understand what I said.  You just didn't understand me.  Really?  What's there not to understand?  That's very curious that you would take that position.  I'm empowered to have a voice, a platform, and a community despite a deluge of harassment.  Okay, and I can exist and will continue to.  Yes, stunning and brave.  After attacking, it's so funny that these people all react the same way.  It's like they take a rock... They chuck it into a beehive, and then they- and when they get stung, they say that, I'm being harassed by all these bees!  Oh, these bees don't like me because I'm trans.  Ah!  I want to be clear that my role is not to moderate or address specific streamers or incidents.  Oh, she definitely got scolded.  I'll be offering my perspective and advice on issues, challenges, products, policies, and more broadly, and I'm excited to bring my voice to the table.  I've always fought for diversity and marginalized communities.  I will continue to do so on this council and use my voice to advocate for and empathize with communities that are often silenced.  Funny you used the word silenced, you know, given you want to silence white cis male voices by removing voice chat from competitive gaming.  I think that, you know, you see what is the top.  Let's see how the replies are going.  You should not be there.  You're unqualified, out of touch with this community.  Why?  All you gamers are, you know, hood wearers.  If anyone said that about any skin color, they would instantly be banned from every platform.  There is online.  Twitch should be the same rules for everyone.  How about this for 700?  I'm really not understanding why you're allowed to have any role of power or even a voice in this council with the way you behaved.  You are clearly power hungry.  And even before your first meeting, you were letting it get to your head with you on it.  The council is a joke.  absolutely absolutely getting destroyed.  and of course uh you know we've got let these.  uh you know i i mean i think you know she did use the a but uh i mean she's just getting roasted.  nobody cares.  uh everyone you know thinks that.  uh you know her position on the council is exactly why it's a joke.  this is from shannon uh saying Nothing was taken out of context.  No one misrepresented full segments of your stream.  We all saw it.  The fact you haven't, in this whole thread, owned up to any of the grossly inappropriate things you gleefully said further underlines how unfit you are for this role.  Resign.  I mean, I guess... I think that the right thing probably for ferociously Steph to do would be to resign and then maybe look to perhaps reestablishing herself on that team in six months or a year after she's gained some trust.  I mean, I think that... Twitch did very clearly scold her, but didn't remove her from the council, which I don't think is enough.  I think if you want anyone to take this thing seriously, then you've really got to remove her.  I really, really don't take this lightly.  I don't take... Basically asking for someone's job to be removed very lightly.  But this is an unpaid position.  This is a position of somebody who has a clear negative bias against gamers, against white men.  And they're just not fit to even have a voice of influence with the Twitch staff.  It just makes Twitch look even more clown-like.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon.
