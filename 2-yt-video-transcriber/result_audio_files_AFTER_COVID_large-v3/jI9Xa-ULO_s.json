This one takes the cake, though, because this cop attempts to extort this gentleman on behalf of the tow truck driver under the threats of fines and or arrests.  Please be aware when a cop is pulling the wool over your eyes under the false pretense of law.  And watch videos such as this one so you don't fall for the tricks they use to make you submit using tactics such as this.  And to the next one, I wish you nothing but love, blessings, peace, and respect. ",
