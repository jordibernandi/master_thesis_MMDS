            "text": "There once was a bittersweet man and they called him Pumpkin Boy.  Yeah, I guess we're doing this again.  Here we go!  I'm Mr.  Atheist.  Let's do this.  I have now twice, on two different occasions in the last, like, week and a half, forgotten to put a fan intro in after saying, but first, this.  But this time, I'll probably remember.  So let's jump into this, but first, this.  For content on atheism almost daily, press the subscribe button and ring the bell.  Alright, there are going to be a great number of you not knowing that this is an ongoing thing on this channel because it was something that ran through sometime last summer and then we took a bit of a break.  We have a plan in action for phase two that is going to go into effect at some point, but right now we've been letting everything breathe and I don't know, you know, I've just been hanging out, quarantining.  Football was good.  I'm just kidding.  I don't watch sports.  So let me give you a tiny story time to get everybody caught up.  Last year, the relative of a pastor called Boyle, seen here without a totally super punchable face, his relative forwarded me a video to something by this guy called the Make America Straight Again Conference.  And he was essentially the main voice, the person who was the best foot forward they had, again, here looking like a foot, he was the best face to advertise an event for this organization called the New Independent Fundamentalist Baptist.  That event was called Make America Straight Again.  This group is very much like Westboro Baptist and other very extreme fundamentalist organizations that believe people like myself, queer individuals, should not just be sort of not tolerated or put in jail, but in fact, put to death, that the government should be killing us.  So I made a video responding to this ridiculous fundamentalist group and all the things about it that are just disgusting.  For example, that they were purposefully holding this event in Orlando on the anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting, very much, from their own mouths, celebrating the Pulse nightclub shootings.  Down below, if you want to get caught up and see everything, because it was an amazing back and forth that I'm going to show you tiny little elements of here in a moment.  But there is a link to all of the videos on a playlist that I did down below.  And it talks about some of the things we did, like cutting off major parts of their funding, making them retreat like the cowards they are to another website called BitChute.  So now they just put their soft hatred stuff on YouTube, the stuff they can get away with.  And the really heavy stuff they go, they put over there.  But one of the pinnacle moments and one of the things that you've probably noticed, actually, even if you don't know what happened back then, was this thing about pumpkins.  So if you've been on my channel, you've probably seen references to pumpkins.  You've probably seen people call me Mr.  Pumpkin.  If you are a member on this channel, next to your little handle when you're in the live chats in the comments is some kind of pumpkin.  All of the artwork is pumpkin based.  One of the peak moments, one of the most fun for me moments, really, was when they decided to respond.  They thought they could take us on.  And boy, did that pay off for them.  One of the pastors of this, what is frankly a cult within fundamentalist, independent fundamentalist Baptists, this is a cult headed by a guy called Steven Anderson.  But the guy who decided to try and come and do battle with me was an individual called Tommy McMurtry.  Now, all you need to know about Tommy McMurtry is start typing his name into Google and you're gonna notice something very interesting.  Let's see here, T-O-M-M-Y, McMurtry.  Ah, yes, this result here.  And I encourage you to try that for yourself and see if you got something similar.  I'm going to be showing you, but see in the response, Tommy McMurtry decided he didn't want to give me more publicity.  So he said, I'm going to call him Mr.  Pumpkin because pumpkins are the biggest fruit on earth.  And so in this whole exposure lesson he was trying to give me, I decided to suggest one back in return and to do a little experiment with SEO.  And in the coming days, as you will see, if you follow that playlist, seriously, it's a good playlist.  You'll be entertained.  Go watch all the videos.  In the days that came, we adjusted the SEO on YouTube so that if anybody were to search for, say, Tommy McMurtry or Liberty Baptist Church, the first video they would come across is a video with several creators, including myself, making the statement that I'm not saying Tommy McMurtry is sexually attracted to pumpkins.  I'm just saying we don't know.  Well, that's what we did on YouTube.  And then to further this lesson, I might have purchased the domain tommymcmurtry.com.  Now, let me say as a disclaimer, as I have said every time I bring up this website, tommymcmurtry.com has nothing to do with Tommy McMurtry, the person or the pastor, nor does it have anything to do with Liberty Baptist Church.  But if you search for Tommy McMurtry, you're going to find this website, tommymcmurtry.com.  Let me show you.  By the way, it might seem to a lot of people that this amount of recapping isn't important.  I could have just said he said the pumpkin thing.  It's all going to make sense in a minute when I give you the update.  that's coming because.  You just, you won't believe what they decided to do.  You won't believe of all the decisions you could make, of all the silly ways you could try to go again, the decision they would make.  So for tommymcmurtry.com, I thought, what should I do here?  Well, I have a big fan base.  We're closing in on 300,000 subscribers.  At the time we were past a hundred, but I think we were maybe closing in on 150.  I don't remember precisely, but I put a prompt out and said, hey, If you would like to contribute to this website, why don't we create some, I don't know, sexy pumpkin people.  And so based on user submissions alone, which at some point I assure you, we're going to update and add more because we have to now.  We created this website, which I actually have to be careful to scroll because while I think it satisfies Google's things, if I scroll too far, we will definitely run right past what YouTube would allow.  And so at the center of this controversy is they're calling me Mr.  Pumpkin, me taking that as a merchandising opportunity, I should still say thank you, and this website and a statement about us not knowing whether or not Tommy McMurtry is sexually attracted to pumpkins.  Anyway, what happens next is some back and forth between myself and their church, and our side did a lot better.  In fact, they kept trying to make these claims about how we're just giving them free publicity, free publicity, and then when the actual event came along, the conference was as packed as what one of their normal Sunday services would be, despite the fact that they had all of these pastors coming in from out of town.  In other words, to do a Make America Straight Again 2.0, would just show that they have a pride issue that they can't get over, that they can't really get over being beaten by a little fruity queer like myself.  And don't you worry, they did not disappoint.  A few days ago, one of my followers called Christina on Twitter forwarded me this.  This is the Facebook event for MASSA 2.0.  And I actually found out that MASSA being short for Make America Straight Again.  Apparently they think they have some kind of ally in Trump.  You will notice the banner up here.  You know, that's not utterly surprising, I think.  A lot of bigots feel like they have an ally in Trump.  And it's not as though that's an illogical conclusion.  The event is taking place over three days.  Now, by the way, let's come back to that in a second.  To confirm that this is actually going on, because anybody can make a Facebook event, this is their actual website.  I know what you're thinking, that can't be the website.  This is a popular church organization.  They couldn't find somebody who could do some basic coding or figure out something like WordPress to make a better website.  Now, this is the best they had to pull off, but we actually see here that that event is actually happening.  Now, some of you might have already jumped ahead to the big observation and the big thing that they didn't think about.  The thing that like, honestly, if you were going to do this event, what is the one thing after the way we whooped your butts last time?  What is the one silliest thing you could absolutely do here?  Well, let's come back to this page and I'd like to draw attention to the dates for you again.  Thursday, October 29th, Friday, October 30th, Saturday, October 31st, and actually there's a Sunday service also with Pastor Steven Anderson because it's happening at his church in Tempe, Arizona.  So to remind you of the main thing that happened with our little fight back and forth, during the actual event of Make America Straight Again version one, Tommy McMurtry decided to do a call-in show before the show, which resulted in many calls of people calling and asking, are you sexually attracted to pumpkins?  Now, I want to say, first of all, I did not tell anybody to do that.  In fact, if someone had asked me directly if they should call, I would have said no.  I also want to point out he never satisfactorily answered the question and mostly avoided it.  But, and there's two layers to this.  If that was the thing that happened... If we have now associated on Google SEO this name and people are calling in that this is the thing, the joke, the silly thing that's following you around, what is the one time of year you would not want to do this again?  Maybe October 31st?  maybe on Halloween day itself.  And let's take this to the next layer.  There's an added layer.  Three, technically four days of this event.  If we go to the discussion tab, it shows us what the schedule is.  When the individual people are going to be giving their speeches on Saturday in the morning, which is Halloween, Saturday, October 31st.  You can't make this up.  Tommy McMurtry, of the four days it could have been, he's going on Halloween.  And I'm saying it's not an accident.  I can't say for sure.  It's on purpose.  I guess I just don't know.  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.  If the pumpkin thing is a thing, you just got to tell us at this point.  So here going forward.  First of all, if you're not already subscribed, you need to be.  Hit that and hit the bell because there's going to be updates coming.  We're definitely going to be taking the fight back to them again.  I don't know where it will end.  I just know where it ended for them last time.  Actually, I can show you this.  Let me pull it up here.  So basically they had to retreat much of their content to a program called or to a website called BitChute.  Here's how BitChute is described by Wikipedia, for example.  BitChute is a video hosting service founded in 2017.  It was created to allow video uploaders to avoid content rules enforced on the other platforms such as YouTube.  The platform accommodates far-right individuals and conspiracy theorists with the Southern Poverty Law Center saying this site hosts hate-fueled materials.  Some creators who have been banned or had their channels barred from receiving ad revenue demonetized on YouTube have migrated to BitChute.  and That's what happened here.  So let's actually go take a look at their channel.  So here we are and the sermons are as ridiculous as you might think.  I guess a bit of a content warning here because some of the titles might seem a little bit more violent and we're talking about hatred toward queers.  So one of the first ones is actually a Tommy McMurtry sermon, Queers Can't Fight, talking about how queers aren't scary and that we can't, I mean like literally fight.  He's talking largely about the military and don't ask, don't tell.  It's interesting coming from a man who I'm pretty sure is eight inches shorter than me and a hundred pounds lighter.  Like in a totally consensual boxing match, I would lay this person out, but whatever, we can't fight.  And so it was just video after video with ridiculous and inciting titles.  I mean it with gross hatred memes, I guess you would call it.  There's even this one that you now see at the top here.  I skipped over some of the other titles and skip forward at this point because I wanted to have the best chance at monetization possible.  And some of these titles would have just killed that.  You see it says interview with Pastor McMurtry by Atheist Vanguard, but you actually see the little image of me on there.  as though I would have done an interview with Pastor McMurtry.  I might have had some sort of interaction with the guy.  It would not have been an interview.  I assure you of that.  Basically, they took a screenshot where I'm looking down and away.  I think it's supposed to make it look like he like owned me or I'm ashamed.  This is not, this is from a different day where I was on Atheist Vanguard.  I was not on at the same time as Pastor McMurtry, but whatever.  Those are just facts and And I'm sure that this helped them get all 169 views.  Gay number, by the way.  But it's good to know that as recently as this last January, they're still thinking about me.  And they will be again here soon.  Also, it's cool that apparently BitChute just lets people steal other people's content.  In this case, not mine, but Atheist Vanguard's.  Wow, BitChute, in the name of free speech, you sure are heroes.  So here we go again.  We're just getting started.  And in the future, I will probably have favors to ask and things that with a bigger audience and a bigger group of people working together, things that we can do together to fight back once again.  Discord and my Twitter are going to be the main place that I'm making announcements.  And honestly, on the Twitter, I'll probably be saying like, go to my Discord.  So join those, make sure you're looking out and look out on Twitter for the notifications that there's meaningful things in the Discord.  if you're not a regular participator.  Oh man, forgive them Harambe.  They know not what they do.  They don't realize daddy likes a good fight.  We'll end it there with me totally not being weird and referring to myself as daddy.  Ways to support the channel can be found below all that social media and that playlist that seriously.  go check it out.  It's one of the few playlists of mine that I can watch back because I hate watching myself, but it is fun.  Some of the most entertaining content, but also some of the more meaningful.  We went to war.  And we've won so far.  Apparently we're doing it again though.  Anyway, all that stuff.  If you want to support the channel financially, PayPal, Cash App, Patreon, all of those things.  OnlyFans.  I'm just kidding.  Not really.  I thought about making an OnlyFans for just my scabs.  I have one on a mole right now.  And I think that would have been the moneymaker.  but ways to financially support the channel down below if you wish as well.  We end today by thanking the wonderful people who keep my channel alive and going with a special thank you to my orbital cosmic pumpkin gods, Commander Bork, Sassy Cat, Mabbity Babbity, Ariel, Kat, Cynthia, YCK, Caleb, Vidano, and Lilith.  With love, I've been Jimmy Snow.  Mr.  Atheist was not my father.  One, two, Jimmy's coming for you. ",
