            "text": "Hello, everyone.  Welcome back to my channel.  Somewhere amidst watching the world go to hell over the past few months, I've often found myself considering the question of obedience, particularly in the context of a government citizen relationship.  Essentially, I was wondering why is it that so many people choose to submit to an authority specifically when the people are discontent with said authority?  And the reason I asked this question is because it seems to me that people both on the left and the right in the United States and in many other countries as well are becoming increasingly unhappy with the state of their governments.  and their societies overall.  Undoubtedly, we have seen a lot of leftists from movements like Antifa and Black Lives Matter manifesting their discontent through acts of violence recently.  But what about the millions of other people who are equally unhappy, perhaps due to COVID restrictions, the collapsing economy, the Black Lives Matter riots, being unable to attend church or a loved one's funeral?  What about these people who aren't even so much as peacefully protesting?  Why aren't we seeing more acts of civil disobedience?  Naturally, the first and most obvious answer that jumped out at me was fear.  People fearing repercussions either from the authorities or even from their own peers.  For example, I've seen multiple videos now of people harassing and assaulting other people as punishment for not wearing a mask.  On the other hand, however, I didn't think that the reason that people were obeying despite their discontentment extended to fear alone.  Human beings are just not that simple.  Fortunately, I happened to get a much more satisfying answer while reading part one of Jean Sharpe's, The Politics of Nonviolent Action, because I'm very interested in the process of nonviolent action, and this is what I advocate for.  In this book, Jean Sharpe goes through the seven reasons why men and women, of course, obey.  And I'm going to briefly quote from each of them.  But if you're interested in reading the full book, which I highly recommend you do, I will link it in the description.  Starting off, the first reason for obedience is habit.  As everybody knows, habits are extremely difficult to break.  And even if we do have gripes about the state of things, accepting our imperfect reality seems better to us than taking on the daunting prospect of change.  Conversely, the book explains that habit ceases to be a reason for obedience in times of political crisis, kind of similar to what we're experiencing now as a consequence of COVID.  Despite many of us not wanting to alter our habits, our habits were forcibly altered for us.  Many of us could no longer go to work, visit our friends, attend church, and so on.  The second reason for obedience is moral obligation, which is obviously a motive that is very often found in religion.  But politically speaking, the book suggests that some see it as a moral obligation to, one, obey for the good of society, two, due to the ruler having superhuman factors such as being a supernatural being or a deity, which isn't something that I think applies to too many Americans, although I have seen a few boomers here and there refer to Trump as some kind of chosen one.  Three, people see it as a moral obligation to obey because they perceive the command as being legitimate owing to its source and issuer.  For example, a mayor or a police officer.  And four, people see it as a moral obligation to obey due to conformity of commands to accepted norms.  For example, most people believe that a command such as not committing murder is a moral command and therefore they obey it.  The third reason for obedience is self-interest.  And this is perhaps one of the more common motives nowadays.  For example, most big corporations are amoral and seek to piggyback off of current social and political trends in order to gain money status and approval.  Just look at all the corporations that suddenly became champions of social justice after the death of George Floyd.  None of them gave a crap about police brutality and Black Lives Matter until it became in their interest to care.  This self-interest can of course also extend to individuals.  Famous and non-famous people have a lot to gain by falling in line.  Or as the book points out, there is also a negative self-interest wherein the person doesn't obey simply because they're going to gain something but so they won't lose everything.  Their reputations, jobs, social standing, and future career prospects.  The fourth reason for obedience is psychological identification with the ruler.  meaning that people have a close emotional connection with the ruler, regime, or the system.  I imagine you would have encountered a lot of this in, for example, communist Russia or Nazi Germany.  The fifth reason for obedience is an extremely common one today, and that is zones of indifference.  meaning that even if people are not fully satisfied with the state of things, they have a margin of indifference or a margin of tolerance for the negative aspects of their society and government.  The sixth reason for obedience is the most obvious reason, and it's the one that I mentioned at the beginning of this video, and that is fear of sanctions, which generally involve the threat or the use of some form of physical violence against the disobedient subject and induce obedience by power merely coercive, a power really operating on people simply through their fears.  And lastly, the seventh and final reason for obedience is the absence of self-confidence among subjects.  Meaning that many people simply don't have sufficient confidence in themselves, their judgment, and their capacities to make themselves capable of disobedience and resistance.  Thanks to the internet, I observe this motive quite often.  Thousands of people decry on the daily that they're miserable with the state of things and yet they do nothing because they have no confidence in their personal ability to lead, to organize a peaceful protest, to start a movement, and so on.  One consequence of the lack of self-confidence is a tendency to avoid responsibility, to seek to delegate it upward, and to attribute greater authority to superiors in the hierarchy than is in fact merited.  People lacking self-confidence may seek a ruler, a leader, a despot, a tyrant who will relieve them of responsibility for guiding their present and their future.  Wrote Rousseau, slaves lose everything in their chains, even the desire of escaping from them.  They love their servitude, as the comrades of Ulysses loved their brutish condition.  Even where subjects wish to alter the established order, they may remain submissive because they lack confidence in their ability to act effectively in bringing about the desired changes.  As long as people lack self-confidence, they are unlikely to do anything other than obey, cooperate with, and submit to their rulers.  Even if Gene Sharp missed a few of the reasons why people choose to obey, I certainly think that he hit upon the fundamental ones, which I think that many of us can use to better understand our own motivations.  It seems that in many countries, people regard their governments as immense bastions of power, far too powerful to ever be challenged, for example, by a nonviolent resistance from its people.  But where does this power of government come from?  Is the power inherent and self-perpetuating?  I fully agree with Jean Sharp's argument that a government's power is dependent on the goodwill, decisions, and support of the people.  In other words, a government only has power because people give it power through their cooperation and obedience.  Therefore, if we are unhappy with the state of our governments and overall societies, It's our duty to rectify the issues that are plaguing them.  Where we will end up is our own responsibility and will be the result of our own choice, conscious or unconscious, of whether or not we are going to obey.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.
