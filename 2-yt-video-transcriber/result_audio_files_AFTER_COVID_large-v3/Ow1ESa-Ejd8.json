It is unsustainable to have over 1,000 foreign military bases while Russia has less than 30 and China has less than 10.  That's insane.  Billions of dollars are wasted every year to support a bloated empire, to support a bloated military industrial complex that wreaks havoc and bombs and launches drones and does covert actions and coup d'etats and regime change around the world.  What have we gained from 20 years of this quote-unquote war on terror?  Today, the Taliban is stronger than in 2001.  That's a failure of both political parties and the U.S.  empire.  It's a failure.  We've lost all the wars that we fought in.  Iraq is a catastrophe.  Libya is a disaster.  They're selling slaves there.  Syria is also a disaster.  Everywhere we've gone, we've wreaked destruction and nothing has been gained.  Nothing.  So the first thing to do is to cut the military, retract all troops from abroad.  Bring them home and put all that money, all the trillions of dollars we spent on war and destruction and empire back into building infrastructure in this country, providing free health care, free education, child care.  If you really believe in family values and are pro-life and are committed to the people and the working class, then you have to be against the wars of empire.  You have to be against all the violence that we reap all over the world. ",

You were in the military.  This isn't like.  you're coming from a place of idealism and theory.  You've literally practiced it and witnessed it up close.
