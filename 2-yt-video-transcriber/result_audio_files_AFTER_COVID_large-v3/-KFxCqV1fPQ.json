            "text": "It's a tale of two cities.  Wuhan, the biggest city in central China, is bearing the heaviest weight amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.  According to the World Health Organization and China State Media, this is the place where massive disease control measures are being taken.  But anecdotal evidence and online videos from Wuhan tell a different story.  Among the mysteries revolving around the outbreak, two questions are critical.  How many lives has the virus claimed?  And how many of those lives are only known to local officials and hidden from the rest of the world?  On February 4th, NTD's undercover investigator talked with executives from some of Wuhan's biggest funeral homes.  The conversations show a simple yet heart-wrenching fact.  The math simply doesn't add up.  The number of bodies being cremated just doesn't match the government's figure by a large margin. ",

            "text": "Hello, it's like this.  I'm here to check and ask.  With the current epidemic, we can see that it is still rising.  With your current workload, can you finish it?  With your current workload, how do you feel now?  Can you finish it?  If you increase it, the pressure will be very high.  You have to tell the truth.  I will tell you the truth.  I am about to collapse.  Oh, tell me why.  I am under a lot of pressure now.  Why?  This is the problem.  Now the center of gravity is the hospital.  We are going to be forgotten.  Our daily supply and consumption is four to five times as usual.  Our staff has no news from the beginning of the new year to now.  Oh, that's right.  And you still can't get the supply of personnel.  Well, then you now say four to five times a day, like yesterday, how much do you think?  I can't tell you this number because I don't know your real identity.  You just make a call, I don't know.  According to the requirements of the superior, this number can't be said by anyone.  Yes, I know.  Your real identity.  This can be said.  I can't tell you the exact number.  I'm asking you now.  I just want to know this situation.  Then, let's see how many personnel you need.  Okay, you... Okay, you just tell me the general situation.  I just need to understand.  Oh, four to five times.  Then when did you start this business?  When did you start being so nervous?  Since the 29th of that month, the volume has been constantly rising.  You mean... It has reached the highest point.  It reached the highest point yesterday.  When did it reach the highest point?  Yesterday was the highest point.  You mean the 29th of that month, the 29th of December, right?  The 29th of that month should be... On the 23rd or 22nd of January, I started to feel a little dizzy.  I started to feel a little dizzy.  Oh, so now you are on the third island every day?  It's not called the third island or zero island.  There is no third island.  It's not called the third island or zero island.  It's not called the third island or zero island.  It's not called the third island or zero island.  It's not called the third island or zero island.  Oh, you must be tired.  How many people do you need to increase the number of people?  How many people do you need to increase the number of people?  How many people do you need to increase the number of people?  How many people do you need to increase the number of people?  How many stoves do you have in total?  You do this.  Oh.  Oh.  I'll tell you what, I'll immediately send someone to repair your stove.  What do you need now?  I'll ask you, what do you need now?  Except for people, more than 40 people.  I need people now.  I need people now.  My people are too tired.  Too tired.  I can't get any news today.  You just said three shifts.  I can't do two shifts now.  Then your two shifts will take 24 hours.  Then one shift will take more than 10 hours.  Oh.  Oh.  Then how many people can you pick up in one car?  In the past, one car could pick up one person.  Now, we have removed those things inside.  At least pick up two.  And then remove some of my used to not be an ice car.  Pick up seven or eight at a time.  How long does it take to process one body?  50 minutes.  Can it be shortened to half an hour?  It can't be shortened.  Some places say it can be shortened to 40 minutes.  I don't know.  Oh, your 50 minutes.  Up to 50 minutes.  Yes, 50 minutes.  That's enough work.  Oh, you're really busy.  No, I didn't say that.  I'm going to be crazy.  That's it.  Then you don't need to work at night in the normal situation, right?  According to Wuhan's custom, it's 12 o'clock.  It's 12 o'clock.  It's 12 o'clock.  It's 12 o'clock.  It's 12 o'clock.  Let me tell you, once the body is brought in, the fire will not stop immediately.  Oh, that's enough now.  There's another one.  So can you do it every day now?  Can you finish it now?  Did you press it down and put it on the second day?  The fire and the suppression are not too serious.  As long as the body is in the hospital, we can't bring it in in time.  Oh, that's the car.  What's the name of our Wuhan's dog brother, Ma Guixiang?  What do you want us to do?  Take us away in an hour and a half?  You can't do that, can you?  Just go out and take us away.  Oh, that's... That's not official.  At least your secretary should... He's going to file a complaint against us.  He's going to interrogate us.  Because after he died, he asked us to take him away in an hour and a half.  Yes, that's... Can you do that?  Then you call him to send a car.  You call him to send a car over.  You're responsible for burning it.  We don't have anyone.  Then you call the secretary.  You said you brought a person over to me.  You said you called him to send a car over.  You said we didn't have a car.  We can do it.  But there's not that many cars.  I'm afraid of the government.  My director is afraid of the government.  He dare to say it.  So this is the thing.  But your secretary reported to us that you are guaranteed to complete it.  And now there is still potential.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  I believe you.  I believe you.  How many cars did you pull yesterday?  How many times did you run?  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter if you don't say it.  At least I should solve it for you soon.  The second one is to ask your secretary to send you a car.  How many cars do you need to increase?  Now the problem is the coldness.  The car can give me three or four more liters.  I can't stand the cold now.  People give you four or five more people.  It's been an hour.  People keep moving in and out to pick up people.  Oh, my God.  Now all of us are going to Lan Tongzi.  All of us are going to Lan Tongzi.  All of us are going to Lan Tongzi.  All of us are going to Lan Tongzi.  All of us are going to Lan Tongzi.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  \u90a3\u4e0a\u5468\u6570\u5b57\u589e\u52a0\u662f\u4ece\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019,\u4ece12\u6708\u4efd,12\u670820\u53f7\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86,\u5bf9\u5427,\u5341\u51e0\u53f7\u3002.  Yesterday, actually, I'm telling you, yesterday was not the highest.  Now it's still going up.  So why do I have to call to ask you about your tolerance?  That's the reason.  I really can't tolerate it.  I told my chief yesterday, I said, I'm going crazy.  I'm going to jump off the building myself.  I said, you scared me to death.  I can't do it.  I said, after the people in the hospital died, this is what Secretary Ma said, After they died, within 30 minutes, the hospital was completely destroyed.  Within 30 minutes, the police department was able to complete the work of the family members.  The civil service department took the bodies away within 30 minutes.  What kind of bullshit is this?  There is no common sense.  There are only a few hospitals in Wuhan.  How big is our area?  My car can't reach it in half an hour.  Yes.  Do you know how the other hospitals are doing?  They are only worse than me, not better than me.  Oh.  Do you communicate with him?  Yes, we do.  Which hospital have you been communicating with recently?  I've been communicating with Han Kou Hospital.  His business volume is bigger than mine.  His pressure is bigger than mine.  Which hospital are you talking about?  Han Kou Hospital in Wuhan.  Oh, his pressure is bigger than yours.  His volume is bigger than mine.  What is the scope of their service?  His service is in Han Kou.  It's in Wuhan.  Yes.  I did a statistics a few days ago.  I did a statistics a few days ago.  I did a statistics a few days ago.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, there are some problems.  You have worked hard.  You have worked hard.  We will teach them to solve these problems as soon as possible.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What I said is based on the party letter of a Communist Party member.  I see.  That's it.  Thank you for your hard work.  Take care. ",

They agreed to give you a car as soon as possible.  But they also said a situation.  I'm thinking that this situation may not be enough to communicate.  He said, you guys, like you guys yesterday, don't have to be so busy.  Maybe you have 40 or 50 people there, don't have to be so busy.  I just want to verify now, is it like this?  Leader, can you send someone to my place?  Don't ask me.  When the car is in my car, Right, now it's like this.  Why did the Central Asian Church send us here?  It's because we don't understand some of the situations.  These leaders sometimes, for the sake of the local work, the results, the image, sometimes they don't tell us the real situation.  So we have to come to you in person to ask about it.  That's the reason.  I want to talk to you about your responsibilities.  OK.  OK.  Um.  Um.  Um.  Oh, okay, I got it.  Okay.  Well, they still said half of it.  Oh, they just said half of it.  They just said that it seems that their work is very bad.  Sometimes they complain.  This seems to be... I know you guys are working very hard.  You guys are in the middle.  It's not easy for you to work in one line.  These leaders don't really understand the real situation.  Okay, I got it.  I really hope the central government will take care of it.  Okay, you've translated it.  Okay. ",
