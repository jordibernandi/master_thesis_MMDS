            "text": "Welcome back to Activate America.  Did you catch last week when former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a temporary global government to fight the Wuhan Coronavirus?  This is the same guy who, when he was Prime Minister 12 years ago, vowed to work with then-President-elect Barack Obama to create a New World Order where markets need morals and people come first.  He recommended using the 2008 financial crisis as an opportunity to restructure the global economy and the global order.  Now he's calling for a task force involving world leaders, health experts, and the heads of international organizations that would have executive powers to coordinate the response, according to the Guardian newspaper.  Unfortunately, we'd love to tell you that no one is thinking this is realistic, but after how jacked up governments are around the world right now, we'll tell you that this has always been the next step.  The founder of the John Birch Society, Mr.  Robert Welch, used to say that when the time came for the enemies of freedom to operate in the open, we'd see them proverbially running naked in the streets.  And friends, that time is now.  Even though things seem dark, this is our time to strike while they are in the open.  There are many out there that have labeled the John Birch Society as a bunch of conspiracy theorists, but folks, look around.  This organization has been speaking the truth for all of these decades.  The globalists are using the current health crisis to usher in solutions that throw out all of your rights, place you under house arrest, and make you participate in tanking one of the strongest economies we've seen in years.  They are not letting this crisis go to waste.  If we let them get away with it, then what signal does that send to them?  It tells them that we agree that our rights are conditional, that our rights are granted by government and can be revoked by the next biggest calamity.  Even though you and I know that our founding documents spell out something much different, if we don't stand up when our country needs us the most, then we may as well fall lockstep in with the globalists.  Unfortunately, the majority of our elected officials are already acting like globalists no matter which party they're in.  And did you see what happens when they're challenged on this by one of their colleagues?  Representative Thomas Massey tried to force a roll call vote, which would have put each congressman on record for their vote on the stimulus bill.  Instead of doing the responsible thing, they ganged up on him and dishonestly and immorally smeared him.  Representative Massey is one of the most principled constitutionalists in Congress.  He has earned an overall Freedom Index score of 99%.  Instead of being ridiculed, he should have been awarded a medal.  For his courage and commitment to the Constitution, we suggest all Americans call Congressman Massey's office and thank him for his principled stand.  His contact information is included in the video description.  Then contact your congressman and tell them you are sorely disappointed in their vote if they voted to support it and that they should have supported Representative Massey in voting against the bill.  Unfortunately, many Americans think that government is here to solve our problems.  They don't see that government is a negative force that needs to be controlled through constitutional limitations.  So let's take advantage of the opportunity to show them the proper role of government as set up by our founding fathers.  an excellent way to do so is to host a workshop and take them through the Constitution.  Though it seems hard, it's actually easier than you think.  For years, JBS has sold a six-part DVD lecture series that you can use to host the workshop.  It even comes with an instruction manual and lecture guides that you can use to review key talking points.  It's called The Constitution is the Solution.  It's so easy that. ",
