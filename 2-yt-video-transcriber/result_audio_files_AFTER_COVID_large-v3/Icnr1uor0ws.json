Today's topic is... Something I am very not pleased to be having to make, but we're just going to do it.  You see, the thing with rap videos is you don't really care about the lyrics.  You just write words on a paper, come up with a cool beat, and then put all the money into the production budget to make you look like you're rich and famous.  So my goal in this is to make myself look like the biggest douche canoe I can possibly be.  Yes, douche canoe.  It's a real word.  Look it up.  So, I am going to try to look like the biggest idiot possible and, uh, throw some hot beats down as the kids... Just roll the video. ",

Anyways, go to blackriflecoffee.com, check out our Coffee Club subscription, and comment below, and maybe you guys can pick the next genre and topic.  This is a very fun project for me, and I hope you guys like it, so... Do all that and we'll see you next time. ",
