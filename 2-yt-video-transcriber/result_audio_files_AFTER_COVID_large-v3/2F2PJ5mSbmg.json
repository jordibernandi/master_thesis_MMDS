            "text": "Hi, I want to talk to you today about ontology.  What is ontology?  Some people use it as a term.  that just means the same thing as metaphysics, but I think it's actually to be distinguished.  At least as I use the term, they're slightly different.  Ontology is really the most central part of metaphysics.  These days, the word ontology is associated very strongly with the thought of Willard Van Orman Quine.  Quine was for many years a professor at Harvard.  He was perhaps the most prominent philosopher of at least the middle part of the 20th century.  Here is how he expresses it at the very beginning of a famous paper called On What There Is.  A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.  or over.  in a word, everything, and everyone will accept this answer is true.  However, this is merely to say that there is what there is.  There remains room for disagreement over cases, and so the issue has stayed alive thousands of centuries.  Indeed it has.  So we can think of it this way.  Ontology is the most central part of metaphysics.  To put it in a diagram, we can think of ontology as being something like this circle, and then metaphysics as a larger area inside it.  If ontology's central question is, what is there?  Then metaphysics, in focusing on the same question, is mission, ontology, but it's doing a little bit more.  It's asking what those things are.  And so, not just what is there, a matter of listing the basic constituents of the universe, what Bertrand Russell referred to as the furniture of the universe, but then describing the furniture, explaining the relations of the bits of furniture to one another, and so on.  So we could think of metaphysics, this larger circle, as a matter of not only answering this, a matter of supplying the constituents, but also then talking about what those things are, and focusing on questions of essences, of natures, of relations, among these things of various kinds.  One of the basic tasks of metaphysics is to develop a theory of categories.  So what does that involve?  Well, it involves listing the basic kinds of constituents of the universe, if at least that's your conception of categories.  Not everyone's is.  But then to try to characterize something about how they relate to one another.  And so you might say it is a mission of, in part, ontology, labeling the basic kinds of constituents of the universe, but then also often talking about their relations or talking about how they fit together as part of a larger whole.  So we might say a categorical scheme is one that has the task of ontology as its basic mission, but then usually includes other kinds of metaphysical questions as well.  Let's focus on the task of ontology.  How do we go about thinking about what there is?  Quine suggests it in these terms.  He says, first, focus on the general question of what theories we ought to adopt about the world, and then ask, what do those theories say that there is?  So Quine says, discourse about the world in general.  But I will tell you, given some discourse, given some theory, how to actually think about the question of what it implies, about what there is.  So for Quine, there are really a couple of questions.  One is a broad background question, not specifically a question of ontology at all, but you might say a necessary precondition for thinking about ontological matters, or at least for settling the ontological.  But now, we can also ask then, To be is to be a value of a variable.  What on earth does that mean?  Well, it's couched in the language of first-order logic.  And so Klein is assuming that we can take whatever theory we have and formalize it, expressing it in something like first-order terms.  There's a big issue here.  What if we can't formalize it in first-order Higher-order logic?  What if we need modal terms?  What if we need all sorts of other things?  After all, first-order logic is really just a certain part of logic.  It's not the entire thing.  Quine treats it as the canonical language of science.  He assumes that everything is ultimately expressible in first-order terms, at least if it's properly scientific and is thereby something like a scientific description of the world.  I doubt that, but for the moment, let's just go with that and assume that what we're doing is saying within our theory that certain things exist.  We're saying certain things are true.  We're interpreting phrases like something or everything or it or other terms in terms of a domain.  So the thought is a theory of some kind has a domain associated.  It's a domain of objects.  a set of objects typically, but we could say more generally a class of objects, and that indicates what, according to that theory, exists.  At least we can say, well, the things that have to be in that domain for the theory to be true exist.  Well, at least exist according to the theory.  Notice a domain might have all sorts of other things that are really not needed for the theory to be true, so it's a question of what the theory implies exists.  Does it directly state that it exists?  Does it entail that it exists?  So it's not just anything that happens to be in that domain.  It's the things that have to be there for the theory to be true.  Because Quine's theory has this shape, it's sometimes been described as a flat ontological approach.  That is to say, everything is just on the same level.  What is there in the world?  Well, there's this.  We look at a scientific theory, for example, a theory of physics, and we say, what are the basic constituents of reality according to that approach to physics?  We examine it by saying, what's in the domain?  What does it entail?  exists?  And it might be point masses.  It might be electromagnetic fields.  It might be strings.  It might be whatever.  It depends on the theory.  But then we say, well, all right, that's what the domain of that theory consists in.  If we end up saying that is a theory about the world that we ought to adopt, then those things are granted ontological status.  Those things exist according to our philosophical views.  we don't find out anything about relations or essences or natures from that.  At least that's the way Quine often approaches it.  But actually it's not quite so simple, because different kinds of objects that are related by theory, that are explained by a theory in general, may have relations to one another within the theory.  And it might be also that the various theories we adopt have relations to one another.  Here's a good example.  We might build mathematics up using some theory of sets.  sets and classes, depending on whether we use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, for example, which quantifies over.  Or maybe we think about von Neumann-Goethe-Brenai set theory or Kelly-Morse set theory, something that includes not only sets but classes in its domain.  And then we think about these in more general settings and think, well, all right, good.  We build up mathematics according to such a theory of sets and classes.  But then, what about numbers?  What about functions?  We have arithmetic, which quantifies over numbers.  We have various theories that quantify over functions, relations.  Others that quantify over things like groups, spaces, rings, fields, and so forth.  But we can think, well, all of those can be built up out of sets, out of classes.  And so one way of thinking about this is to say, we don't really need numbers.  We don't really need groups for really need functions in our domain, we can think about those as definable in terms of sense.  So, we should really think of this as not quite as flat as it initially seems.  We can think about all sorts of things being in the domain of mathematics taken at large, for example, but then say, well, we can't really build the rest of mathematics out of certain parts of it.  Russell and Whitehead famously did that in their work Principia Mathematica.  It was carried out on a different foundation by the French mathematicians that went by the name Bourbaki.  later in the 20th century.  It was really part of the project, you might say, of 19th century mathematics to construct the calculus from a sparse foundation to make sure it had a clear and consistent foundation.  Presumably, we can do the same thing in other realms of science too.  Biologists may talk about animals, so forth.  Geologists may talk about minerals of various kinds, but do we really need those as independent constituents of the world?  Maybe in the end we can reduce those.  Those can be viewed as complexes of which, well, chemistry and then ultimately physics are the ultimate theories.  that a certain structure emerges of these constituents as well.  Perhaps we want to say that matter of structure belongs in metaphysics more generally because it has to do with the relations among the constituents.  Maybe instead we want to say we can start with a very sparse set of constituents and then build other constituents out of them.  So maybe we distinguish some of these as basic and some of these as constructed.  But however we do that, we're going to have something beyond a purely flat list of things, it will not simply be a list of, oh, well, there are dogs and cats and sheep and goats and markers and whiteboards and people and so on and so forth.  It's instead going to be, first of all, general kinds of constituents.  We list the furniture in terms of general categories of things, not by listing each individual object.  And then we can distinguish some as basic sums constructed.  So on a certain conception, you might say this really should be focused on the question of what the basic constituents are, and then metaphysics more broadly on what we can construct out of that.  There's a final question I want to focus on.  of approaching questions like universals or abstract objects or really any kind of object at all, which is are these constituents of the universe that we're talking about independent of the mind?  Are they really out there in the world?  Are they in some way mind dependent?  So, with respect to these constituents, we can ask that fundamental question.  As I think of it, that's not strictly speaking maybe an ontological question.  It is more a metaphysical question, but we can also put it in the category of ontology.  This is another place where the boundaries of ontology are somewhat vague.  So, among these things, the question of the essences, the natures, the relations, we can ask specifically about the relation to the mind.  And so we can raise the question of mind dependence or mind independence.  That is a basic metaphysical question.  And it's going to divide realists from conceptualists, for example, when we think about abstract entities or universals.  And we can raise the same sort of issue about all sorts of other things.  In fact, we can raise it about this entire class of constituents.  The idealists will say, look, everything that there is is actually mind-dependent.  The realist is going to say, no, at least some of these things are mind-independent.  That's a fundamental metaphysical divide, and it's one that ontology, in a certain sense, can be neutral with respect to.  If we at least adopt this Quinian perspective, we can say it's really a question of what theories to adopt and what those theories relationship is to the mind?  That's another question.  We hope that we have theories that will answer that question, but it's a matter of filling in a specific kind of relation.  So, as I think of it at least, that's part of the broad task of metaphysics, not necessarily the task of ontology itself. ",
