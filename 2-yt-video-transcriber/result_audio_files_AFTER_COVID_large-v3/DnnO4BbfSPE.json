You seem to be having trouble with your family, Clarice.  Why?  Silence!  I am in charge here.  Do you feel in charge?  Yes, that's quite enough of that.  What do you want?  It's not about what I want, stranger.  From now on, it's all about what you want.  Explain yourself, stranger!  This is madness to me!  Madness, I say!  Are you stressed?  Are you weighed down by your mask of happy tears as it tugs on the crushed mudpack of your angry tears?  Are you having trouble making your mind up?  Well, you don't have to!  Ever!  With New!
