And we have here, for example, the asylum seekers in receipt of Section 95 support by the top five nationalities in the region.  We've got the East Midlands, the East of England, London, North East, North West, Northern Ireland, Scotland, South East.  And guess what?  The numbers of people who are being housed in this country is going up and up again.  And it says here immigration statistics.  This is just for the year ending March 2020, by the way.  So we don't even know how much numbers have risen since then.  But I can tell you that Nigel Farage probably can tell us that it's risen by approximately three to four thousand.  Nigel Farage joins us right now.  He is, of course, the leader of the Brexit Party, the man who has single handedly brought this issue to the fore and to the front line.  and centre of the media.  The rest of the media, Nigel, of course, have forgotten about it now because they did it last week, but we haven't forgotten about it.  Very good morning to you. ",

It took me a very long time to get it there, and you were very helpful with that, Mike.  But that story they are now covering, and as soon as this storm passes and the dinghies start to come again, that will be talked about.  What we... tend to focus on through the media are the numbers being taken into the reception center at Dover.  What's not being discussed enough are those that are landing on our beaches and simply disappearing.  And there are plenty of those as well.  When it comes to where everyone's being housed, I guess of the things that I covered, the one that did get the most coverage was the constituency in Priti Patel's own constituency, the Rivenhall Hotel.  Now, of course, that was an acute embarrassment to the Home Secretary.  I can tell you that the migrants in that hotel have now been removed.  I don't know where they've gone to, but they've been removed.  But since I started exposing the hotels, I have literally had hundreds, perhaps even into the thousands of people reporting to me from all over the country.  Hotels being filled, empty offices being converted into residential accommodation.  private houses, you know, council housing being repurchased by councils.  From what I can make out, it's the northwest of England that is bearing the biggest burden of this.  What I'm also certain of is there is a growing sense of anger in these communities.  Anger ",

All the language that gets used in British media is about asylum seekers, people seeking refuge.  The correct word in the overwhelming majority of cases is illegal immigrants who come into this country via criminal gangs, who've come into this country because the pull factors here are so great.  Now, we keep hearing tough words from Priti Patel.  We know that Boris Johnson is now under huge pressure from... at least 40 of his own backbenchers.  And we are told that some primary legislation may get put before Parliament this autumn.  But the problem is how many more thousands will come and need to be housed and put pressure onto those communities before anything passes into law.  And I actually think that the government needs to say to the European Union, as part of the negotiations that are ongoing, we are overriding the Dublin regulations, which allows people effectively not to claim asylum in France, but to come to Britain.  And we're going to overrule them immediately.  That's the only way we're going to stop this flow this year. ",
