But they're met with cross-examination based upon certain particular stereotypes about male aggression and male sexual aggression.  So for example, an individual case that we had in common, where an individual was being cross-examined on how they were kissing with a young lady.  And the idea was that while kissing, you must have sex on your mind.  And so the idea was that it's preposterous to assume that when the accused indicated or was trying to say that there was a different level of intimacy between kissing and actual having intercourse with somebody who they've just sort of met and they're getting to know, that that was really quite preposterous.  And this is a really... difficult type of stereotype that we're still trying to root out of the justice process.  Because as the criminal justice process has moved forward in recognizing stereotypes involving female complaints, we still see a perpetuation of cross-examination and reasoning based upon male stereotypes of aggression and sexual aggression.  And we have to really push the narrative to get judges and prosecutors to understand that this is an impermissible line of cross-examination and reasoning to try and discount the evidence of a male accused.

            "text": "Well, and it's interesting too because sometimes these stereotypes are actually the same stereotype operating in reverse.  So there's a case that's going to Supreme Court now where they're saying they looked at text messages prior to an encounter and they said, well, the guy was expecting sex, but more significantly, the woman said that she didn't want to have sex that weekend.  So they found that she wouldn't have consented.  Well, if a woman can't, you know, give advanced consent saying, you know, she's more likely to consent than her saying no, I mean, she's still open to change her mind.  So it's essentially the same myth, but they operate really kind of hide themselves when they're operating in reverse and they're playing out against men. ",

            "text": "Yeah, I mean, courts have to be very careful about what assumptions they want to make about what a complainant will do.  Even though we're rooting out the stereotypes that we know that lead to impermissible reasoning and really erroneous findings, we still have to be very careful about how people will change their minds or how human interaction really plays out in the course of a relationship or the interaction.  But similarly, against men, there is a whole host of male stereotypes that are playing out in cross-examination to try and suggest that the evidence of a particular male accused is implausible or preposterous or not credible or reliable.  And we have to push that narrative, and we're working very hard to do that.  So there's the case, I may mispronounce it, Chepik, which has come out from the Court of Appeal, which is a very strong direction to the courts, to the trial courts, to not use particular male stereotypes of aggression and sexual aggression in order to discount evidence.  In spite of that, we're still seeing this line of cross-examination.  And, you know, we talk also about We've spoken a lot about how text messaging is really quite prevalent because amongst younger people, younger than me, text messaging is quite common.  And so after an encounter or an evening, it may come out a day later or two days later that somebody makes an accusation.  The female says, I was very uncomfortable.  This was not what I expected.  And I feel that I've been wronged in some way.  And then the man will respond. ",
