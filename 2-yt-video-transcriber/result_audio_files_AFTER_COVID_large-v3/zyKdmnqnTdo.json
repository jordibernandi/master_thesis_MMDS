            "text": "Hello there.  It looks like Brussels saw the Irish coming when you look at what Ireland's ended up with from the EU budget negotiations.  Firstly please subscribe and like this video to give my channel a boost and I'm always uploading new content so please do check back daily.  the EU Council was delighted to have got a budget and coronavirus package through.  But in the meantime, despite the EU Council getting unanimous approval from Member State leaders for their new budget starting next year, Brussels still has to get it through the EU Parliament.  And euobserver.com has reported that the European Parliament is gearing up for a fight over the budget deal agreed by EU leaders earlier this week, saying in a draft resolution that it is not acceptable as it stands now.  And Euronews followed that up with A total of 465 MEPs voted in favour of a resolution that threatens to withhold their backing for the deal.  The resolution states that MEPs do not accept the terms of the EU's 1.07 trillion euro draft budget that was drawn up after four days of negotiations between members of the bloc's leaders this week.  Now, importantly, those 465 MEPs make up 62% of the whole Parliament of 751 MEPs.  And I wouldn't be at all surprised if the Irish MEPs also voted for it, because their country has jumped right up the league tables in terms of net contributions over the budget period of 2021 to 2027.  Last year, the BBC reported that Ireland was ninth down the list of net contributors in 2017 and tenth on the list of net contributions per capita of its population.  And Statista.com says that in 2018, in percentage terms of paying into the EU budget, Ireland was twelfth on the list, putting in 1.69%.  But it's now emerging that over the next budget period, Ireland will be fifth down the net contributor list, and would you believe it, second on the net contribution per capita list, with only Luxembourg ahead of them.  So while the Irish government was negotiating Brexit on behalf of an EU that has been trying to fleece the UK, Brussels has been busy lining up the next bunch of cash cows, and the Republic of Ireland came out near the top.  Writing in the Irish news site Grit.com, John McGurk says, In terms of total contribution, in raw numbers, Ireland will contribute about 16 billion euros net to the European Union, making us the fifth biggest contributor, while Spain and Italy, countries with many times our population, will actually benefit to the tune of about 130 billion euros between them.  And I'll repeat that figure, 16 billion euros net, not gross.  So think how big the UK bill would have been.  And McGurk also says that figure of 16 billion euros represents 3,201 euros per person in Ireland, twice the amount that a German will pay.  Think about that.  And the Irish, he says, will pay twice over for anything they do get back.  And further, that the Irish media has buried this cost and is only interested in reporting the bit they will get back, with McGurk writing, Let's be clear about this.  The government secured an unbelievably terrible deal and it is banking on the media to simply not tell the voting public about it.  Does all that sound familiar, Brexiteers?  But the Irish might be facing a double whammy, as I'm sure that Brussels has not shelved its plans for the harmonisation of business taxes.  Something that might tempt companies like Google to relocate elsewhere in the face of a potentially large hike in tax rates from the currently very low level they enjoy, courtesy of Dublin.  And as far as I can see, the Irish political classes are overwhelmingly pro-EU, so I doubt they'll be wanting to rock the boat any time soon.  And I also doubt they'll be wanting to highlight this stitch-up to their own voters either.  Anyone for an i-rexit?
