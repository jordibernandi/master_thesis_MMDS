            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is how to read her thought resume.  when a potential employer looks at one's resume.  The interviewer is taking into account many different factors.  The history of employment, which includes the types of jobs held, as well as the length of time doing those jobs in those career fields, whether it be blue collar or professional.  You should view a potential relationship in the same manner.  For starters, you are reading her resume not only to guess the amount of guys that she has dealt with in which we call the body count, but also the types of guys that she has been with as well as the length of time spent in those relationships.  This is just important as the overall body count.  These factors have a deep and profound effect on the thoughts and behavior patterns of the female you are in a relationship with.  These effects are far reaching and will have its effect throughout her lifetime.  So first, let's look at the implications of the types of guys that she has been in relationships with.  If she has been, for instance, thuggo in them all her life and you are not thuggo, be aware because she will probably cheat on you with thuggo.  If she claims to be older and more mature and past liking Thuggo and she's 35 plus, more than likely she is lying and will most likely find a young Thuggo to play sugar mama too or even cheat on you.  One doesn't just stop liking Thuggo.  She will always want him even at 60 years old.  Now, he may look different to her at that age, older thuggo who may have a substance problem, but he's still in the street and in some cases a fiend.  And yes, many older females are with such men.  Now, much love for thuggo.  This is not an anti-thuggo video.  But I want to use that as an example, him as an example to express that her type will always be her type no matter what.  She is who she is and she is the choices that she makes.  She likes who she likes.  And this won't change.  So if you are not thug or be aware, if she has a long history with him, as well as whatever type she has a history of.  If you want to know those types, see my video called the types of men that she cannot resist.  And oh, yeah, I'm talking about your girl.  Now, it's called the imprint.  It's called her pattern, her history of the men she has dealt with, which will determine the future of the men she will deal with or return to.  And this is where you come in.  Again, for instance, if you are not one of the specific guys she is used to, you may just be a break from her norm, but rest assured that she will be back to her true type even if it's a result of her infidelity.  She is with you because she may want a little variety temporarily, but we'll return surely to what is familiar to her.  So it is important that when she begins to tell you about the men of her past, that you listen.  It will tell you everything you need to know about her and her past so that you can predict her future.  Now, the next item that we consider when we're reading her thought resume is is the length of time spent in relationship.  This is important.  In her history, the carousel is not only the main concern that you should be aware of.  Her being with one man in the past, be it married on paper or not, can still be a hindrance to her future ability to pair bond.  If she has been continuously with the same guy for 5, 10, 15 or more plus years, her ability to receive and love another man is more than difficult, if not virtually impossible.  And what I mean is that she can't strongly emote over and over again.  Her emotions wear thin.  Now, during a long term relationship, she has become and is and may always will be with that man when that relationship is over, whether he's alive or dead.  dead.  this is the result.  this is the consequence for you dealing with a fee fail who has been in a long-term relationship.  if you talk to a divorcee who spent many years with her ex or a widow notice that they will often speak of him in present tense speaking as though he's still there still relevant why?  Because he is still relevant in her life.  Memories are permanent.  I guarantee that the ex will come up often.  I've dealt with one woman in whom it took almost two years for her to stop mentioning her lover who passed away suddenly.  Again, why is this?  It's because his spirit lives on in her and with her.  She is him.  The food he liked, how she cooked it for him, how he kissed her, how he laid it down in the bed, the drinks that he liked.  the subjects that he talked about the person that he was.  she may just project that on you.  so after years of being with the same man he then is her only frame of reference.  so she will treat you like you are him plus she essentially views all guys as being the same anyway.  this is why she may make a statement like I know how to treat a man.  Instead of, I know how to please my man.  That's what she should be saying.  But notice what she is and what she isn't saying.  Think about it.  I had to teach many females how to be intimate with me the way that I like it.  Because her frame of reference was the last guy that she was with.  She slash.  they, the females, wanted to treat me like she treated him.  slash them in the past.  When it comes to intimacy, I have specific taste and ways I like things done.  so i had to break the thought from old habits that she had with the last dude.  i had to get her to unlearn him and learn me dang this is disgusting when you really think about it.  So again, since the succubus thinks that all guys are the same, she would definitely try to treat you the same way.  I had a chick that would always offer me a beer.  I had to mention to her a few times that I am not a beer drinker.  What she was doing was mixing me up with the last guy that she had been with for many years.  This is just a small example of the detriment of dealing with any used fee fail.  She has high miles not only from the carousel, but also from monogamy.  And we know monogamy for her is only short term.  But just one man can change her whole DNA.  And that one man is ultimately who she becomes in a long term relationship and also who you will be in a relationship with when you think about it.  Yes, if she is that man and you are with her, what does that mean?  Think about it.  She has his worldview and ways of thinking, his religion, his ideas and values.  She will be attempting to share those things with you, turning you into a version of her former lover.  You are getting with her, but also getting with the spirit of him that is left within her.  You see her face outwardly, but inwardly, she's a reflection of him.  Yuck.  And I know many guys don't care about the internals, but I do because the internals affect her externals constantly.  Just like a used vehicle, she is that has been sold with one single owner.  But although the vehicle has one single owner, it still has high mileage.  if that owner had such said vehicle for a prolonged period of time.  Now it's better than a vehicle with multiple owners, but mileage on it nonetheless.  So be aware of her history in this way, her thought resume.  Now, why do I keep talking about these subjects, the subject of thoughts, about things such as the thought resume?  It's because I'm your resident thoughtologist.  I'm the prosecutor in the court.  trying to convince you as the judge that the American fee fail is finished.  Trying to convince you as the prosecutor that you deserve better.  And that the beast should be found guilty and ignored as a consequence.  or a friends with benefits situation at the most.  Keeping it casual and occasional catch and release method.  Because they are so damaged.  that nothing in them or about them could we truly identify with as having and owning the title of wife.  That's the mission and that's the realization.
