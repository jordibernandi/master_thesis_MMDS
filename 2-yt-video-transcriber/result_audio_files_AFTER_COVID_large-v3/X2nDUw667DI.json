            "text": "Shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat.  Israel owes a debt of gratitude to President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by doing what no other president was willing to do from 1995 and move the US embassy From Tel Aviv to Yerushalayim, to Jerusalem.  Not only was this prophetic as it was done in the year of the Jubilee, 2017, but it also confirms the Bible where Yeshua, Jesus said, Jerusalem, Yerushalayim, the place where I put my name, which we know as believers in Yeshua is temporary, but it's pointing to the new heavens, the new earth, and the new Yerushalayim, the new Jerusalem.  And later on, the Golan Heights.  And now we have a place on the Golan Heights where it says, Trump, of course the enemy is furious.  We understand this whole election is spiritual warfare.  As a Jew born in Israel, I and many don't have an opportunity to go and to vote as we're not US citizens.  What we can do is we can pray for President Donald Trump and encourage you to go and vote for him.  We're living in a very important time, a time where Satan knows that his time is near, Revelation 12, 12, and he's furious.  And he's using everything he can to pull out his last ammunition.  If Joe Biden gets elected and we, as believers in Yeshua didn't pray.  And those that had the opportunity to vote, didn't vote for president Donald Trump.  Ezekiel chapter 33, verse six.  But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people.  And the sword comes and take someone's life.  That person's life will be taken because of their sin.  But I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.  If we don't get out there and vote, if we don't pray, if we allow Joe Biden to be elected and don't vote for Donald Trump, we are accountable and God will hold the blood on our hands.  These are very, very harsh and difficult words, but we need to realize this is a very, very crucial election.  As Joe Biden is an enemy of Israel and an enemy of the United States of America.  We cannot let this man in office.  As an Israeli, I'm asking you to vote for president Donald Trump.  We are living in prophetic times.  There has never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We cannot allow Joe Biden to be in office.  The man is a danger to United States.  He's a danger to Israel, and he's a danger to the world.  As believers in Jesus and Yeshua, we understand that God's will will be done.  But we have to do our part as ambassadors for the kingdom.  Pray, warn others, and those that have the opportunity to vote, please go out and vote for President Donald Trump.  Otherwise, a murderous leftist will be in government, and innocent babies will continue to be murdered.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we are called to love everyone, but we cannot love people over righteousness.  The gospel needs to be preached.  And if we know and see something that's not right and we don't warn the people, then we're just like those watchmen who do nothing to warn the people.  And therefore, God says that their blood is on their own hand and they'll be accountable.  If you love Yeshua and you love Israel and you love the United States of America, please go vote for President Donald Trump before it's too late, and this radical leftist will be in office, which we know it's just a demonic round working behind the scenes.  Thank you for joining me as we continue to pray.  Pray also for the peace of Jerusalem.  Psalms 122, verse 6.  This is a time for prayer.  This is a time to humble ourselves.  2 Chronicles 7, verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.  We're at a time right now where we need this prayer.  And I end with Numbers chapter 6, verse 24 to 26.  May the Lord bless you, and may the Lord keep you.  May the Lord make his face shine upon you, and be gracious to you.  May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you his peace.  In the mighty name of Jesus, Yeshua, we pray.  Amen.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings, And Lord of Lords, Al Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Vote for President Donald Trump. ",
