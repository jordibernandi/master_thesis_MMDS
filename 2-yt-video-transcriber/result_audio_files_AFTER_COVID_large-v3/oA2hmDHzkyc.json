            "text": "Oh Talking about trying too hard, I think this is the definition of trying too hard.  Now, let's not judge yet because maybe he has a special story.  Maybe he does cosplay.  We don't know.  But usually, when you dress up this much just to impress some ladies, you're trying too hard.  But again, we're going to reserve judgment, okay?  And I love that.  he came out to an ACDC song, right?  I said ACDC.  ACDC, I think is how you say it.  That voice man, that ACDC voice, most annoying but also the most iconic thing ever.  Let's go hear a story.  I've been a lifelong Marvel fan.  I've always wanted to be Iron Man.  I've collected a lot of Iron Man collectibles and I have an Iron Man armor set.  When I put it on, I just think I am Iron Man.  That man is playing Galaga.  Because I am really into technology.  So I have a lot of artificial intelligence.  I have two companies and an investment company.  A lot of people think I'm a rich second generation, but I've earned everything I've gained.  I became an entrepreneur after college.  The real hard part I had to live on, not a lot, man.  But I never give up.  I've never given up.  And after a long time, things got better for me.  In my life, I like the people who are spontaneous.  I am very happy that in my younger years, my life turned around for the better.  For a better tomorrow, just keep working hard.  You know, in this world, there's no real superheroes.  But I think I can be a regular person's hero.  As much as I want to hate him, I like his story, man.  Think about this.  What guy has not wanted to be a superhero when he was younger?  I think when I was younger, I liked Spider-Man.  I wanted to be Spider-Man.  Some people, like my Russian friend I always make fun of, want to be Batman.  Hearing his story, right?  He's had times of struggle.  He's worked for everything he's gained.  So yes, I can show off a little, right?  This is not stuff given to me.  I've worked hard and I've had success.  That's why he can afford the armor and have the cars and stuff like that.  So he has a good story.  He's honestly doing very well.  And you can see in the beginning when he came out with the armor and everything, all the women were like, oh my God, yeah, right?  So he's doing very well.  He better not eff it up, man.  Let's see what he does right.  Let's see what he does wrong.  I see that you're over six feet tall, man.  That's like what I want, you know?  I spot tall people and I just want to be brave and tell you I like you.  The thing about life is you have to learn to communicate with a little bit more subtlety than that.  Again, if you're like me, say whatever you want, right?  But you're on a dating show, you're trying to find someone, so don't just say, I like you because you're tall.  I'm so superficial.  Imagine if I went up to girl and I said, I like you because your tits are so big.  You know, it doesn't work that way.  This girl, you know, she seems like a more masculine type of girl.  Give her credit for trying to be blunt and forward with this guy.  But I don't think this guy is going to like that.  Oh, I only like you because you showed off your cars and now you're also really tall.  I want to know.  No.  You like to cook so many things.  You know, you just burn a lot of money.  So, like, people like you, for example, do you like yourself way too much?  You know, for example, if you have $10, and you invest it on yourself to play and stuff, and then you only give your girlfriend a little bit, That question, he better be careful, right?  She is asking him basically if he can care for more than himself.  He better be careful how he responds, right?  If you respond in the regular guy way, you're probably not going to get through to the ladies.  So this is a test, not just if he cares, but also can he communicate with the ladies?  We know guys and girls talk differently.  Guys and girls communicate differently.  So let's see how he responds.  Well, you got to love yourself first, right?  Then love other people.  You know, you take care of your own self and people around you will feel good.  That is a very kind of Elon Musk response or a Mark Zuckerberg type response, like showing you don't have much empathy, man.  Fail.  You failed, man.  You failed.  You can't talk like that.  Again, you're on there trying to find a date, right?  If you don't give an F and you're just talking to a lady, sure talk like that, but you're trying to find a date on there.  So I wouldn't talk like that.  And it's not that I disagree with him, but you could very easily say, I first need to take care of myself.  Because once I take care of myself, I'll be in the right mindset and have the right resources to take care of someone I love or someone I care about.  You see, just tweak it a little bit.  So it's not just about.  it's all about me and other people be happy for me.  Therefore, they're happy.  But it's like it's all about me.  And then all the energy that I devote to myself when there's excess of that, I can then use to take care of other people.  You see, there's like a slight tweak there.  And I think this guy just doesn't know how to communicate.  If you're in the business world all the time, you're kind of making money all the time, you probably just don't have much experience kind of talking to ladies and stuff like that.  And you just have to realize you can't talk to ladies like you're talking to an investor because ladies are emotional investors.  So now he's bringing in another one of his awesome motorcycle collections.  Look at this, man.  And look at all the people in the audience like, oh my God, this is so cool.  And so he's going to now explain what this is.  It's a 2010 model.  And there's only five of them in the world.  So he bought the second one and there's clothes attached to it too, like the guy's wearing.  He wanted, when he's 35, to have one, and he had one.  So someone's gonna try it right now.  This is officially, when I think he crosses the line, he's trying too hard now.  You've already established you're rich, you have a lot, you collect a lot of cool stuff.  Why don't you show us some other talents, some other hobbies?  All these women want is to make sure you can pay some attention to them and that you're interesting.  If you just make money, that's all you care about, and you care about Marvel Comics, maybe that's not enough.  So you could even take that Marvel Comics type of interest and show off something else besides collecting collectibles.  Maybe you like to draw or maybe you like to movie review or something.  You got to show a little bit more flavor, flair in your personality than just I'm rich.  I collect stuff and I like Marvel stuff because all you're communicating right now is you're a little needy.  You're a little insecure because you have to show off so much stuff.  You try too hard, man.  So what's a good lesson to life in general?  Don't over show off one thing.  Instead, give people glimpses of many things, many things that then they get to know you.  They can explore more in depth.  Right.  The foot is over there.  Okay.  All right, we know what that motorcycle is designed for now.  It's like a girl riding a horse.  You know how a girl riding a horse, it stimulates this area of her?  Well, now we know why that position, a woman riding it, it stimulates whatever.  Here's what happens now.  There are four girls that he can pick from, technically three, because the girl he picked in the beginning doesn't like him.  So he can insist on her and potentially get rejected.  Or there's three girls, including the one that liked him because of the height.  Those three girls he can go home with.  So now he has to find out more about them.  He takes the opportunity to know about their hobbies, even though he showed that he lacks hobbies.  But you know, sometimes you want people that compliment you, right?  You don't want people that are exactly like you.  So let's see what these ladies that like them, their hobbies are.  So out of the four girls, this girl likes to sing, especially folk songs.  Huang Mei Xi is a type of Chinese opera.  So, you know, she's just really cultured.  And she likes to perform.  So, I don't think this type of guy likes her.  So this is the girl that liked him for his height.  She likes to taste wine.  She likes... Okay, just any woman that drinks like this, be careful.  She also really loves extreme sports.  Look at that.  So I think that fits our guy's persona, right?  She loves to dive.  She loves to snowboard.  So that's probably why she really is attracted to him.  She's got a little bad side, a little devil side that he has too.  This is the girl he likes originally.  She feels like she's an old person in a young person's body.  So I guess this is Zekiya, if you guys remember Zekiya.  She likes to eat, she likes to be by herself, she likes to read, she likes to take pictures.  So she's like, oh, come take pictures with me.  And this girl likes him.  Her nickname was Liuliu because she was really little.  Um, this girl seems a little weird.  She's always been a little girl, she says.  A little girl like a weak girl.  So she seems like a mama's girl too.  She's a little dog.  She likes to eat sweets.  So I don't think our bad boy really likes her type of persona either.  I really think that girl that liked him for the height, if she approached it differently, she probably had a shot with him.  It's just that she indicated too quickly that she was superficial.  And then her hobbies, he's never going to express that he likes that type of girl.  He does like that kind of girl because you'd rather a type of woman like that.  You guys have a lot in common and you guys can do a lot together.  There's a level of understanding, a level of respect that you're starting here instead of here.  So I think he's actually very compatible with that girl that likes him for his height.  Unfortunately, she went about it wrong.  It's like the, if people are too similar, but then you see something that really ticks you off, then that's like the similarity becomes bad.  If people are very similar, but there's something really good in there, then you see only the good.  But I honestly think if this were like a romantic drama or something like that, the two of them would have ended up together.  They would have started out hating each other.  there'd be a lot of funny episodes in the dramatic TV series where they're kind of at each other's necks and stuff like that but eventually they would end it up together.  but unfortunately this is just one show.  it's not a drama so he's not gonna pick her.  the girl that likes dogs is pretty cool too but I think in his heart you know he likes excitement he probably doesn't even have time for her so he's not gonna have time for her dog.  the girl who likes to sing is a little chubby so he's not gonna go for her.  And then that girl that's like, oh, I'm just like an old person in my heart.  I just like taking pictures and being by myself.  He is a smart dude, right?  He's an investor.  He's made a lot of money.  He's smart.  He knows if I go for it, I'm probably going to get rejected.  It's not a good thing for me to do.  If you go to the original video, there is a lot of hate towards him, calling him ugly.  I think he did make the right decision.  You're kind of at a lose-lose.  None of the girls you really like.  No matter what, if you pick three of them, any three of them, you're not going to like it.  If you insist on the girl you really like, she's going to reject you.  So might as well just walk away.  In a very weird way, he's kind of going his own way, right?  He's showing, look, I got all this, but all y'all can't have it.  But he just went about it wrong.  Instead of showing that he's just there having fun, off as more, I want everyone to like me.  I want everyone to see this.  And it's all about mindset.  If he went about it differently, if he was more funny about it, maybe if he came out in rags or something and just like played around first, we can learn a really good lesson about how seriously you take yourself matters a lot.  And what you can tell is people that don't take themselves too seriously are very attractive.  This guy took himself way too seriously.  So all you can think of when you think of him is someone that tries too hard or someone that's insecure.  But if he had a little bit more sense of humor, if he just came out, just was a little bit more goofy slightly because he has a lot of things to back himself up.  He explored himself, opened himself up more.  I think this guy would have done really well.  It doesn't matter that quote unquote, the Chinese audience thinks he's ugly.  All right.  Money.  He's got the house.  He's got the cars and everything.  Once you make above a certain level, don't matter.  So we learned a lot of good lessons today.  I could summarize everything we learned, but instead I want you guys, if you don't think you learned a lot, watch this video again.  All right guys, Chinese dating, just by the way, guys, I started a new channel.  It's focused on entrepreneurship business.  It's funny that I'm analyzing this guy.  So I guess it's totally related, but it's focused on entrepreneurship, business, et cetera.  So I'm going to talk to business owners, talk to people who have made a name for themselves or trying to make a name for themselves in this mercantile capitalistic world.  Go to that channel.  Would love to have you guys as subscribers, especially those of you who like enjoying kind of those in-depth conversations, those real hardcore explorations into things.  I'm gonna focus that.  All right guys, more to come.  Let me know what you think.  And also if you want specific episode requests, let me know.  All right guys, this was Jerry.  Who was your favorite superhero as a kid? ",
