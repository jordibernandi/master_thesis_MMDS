            "text": "Hi everyone, Sandman here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Edtix, and here's what he has to say.  I'm new to MGTOW and appreciate your and other creators' work.  I'm from Eastern Europe and the dating market here isn't so bad yet.  However, our politics as well as younger people are copying Western trends like crazy.  Even worse, the government is trying to be creative when it comes to birth rates.  Poland had bachelor taxes during communism, but guess what?  Our politicians want to bring it back today.  The excuse is to increase birth rates.  But why should only a man have to pay such a tax?  In English, it's called the tax on childlessness.  But Polish politicians say it's not sufficient to have a child.  You have to be married.  History teaches us only what we've learned from history.  Thanks again for your work and cheers.  Well, Ethics, thanks for the donation as well as the topic.  In Poland after the Second World War, your bachelor tax was called the bull tax, basically reducing male value to an animal that plows a field.  But imagine what would happen if the women had to pay a hen tax for choosing not to get married or have children.  The reason the bachelor tax is more important than the tax on having children is because governments understand that 80 to 90% of the household purchases are made by women.  When women aren't married, they can't access a man's cash and flush it into the economy to increase the velocity of money.  All countries are ruled by fiat currency bankers that require ever-increasing velocity of money to create inflation.  If men aren't married and they aren't borrowing money for mortgages on houses and women don't have the ability to spend the man's money on his credit cards, then the system collapses.  Credit contracts and the economy crashes.  But what's more important is what Poland said about us.  We are men and we are not bulls or oxen.  They're literally saying that we're on a farm or plantation when they use language like bull, and we're just supposed to accept it.  I'll discuss this and more in just a moment.  But first, let me tell everyone about today's sponsor, Ancient Purity.  Tom has been going MGTOW for quite some time and doing video requests on my channel.  He has also been selling dozens of different products like the ones that you see here.  Most vitamins and minerals are poor, ineffective, and unabsorbable garbage.  Ancient Purity follows the principle of super clean products that are absorbable and at a dose that works.  They're also getting decent reviews on Amazon.com.  Also, these aren't the chemicals they put in the water to turn the frogs gay.  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!  So visit ancientpurity.com today.  Anyways, now back to the video.  I originally thought about naming this video Tax on Childlessness, but that would be a lie, so I chose The Bachelor Tax is Coming, even though technically, it takes... I couldn't find any evidence that it was actually going to be introduced in Poland anytime soon.  I guess this is competitive clickbait capitalism baby.  Who's going to click on a topic like the childlessness tax?  We make town.  men are simple.  We see the word bachelor and think to ourselves winning.  Then we see the word tax next to it and we picture our nuts and a vice being squeezed for their creamy goodness.  There are numerous ways to get the birth rates up without imposing a bachelor tax.  The number one way is to create a society full of abundance of wealth and time.  That's why the 1950s and 60s were idyllic in North America.  The average citizen could have his own home, even if he was a roofer or plumber for the first time in history.  His wife didn't actually have to work, so having children back then was a no-brainer.  Between your wife and the schools, you could be an absentee father, even while living with your family.  but today it takes two to raise a child and pool the resources to do so.  So if men choose not to get married, then even if they're single mothers out there, the state usually has to support those kids in some way.  Yes, the money usually does come from a collective pool of men's money through taxes, but it's nowhere near as much money as if a man is living with and working for his family directly.  Plus, let's not forget that most criminals come from broken homes.  They don't become productive members of society and cost the state even more money.  As for the history of bachelor taxes, I shared a link to the history of it in the description.  Emperor Augustus opposed it in ancient Rome on both unmarried men as well as unmarried men and women that didn't have children.  Yet the birth rates kept going down and down.  There was great wealth inequality in that society and a sort of early form of feminism where the entitled women in Rome were causing trouble for men.  The inequality was bad because many Roman soldiers were once offered land after they finished their military duty.  But the farmlands were increasingly concentrated into fewer and fewer hands, preventing them from becoming financially stable enough to have children and even attract a wife.  The bachelor tax just made Roman men poorer, so the birth rates kept falling further.  Is it any wonder that birth rates are falling in both Eastern and Western Europe, and our societies are starting to look more and more like the Hunger Games?  That film showed us a depopulated America where the young people were competing each other to the death in a zero-sum game for resources and glory.  That's increasingly the world that we're living in.  Who would raise children up in this world to fight against each other and spend 50 or 60 hours a week working just to barely survive?  Governments screw up their society by imposing a lifestyle on the people that they aren't happy with living, i.e.  communism, then tend to punish their population for wanting to terminate itself.  In the West, of course, as long as we have mass migration, and the population is rising, and the money supply is expanding in a debt orgy, there will never be a need for bachelor taxes.  We'll see what happens if the coup limits immigration and property values end up falling, and the state can't expand the debt and money supply further.  Japan hasn't even tried to introduce it either, and their population is falling.  Bachelor or childless taxes seem to be what failed states typically introduce.  Places like communist Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, Italy before the Second World War and Rome, once it started to enter a dictatorship.  Sure, there are individual states in the United States that tried it as well.  But there was nothing stopping many single men with money from just picking up and leaving and going to another state.  Much the same way that today the politicians have destroyed California and people are fleeing from there.  It seems the communists never learned from history that imposing more taxes on an already impoverished population just leads to rebellion.  You don't punish people for not having children.  Instead, you incentivize them to do it.  I remember hearing about how Vladimir Putin in Russia was hanging out money in refrigerators to women that had many children.  Maybe it's work because the fertility rate has actually steadily increased in Russia over the last 5 to 10 years.  Then again, that might just be due to the tons of Muslims in southern Russia having children when the Russian rates were lower and lower.  One thing is clear, however.  Every country that's tried the stick approach to getting people to reproduce has failed.  There has to be a threshold of money and status where a woman is willing to carry a child to term.  Say the state paid women $100,000 or $200,000 to have a child.  That would be a better idea in many places in Europe where the immigrants end up costing the state even more money than that and they'll never actually add any economic benefits.  Doesn't even matter because governments just print to pay for everything anyways.  At least the Romans couldn't debase their currency quickly but they had to do it a lot slower than the money printing central banks around us today.  So how and why would our society impose a bachelor tax on men?  I think those in power understand that it won't work overtly.  Instead, they have hidden taxes like inflation that tax away the money that men could save instead of spending it.  We live in a so-called free society.  Our masters figured out a long time ago that it's easier to control us when we believe that we're free rather than when we're controlled by force.  They're also telling us that global warming is bad and they don't want us to reproduce anymore.  I wouldn't be worried so much about a bachelor tax.  I'd be more worried that eventually governments might create something like a one-child policy in the West, even with declining populations and immigrant declines during the coup.  In such a scenario, if you don't have a child, maybe you could sell your license that the government issues to you to another person who actually wants kids.  Maybe they already have one and they want another.  Obviously the wealthy would buy up all the child licenses in that case.  But I'm just speculating in some crazy sci-fi ways.  If society started imposing a 6% bachelor tax like they did in a couple Eastern European countries during the time of the Iron Curtain, then people would leave if they could go someplace else and pay less tax.  I'm predicting that in the future, with innovations like Bitcoin, countries will be in competition with one another to see who can attract the most talented and wealthy people to their countries.  The problem is that right now, as an individual, your capital is tracked into your local currency, as well as your real estate market.  It's difficult to move in a world like that.  But if we had one global currency like Bitcoin, then countries could compete for the wealthy people.  And if they became socialist shitholes, people would just leave them, like we're seeing once again with many people leaving California right now.  I'd love to see governments impose some sort of bachelor tax on a guy like Venge and MGTOW, and all his crypto.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens to taxes if we live in a deflationary world, where money gains value each and every single year.  My bet is that governments will do whatever they can to extract wealth on assets in the future.  California is trying to do a 1% net worth tax per year, so I could see even bankrupt states demanding their 1 or 2% a year net worth peasant tax from each person.  Finally, to end this video, Ed ticks, welcome to MGTOW and our community.  Learning about that deceptive and unspoken female nature makes you think that you're going crazy at first.  You second guess the behaviors you've seen your ex-wives and ex-girlfriends exhibit.  Things that were once seemingly harmless, you now see in a totally different light.  It's like your love.  life has been a lie your entire life, and you've been poked and prodded into the perfect Mortal Kombat.  finishing move position by your precious sweetheart.  that is anything but.  You'll never get an admission of guilt from a gal if she's doing this to you.  Don't listen to what she says.  Instead, watch how her actions position her into the more advantageous position in the relationship.  Once you look back on your life and see how all the women you dated put you through that in a sneaky way, you'll never date again.  It's like.  they lead you very comfortably towards your own financial, social, and creative slaughter.  So they can feast on safety and security.  They're perfectly evolved at doing this to us.  It's instinctual, and I've only met a couple of women out there that were consciously aware that they were doing this.  But they were still doing it.  It's one of the greatest discoveries that's been hidden from us using our own biology, love, and women's behavior for all of history.  I strongly believe that male sexual liberation through MGTOW philosophy and loverbots, along with Bitcoin, to be an honest store of value or medium of exchange, have immense power to free all men from the malarkey that we face in our lives.  Free men and money free from the manipulation by banking simps will do wonders for our civilization.  We just have to defeat the forces trying to keep us down at this point.  Either we enter the worst tyranny that the world has ever known, or we break free of it and experience the greatest freedom we've actually seen in history.  That's the great war that we're facing right now, as men and most of us don't have any idea what's happening.  Don't take my word for it.  Do your own research on all the stuff that's happening out there.  It's the most exciting and scary time in history.  And yet most people are crying into their cornflakes because Corona canceled new seasons of TV shows.  Wah.  Anyways, that's it for today.  Thanks again to EdTix for the donation and topic.
