Sources close to the network telling us that's because she made a very staunch defense of President Trump.  and wanted to expose or attempt to expose the voter fraud that the Republicans and the president, I should say, are claiming took place in the election.  Fox decided not to air Judge Jeanine Pirro's show because that was going to be the content of the program.  It's a Saturday night show. ",
