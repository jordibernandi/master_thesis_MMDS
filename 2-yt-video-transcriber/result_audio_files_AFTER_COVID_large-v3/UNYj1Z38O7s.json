            "text": "Good evening, Brave Awakened Ones, QV here.  It is the 14th of December, 2020.  It is about 10.40 at night here, p.m.  on the East Coast.  As you can see, I'm beyond exhausted.  I just worked 14 and a half hours, trauma one, post-op.  Hot mess to say the very least.  Been looking at people's limbs that look like hamburger meats all day long.  But I really needed to get this out to you guys.  And I have to get it out to my loved ones also.  Warning, warning, warning.  And I know a couple of you guys brought it up to me, but I've just been so busy working, doing sessions, teaching, doing all of that.  I'm like, oh my God, I better get to it because the time is coming upon us, right?  So a few of you already know, but I want to make sure you guys really get in on this alert.  NASA confirms Earth will go dark for six days.  Surprise, surprise.  Let's take a guess when that's going to go dark.  Ooh, let's take a wild guess.  Alert, NASA confirms, confirms NASA.  What does NASA mean to us?  Never a straight answer.  NASA confirms Earth will go dark for six days in November 2020.  When was this written?  Today.  This came out today, but I think NASA was talking about this last week.  Yeah, I think that's when they first came out with it.  So they've just been planning because they know what's going on and they're figuring, okay, between December 16th, I thought it was December 17th, but between December 16th and December 22nd is the perfect time for them to say the earth is going to go dark for six days.  What an interesting six days, right?  saturn going into on the 17th saturn going into um aquarius jupiter going into aquarius.  and what's on the 21st the 20th and the 21st?  oh solstice surprise surprise zero point.  with jupiter and saturn zero point.  so i told you guys this probably was going to happen.  They're pulling out all the stops.  It's not just about what's going on with the voting system here in the US and what went on with that, with the election and all, but it's about stopping, stopping this great awakening, stopping this final jump, stopping us from anchoring in this timeline.  Okay, and I hope many of you did your meditations today for, this was part two, remember.  part one was the lunar eclipse, today was the solar eclipse in Sag, remember?  The new moon solar eclipse.  And then on the 20th, we were supposed to do our part when it comes to anchoring in, the final anchoring of this new golden age timeline.  And many other lightworkers were going to do it on the 21st, but I was guided to do it on the, that we needed to do the setup on the 20th, which you guys notice, we always seem to run a day ahead of everyone.  But I do believe they're going to go dark during these times. ",
