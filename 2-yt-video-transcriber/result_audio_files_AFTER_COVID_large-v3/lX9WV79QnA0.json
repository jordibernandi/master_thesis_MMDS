            "text": "If I told you to envision an image of ultimate masculinity, what would you think of?  Perhaps a rugged lumberjack chopping wood in the forest to take back to his rustic cabin to cook his evening meal of freshly hunted buck?  Perhaps a heroic fireman climbing a ladder to the tallest floor in a building about to collapse to save a trapped child when no one else was willing?  Perhaps a military veteran jumping on top of a grenade to save the rest of his squad from certain death?  Or hey, if you're a particularly dranged kind of individual, you might look at a terrible situation like the one that recently happened in Nova Scotia, where a violent madman rained bullets upon innocent victims in a horrific tragedy in national outrage, and think, yes, that.  That's what I envision when I think about ultimate masculinity.  Oh lord, help me keep a civil tongue through this one.  Fish!  Hello once again from the Prim Reaper, and welcome to another episode of Men's Mental Health.  On April 18th, a terrible mass shooting incident occurred in Nova Scotia.  I'm not going to cover the details in this episode, but it's obvious that the individual responsible was a deeply disturbed and evil man, and that the world is better off for being rid of him.  No, what I want to talk about in this episode is twofold.  First, the discussion around the mental health of the individual responsible that often seems to follow these kinds of incidents.  And second, I want to cover a very specific response to this incident that someone linked on Facebook that rustled my jimmies so hard that my next-door neighbors felt the aftershock.  So before I get into that, let's just stick more generally with the statement about mental health.  That's what this show is about, after all.  I feel like this is a concept that laymen really like to muck up in casual conversation about murderers and other violent individuals.  I believe a lot of the confusion comes in around the concept of mens rea, or the criminal intent behind a crime.  There are undoubtedly mental health conditions, severe schizophrenia, for example, that can impact an individual's capacity to understand their actions are wrong.  In cases where such conditions are present , an individual may be found not guilty by reason of insanity.  For many people who are really not all that familiar with what that means, it can sound like someone is getting off easy.  This is hardly the case.  Those who are in this category are often placed into heavily supervised mental facilities and by no means get away scot-free.  Regardless, some people see the question, was mental health a factor, when talking about mass murderers, as though people are looking for a reason to excuse their behavior.  Additionally, I think there's a whole other side to it, too.  For example, I suspect that when some people jump to asking about whether there was some sort of mental health factor involved, in a way they're trying to find an explanation for the occurrence that doesn't simply involve the individual in question being a monster among us.  It's uncomfortable to think that we can just have people in our communities who are within their right mind and yet are perfectly content to destroy the lives of those around them.  Now, where we often start to get a little hazy is where we get into the fine details around such discussions.  Are people more likely to bring up the idea of mental health in the context of murderers when said murderer is of a certain race?  Well, the author of the article that I'm critiquing today certainly seems to think so.  In a previous role as a breaking news editor, I learned to quickly scan the wires and assess the race of a suspect by the questions local reporters were asking police.  A question on terrorism meant Muslim.  Gangs meant black.  Was mental health a factor?  Ding, ding.  White.  Well, something tells me that Ms.  Pradkar is not really arguing in good faith because a cursory Google search of the two examples she provides, that is, the Christchurch shooting and the Las Vegas massacre, finds that the articles talking about the attacks are not shy about using the supposedly racialized words she mentioned, nor are they using particularly glowing language to describe the attackers.  But either way, it's not like there aren't tasteless memes flying around in any direction speculating on the race, ethnicity, or religion of any highly publicized murderer.  The people who aren't talking about mental health are all too eager to try to politicize these kinds of killings before the bodies are even cold.  I mean, look at the article that I'm criticizing right now.  We have a fellow who has gone absolutely off the rails crazy, going all over the Nova Scotia countryside shooting at innocent people, and here's this author.  behaving like that behavior is supposedly an example of ultimate masculinity.  I don't know about you guys, but if I had to choose between an article speculating on whether the shooter was in his right mind or not and this dreck, I know which I would prefer to see.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Returning back to the idea of exploring the mental health of a murderer, I think even if we put aside the concept of mens rea, we can look at their mental state as a sort of spectrum.  I think when we think of someone who is perfectly mentally healthy, we may often drum up a picture of someone who is generally content, well-connected to others in their community, who maybe has a family, a job that gives them at least a reasonable sense of fulfillment, and perhaps a few hobbies to keep them entertained in their downtime.  But obviously we can take away one, or even a number of these things, and still have someone that reasonably resembles a mentally healthy individual, right?  And even then, we can have someone who has almost none of these things, and yet who would still sooner just decide to panhandle on the side of a highway, washing people's windshields with toilet water and hand soap from the nearby gas station than go on a murder spree.  So something else must be going on in the murderer's mind, right?  I mean, you might just try to say that if you want to get technical, every person who murders someone else has something wrong with their mental health.  But that's not necessarily an accurate statement.  Let's look at an example that Ms.  Paradkar gave.  A Muslim man who kills people in the name of his religion may believe that he is committing an act of moral good.  This is different from a Muslim man who was peaceful up until the point where he developed paranoid schizophrenia and then stabbed his mother.  This doesn't make the act excusable in any way, of course, but it is a good example of a reason why we might not use the phrase mental health to describe why someone did a thing that he did.  But I think that a common thread that does come up a lot when we're talking about the mental health reasons behind why someone may turn violent is abuse.  Many people who go on to commit these heinous crimes were abused, bullied, tormented by someone in their lives, be it a parent, other kids at school, a partner, that sort of thing.  This is not always the case.  Sometimes it really and genuinely is just something wrong with their brain chemistry or structure that leads them to be unable to properly empathize with others, for example, those with antisocial personality disorder, or to properly understand their own actions.  But a very, very common thread in people who go on to destroy the lives of others is to have someone in their own life that has made theirs extremely miserable.  It's no secret that prolonged treatment of this nature, especially in early childhood by caregivers, can have devastating impacts on one's ability to form healthy relationships with others.  And of course, this does not necessarily lead to violent behavior.  In fact, in the majority of cases, it does not.  But unfortunately, sometimes the stars align and the ground is laid for someone who has a distrust and distaste for others to take those feelings to the next level.  So when Ms.  Paragkar goes on to speculate about why these kinds of individuals may be drawn to the idea of authority and power, it really shouldn't be too much of a reach to think that someone who may not have had a lot of control in certain aspects of their lives may go on to seek it in other ways.  Some may seek this in comparatively healthy ways like wanting to join the police or the military, fields that may give them outlets for some of their pent-up desire for control, though some will obviously abuse this power within these fields, while others unfortunately choose more illicit and violent means.  I'm not necessarily saying that this behavior is justified, or that it is the right thing for them to do, but it is a fairly straightforward explanation that follows from a history of lack of control over one's life circumstances.  But is that what this article talks about?  Nope.  This article has a different theory on why someone might turn to these kinds of controlling paths.  How do we understand the lure of a violent force for a person like the Nova Scotia killer who is likely to be written off as having a mental health problem?  Taylor has an answer.  Ultimate authority.  Ultimate power.  Ultimate masculinity.  boy, this one really gets me going, friends.  But instead of sitting here spewing a stream of four-letter words alone in my library, I'm going to end my introduction here and lead into the show so that we all here at Honey Badger Radio can sit and spew four-letter words together on this episode of Men's Mental Health.
