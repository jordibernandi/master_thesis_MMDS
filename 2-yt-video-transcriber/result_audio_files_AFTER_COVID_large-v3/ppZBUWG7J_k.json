You saw those two commercials from John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.  Evangelical voters are going to be playing a critical role in Georgia on January 5th.  Now, surveys of early voters and exit polls this year showed between 76 to 81 percent of white evangelicals and born-again voters supporting Donald Trump.  That's according to the National Election Pool and AP Votecast.  Now, the conservative evangelical Christians who helped send Donald Trump to the White House four years ago stuck by him in 2020.  White evangelical voters made up 23% of the vote nationwide and overwhelmingly favored Trump, with about 8 in 10 backing him.  Let's talk with Reverend Dr.  William J. Barber, president and senior lecturer for repairs of the breach, and Reverend Dr.  Barbara William Skinner, co-chair of the National Black Clergy Network, and also Reverend Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church.  So, Jamal, I want to start with you for a couple of reasons.  Last week, we played the video.  A lot of people saw the video of Paula White, and she was praying against everybody for Donald Trump.  for him to win.  And then she got a lot of pushback and criticism.  And so she dropped this video here as a way of talking back to her haters.  Well, Jamal, she said, don't have me call some things out.  Well, Paula, let me call a few things out.  Jamal, on August 22nd, 2017, after she made some previous comments on Jim Baker's show, I sent her an email and said, we need to talk.  She responded to me saying she would do so when she got back out of the country.  She said her comments were taken out of context.  She never called.  Then on November 21st, 2017, I emailed her again saying we need to talk.  She said, quote, I'll fly to Ghana this Friday.  Looking forward to telling being back there.  I returned the following week.  Let's talk when I return.  She never called.  On October 15th, 2018, at 1.15  p.m.,  I sent her another email saying we need to talk, saying it has been a year since I last emailed you.  She never responded.  I've emailed her.  I have texted her.  I've called her.  I know for a fact that Reverend Dr.  William J. Barber has tried to, has asked to, and admittedly he would happily debate the likes of Franklin Graham and Jerry Falwell Jr.  and others.  They refused to debate.  In fact, Jerry Falwell Jr.  ordered when he was running Liberty, ordered the police if Reverend Barber or anybody from his group who was in Lynchburg stepped foot on the campus to arrest them.  These white evangelicals don't really want to have a dialogue with us, Pastor Jamal Bryan.  They care about two things.  They care about abortion and they care about getting rid of all gay folk. ",

            "text": "Well, you've got several problems layered, Roland.  First, let me thank you for being consistent in raising your voice for us.  But you've got two issues here for evangelicals who claim to be pro-life for black babies and but they're not pro-life for grown black people.  So the evangelicals went completely mute around George Floyd, around Breonna Taylor, around Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray.  They're not really pro-life.  It's only at the place of those who like baby Jesus, as long as he's in a manger.  But they don't like grown Jesus when he starts kicking over tables.  The second issue, different from Franklin Graham with Paula White, Roland, is the Black church made her.  And so there's blood dripping on our hands because we put her on stages, platforms, and programs where we never push sisters with stellar gifts, capacity, skill, and credentials, but we let her float through.  Now it's what Malcolm X calls the chickens are coming home to roost.  And I think that that last Pandora's box that opened was her calling in for African angels to support Donald Trump when she forgot that that was the same land that he cursed as whole nations.  And so I responded to that video you just posted, saying, let's have a dialogue, asking, in fact, without knowing the information you just shared, for you to be the moderator.  But the Black church has got to have a real coming-of-Jesus meeting about what we promote and understanding what is the slave, Americanized religion that has so many of our people sitting in the balcony, but they're not allowed in the finance room.
