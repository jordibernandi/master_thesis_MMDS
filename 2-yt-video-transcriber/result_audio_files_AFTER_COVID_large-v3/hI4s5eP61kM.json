            "text": "Hi, there is a live stream today.  In the first hour, I'll be talking to a second look, a guy who says he can debunk aspects of the black pill.  So we'll be taking a second look at his IQ.  In the second hour, I will be speaking to Mr.  Based Anglo, who is an alt-right guy.  I want to delve into what makes the incelibate community mostly right-leaning and and how you can be pro your own race as an incelibate when the women of your race consider you an abomination.  Like, what are you supporting?  Now, because the subject matter has the potential to be too spicy for YouTube, it's best if I try to stream elsewhere and upload a censored version to YouTube.  I tried to sign up with DLive, but they wanted so much personal information.  So I will try on Twitch.  Not that Twitch is, like, good at, you know, open debate, but at least if my Twitch channel gets deleted, I'm not really that bothered.  My name there is MFaceHandLMS.  So I will be testing out Twitch streaming over the next few hours.  If that fails, I will.  I'll fall back onto YouTube and I'll just have to police myself really hard.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm not able to test out like entropy stream and any others you may suggest because I don't have time for that right now.  I guess stay tuned to both YouTube and Twitch, because I'm not sure which one I'll come to you on.  And if you haven't guessed, we're back at the usual time.  Saturday, 10 p.m.  UK, 11 p.m.  Berlin, 5 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time USA, and 7 a.m.  Sunday, Australian Eastern Standard Time.  Australian time just feels like so far into the future.  Like they're like a month ahead.  It's probably Christmas already in Australia right now. ",
