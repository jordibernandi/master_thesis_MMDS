Now, in doing research for the Breonna Taylor video, I had a lot of people in the comments section complaining that I did not mention the fact that there was a dead body found in her rental car.  Here's some of the examples.  Harley Davidson, 929, he says, You also have to go back to 2016 when they found a body in the trunk of her rental car.  Here's Selvio.

Now, just to be clear, these people aren't just making this up.  Heavy.com, Breonna Taylor's car rented in 2016. that was used by her then-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover.

Because if I'm smart enough to make this up, then, hey, man, I don't even need to be doing YouTube.  But this is actual investigatory documents.  And it says, the first line, in December the 3rd of 2016, homicide unit learned that the vehicle was Their most recent victim, Fernandez Bowman, which was a victim of a homicide, was in a car that Breonna Taylor rented.

            "text": "So as you can see, this claim was all over the place.  And it was being used to discredit Breonna Taylor in a way.  Hey, they're finding dead bodies in her rental car, in the trunk of the car, matter of fact.  They were very specific with these claims.  But is this accurate, right?  If someone is killed in a car that I rented... that could have nothing to do with me, or I could have some involvement, right?  Without any more context, it's a fact that could lead you to a lot of different conclusions.  So what I'm going to do is see if I can provide context for the claim.  Was there a body found in the trunk of her car?  Was it her rental car?  Any of these little things that we can figure out how this claim of the dead body being her car fits with the overall story.  Now let's just not kid ourselves.  The claim here is that Breonna Taylor was some ways involved in this drug enterprise of her former boyfriend.  And this claim about the body being found in the trunk of her car was in a way to show that her involvement was more than just a passive girlfriend who just dated a drug dealer, but more intimate.  Right.  The fact that she rented the car and it was a dead body.  Hell, I even heard that they turned the body into the rental agency and it was the rental people who found the dead body in the car.  Right.  Let's see what the actual facts are to see if this claim has any legitimacy.  to whether Breonna Taylor was involved in the drug trade or not.  This is Fernandez Bowman.  And this is the car that he died in.  It was actually covered on WLKY.  So let's listen to the actual news report of what happened.  Was his body found in the trunk of a car?  Or was it more than that?  Is there more context to this?  Check it out.  It was a little closure.  I was a little happy.  I cried a little tears of joy. ",

On Tuesday night, detectives who had identified 34-year-old Quentin Hall as the killer attempted to pull him over after he failed to use a turn signal.  A brief chase ensued, but within minutes, Hall was in custody.  Searching his car, they recovered pills, meth, heroin, and a loaded 9-millimeter.  Kamiya Bowman is certain that is the very gun he used to kill her brother, 27-year-old Fernandez Bowman, last December. ",

            "text": "So what do you think?  You now heard the news report.  This body was not found in the trunk of a car.  It was found in a driver's seat.  Now, for a little bit more context, The person, Quentin Hall, who actually shot and killed Mr.  Bowman.  It seems his motivation was a robbery homicide.  He was trying to rob Mr.  Bowman.  And interestingly enough, he was actually on trial for murdering Mr.  Bowman and for the robbery and murder of another person earlier.  Here it is.  The rental car was lent to Mr.  Bowman.  He was running an errand.  Someone tried to rob him.  and gunned him down in the car.  He drove the car and crashed into a tree.  Now, that could happen to anybody, right?  I can let someone in my car, someone could try to carjack them.  And next thing I know, I get a call from the police saying, hey, You know, this person was found dead, shot dead in your car.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Now, interestingly enough, Breonna Taylor said she didn't know him, but her boyfriend did.  This leads me to the question, does this change your perception of this fact that was presented to you?  Now, I'm not throwing shade at my boy B Tatum, nor am I throwing shade at Ann Coulter.  I think they were fooled, too.  I think the police gave them this information without the proper context to try to lead everybody down a particular narrative.  Now, was Breonna Till involved in the drug game and so forth and so forth?  I don't know.  I can't say definitively.  But if your evidence is the fact that this body was found in this car, has your mind been changed?  Or do you believe, yeah, this claim was true?  Does the context matter or doesn't it?  Again, this is all for you to decide.  But we now know a couple of things are not true.  Number one, there was no body found in the trunk of a car, right?  That's just not true.  And second, we know who killed Mr.  Bowman.  It was somebody who was trying to rob him while he happened to be driving Ms.  Taylor's rental car.  Does this have anything to do with the drug game?  Does this have anything to do with anything?  I can't make that decision for you.  You have the facts.  You come to your own conclusion.  But I do have a question for you.  Now knowing the truth about this claim, the body in the trunk, Does it change your mind about anything about this case?  What about changing your mind on this particular claim?  Are you now going to tell people that, hey, there was no body found in the trunk of her rental car?  It was all labeled out of context.  Or are you going to say, well, yeah, there is some truth to this claim.  As always, you don't have to guess.  You don't have to try to figure it out.  All the links to all the news reports and everything are in the description so you can see it for yourself.  I don't want you to trust me.  I want you to go and look at it for yourself if you want to get more context.  Now, how did everyone get this information?  right because this is not something that most people can just get.  police leaked these documents in an effort to put brianna till is passed into question.  right this is obvious now if you made it to this part of the video.  this video like many of my other videos dealing with police violence is going to be demonetized.  look at my last video.  So I'd appreciate your support if you like what I do and you're getting value out of my videos.  Grab a channel membership, join me on Patreon, hit me up with a PayPal donation.  Every little bit helps.  And honestly, I wanna hear how you guys feel about this fact that was put out there without context.  Do you feel the police department put this out in a specific way to make Breonna Taylor look even worse?  Should they be doing stuff like this?  I wanna make it very clear too.  This is no shade to my boy B Tatum or even Ann Coulter, right?  I think they were fooled too.  If I would've gotten those reports, I would've looked at it and been shocked too.  Oh my God, a body was found in her car.  But without any context, it looks worse than it actually is.  Hell, that could have happened to anybody, right?  I could lend my car to my cousin.  He gets shot from somebody trying to rob him.  And now that means that I was involved in a drug game?  Again, is that reasonable?  Is that rational?  It's up to you to decide that.  Again, I lay it out for you to play it out.  My name is Nate, lawyer and YouTuber, and I'm out of here.  Peace. ",
