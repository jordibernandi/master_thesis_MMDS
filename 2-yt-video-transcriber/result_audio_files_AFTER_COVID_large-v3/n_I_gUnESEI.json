Where I sympathize with Christianity is simply that I see Christianity as a relatively very functional religion a religion that works a religion that built efficient societies.  you could argue that in the Catholic history that didn't really look very good but but relatively compared to other religions it has.  it creates a more functional societies and I like the whole message of you know forgiveness and getting rid of those borders and sitting together with the disbelievers and the tax collectors and whatever that is.  There are aspects that I like about Christianity.  Are there other religions?  I would say I used to think that Indian religions or Buddhism, for example, were good.  But then when I studied religious studies a little bit further, I kind of realized that... kind of realized that i don't really like those religions and that i also think very differently from other atheists.  because what makes a religion bad to me is not that the that the religion is hostile and violent and intolerant.  what makes a religion bad to me is that the religion is extremely superstitious and very lazy dysfunctional and simply just.  you know it's just inefficient and it doesn't work.  When I think about Indian religions, I just feel like they are not religions that are very efficient.  They're not religions that really work for society. ",

            "text": "I think Hinduism is like, among religions, Hinduism is, I would carefully want to call it the epitome of apathy, of human apathy.  It doesn't help make progress.  It doesn't help build something better to go further.  It basically, it glorifies the notion of basically just losing, Some people would disagree.  The Bhagavad Gita, for example, I have it right here, teaches how you should be a useful part of society and you should fulfill your duty in society.  And that is a huge goal of your way of living.  But if you look at how Hinduism is practiced in society and by religious people, by devout people in society, you see that there is this glorification of doing nothing and of being worthless and of being... of just being, of just living your life in apathy and stuff like that.  Buddhism takes it even further.  Buddhism kind of introduces this thing where you are supposed to just free yourself completely from good and bad, from all kinds of attachment and just be like empty and be... dumb, basically.  I just thought that is much worse to me than intolerance or violence or all that.  That is more destructive than intolerance and violence to me, I thought.  I don't know.  I don't even want to immerse too much into this.  I found a liking for East Asian philosophies and religions because I kind of liked how they approached life in a more functional way and a more nice disciplined way and all that.  I just thought they're not more about afterlife and living for something that is outside of you or living for annihilation.  they are more about living in society and creating a good society.  of course they have this whole stuff going on with respecting your ancestors and all that nonsense, but I kind of liked the way those religions are structured.  I don't know. ",
