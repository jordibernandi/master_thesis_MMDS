God will heal me and God will take care of me.  Only through the power of prayer.  And I'm confident since you are a devout and a serious Christian, and I respect you for that, and as should everyone here.  You're going to tell everyone here, forget science.  We don't care about any of it.  God will take care of us as long as we pray to him. ",
