So it is legal to say, if you vote for me, I'll give you a free lunchbox, or I'll give you a television set.  But if you say... if you vote for me, I'll pay you $5 for your vote.  Now, that is illegal.  That may have happened.  I don't know.  It could have been.  Anyway, but no, what he did was not illegal.  It was just a typical...

So when you say you can't prove it and it won't change anything, one of the elections in Michigan has already been overturned.  It was a local race.  It wasn't the presidential.  But it was because when they went back and looked at the ballots, they found out that they had announced \u2013 good old media, had announced someone to be the winner.  Turned out he wasn't the winner.  It was the other guy.  So it does happen.  We'll see when the votes are all tabulated and we find out if we can, we may not be able to, but if we can verify that the ballots are legal and completely legitimate, then we'll find out the final results of the election.

I have some real doubts and suspicions about it, but I'm not in a position to go through and look at all the ballots and see what they're marked and whether or not there were people who were voting who were dead.  If they were, we should tell them they can't do that.  But in the meantime, What we do need to do is demand, not ask, demand that we get a clear accountability for how the ballots were handled, where they came from, and if the people who voted those ballots were legitimate voters and had a right to vote that particular ballot.  Because if not, your vote got stolen.  And that's why it matters.  It truly does.  Do we have any others?  One more. ",

And I do think that the biggest questions regarding the election and the questions thereof come down to statistical possibilities, not just probabilities, possibilities.  And people a lot smarter than me, which would be most people, many of whom are trained mathematicians and statisticians have made the observation that there are certain things that have been presented in the voting process that are statistically impossible.  That's why I think there are some questions that we still need answers to, and that's why I think the media was way premature to go out and say, Joe Biden is the president-elect.  And Al Gore took 37 days.  And that was only because in one state and in three counties in that one state, there were some questions.  37 days.  Why is everybody in the media so in a hurry?  This stretches over at least five, if not a dozen states, and involve hundreds of counties and hundreds of thousands of votes.
