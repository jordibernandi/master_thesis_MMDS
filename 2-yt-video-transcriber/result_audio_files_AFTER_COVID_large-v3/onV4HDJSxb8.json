And these forms of denial take a couple of really interesting avenues.  And like the first of which is to pretend that it was just thoroughly impossible for Obama to get anyone on the Supreme Court because of what happened to Merrick Garland.  Like forgetting the fact that like Mitch McConnell took over the Senate in 2014.  And that he got already two of his choice justices on the Supreme Court in an up or down vote.  So they're just pretending that that like that would have been impossible.  So to say that, oh, oh, yeah, just there's no way she could have retired and then just been replaced by someone who is, you know, of a similar political point of view is one thing.  And then the other thing is these people sort of like saying that like there's no way she could have known that Hillary Clinton would lose and that she would die.  Which is like, you don't have to be fucking the amazing Kreskin to just like, okay, yeah, all of us, myself included, thought there was no way Hillary Clinton was going to lose that election.  But it's still a fucking gamble if you're in her point.  If you're in her shoes, it's still a fucking gamble.  And to be willing to make that gamble with the lives of like hundreds of millions of people so that you can still have fun on your job seems pretty monstrous.  Well, I mean, also this idea that like she didn't know she could die.  She's in her 80s and already had cancer twice.  It's a pretty fucking safe bet. ",

That's what they're going for.  And, you know, I think you're exactly right.  I don't think the liberals on the court or liberals anywhere in this country have any such notion that they're involved in a like a larger political project.  And like.  I think the evidence of that is that like what do they like about Ruth Bader Ginsburg?  It's that she achieved individually and got to the highest thing.  And it's not just what the laws she passed or like laws that she stopped from passing.  It's that it's that she's there and achieved.  And that's why she can stay there until she's 80 fucking years, 90 fucking years old. ",

I want you just a little experiment, a little experiment that I'm personally doing.  I've done it for a while.  I follow someone.  I'm not going to name him.  He's from McConnell's team.  He's not like a big Trump guy, but he's an operator.  And he knows what he's after.  You can find someone similar out there.  You can figure it out.  Then follow somebody on the Democrat side of things.  Follow somebody from Schumer's team, you know, Exofico, wherever.  You know, fucking McCaskill, whatever.  Who gives a shit?  One of those losers.  Someone who is high up.  A Kappa regime in the Democrat mafia.  Compare what you get there.  You get somebody... This guy I follow from Team McConnell, very interesting.  He never fucking shuts up about appellate court appointees, about recess appointments.  He's got his eye on the fucking prize.  He's... He's a very, you know, the world is a zero-sum place kind of guy.  He's very, you know, ice in his veins.  But he's after one thing, and that's even when the game is over numerically, which, you know, it kind of already is, it's preserving this rule and preserving these laws, the ones that the donors are paying for, the thing that will make him rich when he's an old man.  You go to the Democrat side, what do you see?  Let's normalize masks.  Let's normalize masks.  Let's normalize masks.  Or like, look at Kamala wearing the shoes.  Oh, what if we appointed Michelle Obama to fucking ambassador to the  U.K.?  just grab that all over the place.  cultural signifiers they don't give a shit about any type of permanent rule planning their flag anywhere that the culture that's where they can plant their flag in.

Will the legal right to an abortion be overturned in large parts of the country?  Functionally, it has already been overturned in large parts of the country through eating away through regulations that they don't really need to overturn it on a state level.  There's just one abortion clinic that serves 100 million people in large swaths of this country.  um but like yeah yeah they don't care because they know for them like their personal rights and privileges are going to be pretty much well preserved and that like all the all the other hard right-wing decisions that this court is going to hand down.  like there was a good article the other day about how basically it's just one of the coke brothers got kavanaugh across the finish line and they're going to do the same for amy coney barrett.  because what they want to do is create like a pre-new deal sort of gilded age regime of labor rights and like the untrammeled access of money equaling power in our system of government.

You'll work about fucking 20 hours a week and you'll be a fucking millionaire.  That is a very common path.  I'd say almost every Republican takes that path and a lot of Democrats.  But there is one lane that only exists for Democrats, and that is the path of entertainment.  You write some fucking abominable script about, like, I don't know, a president who goes on OKCupid or, you know, you consult for some dog shit show.  And you get in that position not by winning because these lobbyist positions, the Republicans give them out to winners, guys who even if they lost their election, they put a guy.  they put a fucking 24 year old with an associate's degree on the bench.  He's going to rule there for the next hundred years.  The Democrats give that to their losers.  Here, you know, you lost valiantly.  Here, take some of David Geffen's pocket change to write some fucking awful bullshit.  We'll also make you a millionaire.  But not because we give a shit about how you affected anyone's lives or any victory for our ideological point of view.  It's because we celebrate someone who lost in style like you did.
