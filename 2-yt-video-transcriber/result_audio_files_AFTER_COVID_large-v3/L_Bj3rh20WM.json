            "text": "The other day, I was trying to think of what would be my favorite episode of Avatar The Last Airbender.  At first, my mind jumped to The Tales of Ba Sing Se, specifically Iroh's story about his son, because that's just an incredibly good, emotional story.  But the rest of the short stories in that episode are kind of lackluster, so I don't know if it could be the best episode overall.  Then I thought maybe one of the finale episodes, because simply by being the finale, those episodes have higher stakes and give a really satisfying conclusion to a lot of major plot points.  But that feels like cheating.  The finale is always going to have that kind of advantage over the rest of the episodes.  So I started thinking, what would make the best non-finale episode?  What would just your average Avatar episode need to be perfect?  And as I was rewatching the series over and over again, as you do, I kept finding the most joy in the firebending masters.  As I thought more about it, I realized that this episode has absolutely everything that a good Avatar episode needs.  So in this video, I want to break down those reasons and talk about why I think this is the perfect Avatar The Last Airbender episode.  Number one, worldbuilding slash backstory.  Part of the appeal of the Avatar universe is the incredible worldbuilding.  This feels like a real, actual place that you could visit, with its own distinct regions, cultures, traditions, and people.  So much time and effort goes into fleshing out this fascinating world.  By the second half of the final season, when you reach the Firebending Masters, you probably think you understand most of this world by now.  You've gone with the gang from the Southern Water Tribe to the Northern Water Tribe, all across the Earth Kingdom, stayed in Ba Sing Se, and even lived in the Fire Nation for a bit.  A lot of the worldbuilding has already happened, and so you're probably content to sit back and think, yup, I understand all of this world now.  But then they hit you with some new information.  Toph learned earthbending from the badgermoles, who were also blind and used earthbending as an extension of their senses rather than just as a fighting form.  The airbenders learned how to master airbending from the sky bison, which sheds a new light on Appa, and the firebenders learned from the dragons.  But the dragons are all gone, which sets you up for an amazing plot twist later in the episode, when Ran and Shaw are revealed.  And as a part of all this new worldbuilding, you get some extra insight into a now very beloved character, Uncle Iroh.  You start out the episode thinking, geez, maybe his dark past is even darker than I thought, and you end it with the knowledge that Iroh actually was deemed worthy by the dragons and lied to protect them, which helps you understand his character a lot better.  When he was trying to teach Zuko not to draw all his firebending from anger and hate, It wasn't just old person wisdom, it was wisdom from the dragons that he had been gifted.  It recontextualizes a lot of what you know about Iroh, and therefore even what you know about Zuko, all the while expanding the scope of this world in a really fun way.  We now know that when the badgermals helped the gang get through the secret tunnel, they weren't just goofy creatures placed there by chance, they were the original earthbenders who have a deep connection to that land.  A good episode of Avatar should expand on the worldbuilding in some way, because that's such a large and engaging part of the show.  And this episode excels in that department.  You learn about an entirely new culture that's been hidden away from everyone, even the Fire Nation royalty.  You get backstory on Toph and Iroh, as well as information about how people used to learn bending long ago.  It's all relevant to the overarching story, while also having a great deal of meaning to Aang and Zuko's arc in this one episode.  It's really just perfectly delivered worldbuilding and backstory.  Number 2, the Aang and Zuko parallels.  I'm not running.  I'm tired of running.  It's time I faced Azula.  This show really loves to beat you over the head with the fact that Aang and Zuko mirror each other, which I honestly think is great.  I love the many camera transitions from one of them to the other, and how we repeatedly learn about their backstories at the same time, like in the storm in season 1 or the Avatar and the Fire Lord in season 3.  Aang and Zuko from the beginning are set up as having their destinies intertwined, and so we know the whole series is leading up to something happening between them.  The climax of all that setup is kind of when Zuko returns to the gang and offers to be Aang's firebending teacher, but the Firebending Masters is the episode immediately following Zuko joining their team, so it's like the adjustment period for Aang and Zuko learning what it means to be on the same side.  Because up until now, their stories have paralleled each other, but in opposing ways.  Now their stories need to drive in the same direction, and yet somehow, the show manages to find the perfect way for this to happen.  They both need to learn firebending.  Now Aang has been struggling with firebending for basically the entire series, but Zuko's struggle is new.  Now that he's not trying to capture the Avatar, he's lost the anger that fueled his firebending.  So they both set out on an adventure together to learn the true meaning of firebending.  This is the perfect scenario for them.  For so many episodes, we've been seeing the show compare these two and their backstories, and if they're not setting up to have some world-crushing battle between them at the end, what could they possibly be mirroring each other for?  That kind of prolonged setup needs a really satisfying payoff, and I think Zuko joining the gang is good, but it's not enough.  Aang's firebending teacher didn't need to have all those parallels with him.  If all Zuko did was just join them and then hang around and then fight Azula at the end, I think it would have devalued the parallels he had with Aang earlier on.  I don't think it would have ruined the story entirely, it would have just taken away some of the impact.  But instead, Zuko and Aang meet the firebending masters and learn the secret of firebending together.  That's a satisfying payoff.  They both had to go on their parallel journeys through the series because they needed to get to this moment, where they could both recognize that fire is about life and passion, not anger and hate.  Zuko couldn't have gotten there without Aang's forgiveness and resourcefulness, and Aang couldn't have gotten there without Zuko's knowledge and persistence.  I think this moment, where they stare into the fire of Ran and Shaw together, that's the real climax of their parallel stories.  It changes them both significantly and bonds them in a way that they couldn't by just normally hanging out and wanting to take down the Fire Lord.  It has the finale energy of tying up a really satisfying arc without actually being a finale.  Number three, contrasting personalities.  Aang and Zuko, despite all their parallels, are very different characters.  Aang is a happy-go-lucky kid who wants to see the bright side of everything while staying upbeat.  Zuko, on the other hand, even once he's joined the gang, is a broody teenager who's grumpy and quick to anger.  Personality wise, they're about as opposite as they could possibly be.  They're foils of each other, each one used to highlight the other one's defining traits.  And, you know, there is nothing I love more than the trope of the peppy sunshine and rainbows character annoying the broody grumpy woe-is-me character.  It's just a perfect dynamic.  It makes for fun and wholesome character interactions, and it generally ups the enjoyment level of the whole episode.  While we've seen Aang and Zuko interact plenty before this episode, this is the first time where they're starting on the same side together, which just leads to some of the best moments in the entire series.  And when Aang is trying to make Zuko feel better by being like, that one felt hot, and Zuko is like, don't patronize me, and then they start flying on Appa, and Zuko makes this observation about Appa being slow, and Aang's like, in our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.  Nothing is better than that.  Zuko's literally like, dang, I thought this thing was faster because it was so hard to capture you.  And Aang only sees it as an insult to Appa, and is like, come on Zuko, don't be mean to Appa, he's flying as fast as he can.  And it only gets better once they get to the Sun Warrior Temple, and Aang has to convince Zuko to dance, even though he really doesn't want to.  And then they get trapped in the sludge and Zuko's like, what do we do?  I don't know, I guess think about our place in the world?  That's what Iroh would want.  We also get maybe my favorite moment in the whole series when Aang is like, you're not as bad as everyone says, and Zuko just has this big goofy smile that's incredibly rare for him.  And eventually the show manages to squeeze a compliment out of Zuko when he's like, come on Aang, you're strong, you can keep a stronger fire than that.  That was such a sweet moment, largely because of how it contrasts with their personalities.  You know Zuko isn't one to just throw out compliments all over the place, and you also know Aang really needed that little boost.  But then, this exchange, when they're facing the dragons after Zuko said they could fight the masters if they had to, is top tier content.  Because now we're getting Aang teasing Zuko and forcing Zuko into this, like, awkward situation where he doesn't get to be the tough broody guy.  It's just perfect.  And it all ends with Zuko at the end having to justify to everyone why his dragon dance is more than just a dance, which is embarrassing for him, but helps solidify him even further as a member of Team Avatar.  It's just such a fun episode because of all these little moments between Aang and Zuko, which helps it stay lighthearted and joyful even when it's about all this worldbuilding and learning the true meaning of firebending and all of that.  And it's also about something else, which brings me to... Number four, it drives the main plot.  There are a lot of really great, fun episodes of Avatar that expand on the worldbuilding or tell us more about a character, but only a few non-finale episodes can drive the plot forward as much as the firebending masters.  Aang is supposed to master firebending in order to face the Fire Lord, even though, to be honest, it doesn't come in that handy when he actually faces the Fire Lord, but it is a very central part of his drive to prepare for the final battle.  So this episode obviously drives him closer to that goal.  And for Zuko, allowing him to learn the true meaning of firebending and getting his firebending back means that he's now one step closer to being able to face his destiny in the finale, which is facing Azula.  Not to mention that he needs his skilled firebending to get through the next couple episodes with Sokka on the Boiling Rock.  So on top of expertly handling the worldbuilding, backstory, parallel stories, and contrasting characters, the Firebending Masters episode also manages to help drive the main plot forward in a significant way.  Aang's firebending teacher now knows a secret about firebending that maybe only one other living firebender, Iroh, knows.  And that's why I think The Firebending Masters is the best overall non-finale episode of Avatar.  It does everything that a good Avatar episode should do, from the character interactions to the world building to driving the main plot, and it does them all in exceptional ways.
