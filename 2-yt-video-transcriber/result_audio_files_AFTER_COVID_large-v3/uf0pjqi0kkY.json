They never turn, look at them, they're just like a bunch of stiffs, real stiffs.  Why don't you turn the cameras around for once?  You look back there, you can't see it.  There's gotta be.  Feels like feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground, except we have more people.  Oh, boy.  It's always tough.  You know, we go through this all the time.  We're always asking them.  Look at these crowds.  I mean, as far as you can't see it, you have this prime territory like you should be in the real estate business.  Now as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don't, they don't get it.  You only hear it from the sound.  I go home, I say to the first lady, did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?  And she goes, no.  No, they just keep it on your face.  That includes Fox.  They just keep it here, right here.  They don't want to show.  You know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them.  It's positive for their ratings.  It's really a good thing. ",
