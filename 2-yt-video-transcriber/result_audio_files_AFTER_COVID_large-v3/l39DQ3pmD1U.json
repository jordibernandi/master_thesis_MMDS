            "text": "Hey guys, welcome to the Liberal Hivemind, a channel solely focused on exposing the abundant hypocrisy of the left.  Melania is back in the news cycle, and of course you guys are probably thinking that the FLOTUS and the POTUS just got the coup of virus, but that's actually not what I'm talking about.  Melania is based.  Now she's very quiet behind the scenes, she's a little bit of an introvert, a little bit of a mystery, so to speak.  We don't know too much about her.  Well, one of her ex-friends, somebody who she trusted, she had a phone call with, and that person recorded the phone call and leaked it to CNN.  What a great friend.  Now, of course, CNN and the person who leaked it were trying to make it seem as though Melania is a bad person.  But if you pay attention to the base.  She is so spot on with everything that she's said and we have CNN, Anderson Cooper and all of these dopes trying to spin it into some sort of scandal so incredibly desperately.  Wait till I show you guys Anderson Cooper fumbling for words trying to figure out how he's going to frame it.  It's a complete farce.  Making themselves look like absolute buffoons, partisan hacks and I think it's backfiring pretty hard because the American people are seeing Melania as just a normal person with emotions who's at the end of the line and frustrated with the liberal media.  And frankly, it's quite eye-opening.  It's not just the president.  Even his wife is sick of dealing with the unfair media onslaught and media spin that goes on each and every day against this current administration.  So I gotta show you guys what Melania said.  I gotta show you guys Anderson's... desperate attempt at turning nothing into something.  And then we gotta talk about the facts.  We gotta analyze this, I gotta give you guys my opinion, and I gotta shut down all of the BS coming from the left.  But before we get into today's video, I'm not gonna ask you to subscribe or anything like that.  I was just made aware that the president was transported to Walter Reed's hospital, he's undergoing testing, we don't actually know exactly what's going on, and frankly, it sucks.  I'm not happy about it, and I just hope that him and his family, Melania, the FLOTUS, the POTUS, I hope everyone a speedy recovery, I hope we get back to normal here, and we're sending our prayers from the Liberal Hive Mind straight to the White House and now straight to Walter Reed Hospital.  So just want to send out some positivity before we start the video because everything that I'm reading on Twitter from these despicable lefties is just honestly it's sickening and i just want to put some positivity out there.  now with that out of the way let's roll the tape all right.  so let's do what we usually do on videos like this.  let me show you guys the clip.  we'll set that baseline and then we'll get into what we got to get into.  so let's roll that tape.  you say i'm complicit.

Christmas stuff that, you know, who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decoration, but I need to do it, right?  Yeah, but 100%, you have no choice.  And okay.  And then I do it.  And I say that I'm working on Christmas, planning for the Christmas.  And they said, oh, what about the children?  They were separated.  Give me a break.  Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?  I know.  I cannot go.  I was trying to get the kid reunited with the mom.  I didn't have a chance.  Needs to go through the process and through the law.  But here's my thing.  Hear what you just said.  But instead of that, You just, your messaging, you were so loved.  They would not do the story.  We put it out.  They would not do the story.  You would not believe it.  They would not do the story because they are not, they would not do the story because they are against us because they are liberal media.  Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story. ",

You know, I certainly doesn't jive with, you know, the Fox whole idea.  I mean, if we're talking about a war on Christmas, it's funny that she would be leading that that. ",

            "text": "And I told you guys, Melania does not mess around.  She is right on point.  And she calls them for exactly what they are, the liberal media.  You know, over the last couple years, a lot of us have been, quote, red-pilled.  Well, it seems as though Melania has as well.  She's right on the money, thinking in the exact same framework as us.  And did you see Anderson Cooper foreshadowing?  fumbling for words, trying to drum it into some sort of drama.  That's how you know.  he is a paid actor.  His job is literally to turn this nothing burger of a leak into some sort of big story.  And then he's like, oh, oh, you know, Christmas.  She's not condemning Christmas.  She's not saying I hate Christmas and trying to abolish Christmas like the lefties are.  She's merely saying there's more important things in life than damn Christmas.  and stop putting so much pressure on me.  I'd rather focus on important things than Christmas decorations.  And if anything, that's.  And then of course, it follows up with the pearl clutching that you'd expect from every CNN analysis that, oh, it's so surprising to hear her speak like that.  What do you mean?  speak like that?  Like a normal human being?  Like I stated in the intro, a normal human being who's at the end of a rope, who has emotions like every other person, and is just venting a little bit.  It's totally normal.  And could you imagine being on her end with the constant onslaught that her husband has to deal with?  and then of course by virtue she does as well.  The contrast between Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.  Michelle could do no wrong.  She is a deity in a dress.  Where Melania has had to deal with scrutiny and attack since the first day she stepped in office.  They call her miserable Melania.  They question her relationship with the president.  They attack and slander her.  Some people call her all kinds of words that I don't even want to mention.  She has to deal with that and every single day.  And you're wondering why she might want to rant a little bit?  Yeah, it seems perfectly human to me.  Something I guess CNN can't seem to understand.  But now let's really talk about the meat because obviously the most important thing that she said there is that the media is questioning her about the kids at the border.  And she says, give me a break.  The Obama administration did it and no one asked them any questions about it.  And she's totally right.  Absolutely based.  And liberals across the globe are outraged because she said, give me a break in respect to the kids.  Yeah, no, she didn't mean the kids.  She meant you liberal hacks.  Once again, turning nothing into something and being complete hypocrites.  The Obama policies, which have absolutely nothing to do with Melania.  Why is she being questioned about it?  And she's totally, totally right.  And the absolute irony of the whole situation is, frankly, when it comes to the kids at the southern border, what other choice do you have if you want to protect their innocence, if you want to stop humiliation?  human trafficking and make sure that the parents are actually the parents and that they're not being smuggled, what other alternatives do you have?  At the end of the day, the Obama and Trump administration were arguably doing the right thing.  They were protecting the children.  In terms of optics, it doesn't look great.  But in terms of what they're really doing, they're trying to save children.  And the president has a track record of doing exactly that.  Endless, endless stories.  In fact, one that came out today.  Look at this.  Huge.  U.S.  Marshal Service announces rescue of more than 1,300 missing children, including victims of trafficking.  Trump has doubled the amount of rescues.  And this has been a massive, massive operation from the DOJ that Bill Barr has spearheaded.  And we've had so many stories in the last couple months of like 30 plus kids being rescued.  One after another.  In some cases, I think I've even seen 50 plus in the single raid.  What about this?  Trump signs executive order expanding efforts to combat human trafficking.  Calls them monsters.  My administration is putting unprecedented pressure on traffickers, he said.  Trump gives $35 million to aid human trafficking victims.  One after another, the president puts his money where his mouth is and got results.  And Melania is part of that administration.  So calling her out for saying, give me a break when she's referring to the media and trying to spin it as if she means the kids, lefties have no arguments.  So they'd rather slander, play political games, and drum up some sort of garbage, scandalous narrative that frankly doesn't exist and it's backfiring and backfiring wholeheartedly.  hard because the American people can see right through this.  And if you know the context of how Ivanka, the Trump administration, and Melania have worked with human trafficking victims and have done more than any other administration to save children, then you know that they have no argument.  They never have an argument.  Their argument... has only been orange man bad for the last four years and let's put that into context.  of course we know the president just got the coup as well as his wife and look at this sick.  40 of democrats are happy after president comes down with the coup 40 that tied in with what you've probably seen on twitter.  i mean just go go to some of the tweets of mainstream news outlets reporting that the president is going to walter reed hospital.  read through the comments.  you will lose faith in in humanity, but more specifically, you'll lose faith in the moral compass of leftists in America.  I wasn't kidding when I said it's giving me a sickening feeling in my chest.  It bothers me.  It frustrates me that people would speak in the way that they are about a president who has done so much to help so many people.  And you have these lowlifes on Twitter who take a moment which should bring people together, show some decency, bridge the gap a little bit.  They're always talking about he's the divider-in-chief divisiveness.  And then they go around doing stuff like this.  Absolute hypocrites, the tolerant left showing the world exactly who they are.  That's why I can't stand on that side anymore.  But you know what?  We're not going to end this video on a negative like that.  Of course, we wish the president a speedy recovery.  And actually, the fact that I say that's pretty interesting lines up perfectly.  Speaking of recovery, jobs, jobs, jobs.  The Trump recovery is the greatest recovery ever.  661,000 jobs added in September.  Record 11.4 million jobs added to the economy in the last five months.  And the unemployment rate has dropped below 8%.  and it's where it was at the end of the first Obama term headed into re-election as an incumbent president against Mitt Romney.  So good news, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, like the president says, jobs, not mobs, and hopefully he'll be back kicking and roaring saying that himself in the next couple weeks.  So once again, to end this video, we here at the Liberal Hivemind are sending our prayers to the White House and the Walter Reed Hospital.  If anyone can... btfo this virus.  it's the current president regardless of whether or not he's in a higher risk category.  so we hope he gets better.  we hope melania gets better of course because she's the focus of this video.  and of course to conclude on the whole melania thing don't worry flotus.  i'm sure most of the american people who saw that leaked audio are on your side and can see that you're just a regular person like anybody else who's just had enough of the absolute absurdity that comes out of the liberal media.
