            "text": "yes married tied the knot exchange wedding vows.  you know stories like this can be very disturbing.  you know you know even the photos that I'm going to post up of these two at their wedding but as a youtuber I have to bring This type of story is to the public.  You know, a South African male gay priest got married to his longtime partner or boyfriend from Kenya, whatever you want to call it.  The two so-called preachers, one go by the name of Reverend John Mayor Payau, and the other name is Pastor Paul Maury.  Do note, these names could be very difficult to pronounce from different countries and continents.  So please forgive me if I didn't pronounce their names correctly.  But in an article on the net that I saw, and you guys could go easily research it out you know one quote it was don't judge them please touch not the anointed ones.  you know many think because church people who disapproves same-sex marriages that they hate the person itself themselves.  you know which isn't the case.  it is the sin that they are condemning.  it is the sin that is talked about.  that is the main focus.  so you will find people who will say things like you know towards church people and they will try to play the victim and change the narrative.  Or they will say, why you condemning homosexuality where there's other sins?  Yes, church people knows that there are other sins out there.  But if a holy sanctified preacher or of a video or a sermon is on homosexuality, is it on same sex marriage?  That is the main focus.  That's the main topic right then and there.  It's known about other sins.  We know that already.  But the center point will be that topic of homosexuality.  You know, now somebody might have seen or know of these two male gay so-called preachers, you know, who got married and are in their congregation.  They know the truth of the scriptures, but they are afraid to speak out.  Feel free to leave your comments on this situation.  I know people of different religions come on my channel and view the videos on here.  Whether you're Catholic, whether you're in holiness, whether you're a Jehovah's Witness, or whatever you are.  What are your thoughts pertaining to this matter of two male gay so-called preachers getting married?  You know, we all know that same-sex marriages are contrary to what the Word of God says.  You know, I remember doing a video about two years ago on two female so-called preachers who got married in my area of New Jersey or New York, I believe.  You know, so feel free to share your thoughts, to share your feedback.  You know, I'm concluding this video and you all can research these uh two names.  research this story and you will come across better details and different articles and different websites giving information pertaining to their marriage.  i'm tony harvin.  i'm concluding.  may you all have a blessed day peace.
