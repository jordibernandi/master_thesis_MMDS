            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  As winter storm Billy, 50 degrees Fahrenheit below normal temperature, slams into Hurricane Zeta, ice storm warnings is an understatement.  One and a half inches of ice falling, and this ice storm is gonna continue eastward.  Simple graphics here from the Weather Channel.  dramatically colder air in corporate media speak is coldest temperatures in one hundred and forty two years taking us back to eighteen seventy eight hundreds of records smashed earliest thirty degree fahrenheit below normal temperature on record ever for any year ever in october.  And the list of records broken goes on and on and on and on to the weather forecasters saying that Denver is going to obliterate record coldest daytime temperatures.  But if we look back into the 1870s and 1880s, that's the Gleisberg Minimum.  We're heading into low solar activity once again, so perhaps the reason for the great reset, the movement to cryptocurrency now that PayPal's into it, is because we are in the eye of the storm.  The eye within the eye of the grand solar minimum and the society reset.  And with the U.S.  election just a few weeks away, it's time to take a step back and survey the political uncertainty that could be devastating for your retirement fund if it's not handled properly.

Grab the phone and give Noble Gold a call now.  877-646-5347.  And you'll also find the link in the description box below the video.  Interesting graphic here off the weather channel.  Hurricane Zeta and winter storm Billy will intersect.  Well, they already are beginning to.  This is having a massive effect for some ice storms and flooding coming in coastal.  Bit more detailed graphic off of NOAA here.  We see the panhandle of Texas and all those different colors.  That's a mishmash of different types of freezing rain, sleet, snow, hail, and any types of atmospheric mix.  It's a strange bag right there.  The red is the hurricane.  And when looking at corporate media graphics, we need to translate the English.  Dramatically colder air and cold front would be translated into 50 degree Fahrenheit below normal temperatures and an Arctic blast.  So you have to substitute those words there.  This chart actually goes down to 50 degrees Fahrenheit below because the other chart I was using with 20 degrees Celsius below was actually off the chart and you couldn't go any further than the 20 degrees Celsius below, which was about 35.  Now this in turn, because there's so much moisture coming up from the Gulf, the hurricane warnings there and the ice storm, they're about 400 miles apart, but as you know, in the atmosphere, 400 miles is nothing.  That is a skip away.  They're already starting to interact.  And this ice storm, warning out now through the National Weather Service, and we'll take a look at the weather channel again.  We have to translate this.  Damaging ice possible, probability of ice, low, medium, or high.  Okay, so when we come to the charts here from Severe Weather EU taking off again the National Weather Service, we get some incredible, I mean incredible, total accumulated freezing rain off of Pivotal Weather.  These are great charts here.  Pivotal Weather, thank you for putting these out.  And this is such an emergency message for those out there in this area.  This is sweeping east, and you see those different teal colors in there.  I have never seen charts with an inch and a half of accumulating ice coming down.  Forecasters are talking about apocalyptic tree collapses and power line downages.  Even a full inch of ice coming down, a half inch, a third of an inch, that is still paralyzing for the communities that it's going to be going through.  You can't drive, you can't walk, no bicycles.  If you have crampons, I guess you can get around, but you can't walk that fast.  Studded tires, not down here.  The temperatures will rebound in about three or four days, but you're gonna be locked in your home for that period of time if you're in this ice storm area with no power, and you're gonna be sealed and locked in there.  The wind's blowing three or 40 miles an hour, and it's just gonna be sideways blowing ice.  We've seen these types of storms before where you can't open your doors or windows because they're completely covered in ice.  Really good graphic here as we can see the forecast spin coming through making landfall eventually and that moisture is going to go right up through the Tennessee Valley and the record Arctic cold is going to slam right against that.  Now these types of temperatures aren't normally observed.  So something that's 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the normal, well down into the most extreme record.  cold since the 1880s, slamming into a really warm 85 degree Fahrenheit warm gulf moist front is something rarely seen if ever.  So Winter Storm Billy, Colorado Springs, look how sunny it is up there.  They didn't mark any of the graphics there where it was.  Record cold set in these boxes, not just record.  cold, coldest ever since records began.  And that nice little sunny graphic there with Colorado Springs, well, Ryan Maui here, forecast high of 15 in Denver on the 26th, would obliterate the record for the coldest daytime high so early in the season.  Two weeks early, coldest since 1873.  Weather Channel missed that.  So still waiting about another 24 hours to confirm if this did actually go down to 2 degrees Fahrenheit for the low.  And if it is, that'll even set a different type of record as we move forward for the coldest records set in October.  Here's an example out of the National Weather Service, Missoula.  Earliest 30 degree Fahrenheit below zero.  Reading on record for any official climate station in the lower 48 ever.  for any year ever in October ever across the United States.  The old record was 1917.  And on the descent into the 30.1 degree Fahrenheit below zero, I like how they capitalized, any year.  This is a significant event here.  This is record breaking and it would be front page news.  Imagine if it was heat.  And let me translate AccuWeather's record challenged.  Because if this was an Olympic event, would you challenge the record at, let's see, Casper, Wyoming, the old record was 12 degrees Fahrenheit, the new record is minus four degrees Fahrenheit.  16 degrees difference.  Now if that was a sprint and somebody won by 16 seconds in the Olympics, would that be a challenged record, do you think?  And look at Billings, Montana.  Old record 22 degrees Fahrenheit, new record three.  Again, we get right into those high teens of the new records.  Challenged, barely challenged.  And the absurd amount of records broken just continues in list after list after list.  If I was gonna list every single one that I could find across all the National Weather Service Twitter feeds, we'd be here for an hour.  So I'm gonna give you a spackling.  All these are new records and Salt Lake City Tide, 24 degrees Fahrenheit, but you can see where the records go all the way back to 1921.  Summer significant breaks.  You know, Deer Creek, five degrees is the new record, old record 17, or Hans Flat, you know, eight degrees compared to 23.  These are significant.  It's not one or two degrees cooler.  It is dropping out.  These are such cold temperatures.  Where are they coming from?  And Salt Lake City on the 26th then did indeed break a record that stood for 142 years.  And Boise, Idaho also breaking the record back to 1878.  But we need look no further than the solar activity.  You see the 1900 easily there right above the DAP 2030 Patreon logo.  You can join me over there.  I do special updates that I don't do here on YouTube about my homestead and why I've chosen to start a farm because we need to grow our own food exactly because of these reasons.  But the Gleisberg minimum, 1900, what do you see?  You see a drop off in solar activity.  And where are we going into?  the Eddy minimum, a drop off in solar activity?  That is so coincidental and so quirky that a drop off in solar activity in the same records we're breaking right now was linked to a drop in solar activity.  digress back to the 25th where just a 29 degree fahrenheit below zero broke records during those days too.  everywhere you see a circle on the map there is an all-time record cold temperature not for the individual spot for the region because there were so many records shattered across every single town and city in these areas that they just lumped them into circles.  Now Boise, they broke it down into the different towns and cities here.  I'll wide that out for you.  So anywhere you see an asterisk was a new record set and anywhere you see a double asterisk, that was the coldest ever in recorded history for the area there.  And these lists just do keep going on.  I linked everything in the description box below.  So I'm going a little quick.  You can go ahead and click all these graphics.  Everything's in the description box.  Just click on it and then hyperlink out and it'll bring you right back to the same graphics again.  Boise, Idaho, you know, back to 1878, it's more significant.  What's that, McCall, Idaho there, back to 1909, tie in that record.  Fairfield back to 1948.  And then this entire list here, so I decided to wide that out for you, cut it up a bit.  Now, some of these forecasts versus the record, this would be October 27th, and this Arctic front is by no way finished.  It's gonna stick around for another few days, it's gonna descend, push more ice, it's gonna collide with that hurricane.  Yet to be seen what types of effects it's going to be.  Possible tornadoes, for sure going to be some atmospheric disturbance there.  And if we look for all these different types of charts that they put out there, the earliest below zero temperatures, the earliest zero degree Fahrenheit temperatures, coldest October ever.  I'm going to wide that out for you here.  Earliest below zero temperatures, Butte, Montana.  October 25th, 26th, 2020, and then you know what's magic right there, October 29th, 2019.  So wait, three out of the top six are in the last two years, okay.  And the coldest October lows, the yellow is this year, but wait a second, the number five position's last year, so three out of the top five are last year and this year.  Forecasting out, where do you think is getting cooler?  in regional areas, and then which crops are grown in these areas?  And that's a good way to move forward to see which crops are going to be affected, which prices, and limited availability for the food that we produce on this planet.  This is not just happening here.  It is happening everywhere from Australia to Chile to Brazil to Russia to the European Union to the United States to Canada over to China.  It's everywhere happening across the planet right now.  Another list of record setting low temperatures here.  So the one you saw on the 27th, these are the 25th and 26th temperatures that were broken, all time record lows.  And look, they're going back to 1919.  In the Missoula, Montana, that's an interesting one, because the old record was 10, and then the new record is minus seven.  So we're looking at a 17 degree difference.  In Butte as well, 15 degree difference there.  And this is all from 1919.  But Potomac, old record, four degrees Fahrenheit, but look at that, 29 below zero.  That's a 25 degree difference.  That is incredibly huge.  You know, breaking a temperature record by one or two degrees, okay, but smashing it by 25 degrees Fahrenheit and it doesn't make national news, there's a disconnect.  And it just keeps going record after record after record.  And you can see the nice numbers there.  And then Wyoming, oh, smashed a record back to 1878 as well.  Two degrees Fahrenheit for the low.  And you know what?  That's record setting.  Temperature is going to head up right to the northeast coming up on the 31st.  Anywhere you see that bluish color is going to be new record setting low temperatures forecast.  I forgot the snow.  How did I forget the snow?  Wait a second.  In the same storm here.  Record breaker.  Early a snowfall over an inch on Wichita.  And you know, I did a full snow video just two days ago on all the record breaking snows that had fallen across the same areas.  But these are new records even on top of that through the 26th.  Marquette, 8.3 inches.  The old record, 3.1.  So more than doubling it back from the 70s.  Remember, the 70s was the Buffalo Blizzard era.  So I'm wondering how the Great Lakes are going to fare this year.  And Great Falls, number one already, maximum 31-day snowfall totals.  And they still had seven days to go.  So who knows how much more snow is going to come down there.  But up to this point in October, seventh warmest since 1981.  And while you're distracted with that, the Great Reset is happening.  Time Magazine, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements.  We're going to switch our money.  Maybe it's not about the money.  Maybe it's about the food availability.  And changing over to cryptocurrency, PayPal is going to bring it out into the everyday mom and pop adoption phase.  And if we level up just like we did from the weather channels charts right up into NOAA weather forecast and warnings, unprecedented monetary overhaul, that means your money is going to change.  Hey, was there a shortage in coins and small bills and things this year?  That's part of it.  Preparing to deposit digital dollars, that's central bank digital currency, straight to each American.  From the Fed to you.  Spend it this month or it disappears at the end of the month.  Restart the economy.  Free money for now.  But eventually you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get the money.  But enjoy it while there's no strings attached.  So we are in the eye of the eye.  The hurricane preceding Zeta was Epsilon.  Such a strange eye within the eye of a high altitude zone of low pressure.  And more anomalies, which I'll cover in the next video, the salinity, which is the dark brown in the North Pole, as well as that incredibly dark section is almost no salinity, which is preventing freezing also.  This is such a strange mix up here.  We have these record cold temperatures back 140 years, and now we're seeing such anomalies in the Arctic as well.  Vortices in the atmosphere double spinning inside themselves.  But I love these eye walls.  I wanted to leave you with this here.  It's such a beautiful photo.  And I give credit to those pilots who fly through that because the bumpy ride to get into that beauty, it's going to be the bumpy ride of the reset of our society from everything from food availability to the way we buy, sell, and trade, what money is, quote unquote, and how we're going to exist and help each other move through the future.  But how prepared are you for emergencies?  Are you storing some of your own food right now knowing that these changes are here and you might not be able to get to the supermarket for a couple days, a week, the two week or the four week emergency food supply?  And whether you get it here from MyPatriotSupply or you store it yourself, a main priority for you right now is getting food in your house for your families in case of these type of strange anomalies which are happening with more frequency.  It's about you keeping your family's more grand solar minimum prepared.  My Patriot Supplies, a fast-track, easy solution.  You buy it, comes in, Mylar-packed, 25-year shelf life.  Or you can go out to the store or your local agricultural co-op and get things in bulk in 50-pound bags of beans or rice or whatever it is, and then pack it yourself.  Whatever you're doing, please get ready.  And the links in the description box below is a great way to support the channel.  I thank you for your time.  Hope you got something out of the video.  And I'll see you next deep dive. ",
