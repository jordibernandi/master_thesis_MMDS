            "text": "Hi, welcome to my movie review.  Now, I have been listening to your feedback, okay?  I've been getting compliments on my beard, which I think I'll keep since, you know, I'm not getting insults.  So I'll keep it for now, we'll see what happens.  But I've also been getting a lot of criticism about my movie reviews.  People are saying that I go too in-depth with my movie reviews, so... I'll try to keep it more simplified and I won't delve too deeply into the plot from now on, okay?  So I have been listening to your feedback, right?  Anyway, today's movie I want to review is called Stuck on You with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear, right?  Stuck on You.  The title of the movie, Stuck on You, actually reminds me of an article I've seen the other day.  This is crazy, right?  Look at this.  women who glued her vagina shut as part of bizarre bid to frame her ex-boyfriend for kidnap and abuse is jailed for 10 years in spain.  now there's a lot to take from that headline.  right one A woman glued her vagina, right?  Put superglue on her vagina.  That's... I don't think it was wood glue.  I think it was superglue, right?  That's fucking mental, right?  But also, she got 10 years?  I mean, a woman actually got punished by the law?  What?  Wow.  A woman who glued up her own vagina and tried to frame her ex for the crime has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Vanessa Guisto accused former boyfriend Ivan Rico of kidnapping her outside her home and abandoning her semi-naked after squeezing the superglue into her private parts.  It is superglue.  Oh, my God, man.  That's just... Just the thought of that, you know, is... I don't even have a vagina, at least not to my knowledge and that sounds very painful.  Her story began to unravel when investigators uncovered CCTV footage showing Gesto buying the glue and a kidnap kit, including knives... A kidnap kit?  Including knives.  she used to harm herself from a Chinese-run supermarket.  Police also discovered the only vehicle filling passing the spot where she claimed to have been assaulted and then tortured was a council bin lorry, not the black car she said she had been abducted in.  It's like... She's so stupid, she doesn't think the police are going to actually do an investigation.  Probably so spoiled and pampered her whole life.  I mean, look at her picture there, right?  You can see she's alright looking, you know?  She's not too bad.  So she's probably totally spoiled rotten.  And she thinks that if she just says something, everybody will just believe it.  Because that's how her life has went.  And she didn't think the police would actually investigate this.  Unreal.  Rico, 36, spent several days on remand in prison before the shameful attempts by a guesto dubbed the glue liar in their native Spain became apparent.  Yesterday it emerged a court in the northern Spanish city of Leon had convicted her of two counts of making up a crime and jailed her for 10 years.  10 years is quite a hefty sentence for a woman.  She was also ordered to pay her ex \u20ac25,000 in compensation in a written sentence released this week after a trial earlier this year at Lyons Provincial Court.  State prosecutors had demanded an 11-year, 8-month prison sentence.  So they demanded an 11-year, 8-month, OK, let's say 12 years, and they got 10, so, you know, not bad, right?  Guesto's lawyer, Emilia Esteban, Or is that Estevan?  I don't know.  Cut ties with her former client.  After it emerged she had tried to frame Ivan over the made-up October 2016 crime, said to have happened in the town of Bimbre.  benvimbre an hour's drive west of lyons.  yvann's brother raphael who said from day one his sibling was sleeping when the superglue attack and kidnap took place said her mum spent days crying after he was arrested.  lawyer mr mrs ys savan said i always believed vanessa and that's why i defended her.  i feel humiliated and deceived.  Good, but it doesn't matter anyway.  You're a lawyer.  It doesn't matter if you believe them.  It doesn't matter if you believe your client.  That's part of being a lawyer.  Your job is to convince everyone else to believe them.  It doesn't matter whether you believe them or not.  But she feels she's been deceived and humiliated.  Well, that's good.  No words, just when you think you've heard it all, along comes this story.  She needs to be in a mental hospital.  She's obviously very unwell.  It's an opening shot case.  Obviously there's going to be puns for this, right?  A kidnap kit.  I can just see it.  Can I have two pints of milk in one of them kidnap kits?  It reminds me of the first series of Fargo.  When... What's his name again?  Billy Bob Thornton.  When he goes to this guy who sells stuff at the back of the van.  guns and stuff, and he tries to sell them a zombie kit, you know, for the zombie apocalypse, which is quite funny.  It reminds me of that.  A zombie kit is a kidnap kit.  Wow, he couldn't make her stuff up.  Glad she's in jail.  At least she got a reasonable sentence.  See, I think that's the most surprising thing.  Even though the story is about a woman putting superglue in her vag, the most surprising part is that she actually got 10 years in prison, which I think is pretty good.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you about that.  Sorry, I really should get back to my movie review and stop getting bloody distracted.  I do this all the time.  Anyway, the movie is Stuck on You, which is... You know, it's okay if you like that kind of thing, I suppose.  Anyway, thank you very much for watching my very quick movie review.  As I said, I didn't want to go too in-depth this time, you know, I've been listening.  So thank you very much for watching my movie review.  Until next time. ",
