            "text": "thanks george.  it's a it's a complex question i think and um i haven't listened to your whole show.  i'm sorry i've been working but i've just caught the last few minutes of the debate.  um and it's an area where if you like the medical the political and the economic are closely intersecting.  And that makes it a difficult question to comment on with a lot of competing interests.  In terms of the medical, coronaviruses are not new.  We've had multiple outbreaks in the past.  So it is a very, I mean, a virus is not actually a complete life form.  It basically is an infective particle which is able to hijack the reproductive mechanism, the protein synthetic mechanism of a cell in order to cause its symptoms.  And it does seem that this coronavirus is more infective than the SARS virus.  But on the other hand, its effects are a lot less lethal.  The actual number of cases that we've seen around the world, around 80,000.  95% of those within China, mainly in the Wuhan area.  And I agree with you, your last comments I heard, that China have done an amazing job.  I was talking to a colleague of mine who's a virologist.  He was astounded at the job.  He's a British virologist.  He was astounded at how well China had done managing the outbreak.  Firstly, to actually recognize that it's a new pathogen that you're dealing with.  is not a straightforward and regular everyday occurrence.  An unusual cluster of respiratory infection was seen.  And China is extremely advanced, both in its medical care and its immunology, and of course its genetics.  So it was able to sequence this virus very quickly.  So relatively simple, single-stranded RNA virus.  And they have actually already come up with a medicine that they're testing, an antiviral medicine that was already on their shelf that they found to be effective against this, and it seems to be having good results with a high safety profile.  It's very early days to say.  In terms of the spread outside China, it's a complex thing as well.  So clearly it is spreading, and that's reflective of many things.  It's reflective of the fact that we used to think of Britain as the workshop of the world.  Really now China is the workshop of the world and is intimately connected in terms of its transport links and economic infrastructure with the entire world.  That's, of course, put it to a degree at loggerheads with the United States.  And that plays out in a number of ways, military, political, diplomatic and economic.  But it's certainly true that we should be cautious of this virus.  Overall, is it a pandemic?  It's interesting to see that the World Health Organization haven't declared it a pandemic.  because actually the numbers, there's no strict definition of the numbers necessary to declare a pandemic.  It's quite possible to declare it a cluster or a localized outbreak.  There have been very few cases outside around the world.  What do we know about its mortality and how dangerous it is?  Well, the picture is, as I'm sure you've noted in your program, it's emerging.  So that it's quite a dangerous illness for an 80-year-old to get.  But someone who's younger than nine probably is asymptomatic.  No one's died.  And it's for them really almost trivial.  Where it becomes dangerous is if A large enough number of people in the population, in the world's population, get it, that even a very small mortality can result in a large number of deaths and a large strain on health infrastructure.  Stop me if I'm going on too long, George. ",

I made the point, maybe some might think at a cheap point, but if I were in the United States, I'd be loath to present with the symptoms of the coronavirus because I couldn't afford it.  I can't afford to take time off work because nobody will pay me if I'm not at work and I can't afford the medical bills.  I'm just an ordinary Joe in the United States.  I'd be scared, very scared of getting it.  In Britain, where we have a health service, at least for the moment, I'd be worried as to whether the hard-pressed NHS, where trolley medicine is becoming a norm in some places, would be able to cope with a big outbreak here.

            "text": "I think that's an entirely reasonable point.  So when we look at systems, of course, I mean, there's an undercurrent, a subversive undercurrent in the way that this outbreak is portrayed in the media.  No credit whatsoever has been given to China for their incredible efforts.  I think they've moved heaven and earth very successfully.  They themselves have pointed out that a certain doctor who initially raised alarm seemed to have initially met with some resistance.  That's not unusual in any system.  And in fact, they've subsequently look at anti-corruption officials to ensure that no suppression of this valuable information was ever taking place.  But there's a kind of grey propaganda, what used to be referred to in the old Soviet days, we used to have an information research department, George Orwell was actually a member of that, who were systematically placing negative propaganda stories against the Soviet Union in our media.  I mean, they haven't gone a long way.  That's a kind of modern existing phenomenon.  But of course, Soviet Union is no longer the enemy.  China is a major enemy of our country.  And they're constantly going on about the subversive command and control economy and trying to say in some way that this is the fault of China.  Of course, you know, diseases are resolved as humanity.  But there's a brilliant book.  I don't know if you've read it or any of your viewers have read it.  I recommend it to you if you haven't.  It's called Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond.  And it talks about the clash of old civilizations with new civilizations and the way in which infection actually and resistance to infection grew up with densely populated human civilization.  So it's as old as really human beings inhabiting cities, living closely with livestock and other animals and vermin and parasites.  And the transmission of disease backwards and forwards between the two is an age old phenomenon.  We've seen many very significant outbreaks of health problems.  I suppose flu is one that is important to compare it with, and we can come back to that, and certainly we could talk about the world flu pandemic in 1918, which is an interesting analogy.  But just coming back to the point about how does one care for your working class population, the overwhelming population of every country's working class.  In Britain, yes, we have an NHS.  I mean, in terms of preparedness, You know, the NHS is not well prepared for major strains upon it because we're operating at absolutely maximal capacity.  Part of the PFI initiative and the constant drive to really privatise the NHS, which has come to a very advanced stage now with Simon Stevens, who is formerly actually chief executive of one of the chief executives of the International Department of United Health, a huge insurance company, has come back and now he's actually running our NHS.  I don't know how many of your viewers will be aware of that.  And there's a constant drive towards privatization and the private finance initiative, which redeveloped our hospitals using capital essentially from banks and corporate finance, meant not only is it hugely draining of our resources in terms of the mortgage repayments.  uh you know we borrowed 12 billion and we're having to repay 1992 billion so it's a massive.  uh it's eightfold.  we're having to pay back what we borrowed.  so it's not been a saving it's been a massive drain on the current financial balance which is why every single trust in the country is actually in debt now.  and that debt is being used to drive further austerity measures.  and despite Boris, having come to, you know, smashing the Red Wall and promising to do something about the underfunding of the NHS, is saying that Brexit is going to materially benefit the NHS.  He himself came out only a few weeks ago saying, well, actually, you know, this chap, Simon Stevens, has too much operational control.  And Boris finds himself unable to affect the financial management of the NHS.  Part of that PFI was a constant reduction.  As they redeveloped every hospital, there was a reduction in the number of beds in every hospital.  So that actually, while we used to have cottage hospitals, where we used to have a certain amount of redundant capacity, I can tell you that every hospital in the land basically operates at full stretch all the time.  It's almost like hotbedding, you know?  As soon as one patient is out, quickly clean the bed, a new one comes in.  It's not good conditions for controlling infection.  It's not good conditions if there's any kind of extra stress.  And it's a constant concern that I've had throughout my career for the last five or ten years, certainly, of not being able to get elective surgical patients into beds because emergencies are filling those beds already.  So the NHS is at a real straining point, and I don't want to panic-monger, But everyone who works within the NHS will recognise that picture that I'm painting.  That's a fact that no politician can speak away.  So were there to be a... I mean, currently, I do have to say there's like 30 cases.  I think there's now been one death of a British man from a cruise ship.  You can't call that a pandemic compared to almost any other disease that we're talking about.  And we mustn't forget that flu, when we talk about just straightforward influenza, affects hundreds of millions of people a year, and probably from respiratory deaths alone, causes 500,000 deaths worldwide, and total deaths, probably a million deaths worldwide.  So absolutely dwarfs, currently, the SARS pandemic.  And it's in that respect that I think a lot of your viewers will say there's an overreaction in the way it's being portrayed.  But in terms of our preparedness to deal with any kind of extra strain on the NHS, I agree with you.  There are real issues with the ability of the NHS currently to cope. ",

But of course, there are other countries which started out with 30 cases and now they have hundreds of cases and one or two of them, thousands of cases.  Is there anything that we should be doing that we can tell our viewers and listeners tonight.  I was alarmed as a man over 60 who goes to football matches to be told that people over 60 should avoid big crowds.  Maybe I should go and watch Manchester City.  There's never much of a crowd there.  But I support someone else.  And I'm amongst big crowds all the time.  Should we be avoiding crowds?  Should football be being canceled and so on? ",

            "text": "I think it's a really good question.  I think the high risk areas are, you know, the London tube is going to be a hotspot should we come to a generalized infection.  It's a hotspot for getting flu.  I mean, people in London who use a tube will recognize that they catch flu on the tube.  They're used to people sneezing in the densely packed trains in the morning.  And of course, you know, this is a virus which basically is spread by airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing.  I won't go into why that is, but essentially there's an angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor on it which localizes and makes it able to penetrate the endothelial lining of the lung.  So it is an extremely infectious agent, there's no question.  So if it were to become generalized, yes, it's reasonable to avoid crowds right now, I guess.  airline travel would be a place where you're likely to catch it.  I myself and my wife, my wife's from China, we were due to go on a long break over Easter and see her family in Hong Kong.  She has elderly relatives.  We, despite thinking that the chances of catching it overall are low given the numbers, are concerned.  we don't want to be the ones who are spreading that vector to an elderly population.  Well, we'll be safe, our children will be safe.  That's precisely the danger in that.  At the moment, we can't be absolutely sure how far this will spread, because the majority of young and middle-aged people who catch it will be almost totally asymptomatic.  So there are dangers of spreading it.  Yes, the danger is in the crowd.  But I must emphasize, at the moment, there are relatively small numbers.  And compared to other health emergencies, I think China has done a fantastic job of limiting it.  It is obviously up to other countries, to intercede.  And I understand why Dr.  Gabor Jesus, the leader of the World Health Organization, would be particularly worried about less developed countries, because where they don't have the ability to test, they don't have many medical facilities, and the population are more immunosuppressed, they're at higher risk, and probably that's the reason that there were massive pandemics.  For example, the world influenza outbreak in 1918 killed between 50 and 100 million people.  But that, of course, came on the heels of the war. ",

Soldiers and the general population were malnourished and, therefore, immunosuppressed.  And for that reason, it was a consequence not just of the pathogen itself, but the complex way in which that interacts with society.  And when society is poor and depressed, and you know, there's a world crisis now, and they may say that the economic crisis was over.  In fact, they're saying it's being reignited and saying that this virus is the outbreak.  If one virus is enough to precipitate world economic crisis, it tells you something about the precarious state of the economy.  So it's a slightly more complex phenomenon than that.  But of course, these things can spread rapidly around the world. ",
