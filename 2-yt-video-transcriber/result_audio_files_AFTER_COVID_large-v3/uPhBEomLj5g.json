            "text": "Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Graham Elwood, and you are watching The Political Vigilante.  Well, as we've been covering for over a year now, the Jeffrey Epstein story, it's expanded, of course, to notice how the billionaire... ruling class, many of which are pedophiles and sex traffickers.  So the most powerful people in the world that control the media and the politicians and countries and everything like that from several royal families, both political parties in this country, we keep showing how they keep kind of getting protection.  They keep getting covered up.  Well, it happened again recently.  Peter Nygaard, who I've talked about, billionaire, All these people have come forward to talk about.  he is a pedophile.  He abused children.  So there's a civil lawsuit happening, and the U.S.  government got involved.  Weird.  So this is it.  This is in CBC.  CBCN News.  So this is up in Canada.  This came out about a week ago.  A class action lawsuit against Peter Nygaard involving 57 women who alleged the former fashion executive sexually assaulted them has been put on hold.  Wait a minute, what?  The U.S.  government requests a stay of proceedings?  Now I covered this when this, it's in my Epstein playlist.  All my Epstein videos are in there.  The judge presiding over the case in Southern District of New York entered a stay of proceedings on Friday.  court record show.  Well, gee, let's find out who that judge is.  Is it Judge Preska?  She's been quite effective at withholding, not making sure documents aren't released.  You see how these... The most powerful people in the world, they can't have this information come out.  Remember when the Podesta emails came out?  There's no actual information in the Podesta email saying, oh, we're going to go, you know, rape and sell children.  But all this weird, creepy language about pizza.  And then the FBI on their website says all these terms for pizza are used as code.  So if the most powerful people in the world are raping and trafficking children, they then have power all the way up to the reaches of the government.  Why would this happen?  The judge's order is sealed, but a screenshot of the court docket posted to Twitter on Friday by Pete Bush, a reporter of the New York Court Service.  Law 360 shows the U.S.  government was granted leave to intervene.  It also shows the government is directed to inform the court within 48 hours of the completion of its proceedings and advise the court whether it may lift the stay.  A stay of proceedings means the case has been put on hold, but it doesn't mean it's been dropped.  They're stalling.  The court can later lift the stay and continue the proceedings.  In February, the FBI raided Nygaard's New York offices as part of a criminal sex trafficking investigation shortly after the class action was filed.  No charges have been laid.  Isn't that a consistent pattern?  Remember when they raided?  Jeffrey Epstein's New York penthouse, and you saw the guys in FBI jackets wheeling out cart after cart with all these boxes and documents and all this stuff.  Where's that?  Jalene Maxwell has been arrested for two months now.  They arrested her July 2nd or July 3rd.  It's now September 3rd.  Two months.  Where's her all information?  They raided Epstein's horrifying creep island in the Virgin Islands.  Where's all that information?  Where is it?  Her court case isn't until a year from now.  It's really going to take a year?  You see how this, they just keep stalling and keep delaying and they hope we all go away.  They hope we all go away.  I'm not.  I'm not going away.  I want to keep covering this.  In Canada and the  U.S.,  lawyers can tell witnesses to testify in a civil trial, but unlike in Canada, Americans can depose witnesses prior to trial regardless of a police probe.  Nygaard denies the sexual assault claims, and none of the allegation has been proven in court.  Because the government won't release the documents?  They keep intervening?  In February 10th, 10 women filed a class action lawsuit against Nygaard and his companions and his companies, alleging he had raped and sexually assaulted the plaintiffs.  Other women have since signed the lawsuit from the  U.S.,  Canada, and the Bahamas, bringing the total number involved to 57.  The allegations date back to 1977, and some of the women say they were as young as 14 and 15 years old.  In July, he filed a claim to dismiss.  A motion to dismiss, he filed, arguing that 50 of the women have no connection to New York and the American court doesn't have jurisdiction over them.  Last week, two of Nygaard's sons launched a separate lawsuit alleging Nygaard set them up to be raped by his girlfriend, described as a known sex worker when they were teenagers.  That happens a lot.  It's horrifying.  This awful notion that You know, if a grown man in his 30s or whatever has sex with a teenage girl, well, he's an awful pedophile and a creep.  But if a woman in her late 20s or 30s or older has sex with a teenage boy, hey, the guy gets high-fived.  And I'm here to tell you that's not true.  And I have friends of mine who that happened to, guys, who older women had sex with them.  Let's call it what it was.  Raped them.  And they felt weird about it, and people said, oh, you're in the club now, or one guy got grounded by his parents because the woman was from their church, and all this awful shit.  And it's such an insane double standard.  And there's plenty of double standards that women have to put up with, of course.  And this is one that, that, and I know men, some guys who had that happen to them and they're like in denial about it.  They're like, Hey, you know, I got into the club and I remember being a younger guy going, Oh man, I wish when I was 15, some hot 30 year old would.  And I look back now and I go, that's insane.  You're 15.  Your brain's not even developed.  You're a 15 year old boy.  A beautiful woman could make a 15-year-old boy do anything.  Your hormones are going through the roof.  That's a child.  A 15-year-old is a child.  In the eyes of the law and in the eyes of physiology, the human brain isn't fully developed until it's like in its early 20s.  And he did this to his sons?  Because he's a creep pedophile.  Nygaard's companies, as have offices in Winnipeg, New York, and Toronto, have been in court-ordered receivership since May 18th to pay back more than $25 million to U.S.-secured lenders.  It goes on and on.  Among other things, the court ordered the company to hand over documents, records, and communications concerning or reflecting allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment, or assault by Peter Nygaard.  So let's see here.  I'm going to just copy this.  Use Ecosia.org.  Use this search engine.  Don't use the ugly D. Put this there.  And we're going to put Nygaard.  Let's see what comes up together.  Mm-hmm.  All this about class action lawsuit put on hold.  Let's see who.  It's basically just the same story we just read.  Okay, so this is case state.  This is what Pete Bush put on Twitter.  The government is granted leave to intervene as right pursuant federal of court.  The government is directed to inform the court within 48 hours.  Okay.  Signed by Judge Eduardo Ramos.  So that's the judge, Judge Eduardo Ramos.  Let's look up Judge Eduardo Ramos.  Eduardo, sorry, Eduardo Ramos.  Let's see his history.  See how easy this is to just kind of, I just wanted to do this, I wanted you guys to do this with me.  Okay?  All right, this is his history, all right.  Thurgood Marshall, okay.  He's the judge, all right.  Individual practices.  Let's see what we have here.  Deputy clerk, communication, okay.  Regressed for injurement, all right.  So that's just sort of basic court stuff.  Let's see what happens when we go back here.  Let's go to his Wikipedia page.  See what we find there.  Bachelor's of Arts at Yale University.  Went to Harvard Law.  Okay.  From 87 to 92, Ramos worked in a private legal practice as an associate with Simpson, Thatcher, and Bartlett.  I'm an assistant U.S.  attorney at Eastern District of New York.  We prosecuted case of white collar fry.  Okay.  Everything's fine.  Ramos was a part of the law firm Day Pitney LLP.  Okay.  I wonder what they do.  He was put in power by Obama, Southern District of New York.  Senate confirmed his nomination December 5th, 2011, six days before Obama signed the NDAA.  On May 22, 2019, Ramos affirmed the validity of subpoenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One by two committees of the U.S.  House of Representatives.  The same subpoenas asked for financial records relating to Donald Trump, his children, and his businesses.  Okay.  On May 20th, Rommel's granted Trump's attorneys their request for a stay so they could pursue an expelled appeal through the courts.  All right, so nothing really, you know, just nothing really stand out.  We're not seeing any of the same names other than Obama.  Okay.  I just, I always like to see because sometimes... Did he go to this school?  He worked at William Barr's law firm.  I mean, you see stuff like that.  When you're dealing with the Epstein stuff and the global pedophile rings, you've got to really look for that.  You'll start to see the same names again.  We haven't so far.  Maybe there's something I missed.  That was just a cursory search.  I just wanted to show you.  I just wanted to show you.  Every time you see some story about it, just do a little bit of digging.  Just a little bit of digging.  See what you find.  So far, nothing that I see around us other than he's an Obama guy.  Okay.  We'll keep digging.  The U.S.  court suddenly is defending Peter Nygaard and dismissing the 57 women and his two sons that have accused him.  We'll keep digging.  Corporate media is not going to cover this story the way I have.  That's why you come here.  I'm going to keep going on this.  I said I wouldn't stop a year ago.  Still not stopping.  Thanks for watching the show. ",
