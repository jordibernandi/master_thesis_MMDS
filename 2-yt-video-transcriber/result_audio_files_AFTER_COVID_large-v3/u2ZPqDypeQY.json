            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Prep.  This is an epic, awesome, amazing episode of the Boxing Authority Liberty BitChute YouTube channel.  Today, I'm going to tell you how you can keep your AMD Ryzen 9 3950X or 3900X CPU from getting too hot in your computer if you have the right motherboard.  So if you watched my computer build, you would know that I am running an Asus Prime X570P OK motherboard, and I'm using the stock firmware that came on it right here.  And I have found two secrets.  I'm going to show you at least one of them today on how you can make the CPU run cool in your computer.  And I haven't lost performance, at least that I can notice.  So awesome.  Theoretically, with this method, you could even use a CPU cooler like this, although I'm certainly not suggesting or recommending it.  You can see I haven't tried it as this one still has the heat sink on it, or the heat paste on it.  I've never used this heat sink, ever.  I am, however, using the Noctua NH-D15 cooler that you saw me install on my computer, and that's the one we're using in this video.  So first, let's talk about temperatures, alright?  Now, I don't know what AMD says that the Ryzen 9 is supposed to be able to run at as far as temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit, but I've always been told that a CPU shouldn't run over 104 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius.  That's just... what I've known from the past.  However, with the Ryzen 9, it's common with default stock settings to see them run anywhere between 80 degrees Celsius up to 90 degrees Celsius, and that's getting really close to like 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I mean, that's insane.  That's like your car engine, right?  So in the ASUS BIOS here, once you've gotten past the easy mode, you're in the advanced mode, at the top here, you're going to say AI Tweaker, AI Tweaker, okay?  So you go down this list and the most important setting is gonna be your Precision Boost Overdrive.  Now some people just completely turn this off in order to solve their problems.  But precision boost overdrive can actually help.  And what precision boost overdrive does that is helpful is when your computer is doing a single core process, it will go ahead and allow the CPU to run faster, hotter on that one process.  And as long as you keep this on, that is still going to happen.  So that means that even though you set a thermal level of 54 degrees Celsius, which is about 130 degrees Fahrenheit, you still might see it spike once in a while, and I mean spike, right?  It's not going to stay there, hopefully.  It's going to spike up to 151 degrees or 54 Fahrenheit in there.  And that's not the end of the world.  It does it just for a second.  But if you think it is, you can go ahead in here and you can shut off Precision Boost Overdrive, which a lot of people have done.  And I'm actually thinking that might be a good idea for me to just shut it off completely.  But in any case, we have a platform thermal throttle limit, and we change that to manual here instead of auto.  And then I just set mine at 54 degrees Celsius, which is 130 degrees Fahrenheit.  And by doing that, it has helped my CPU most of the time stay at or below 130 degrees Fahrenheit with slight spikes once in a while up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit when it's doing multi-core processes and that sort of thing.  I did set my temperature alert on my computer to notify me if it goes over 103 degrees Fahrenheit.  Now also, there are some other settings in here and the motherboard actually tells you in these settings that if you turn them on, The motherboard may actually lie to you about the temperatures.  It tells you that you might get false temperatures if you have some of these settings turned on.  I turned them off.  I don't know where they are because I'm not seeing the ones listed here that I turned off.  They all say auto or whatever here.  And then my memory frequency was wrong, just so you know.  Don't know if that matters to you, but my memory frequency was 2666, and the memory I have in here is 3200.  So I changed that, and I checked the cast latency and everything, and it looks like it's automatically figured that out.  Now even if we disable precision boost overdrive, it still apparently will let us do a platform thermal throttle limit.  So if that's what you want to do, that may extend the life of your CPU.  Please excuse the noise.  We have a project here that's 10.4 minutes long, or sorry, 12.4 minutes long.  And it finished rendering, did I say in 10?  Is it actually doing it faster?  Yes, it did.  Look at that.  OK, so we rendered a 12.04 minute project in 10 minutes, 4 seconds.  So it is rendering the project faster in a shorter amount of time than the length of the project, and that is very good.  All right, so I don't know how well you can see all this, but right now the CPU is running at about 41 degrees Celsius.  Our max is at 61.9 Celsius, and our minimum is at 37.9 Celsius.  Now we're gonna go ahead and run Cinebench.  I'm not using any special fans on this to keep it cool.  I'm just using the cooler I showed you, the Noctua one.  And there's three 120mm fans that are blowing air into the system and one that's blowing it out.  And they're not Noctua, they're just generic fans.  So I'm going to show you that we can keep the temperatures cool while doing this.  So check this out.  All right, so we just completed our test.  We've got the graph down here.  We got a score on Cinebench of 3,691, which is better than the Intel Xeon CPUX 5650, okay.  Reach over here, I'm gonna turn on my fourth fan.  It's gonna get really loud.  And we'll run this test again.  All right, so this time we got a slightly higher score.  The number is 3,702.  Now, if I hit run again, let's just watch what it does.  I'm gonna hit run.  Okay, we're gonna put this up here and we, I'm gonna, yep, there we've seen a spike.  So the peak is actually the entire test because the Ryzen 9 is finishing the test so quickly in Cinebench, but the whole test is happening during this peak right here.  And But the difference is then this is our idle in between tests here.  And I just ran it again without the turbo fan on.  But it didn't really have time to saturate the CPU with heat.  So actually I think, well, yeah, I think I'm a little off because I've run the test three times.  And with and without the fan, these are about the same.  Here's without the fan, and there's a little piece of brown that's just slightly higher on the third test without the fan running, with the front of the case open and the fan off.  So they look so similar.  Now, if I'm rendering a 4K Ultra HD video like this one and it's going to be running for a while, then I'm going to want that turbo fan or some fan on in the top of my computer case.  And so I'm thinking of swapping out that turbo fan that I have up there for just a regular CPU fan and just leaving it on all the time.  But we're running our CPU.  It's running cooler.  It's not running at 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 90 degrees Celsius or anything like that.  We're able to keep it all under control here.  No problems.  And all we had to do was go into the BIOS and change those settings.  I'm very happy with this, and by default, as far as I know, your motherboard's going to want to overclock the CPU.  That's what Precision Boost Overdrive does, and there's several other features in there that also boost the CPU by default.  And I honestly, after reading what AMD has said about overclocking, I think that the default settings in the chipsets technically are violating the default specs of what AMD is allowing for their warranty for their CPUs.  But I think AMD is also responsible for that chipset as far as I know.  And UEFI biases, I don't know what they're responsible for in that.  Anyways, in any case, you can run your computer every day if you want to, keep it cool, and you shouldn't have any problems as long as you keep the thermal limits in place and as long as your CPU cooler is capable of at least keeping the CPU cool at idle temperatures.
