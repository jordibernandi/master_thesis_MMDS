            "text": "What's happening, fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Subscribe or die trying.  You see the title.  You know where I'm about to go with this.  I did a live yesterday.  Shout out to JoJo and the Real Dana about Massage Noir.  And at some point, there was a lady.  They had a picture.  I'm guessing the lady was African by her last name.  So I'm going to take it for face value.  Could be somebody trolling.  I know it.  But this lady was telling other women not to... Was telling the lady not to give her man a gift for Christmas.  You know what I'm saying?  And I was looking at it like, you said, this is a problem.  And so for people who come along, this is what this is about.  So... This is how y'all going to end up, like that picture.  The picture that's on the thumbnail is a year or two years ago when a lady decided that she turned 40 and she married herself and she had a whole wedding for herself and her mama had gave her away to herself.  See, this is where y'all headed.  This is where the girl, you don't need no man.  This is where it ends up.  You're going to have a wedding with yourself, with your friends, with no men around.  And then what's going to happen?  You know, this is how some of y'all stay perpetually single because a girl, you don't need no man.  Keep working on you.  You work.  You've been working on you for 132 years.  You ain't done yet.  You can't work with another person yet.  And then you let these women come around here and tell you what you don't need.  You don't need no man, girl.  You look good in that girl.  You look like James Harden in that outfit.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Because then you want, I don't know why, I'm a good person, I'm a good woman.  Girl, look like you can do a step back.  Listen, stop letting these girlfriends gas you up to be lonely for life, okay?  Stop letting these women who are on, you know, whatever kick they on, let you be lonely for life.  Because they don't have your best interests at heart.  You know, the same girl that'll tell you, you know, don't worry about that.  You don't need no man, girl.  The minute she meet a guy, she going to leave you.  Or the minute she meet a girl, she going to leave you.  Where you been at?  I ain't talked to you in years.  I know.  She told you, you didn't need a man.  She wasn't talking about herself.  Unless, like I said, she got a girlfriend.  This is how it's going to end up.  You're going to go to college, get an education, get a career.  And when you're 49 years old, I'm ready to be married and have kids.  Listen to them.  Girl, you don't need a man.  Don't worry about them.  They're going to always be there.  Okay?  Girl, I'm 49.  I love me.  Do you take yourself to be your lawfully wedded bride to have and to hold through sickness and in hell?  Could you submit to yourself?  I don't know about that word.  submit now.  I can't submit to me either now.  You know... But yes, but I do.  Will you take yourself to be lawfully wedded wife to having to hold through sickness and in health and rich up on?  I do.  I do.  Like, stop listening to these fools.  They're going to get you jammed up.  Girl, let's go eat.  Let's go to brunch.  Ooh, let's go have shots.  Ooh, let's go have mimosas.  Yes, let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's eat a salad.  How come your friends don't say let's go work out together?  How come your friends don't say, you know, let's take a walk.  Let's not order that.  Let's eat some salad.  Let's eat healthier.  Girl, you know what?  Maybe we need to go talk to somebody.  No, they tell you what you don't need and you wind up by your doggone self.  Like that doggone thumbnail picture.  Your girlfriends love you.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  You know what I'm saying?  Unless they want to lick you like an ice cream cone on a Sunday, I'm trying to tell you they don't like you like that.  I know you think they do.  But how does it end up?  How does it end up?  You in the bathroom doing a body challenge, twerking for yourself in the mirror.  You doing it, girl.  You doing it, girl.  Oh, you get it, girl.  Get it, girl.  Like, no.  No!  I'm not a good person today.  But this is where we at with it.  Stop listening to your friends sabotage you.  Like I said, subscribe or die trying.  I'm out of here, man.  I got time for this.  Peace. ",
