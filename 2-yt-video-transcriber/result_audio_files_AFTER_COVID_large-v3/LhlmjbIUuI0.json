            "text": "So Biden's in really good shape, but here's the problem with Joe, and it is a huge problem.  Joe can't speak.  I'm going to show you, and I'm not doing this to be mean.  Some right wing commentators, of which I am not a right wing commentator, I'm an independent commentator, but some right wing commentators, they're mean to Joe.  Joe's having problems.  But because this affects you, the American citizen, all right, you need to see it.  Roll it.  Look, tomorrow's Super Thursday, Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.  I tell you what, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?  We hold these truths to be self-evident.  All men and women created by, you know the thing.  Yeah, I do know it, Joe.  Endowed by your creator.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  But you either don't know it or didn't want to use the word creator.  Which is possible because your party is not exactly friendly to religion or the deity.  Okay?  Bernie Sanders is an atheist.  I just found that out.  I didn't know that.  But he's an atheist.  Not to say there's anything wrong with being an atheist.  I'm not condemning him.  That would be unchristian of me to do it.  But not only is he a socialist, he's an atheist too.  Karl Marx would love Bernie.  Anyway, Biden can't speak.  He can't formulate his thoughts into words.  That's going to be really tough.  Now, what is going to happen?  They're going to keep old Joe away.  from the national media.  They're gonna do them state by state.  All right, he'll do local, but they're gonna keep him away because they know it's a disaster waiting to happen. ",
