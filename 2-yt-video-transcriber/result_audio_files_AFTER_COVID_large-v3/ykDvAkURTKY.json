            "text": "We have received information in social media that some of the criminals were going to take your criminal conduct into the neighborhoods.  I would tell them if you value your life, you probably shouldn't do that in Polk County.  Because the people of Polk County like guns.  They have guns.  I encourage them to own guns.  And they're going to be in their homes tonight with their guns loaded.  And if you try to break into their homes to steal, to set fires, I'm highly recommending they blow you back out of the house with their guns.  So leave the community alone.  And we'll do our best to support the community.  But ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it.  All of that ugliness has taken away from what we're united about.  We're united about.  The conduct that you saw with George where his life was taken with the knee to the neck is horrific and there's not enough words to explain that.  Let's get the focus on that. ",
