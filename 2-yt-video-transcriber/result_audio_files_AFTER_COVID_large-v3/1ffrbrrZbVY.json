            "text": "Hi there, Matt Jonah Jones here.  Many thanks for all your views and shares of my channel.  I recently had the opportunity of chatting with an old Royal Marine friend, Chris Thrall, quite well renowned in the YouTube world and well worth a watch if you get the chance.  I was specifically intrigued with his piece on being called out as a Walter Mitty.  Most of us former servicemen are not really bothered by those who dress up and pretend, so long as they are not causing any bother, not capitalising for financial gain, and not dishonouring the memories of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.  If someone does look out of place, then we may have a quiet word in their ear.  For all we know, they could be a bona fide veteran.  that's just having a bad day.  We've all had one of those.  Back to Chris Thrall.  I wanted to prove him as the real deal in a swift and humorous manner, the approach I might use for any Walter Mitty suspect.  I decided to create 10 questions that, in my view, only a Royal Marine could answer.  No trick questions, just simple poses that no one could possibly know, research or Google.  If you're a former or serving bootneck, then let me know in the comments below as to how long it took you to get the answers.  Diversely, if you have never served as a bootneck and can answer all the questions, then I'd be curious to know what sort of warped mind you have.  Anyway, this is how the interview went. ",

And I always want to pass the information I know to young people, whether they want to use it or not, because I came from a time in life where your, your parents' generation didn't really teach you much of any use.  All the stuff they should have been talking about was kind of taboo back then.  And lots of stuff was, uh, brushed under the carpet.  What I wanted to do in this video was trying to get the point across to young people that look up to me.  They hear the Marine moniker and that's something that they aspire to in some way.  And I wanted to say, fellas, look, if you have an issue with someone, The way to go about that is not to take to the internet and make all that public.  And I highlighted this guy that had come out and accused me of not serving.  A former Matlow, so sailor, our brother, right? ",
