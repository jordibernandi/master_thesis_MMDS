            "text": "I'm guessing most of us have experienced a breakup at some point or another.  And it's never easy.  In fact, it's really awful when you're in high school and maybe it's your first love and you've never really dealt with heartbreak like that.  But a lot of people have gone through that.  Hopefully you learned something from the experience and you carry that with you into future relationships.  Okay, now imagine it's 10 years after graduation.  You haven't really even talked to your high school ex outside of a few Facebook messages here and there.  In fact, you've been married to someone else for years.  But then you get a physical letter at your parents' house from your high school girlfriend's father.  And he is pissed because at some point between high school and now, he found out that you had sex with his daughter.  That seriously happened to someone recently and his friend shared a copy of the letter on Twitter with their names covered up.  I'm gonna read it to you because holy hell, it is just full of crazy.  But I hope you stick around because I got in touch with the boyfriend in question and I have a few updates you may want to hear.  Also, I should mention this up front.  A few years after this guy graduated from high school, the girl's dad actually confronted him in person about this loss of virginity thing.  The boy was pretty freaked out about it, so he apologized and thought that would be the end of it.  I mean, it was for him.  But apparently the dad has never stopped thinking about his daughter's sex life.  It's creepy.  And it's all because of Christianity.  And then last month, he sent that boy this letter.  Alright, let's do this.  Demand for restitution for stealing my daughter's honor.  It has been nearly 10 years since I learned that you stole my daughter's virginity.  Initially, it was my intention to forgive you.  But after I confronted you about it and you expressed repentance, I later learned that you have since gone and done the same to others.  Moreover, you have regarded the matter more like winning a game than the despicable deed it was.  So I have decided to irrevocably retract any offer of forgiveness.  So not only is the father obsessed with his daughter's sex life, he's pretty much Facebook stalking this guy to see who he's dating, and then somehow he knows about the sex lives of the other women.  Yikes.  And how exactly does he know the boy thinks of this as some kind of game?  Not everyone treats sex the same way, but this dad can't stop obsessing about it.  In the interim, I have thought, prayed and studied the Scriptures seeking for an appropriate response.  At the time, I was a man of modest means, and you deliberately took from me my most precious treasure.  a treasure I invested my heart and soul and every available resource in creating.  For a brief pleasure, you forever took from me the sublime joy of giving my pure, virgin daughter a way in marriage to her chosen husband.  Moreover, you broke trust with me and God, for you promised me as a Christian brother to diligently guard against this very act.  As a father myself, if I ever refer to my daughter's genitalia as my most precious treasure, you need to unsubscribe and maybe call the police.  And how does he know the pleasure was brief?  And seriously, even if we think a wedding tradition like a father giving a man his daughter's hand in marriage is cute, which it's totally not, why is that somehow less special if the woman isn't a virgin?  This guy makes it sound like his daughter's wedding day is all about him.  It's bizarre.  It's also really selfish.  Since you have not raised a daughter, you cannot imagine the emotions and feelings that I have endured without relief since then.  However, I will tell you that my wrath against you is so great that to kill you by prolonged and extreme torture, followed by the thorough desecration and destruction of your corpse, would not be enough to extinguish my anger.  However, I am restrained from doing violence against you by the sole fact that I have given my heart to our Savior, Jesus Christ.  And doing willful harm to a fellow Christian is an impossibility.  Moreover, I cannot hate a person enough to desire that they should suffer eternal torment in hell.  So I have sought for a resolution somewhere in between these extremes.  I am raising a daughter and I don't get this guy's emotions and feelings either.  I certainly don't get the murderous rage this guy feels in the name of Christ.  And I know this is cliche, but if the only thing stopping you from murder is Jesus, You have a problem.  After years of searching, long nights spent in examining possible courses of action, I have settled on a form of restitution that fits the principles God ordained in the revelation of His Scripture.  It is derived from the following points.  I won't read you the Bible verses, just his summaries.  This should be good.  When Jacob sought to marry Rachel, the daughter of Laban, they agreed that Jacob would first serve Laban for seven full years tending his herds, flocks and tribes.  Therefore, if we had mutually agreed that you could marry my daughter, the equivalent of seven years of your full-time service would have been a reasonable bride price.  However, we had no agreement, and you took my daughter's virginity through deception and seduction.  Therefore it was stolen, and you are a thief and a liar.  The Scriptures state that when a thief is discovered, he must repay sevenfold what was stolen, even to all that he has.  In fact, if a thief does not have the means to make full restitution, they may be sold into slavery as well.  Therefore, the restitution is seven times seven years, or 49 years of the prime years of your life.  For you have no material possession, nor is there any amount of labor or money I would accept as restitution.  Moreover, the Law of Moses states that a father may refuse marriage to his daughter to a man who seduces her, but still require the bride price.  When the Canaanite Sechem raped Dinah, the daughter of Israel, Sechem offered restitution, saying, Ask me for as great a bride price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me.  Only give me the young woman to be my wife.  Jesus Christ.  First of all, if he stole her virginity, then I am really worried about how someone might interpret paying back what you stole seven times over.  But this guy wants 49 years of the boy's life.  So I have decided to petition the courts of heaven to take from you and give to me that which is your dearest possession, your youth and all the good that goes with it.  Specifically, I demand divine restitution that will age you and rejuvenate me 49 years.  Therefore, if from this date you discover that you have aged significantly or are aging rapidly, know that it is not a medical condition.  It is the judgment of God.  Nor will I relent and give it back to you under any circumstances.  for nothing you can do could restore my daughter's virginity and our family's honor.  You have also stained your family's honor, but that is another matter you must face with them.  Moreover, you did this detestable deed under the guise of professing the Christian faith.  Therefore, you have offended Christ, grieved the Holy Spirit, and tarnished the reputation of all true Christians.  If you will make an appeal, make it to them and see how they answer you.  Even if my divine petition is not accepted and you do not age, know that you are still in the wrong and are separated from God until you are reconciled with me.  Lastly, I will add that you have committed the act of fornication.  This is specifically forbidden to Christians, grieves the Holy Spirit, and condemns the perpetrator to eternal torment in hell.  i have actually seen hell first-hand and assure you that it is very real and terrible beyond description.  with this restitution your debt to me will be paid.  I do not know how many other parents you have similarly swindled and robbed, but that is also another matter, and how you will reconcile with them is your concern.  However, you must still repent and ask God for His forgiveness to have any hope of salvation.  I do not expect He is pleased with you.  He seriously wants to steal the boy's youth.  Somehow this went from overprotective Christian father to weird comic villain.  And the father wants God's help to turn into Benjamin Button.  Can you even imagine getting that letter?  I honestly thought it was a joke at first.  A very elaborate joke.  But after talking to the boyfriend, it was clear.  this was very real.  I am protecting his anonymity here at his request, but here are a few things he said to me.  Yes, he has spoken to his ex-girlfriend since receiving this letter.  They haven't talked too much since they broke up, which is a totally normal thing, but this definitely warranted a conversation.  He told me she was shocked but not surprised that her father did this, since he was always a purity culture promoting type of Christian dad.  The daughter never quite shared those views.  If you're not familiar with purity culture, by the way, lucky you, we are talking about a mindset that's popular in evangelical Christianity where young people are basically taught to treat sex as the most important thing ever.  They wear abstinence rings.  They sign a pledge that they won't give up their virginity until marriage.  They go to those creepy daddy-daughter dances.  Basically, they live their lives as if their first time, on their wedding day, of course, is the pinnacle of anything they will ever achieve.  Which, as anyone who has had sex exactly once will tell you, is hopefully not the case.  Purity culture has been criticized a lot in the past few years, including by evangelicals.  But dads like this exist.  They take this stuff seriously.  They really do believe their daughter's hymen is something they can gift to another man.  It's such a messed up way of thinking.  And so many Christian women who have left the religion have spoken out about the serious damage this mentality caused.  And while we're on the subject, it's also really messed up that the dad says the boy stole the daughter's virginity.  First of all, both of them were involved.  It was consensual.  And also, everyone needs to stop pretending like virginity is some sacred piece of art that can only either be cherished or taken.  Relax.  You can be a virgin.  You can choose not to be.  One of those options is not better than the other.  But unless it's not consensual, theft is not a word to use in connection with it.  Another question I had.  Has the boyfriend responded to the dad?  No.  He was debating whether or not he should.  Part of him was laughing at this whole thing.  Part of him was wondering whether he needed to get a restraining order.  If there's any silver lining here, it's that everyone in his life, including his current wife, thinks this is the most hilarious letter ever.  I also asked him, somewhat jokingly, if he's aged significantly since receiving the letter.  Surprise!  No.  Not even close.  But he said that if he does respond, he may attach a program taken with that FaceApp program that lets you age yourself.  I would so be on board with that.  In all seriousness, what troubled him the most about this letter was the father treating his daughter as if she is his property.  That's something that he thought only existed in some other cultures and religions, not the Christianity he's most familiar with.  Even when he dated the girl in question, the dad was a bit overbearing, but nothing like this.  In any case, the daughter's virginity may be gone, but I am glad this letter will live on forever, so that everyone can see what happens when you take Christian fundamentalism regarding sex to its logical conclusion.
