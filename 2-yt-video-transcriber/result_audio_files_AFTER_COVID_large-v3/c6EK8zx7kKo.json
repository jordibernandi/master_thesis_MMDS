            "text": "The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett was the third ultraconservative justice Trump was able to appoint to the Supreme Court in just four years.  He was also able to appoint a record number of lifetime federal judges across the country.  Now millions of progressives are worried about what this new Supreme Court dynamic could mean.  in terms of maintaining their constitutionally protected rights and preserving any new potential gains.  To join me to discuss more is constitutional lawyer Mara Verheyden-Hilliard of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund.  Mara, thank you so much for joining me.  So Trump has recently called for the Supreme Court to intervene in the presidential election.  Of course, we all remember the famous Bush v. Gore case in 2000 where the Supreme Court essentially handpicked President George W. Bush over, I don't know, around 500, what they deemed illegitimate votes.  Pretty stark example of of what I would call right-wing coup.  Now, Trump, of course, ramming through these three ultra-conservative justices in his short term thus far.  Do you think that the Supreme Court would have any standing here to intervene as Trump is claiming? ",

            "text": "Well, I guess there's two questions.  There's the political standing, and there's the legal standing.  Obviously, Trump is hoping that he can work up a case sufficient to get to the Supreme Court and have the Supreme Court, which is now packed with his appointees, determine that some number of ballots, particularly the mail-in ballots that were being counted on election day or thereafter, that he feels changed the outcome for him, are somehow not legitimate ballots.  That's his goal.  That's his focus.  And he's obviously hoping that there is some wisp of a legal basis to have those ballots thrown out.  And there are finally multiple lawsuits in many states, it sounds like.  And they're trying to find some angle.  So the angle is that they try and get affidavits from people to say that they think that the counting was done improperly or that they weren't allowed to get their observers in close enough.  to observe, although over and over again, everyone is describing the number of observers and cameras and the number of people's hands that a ballot has to go through in order to be certified such that no one person is just making the decision.  But they're desperately trying to find something, or they want to say that ballots aren't postmarked properly, or that the state laws or the decisions that are allowing ballots to be received after a certain period of time or after Election Day or somehow not legitimate, even though it's Trump and the Trump administration that did everything they could to derail the American Postal Service to try and delay ballots from being received.  So there's many different avenues.  they're trying.  They're throwing up a lot of garbage and hoping that something sticks.  that it will stick enough that it will get past one court and another court and that maybe they can find their way to the Supreme Court, which, again, is packed with Trump appointees.  The court has already in several circumstances directed that ballots received after Election Day or after a point in time on Election Day be segregated.  So they left that door open that somehow there is a distinction between ballots received on election day by a certain time and ballots that were received afterwards.  But there's also the political reality right now.  And I think the Supreme Court would really have to consider that.  whether or not if they were to intervene, if they were to throw this election back, if they were to invalidate hundreds of thousands of people's actual votes and legitimate votes, what that would do to the legitimacy of the court in people's views.  And I think we all know that were that to happen, a significant portion of American society would really see the court as fully illegitimate and nothing more than a pure political tool. ",

            "text": "It's going to be very damaging for civil rights and civil liberties.  There is no question about it.  The cases that are coming up, the cases that are going through district courts and courts of appeal, these federal courts, and ultimately up to the Supreme Court, are now going to be decided by judges who have a particular political point of view and the clerks that they bring in who see everything through their own lens.  And that is not friendly or hospitable to civil rights, to human rights, to civil liberties in many instances.  That's a reality.  But there's also the reality, again, like on the Supreme Court, you could see with Justice Roberts changing his position or an expected position in a number of instances, that the courts always have to balance out a political agenda with delegitimizing themselves.  And if the courts begin to look over and over and over again like nothing more than unlegal rubber stamps for a political agenda, they're going to lose any sense of legitimacy with the American public.  And that's a very dangerous path to go on.  But again, you know, just to remind everyone that the idea that everything that happens that's progressive in American society happens in the courts in sort of a isolated or neutral universe is a fantasy.  The courts both act in terms of the political reality of the justices that are appointed, even though everyone likes to pretend that's not true, everybody knows it's true.  And then at the same time, there is a complete response to what is happening outside and on the streets, just as the legislative response is always a response to what's actually happening outside on the streets.  And so that's how you can have the Supreme Court you know, shift so dramatically decade after decade and centuries in taking positions that then later fully shifts on because society has changed and the court is forced to change with society.

Hardwick supporting as constitutional laws that said that people couldn't engage in sex, that two men could not have sexual relations.  And then 17 years later, they just overturned that.  And then some years after that, suddenly then you have marriage equality.  Now, if all these things were enshrined in the Constitution, and so obviously enshrined as constitutional or unconstitutional, they couldn't change, just as you wouldn't be able to go from.  you know, Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson, I mean, saying that black people do not possess rights as American citizens, and that being separate but equal is acceptable to suddenly, you know, not suddenly, but over a period of struggle, then Brown v. Board of Education.  So over and over again, the court ultimately has to follow along with where society is at. ",

And this has been debated for quite some time in American society.  And I think even more in the recent period where people really begin to question, who are these people that make the decision?  How can it be that one person dies and tens of millions of women's healthcare is now potentially being fully erased?  This is a real question that people are asking themselves and correctly asking themselves in terms of how the court operates, how it's structured, and even this idea of lifetime appointments, that somebody can be on the court and just stay there for so very long, even if society evolves around one person, they can just hang on.

So as the progressive movement had come forward and people always fight towards justice and towards human liberation, that is the organic nature of humanity.  And then there are always the forces of reaction.  So this was a very effective and very smart initiative that was undertaken And it took years to really gain strength, to gain steam.  But what they did is by organizing on campuses in particular, they began to build up a body of ideologues, a body of lawyers, law students, judges.  who began to seed the courts, seed legal institutions and government institutions, and bring that ideology with them.  And it became very strong.  It's become very powerful.  And the progressive movement did nothing similar.  They really didn't build that structure where they were training people, where they were organizing people, but the Federalist Society did.  And you can see the outcome.  I mean, someone like Justice Kavanaugh had been groomed his whole life for the position that he now holds.  And that's really an impact of the Federalist Society. ",
