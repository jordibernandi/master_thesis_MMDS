It was on the Young Turks.  It got downvoted into oblivion.  But go watch my fucking video on PewDiePie.  Mistaken gamer bro or actual Nazi or some shit like that.  I don't remember what the title of the video was.  What I discussed is he is not anti-immigration at all.  As a matter of fact, all the way back in 2012 and 2014, he himself was literally pushing back against the Swedish Social Democrats and talking about how fucking racist young Swedes were and how frustrated he was with young Swedes.  I think throughout that time, he has radicalized for sure, like hating on um it like because of because of who he aligned himself with on the internet and whatnot.  he absolutely inadvertently without yeah alt writer irresponsible gamer here.  i'll just show you this video here.  i'll just show you this part of it Talking point back in 2014 from his own podcast.  So this is how we talked about it. ",

Anyway, PewDiePie did defend the kill stream though, which is like... insane like completely fucking unacceptable.  so my point is in this video and overall my point is he went from being like a reasonable fucking lib dude all the way to genuinely getting radicalized and a lot of people in this audience were in that exact same fucking boat.  so when i see someone like that when i see someone like that making an effort and actually trying to uh do better making an effort and actually trying to fucking do better Um, Steven defends his kill stream.  No, Destiny going on the kill stream is entirely different than PewDiePie defending the kill stream after they got fucking, uh, uh, like after they got, uh, what do you call it?  Deplatformed.  Don't be psychotic.  Destiny is one of the few people as much as I fucking despise him, uh, because he's such a little piece of shit.  Uh, like him going on the kill stream is like one of the best, uh, he's the only person who should go on the fucking kill stream.  Like, don't be ridiculous.  Kill stream is a Nazi broadcast with like a bunch of neo-Nazis and alt-right and like libertarians.  But like, that's the difference.  I'm fucking fair.  Vosh is pretty good too. ",
