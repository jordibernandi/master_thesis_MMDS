            "text": "Hi guys, how are you?  Welcome back to my channel.  I hope you're all doing well.  I'm Kim Cohen and I'm so grateful to have you here.  I just wanted to give a quick message real quick to my last video's response.  Okay, I'm going to start by saying that what I preach and what I teach is compassion above all for all mankind.  and trying to be the bigger person and understanding where someone else is coming from with all of their views.  And this applies to this video.  in this certain situation.  As many of you guys know, I stopped creating YouTube videos related to QAnon and what is going on in the world on here because of my hacking situation.  So I wanted to say, first of all, thank you to anyone and everyone that joined me on my Patreon site.  That is where I'm uploading my content now.  The good thing about being able to upload content on there is that I am uncensored.  I don't have to worry about what I'm saying, not using certain words, which, you know, even though I was exposing a lot on here, there was still a lot of things that I couldn't say and I couldn't do.  That now I can do there on my Patreon side.  I can add certain clips of actual, like if I'm referencing to something, I can actually add a clip of it and show you guys more stuff that I wasn't able to do on here because of copyrights and things like that.  So I wanted to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for anybody that joined me on my Patreon site.  I'm uploading two to three videos a week, although I already have two videos on there right now.  I just finished filming four videos, so that's gonna be going up really soon and I'm gonna be giving all my attention to my Patreon.  Now I know some of you guys don't agree with my decision and that's understandable, but I also think that people should have compassion and understand what I risked and all the risks that I took as an individual upon myself in order to do this.  I think it's so much easier said than done.  So many people were criticizing me about my decision, which I felt was very disheartening.  I think it was very disheartening and almost heartbreaking to me that that's the kind of response that I got from some of you guys.  Some of you guys were like, told me how much you love me and were rooting for me and all that stuff.  And the moment I decided to make this decision, some of you guys unsubscribe from my channel, you flipped sides, I don't even know.  And I think that's really disheartening.  So I just kind of wanted to share a couple of things in regards to all of this.  So when my, how do I explain this?  My physical life is on the line being threatened.  That's an issue.  I don't play with life.  I value my life very much and I'd hope that you have the compassion, the respect for me to value my life and not want me to get into physical danger of having people follow me or things like that.  physically follow me.  The hackers do know where I live.  I had to change my number, which they can probably get the new number as well, my phone number.  My bank account was hacked into, my emails were hacked into, business accounts from my influencer job that I do for the last six and a half years.  A lot of things were hacked into.  So A, that's my physical safety.  B, that's my personal safety.  That it's just boundaries that shouldn't be crossed.  But to top it all off, this is something that some of you guys don't know.  Um, the hacking really, really got to me.  Um, now I'm a very healthy individual most of the time.  Um, I'm a vegetarian.  I'm basically vegan.  I eat super clean.  I don't eat processed foods.  I don't eat meat.  I don't eat dairy.  I eat very healthy.  I take care of myself.  very much so.  Um, but something that people don't know and I started sharing on social media a couple of days ago.  I developed a weird skin condition and disease, something that I've never ever heard of or had to deal with.  So I believe that from personal experiences in the past, I've been to Israel a couple of times during war time and I developed PTSD from seeing bombings and things like that and not being able to get to a safe zone, like a shelter in time.  So when you're in survival mode, how do I explain this?  When you're in survival mode, you're just surviving and only when you're done being in danger, so to speak.  A lot of times I've noticed physically with me and from other studies that I've done that kind of like.  when you're like, okay, I can breathe.  And this has happened to me in my travels too, now that I think about it, when I'm like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  And the moment I come home from like a three week trip, I ended up getting sick because my immune system is weak.  So, you know, a lack of sleep, a lack of, you know, being in a lack of sleep, being in survival mode, not eating regularly because your hours are a mess, causes your immune system to be weak, therefore creates the diseases.  So, When I was in Israel, for example, during wartime, I only, I guess, developed PTSD once I calmed down and came back to America.  I didn't know what was wrong with me and thought I had a heart attack or a breast cancer or something crazy.  And then I went to the doctor and he told me it's PTSD and anxiety and panic attacks.  I didn't even know what it was prior to that.  So I've noticed that kind of reoccurring thing in my life where I'm surviving, I'm on survival mode.  The moment I get a moment to breathe, that's when a disease or a sickness comes along.  so with that being said obviously you could tell my energy is kind of off.  right now I am on meds.  I went to the hospital on um I believe it was Monday because two days prior to that so basically like a day after hmm Basically leading up to my decision and what was the final straw for me was that I developed a weird skin disease.  The doctor isn't exactly sure of what it is fully.  He thinks it's shingles.  Shingles is a strand from chicken pox.  It's caused by stress.  He said it's not hives, it's not allergy, it's not a rash, it's none of that.  um and so what happened was I had a day where I started itching a night where I started itching a lot on my neck and it kind of became this like super weird bubbly like disgusting fucking thing.  and then I started itching here on this side and I started itching here on this side.  and then when I saw what this looked like I was like oh my god I need to stop itching.  So I've been on meds and I've been taking cream for a couple of days now.  It's starting to kinda disappear as you see different color right here.  I'm gonna put some pictures of what actually was going on with my skin.  And then this side is a little less.  And what happened was is I felt it.  It feels kind of like a sensation of hot and cold.  Hot and cold, itchy, burning sensation and it sucks because it's literally right here.  So every time I turned my head when I try to put a pillow to sleep, it would really hurt and irritate me and I would be in bed and I couldn't fall asleep.  And I was like, okay, maybe it's going to go away.  Maybe it's like an allergy.  Maybe, I don't know, I ate something.  I don't know.  I haven't gone to the hospital in many, many, many years.  I don't believe in hospitals.  I don't believe in the medical world at all.  I'm totally against it.  I try to do home remedies.  I put coconut oil on it and then it was burning even more.  And it just, the next day I woke up, I was very weak.  I felt like I was gonna faint or something.  I felt it in my veins and I was scared that I was having an allergic reaction and my sister is allergic to testamine and she had hives all over one time and she went in an ambulance because they were scared that her throat would close up and she couldn't breathe.  So when it was right there, that's kind of the fear that I was getting.  Like I didn't know where this was going and I've never had to deal with anything like this.  And as you guys know, I just moved here so my family's not here.  So I was kind of getting very worried about the whole situation.  I went to the hospital, which was kind of insane considering the circumstance of the world right now.  And that's why I also don't have my necklace on.  And the doctor took samples.  My blood pressure is good.  My heart's good.  My temperature is good.  All of that was great.  But this is not great.  And this is caused from stress.  And I think that that's what happened when I decided to just surrender to the hacking situation.  It just kind of developed because my body was constantly on survival mode.  I had to deal with this hacking situation literally from morning till night.  When I say morning till night, I know that people have different time zones of where they like to sleep in.  I go to sleep, I would say between 4 a.m.  And sometimes 10 a.m.  because I've been doing so much research and because I would just see such a significant decrease in following with the hacking going on.  Again, this was happening on an everyday base.  YouTube would get it off.  A few minutes later, it would come back.  then I send them an email, then they would try to get it off, then it would come back.  And this is ongoing for 10 weeks.  10 weeks, you guys, I don't think you understand, but that's 70 days.  That's almost 100 days out of my life that I was living in this current situation where I did not feel safe.  Anyways, right now I'm recovering.  I am on meds and I have a special cream lotion.  And although it's looking better, It's also started to get under my chin and I started to feel it kind of on this side of my face and I'm kind of scared it's going to go all over my face.  God forbid, please pray for me that it doesn't go on my face.  I'm not allowed to be in the sun because it irritates it and it can spread to other places.  I do feel other places in my body. ",
