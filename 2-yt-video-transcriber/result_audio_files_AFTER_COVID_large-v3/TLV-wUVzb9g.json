And all I'm trying to say is I do a lot of street ministry and this is something that IMPD has trampled on my own first amendment rights and I've had to have them back off on this issue.  So all I'm saying right now is, and I asked this officer where he had violated the law, he didn't answer that.  I'm willing, I mean, if what he was doing was unlawful, And what I was doing was unlawful, then I would cease and desist.  But we weren't instructed in that, if I'm making sense. ",

            "text": "This video is great.  It's so far one of my favorite First Amendment audits of all time.  This is from a Facebook Live feed from John Jacob.  He was at the post office to conduct some business and experienced a First Amendment audit happening while he was there.  He decided to pull out his phone and conduct an audit himself.  He didn't really recognize his video as a First Amendment audit.  At first, he said he was filming the cop who was there to deal with the auditor.  Guys, this is exactly what we need to start happening everywhere.  People standing up and saying, hey, what's going on here isn't right.  This is how we can affect change.  I cut this one short on purpose, so you will go see the rest on his Facebook page and give him support.  A link to his video is in the description.  Go check it out and say hi, and tell him questionable authority sent you and to keep it up.  While you're still here, hit the like button, share this video on all your social media, subscribe, and leave me a comment with your thoughts on how this video came about. ",

            "text": "This is really interesting.  This gentleman is just doing his first amendment rights here, and there's an IMPD officer here.  It's actually trying to escort him out.  I'm just asking him.  All I'm asking you to do is wait for a supervisor.  That's all.  I'm not with him.  I'm just observing what this is going on.  So actually, I'm saying you actually... Let's state what's going on correctly.  Have I violated a law, sir?  Did I say you have?  No, but you're asking him to leave.  I'm just observing what he's doing.  I didn't ask him to leave.  I asked him to wait right here.  Well, you did say that.  You did ask him to actually leave where he's at right here.  You did say they wanted me trespassed.  Officer holding?  We'll figure that out once the supervisor gets here.  Well, you need to call federal police because this is federal property.  Federal police will inform you that their rules and regulations are right there.  I have a DHS memo in my backpack.  Can you get that out?  Yes, sir, I can.  So you're saying that he is actually federally trespassing?  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that they've asked him to leave, so we have to address that.  But why?  What has he done?  The staff wants him to leave.  So we have to come here and deal with this.  But under what law?  You weren't called to service, so you were just standing in line.  But I get that.  Hi.  How are you?  Yes, I'm good.  You are not authorized to film any employees.  You are not authorized to film any retail transactions.  Yes.  Transactions, you're right.  You're filming the employees in their retail transactions.  But I can't see.  But you're filming them conducting retail business.  You're right.  You are not authorized to film any employees.  That's fine.  Who said that I don't have authorization?  You.  I've already told you, we do not have authorization.  This has also been reported to our inspection service.  So if you'd like to give me your information, I can pass it on to them as well.  He's got the DHS memo that says I can do this.  What is all this blacked out stuff?  Because it's redacted.  It's redacted.  So they are not authorized to film any employees.  They're not authorized to film retail transactions.  This is our retail window.  You are not authorized to film any transactions that they are conducting.  Is this access to the public?  Sir, you are not authorized to record any transactions that are being conducted right here.  It says right here you're only allowed to be In the lobby or foyer?  This is a lobby.  This is the lobby.  No, that is an entrance.  That is a foyer.  Entrance.  Foyer.  Lobby.  I'm sorry, I already have.  And I still have.  We have another officer coming and we've already notified the inspector.  I've got a supervisor.  So if I may just clarify.  Okay, thank you.  I'm not even, sir, I'm not even with him.  I'm just observing this whole thing.  Are you saying this is the foyer and this is the lobby?  This is your retail window.  So are you saying what's, no, just because I'm clear.  So this becomes the, so you're saying in here is wrong.  You cannot be in here, but you're saying out here, we can be out here.  But under what law?  But under what law?  You are not authorized to film employees.  Under what law?  You cannot trespass my eyes.  Whatever my eyes can see, I can film.  Under what law?  Interesting.  This is really interesting.  Wow.  I just came in here to... to the post office to take care of some business, and they're telling... So, notice, if you know any emails... Right here.  This column.  Right here.  Read that, right there.  You don't know your rules and regulations?  Sir, I know exactly what the inspection service told me, and they told me you're not authorized to be in here filming.  See, photographs for news purposes may be taken in entrances, lobbies, foyers, corridors, or auditoriums when used for public meetings except where prohibited by official signs or security first personnel or other authorized personnel or a federal court.  order or rule.  Other photographs may be taken only with the permission of a local postmaster or installation head.  that is with commission from them is restricted areas like offices.  i can't go behind that door right but it says it says we may be taken in entrances lobbies foyers quarters or auditoriums.  absolutely unless otherwise right.  right no i'm with.  i'm with you.  i understand i i'm in agreement with you and this is this is a violation of first amendment rights.  i'm really.  this is stuff that i'm.  Yeah, I was actually observing him and I was just noticing what he was doing because I know that there are people actually that do this type of stuff to actually profile how First Amendment rights are actually violated.  And as I observed him, I noticed that his First Amendment rights were actually being violated by what was going on here.  I asked this officer what law had he broken, and he was not able to say what law he had broken.  So under the Constitution of the First Amendment, with free speech, I'm just trying to understand.  Thank you.  But with this whole issue here, why this is even an issue?  That's what I'm trying to understand.  And so that's why I'm actually profiling this right now, because to me this is a violation of the First Amendment.  We have people that are doing transactions, and so we don't have anybody.  Listen, I'm completely familiar.  We have people that are doing transactions.  We don't need anybody here filming people while they're having their credit cards or doing transactions.  We're not getting up on them to sit there and get their credit card information.  He's far removed from that, sir.  Why are you filming?  I mean, what do you need to film?  Do you not understand that our free speech rights are actually being trampled on in this nation?  I'm asking you, why are you filming it?  I'm trying to explain.  Yes.  He was actually here doing some... ",
