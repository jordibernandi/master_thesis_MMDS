We've decided to come in here and pay a visit today to the Green Party headquarters and hoping we might get to possibly bump into Minister Roderick O'Gorman and the new Minister for Children.  God help us.  We're going to do a little ring of the old doorbell and call these people and see what they answer us and we're going to ask for a comment from the Green Party about the new Minister for Children, Roderick O'Gorman.  and see has he got a comment to make about his association with Peter Tatchell.  How do you feel about this?  Are you aware of Roderick O'Gorman, the new Minister for Children?  Are you aware of who he has associates with?  It's all over social media.  And RT aren't, they're not reporting on it. ",

First of all, his qualifications, that he doesn't have any children of his own.  He's never reared children.  He's never brought children into the world.  And how does he get a qualification to be over the children of this country and making crucial decisions about their education and about their care? ",
