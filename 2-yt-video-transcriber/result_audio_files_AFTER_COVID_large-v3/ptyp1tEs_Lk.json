But I wanna start this video off by talking about the spot price of silver because as I'm recording, spot price is about $24.57.  Coincidentally, That was approximately the same spot price this time last week.  If you guys remember the video I posted a week ago, I mentioned how I feel like the upcoming week is going to be a roller coaster ride of a week for silver.  And those who are stacking it, I had a feeling it was going to be a very bumpy ride.  Ended up being wrong about that because silver really did not budge at all.  Sunday night it went from $24 up to 25 then 26 and then immediately right back down to 24.  Monday 24 and change.  Tuesday 24 and change.  when day 24 and change.  I believe Thursday it creeped into the $23 and change range and then Friday was back to 24 and change.  and guess where it was all weekend 24 and change.  here we are Monday 24 and change.  so silver really has not moved much at all and I can't help but feel like a storm is on the way.  and the reason I say that is because when I woke up today, I was thinking about it and kind of just brainstorming about what silver has done over these last couple of months.  and Really the last couple of years silver has been a very slept on metal.  a lot of people have Not really taking silver into consideration.  I feel like silver hasn't really had the respect If that makes sense from a lot of people out there.  but Silver wasn't really moving all that much at all for the last couple years.  I mean, I've been stacking for about two and a half years, and every single piece of silver that I've picked up was picked up between $13 and maybe $19.  So that's a pretty small window.  It hasn't really gone up too much.  It hasn't really gone down too much.  Silver has been... somewhat complacent these last couple of years.  But then what happened in March of 2020?  What happened just a couple months ago at the very, very beginning of this whole planet Earth lockdown Nonsense.  What happened to silver?  Silver, the spot price of silver tanked.  The spot price of silver dropped from I think the $16, $17 range down to below $12.  Granted, it was just for a day.  It was just, you know, $11.90 or something like that.  for a very short while, and then it creeped up above $12, and then it stayed in the $12, $13, maybe $14 range for a little while.  So it seemingly collapsed overnight, and then slowly but surely over the last couple of months, been working its way back up.  And then when it got to the point where it was pretty much exactly where it left off prior to crashing, what happened then?  what happened after silver got back into the 16, 17, $18 range, after premiums were already through the roof, what happened then?  Last month happened.  But before we get into that, I can't help but feel that what happened in March of 2020 was almost, it seems almost like a marketing ploy on silver's behalf, because it got a lot of people talking.  When silver's not moving very much, I mean, when anything isn't moving very much, no one really cares.  No one really pays attention.  Nobody really takes it into consideration.  Nobody's really looking.  Nobody's really worrying or wondering or anything because it's not really moving very much.  That goes for everything.  That goes for gold.  That goes for stocks.  That goes to the real estate market.  That goes for absolutely everything.  Complacency does not get eyeballs.  Numbers going up or down very quickly get eyeballs.  And silver... Definitely got attention.  It definitely got a lot of people talking.  March of 2020, it got the people who love silver Talking.  It got the people who hate silver talking.  It got the people who don't really care or are indifferent about silver.  Got them talking.  And the people who didn't even know that silver stacking was even a thing, it got them talking as well.  What happened in March of 2020 introduced a lot of brand new people to the stacking concept.  And it definitely got... attention to say the least which is what marketing is creating awareness establishing your presence and you know how they say all attention is good attention.  well silver got its fair share of attention and then it worked its way back up right where it was when it left off prior to the crash.  And now getting back on track to last month, what happened last month?  after silver kind of got back to where it was from a spot price perspective, not so much a premium perspective, but what happened after?  silver got back to where it was and a little bit of time went by and then boom, silver started to really climb.  It started to hike.  It went up to $19, then it went to $20.  Coincidentally, it went to $20.  Just a couple hours after I received a comment from someone saying that silver will never hit $20 again, went to $20.  Then it went to 21 the next day.  The day after that, 22, then 23, then 24.  Then on Sunday of last week, 25, 26, then back down to 24.  So silver, did its marketing in March, but in July, it's almost like a sales pitch.  It got the attention it needed.  It got back to where it was.  And then it did its sales pitch.  And by that, I mean, it showcased its ability to perform.  It laid out on the table the value it can bring us.  I mean, those of us who have been stacking, we already knew, but the people who were just now starting to pay attention.  Silver showed those people that it can provide value.  So the question now, now that we got the marketing out of the way in March, now that we got the sales pitch out of the way in July, we're now in August.  Silver could go up, could go down.  It could continue to slowly climb.  It could rapidly go up in value.  fiat dollar bill value.  The question now is, when is silver going to follow up and close the deal?  That's my question.  That's what I'm wondering.  I don't believe it's a matter of if.  I think it's a matter of when.  That's just my opinion.  Not a financial advisor.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice.  This is all for entertainment purposes, by the way.  I don't know for sure what silver is going to do, but I have a very strong feeling silver is going to seal the deal.  I have a very strong feeling that a storm is coming for silver.  That's what I believe.  But the question is, will it be this month?  Will it be this week?  I mean, man, it could be tomorrow.  Or is silver going to fail to show up?  it got the attention it needed, it got the respect that it needed, will silver successfully follow up and close the deal?  It already marketed, it already did its sales pitch, will silver close the deal?  That's the question I'm wondering.  Now, if silver fails to show up, and the spot price starts to trickle back down into maybe the 19 and below dollar range.  If silver goes back down into the $19 range or the 18, 17, 16, $15 range, that's definitely a possibility.  In theory, it could absolutely happen.  However, even if that were to happen, I do not believe premiums are going to do anything.  I think the premiums are going to stay sky high.  I do not think that if silver drops By four, five, six dollars premium's going to move at all.  Maybe go down a dollar or two, but I really believe that the premiums are gonna stay astronomically high for a very, very long time.  That's just my opinion.  I'm not a psychic.  I unfortunately do not have inside information as great as that would be, but I don't have anything.  I don't know anything.  I'm not a psychic.  I can't make any predictions.  I'm just getting a really strong feeling that a storm is on the way for silver.  I don't want to put a time frame on it because I genuinely don't know.  Nobody knows.  But with the way things are going with the economy right now, with all the mass printing of these things, it's really only a matter of time.  It's not about if, it's about when, in my opinion.  The dollar bill is taking some serious punishment right now.  The dollar bill is getting... Pounded into the ground.  the dollar bill is getting weaker and weaker.  We all know that the dollar bill is old and brittle.  It's old and fragile.  It's sickly right now.  It's losing purchasing power.  it's been for decades and decades and decades.  But right now with everything going on.  I don't even want to say in our country, but on our planet The dollar's taken some serious punishment and it's really only a matter of time before that really begins to show.  I know we all know, we can all see it already, but I don't believe the surface has even been scratched yet.  I think the dollar bill is gonna continue to get beaten.  I think the dollar bill is gonna continue to take punishment.  And as they say, When currency gets weaker, real true money becomes stronger.  Real true money, referring to silver, also gold.  Real true honest money becomes stronger.  When fiat, paper, glorified IOU, man-made dollars become weaker and weaker, real money becomes stronger and stronger.  So, in conclusion, I really believe it's only a matter of time before silver really starts to climb.  23, 24, 25, $26, that's nothing in comparison to where silver can go.  And I can say that because silver has gone higher.  Historically speaking, we know for an absolute fact that silver has the capability of going to and above $50 an ounce.  How do we know that?  Because it already happened.  Not even a decade ago.  Silver, $50 an ounce.  And with it sitting pretty at $24.57 right now, it's not even halfway there.  Silver has plenty of room to grow and perform over time, in my opinion, from my perspective that is.  So $23, $24, $25, $26, I don't believe that's anything in comparison to where I believe silver might be going in the future.  It might be sooner rather than later.  It could happen.  In theory, it could happen.  Also in theory, silver could go above its all-time high.  I can say that too, because guess what gold just did?  It just surpassed its all time high just last week.  $1,984 as I'm recording this video.  So who's to say that silver can't break its own record?  It's definitely a possibility.  If there's one thing silver has taught us over these last couple of months, it's that anything is possible.  Silver has got the attention that it needed earlier this year.  Just last month, I would say it's done a pretty good job of proving itself.  But the question is, when is the storm coming?  It's not a matter of if, I believe it's a matter of when, in my opinion.  When is the storm coming and when is Silver going to follow up and close the deal?
