            "text": "Welcome to CVine We the People and I'm Linda Forsyth.  I am here today because we are doing a multi-part series of what happens when a website, especially a news website, goes through a rating process through fact checkers.  And we have been showing you every step of the way because C-Vine was chosen to be rated.  The website, I should say.  The C-Vine website was chosen to be rated.  And that can be a good thing or a bad thing.  It all depends on the type of rating that you get.  And then there's also the circumstance of wondering if the rating process is fair.  And so this is why C-Vine is taking you through the process that we are going through to become rated.  So I'm going to go ahead and minimize the screen.  excuse me to share this screen because i wrote an article about this and i think it's a good thing that i go ahead and put this on youtube video so you can see it.  but in the meantime the cvine website for your information is c-vine.com.  c-vine.com.  And it is news stories, American patriot news stories, everything having to do with America and our country.  And C-Vine is actually owned by We the People.  It's put into a charitable trust for you.  Nobody actually owns it.  There are trustees that are elected to the board to help run it.  And it is done in this way so we the people can have a voice.  And so that is exactly what the fact checkers are reading.  If you find it in your heart, it would be very helpful if you would consider clicking on the donation page that is up here in the taskbar and you can either do like a one-time donation or become a member of the website for you know five ten dollars a month or whatever it is that you can do.  you'll have access to everything on the website whether you're a member or not but it's something that we need in order to be able to keep everything functioning because we don't have any advertisers on our website and never we would never will.  we're not going to be held hostage about from anything.  Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and get right over to the article that I wrote And what it actually is, is the email that NewsGuard, NewsGuard is the actual fact checking service that appears to be the mother of all fact checkers.  Because if you go to their website, it's huge.  It's really big.  And they do fact checking of the New York Times and all these other mainstream media.  I don't know how Seavine got in there, but they also have off branches if you look at their website where they have fact checkers for social media and etc.  Anyway, I'm just going to get right into this.  What I had done is I had copied and pasted the actual email that was sent.  We've received a couple of other emails before this and we've got part one, two and three that has gone over each process that they had questions, things that they were concerned about that they saw was C-Vine.  But keep in mind that C-Vine is fact-checking back because there has been, quite frankly, a number of people that are very concerned about the biasness of the fact-checkers.  So we hope that NewsGuard is not like that.  um but we are going through the process and you decide.  you decide whether or not whatever rating we receive was done fairly or if we complied the way we should have or you decide what you think about the fact checker because i'm going to be asking them questions also now.  just so you are aware the fact checker that was assigned from news guard.  her name is annika schlotzka And thus far, she's been very professional and polite and accommodating.  And frankly, I've learned quite a bit from her.  So I've been impressed so far.  So okay, this is the beginning of the email.  Hi, Linda.  NewsGuard, as we move through our editorial process, I have a couple of follow-up questions for you.  If possible, it would be great to hear back about these in the next few days.  In regards to opinion content on the website, you had noted in your reply that you occasionally add an opinion piece to the breaking news section of the site, but in those cases, the word opinion is added to the headline.  However, I found numerous examples of opinionated language in stories filed under the breaking news that don't include the word opinion in the headline.  Among them are, and she lays out four articles that we went back and we looked at.  By the way, this article obviously is up on the c-find.com website.  You can look at it and you can read this.  So I don't have to read every single part of it.  Our response.  Thank you for pointing these out, and I agree with your findings in these instances.  Three of the above articles are abbreviated report proverbial bullet points of the X-22 reports that are on video.  The videos are lengthy and cover multiple news pieces.  JoLynn Live is a citizen journalist who volunteers her time to listen to the report and then writes up the highlights.  If you look at the bottom of her reports, they do say opinion, but we agree that it should also say it in the title, so it has been added.  All her future X-22 report encapsulations will include the word opinion in the title.  The other report was written by me and was factually based on a personal observation of an overwhelming response of angry citizens on Twitter.  having to do with a false allegation from mainstream media, the report was sourced.  I went back and I updated the report to add the word opinion in the title because I had indeed voiced some of my own personal thoughts based on my observations.  I will also instruct the team that in the future, all opinion-based articles be labeled as such in the title.  Okay, then NewsGuard had a statement after this.  This is something I think you may find of interest.  NewsGuard statement, for some background on this criteria, if websites do lean one way or another politically, we require them to disclose that.  Websites pass our opinion criteria if they use opinionated language in articles but disclose their position.  The Gateway Pundit is a good example.  We pass them for using opinionated language in articles because on their About page, they disclose that editorially, the Gateway Pundit espouses politically conservative worldview that support conservative positions on most cases.  And then she has the link.  On the other hand, the Huffington Post does not meet our criteria for handling the difference between news and opinion responsibly because it uses opinionated language in articles without disclosing a liberal perspective.  This is Seabine's response.  NewsGuard requires a declaration of a political leaning on the About Us page.  Editorials labeled as opinion is a fair request, but declaring a political leaning assumes people can't think for themselves and immediately places division.  On the internet of universal, oh, excuse me, In the interest of universal fairness for NewsGuard requirements, I'm seeing a large number of mainstream media that are obviously left-leaning that do not follow your criteria.  The New York Times is one example, according to the website that you fact-checked.  If you are fact checking as a service for the reader, fairness is paramount and it should be universal for all.  Editorials are meant to elicit thought.  Your criteria immediately tells them how to think.  It is not fair to immediately plant seeds of division when people can clearly see the direction of editorial content without having it declared.  People are capable of making their own observations.  That being said, Seavine does completely agree that transparency is important.  We added the following verbiage to the top of our Seavine About Us page in a comprehensive declaration of how we lean politically as follows.  About us.  This is what we added.  The existence of C-Vine is for we the people and made by we the people.  It is by and for those who love our country, believe and follow the traditional constitution of the United States, follow and implement the rule of law and support our duly elected president.  Most importantly, made for those who know we have the right for freedom of speech uncensored, which includes the freedom of press.  The grassroots wave of love for our country has amazingly spread globally as demonstrated from our many international members who recognize a duplication of the same problems we have here.  C-Vine is a voice of the people and we claim our right to that voice.  Okay, second question that Annika had.  My second question has to do with your response to one of the stories I mentioned in my email, which was CDC quietly lowers COVID-19 death count to 6%.  You mentioned in your reply that many of your sources for information are news guard.  You mentioned in your reply, which is what I said to her, Many of your sources for information are NewsGuard investors or lobbyists, as the investigations have found out, and you are paid by some of the people who make the assertions.  Anikos continues on.  I'm hoping you can clarify this for me.  To which sources are you referring?  I mentioned the CDC, health experts, and Associated Press.  Are you talking about those?  Seavine response.  The above statement I made was in reference to NewsGuard in general, which was discovered through our investigators.  But for clarification of your specific question having to do with COVID-19, yes, there are some health experts and a number of your investors who are closely tied to NewsGuard.  that had obvious agenda toward the left that you received benefit from.  In addition, the health expert opinions used as NewsGuard sources are not in agreement with many reputable practicing health experts.  These other opinions that are not used as your sources have been quite vocal about their disagreements, including the health professional experts team, which spoke at the White House.  Fact checkers need to make certain information as well-rounded for the reader for themselves.  Fact checkers need to make certain Information is well-rounded for the reader to think for themselves, a number of which who are well-schooled in medicines, physicians, researchers, et cetera.  There is a reason they call it practicing medicine.  Why not fairly allow reports from these others?  Instead, there is silencing and attempts to discredit or censor proven health experts.  Those actions show great bias.  As for the investors listed on your websites, all are left-leaning as found from our investigations.  Investors, advertisers, and even members who use your services can do much to influence NewsGuard's direction for content.  CBI members suggest you consider implementation of your own declaration criteria to NewsGuard about being a political left-leaning fact-checking service because they certainly are not coming from a position of being unbiased as based in on our in-depth investigations.  Is NewsGuard willing to consider this in the interest of universal fairness?  Our report on our findings will be forthcoming.  Annika, I offer you the opportunity again for us to conduct a taped Zoom discussion debate for the public.  If you are judging content, then in the interest of transparency, come out of the shadows and explaining fact checker actions would be essential.  In fact, substantial amounts of readers are demanding it.  The following is a case in point where a fact checker was wrong, but there was no recourse.  We are including this here as an area of great concern to the general public, using it as one example.  Please consider the following in an additional response of interest having to do with our previous COVID-19 report that we posted on our Seabine News Facebook group page.  The attached report was declared false by an independent Facebook fact checker that remains anonymous.  My question to you is, are they from and out branch of NewsGuard?  Your website declares a social media aspect to NewsGuard, but we don't know if NewsGuard has anything to do with it.  Please clarify.  The information we had posted, and there's a screenshot copy displayed below, came directly from the CDC as you can see from the source links.  Active links are added below them for you to fact check.  Observe the statement the fact checkers are declaring false.  That statement was never mentioned or alluded to in the posted report, but yet we were docked.  Observe the sentence at the top that clearly states, total US deaths, all cases.  Nowhere does it say COVID is less fatal than the flu.  It is for censoring like this, Seabine was created in the first place.  Annika, is NewsGuard willing to work together to correct areas on your end also that need improvement for the purpose of the greater good?  For the purpose of transparency and fairness?  This is a gesture that will go far in the eyes of the public.  And we went ahead and did a copy here of what was on Facebook.  It basically said that we said the flu was less fatal than, excuse me, COVID was less fatal than the flu, which we never stated that.  And we have examples here.  There is nothing that even remotely touches on that.  But yet they made the entire thing false and put up the sign to scare away the masses.  And these links that are in here, as I mentioned earlier, are from the CDC.  So this is why it's important.  that you know what fact checkers do have a good purpose as long as they do their job as long as they do what they need to do and as long as they are bringing you the truth unbiased truth to help people understand what is true and what isn't.  the reason people are so skeptical of fact checkers is because they're all liberals.  I think there may be one or two out there that aren't, but that is not what is paid attention to.  So, you know, this just adds to all the things that are going on in the confusion and the chaos.  is fact checkers lending credibility to questionable content.  So, okay, please like this video if you feel it's worthy of it.  I would love it if you were a subscriber and this is your first time.  And please discuss this.  Discuss this in the comments and we'll see what the response is from NewsGuard.  Stay tuned.  Good night, everybody. ",
