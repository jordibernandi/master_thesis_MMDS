This is the most expensive firework in the entire world, and it cost me over $160,000.  And I also bought a $5,000 firework, a $10,000 one, and this big behemoth right here is a $40,000 firework.

            "text": "Like many of you I assume that you've been exposed to MrBeast from YouTube actually pushing him whether that be on your recommended tab or on the trending tab or recommended under videos you're watching.  Essentially what this guy does is make crazy YouTube videos a lot of the time revolving around spending a ton of money.  Sometimes it even amounts to about a million dollars that he actually uses on certain things in a video.  So after first being exposed to his content I've been really trying to think about why I have a problem with it because it never sat well with me and he does a lot of good work as well.  and I know a lot of people in the comments are probably going to be saying MrBeast has done x y and z. what have you ever done which is a fair point.  he's given a lot of money to various good causes.  he's given money personally in these videos to people who need it.  But I guess in this video what I want to talk about is how he uses these situations to grow his channel and then it is in very poor taste a lot of the time where he will give a certain amount of money to someone who is in desperate need of it before then going to spend about half a million dollars on something ridiculous like the world's biggest firework.  And although it's not totally known where all his money comes from, people think, and he says it's mostly from brand deals, I'm just going to talk how it's in pretty poor taste.  during what is going on in the world currently at the moment to be throwing around so much money on ridiculous stuff which is often very wasteful stuff that can never be used again or can never be sold again and then talk about why his content is sort of exploitative just like traditional game shows back in the day.  So this video is going to be sort of split into two.  The first part is going to be talking about this game show he did a couple months ago.  The second part is going to be talking about his donations to people who needed it during the current situation in the world at the moment.  And then how he wastes loads more money on doing really, really stupid stuff.  So MrBeast set up a game show where various people would compete to win a million dollars.  He actually click baited a lot of this because he did this in the numerous rounds.  So he had parts one to four and said, you know, the last two, whatever, wins a million dollars when they don't actually win a million dollars.  So you have last to four wins a million dollars, part one.  last to stop swinging wins a million dollars part two.  lastly the toilet wins a million dollars part three.  last to stop riding bike wins one million dollars.  part four like i said no one in these videos wins a million dollars.  they win this round and get put through to the final round.  so this final round is last.  to take hand off one million dollars keeps it.  yeah it's pretty straightforward.  the finalists all put their hands on a box of a million dollars and the last one to leave basically wins that Dead serious.

You don't really get to choose how to spend your money in a proper way because I know like a lot of you, if I won a million dollars right now, a million pounds or whatever, I would not be spending it in a day.  I would not be spending it in a month.  I would not be spending it in a year.  I'd probably buy something like a new house and then I'd keep it or invest it.

He gives money to food banks and all this good stuff.  He's beating around the bush by just giving money to these good causes.  But at the end of the day, he's not doing anything significant to tackle the real problems of the world economy, of the US economy, why it's so bad.  Why unregulated capitalism and just capitalism in general is so exploitative?  He's just doing these token things and in my mind it's to make himself look better and it's to grow his brand.  Look at the title of this video.  Spending $1 million in 24 hours.  That's not.  I am helping Mark who it comes from a poor background get a better life.  Please Mark, do this gimmick with me with the money you've won.  and I can make more money off it, I can get more subscribers, I can get more YouTube fame, and I can get in the algorithm.  This video has 43 million views.  Again, if he wasn't clickbaiting everything, do you think they'd get as many views for this series?  So to do his credit, MrBeast also sets up Mark with financial advisors, just so he doesn't mismanage his new assets.  And I'm sure a lot of people will say in the comments, mark would not agree with you.  mark is happy.  mr beast did this and gave him a lot of money.  mark is happy for his new life.  he probably will have to work again since he spent most of his money.  his house is only worth a hundred thousand dollars.  so maybe i'd appreciate it if mr b said here's a million dollars in some financial advisors so you can probably never have to work again because this is a significant amount of money.  but again over the course of the video in the series mr beast has helped mark out as a. In terms of this video specifically, I find it pretty exploitative, showing a situation, MrBeast's comments and using this guy for more views, for more subscribers and for more clout for MrBeast himself.  So let's move on to a more stark problem I have with him.  So he's made recent videos about the world situation at the moment and he recently rang up a bunch of people and gave them a couple thousand dollars.  So what people do is they tell Mr.  Beast their story, how everything has affected them, their jobs, their livelihoods, their medical bills, and then he gives them a bit of money.  Notice how I say a bit, because he doesn't actually give them that much when you think about it, especially because Americans, don't have universal health care the way the government has dealt with everything has been awful.  one one thousand two hundred dollar stimulus check is not enough.  in the uk for example if you get put on the furlough scheme you get eighty percent of your wages and that goes on through to the end of september.  again pointing to a general problem i have with him is that he never does anything to tackle the real causes of these problems.  it's just.  you know here is five thousand bucks random stranger while i spend half a million dollars on the world's biggest fireworks Never thought that the whole world would just stop.  I mean, I live in New York City.  So, you know, at the beginning, I kind of was essential at my job.  And at the end, I wasn't. ",

Now, not all of those people are the same, but again, it seems to me pretty disturbing using people who are falling on insanely hard times for your clickbait video, which you've titled, I give 200,000 to people who lost their jobs.  17 million views.  He didn't give anyone $200,000.  He spread $200,000 among multiple people.  people.  Anything for clickbait from Mr.  Beast.  And like I said, a guy like Mr.  Beast who's chucking around money like anybody's business, again, I don't know exactly where it all comes from, but if it comes from brand deals, he's not doing anything to really help these people's problems directly.  Again, these people fall on hard times.  Have you seen the cost of medical bills in America?  You giving them five, seven, eight, nine, ten grand?  It's not going to help them forever.  It's just, you know, a band-aid.  And again, in this instance specifically, this is just trying to make himself look better.  This is just trying to get himself clout.  And unlike Mark's case, he's not significantly changing these guys' lives, especially with the uncertainty around everything.  that was two months ago.  most recently he uploaded a new video called i bought the world's largest firework 600 000. maybe you should have used that 600 000 to give to people who have fallen on hard times.  maybe you should have used that money to give more people.  you say you care about you know the chance for a new life instead of wasting it on probably the most ridiculous thing in terms of You shoot a firework, it explodes, and then it's gone after about 30 seconds.

            "text": "You spent $600,000 on that while giving some of these people who really need it a measly $5,000.  Again, I'm not saying it's not good he has done those things, but when you compare what he's doing, he's a guy who can throw around all this money.  You're barely doing anything in the grand scheme of things to help people with that stuff.  while you're spending so much money on ridiculous stunts.  Paid for by brands or not.  And let's get to the point, if this stuff is paid for brands, that's even more sickening, that they're just throwing around money for ridiculous stuff like this, just as he's throwing around money.  Because there are significant problems in the world right now, and there are very, very, I guess, direct problems.  It's not just, you know, general problems with capitalism, consumer capitalism, healthcare, it's literally like... People are being laid off, people are being evicted at unprecedented levels, especially in America.  When you're a guy who is either pretending or clearly cares about people by giving them so much money, I don't think now's the time to start spending it on totally ridiculous stuff.  just for clickbait videos and it's not surprising which he probably knows this video did significantly better than the video of him handing out money to people in need.  this one got 38 million views which gets him a bunch of money which also gets him a bunch of subs.  and like i said if you know there is a brand funding this he has taken them to the bank and he's made that all for himself.  so i hope you see through the course of this video why his videos in general are problematic.  and And yes, I understand the people in the comments who will say, Mr Beast has helped loads of people, he's given them loads of money, that's helped them out.  What have you done?  And of course I can say I have not done what Mr Beast has done, but I also am not in the position to help anyone with that kind of money.  When you can spend 600 grand on fireworks for a video, I don't think it's necessarily right you give so little to people who generally need it.  I also don't appreciate you exploiting their sob stories, what they talk about in traditional entertainment TV.  But of course, we all know it's just people suffering during this time.  I don't appreciate you using that for clickbait.  I don't appreciate the way you depicted Mark's home life and those comments about his home life saying you're so happy.  He won the money.  And I just think it's generally pretty tasteless to throw around so much money like this on completely frivolous stuff.  You can make entertaining YouTube content.  You can make really weird videos or crazy videos.  You don't have to waste so much.  In this context.  I can say that I don't think Mr Beast is genuinely a good guy anyway.  I think he's all doing this to create this image of himself.  I think he does the charity stuff.  Mixed in with the rest.  So people like me don't come out and say.  Why are you wasting so much money on the most ridiculous stuff imaginable.  Why don't you put this to good use.  So what he does.  is he does put the money to good use, in certain instances, in certain videos, but if you take a look at his entire channel, it's not like he's doing overall good things with his money, he's wasting his money overall.  And it's clear because the videos where he wastes the money on stupid stunts do way better, which, of course, make him more famous, which, of course, get him more subs, get him more views, get him more money for him personally.  And in the grand scheme of things, Mr Beast is hardly the worst person.  He's not an exploitative boss or anything, it doesn't look like.  He just employs a bunch of his friends.  Of course, the people who are really destroying the planet are, you know, the 1%.  It's the people who own corporations, it's the governments, it's the elite.  Mr Beast isn't necessarily part of that.  So anyway, let me know what you guys think in the comments.  Please like the video, maybe subscribe to the channel.
