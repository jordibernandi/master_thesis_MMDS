            "text": "Hey everyone, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Today on the newscast, the Israel Defense Forces announced they are drawing up plans to strike Iran's nuclear weapons facilities if needed.  Plus, the IDF will conduct a major war simulation drill in just a few months.  The Middle East is heating up and we've got all the breaking details for you today right here on the Watchman Newscast.  Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to the Watchman Newscast.  The Chief of Staff for the Israel Defense Forces, Aviv Kohavi, laid down the gauntlet today while giving a speech in Israel.  He announced that he has instructed the IDF to draw plans to strike Iran's nuclear weapons facilities.  Now, Qahavi says they will be working on these plans throughout 2021.  What does this mean?  Does it mean that war is coming to the Middle East in the very near future?  You'll get my take in a second.  Before I get into it, I just want to encourage you to subscribe to the Watchman News channel right here on YouTube and click the notification bell so you get alerts every time a new video is posted.  We're bringing you the kind of cutting edge.  Timely information that you just won't hear anywhere else for such a time as this because the Middle East never sleeps.  And events unfolding there today profoundly impact you no matter where you live.  So let's get into it.  Aviv Kohavi, again, the chief of staff for the IDF.  making, you could say on one hand, a stunning announcement, but on the other hand, entirely predictable based on Iran's actions in the region, number one, and number two, the Biden administration's desire to re-enter, expressed desire to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal.  So, Kulhavi is giving this speech today and he says, and by the way, folks, This is no guarantee that Israel is going to strike Iran's nuclear weapons facilities.  It is a contingency plan.  Meaning, as Kohavi said today, Israel believes that if Iran so chooses, they could break out, perhaps even in a few weeks time, and have a nuclear bomb.  So, considering that the Iranian regime is devoted to the destruction of the Jewish state, It's just plain common sense that the Israel Defense Forces draw up these plans for potentially having to eliminate an existential threat.  That threat, of course, being Iran's nuclear weapons program.  So in one sense, it's kind of stunning to hear the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces announce this publicly.  But on the other hand, look, it's just plain common sense and smart work and smart planning, strategic planning by the Israel Defense Forces.  Now, why did he feel the need to express this publicly that, hey, we're not going to allow Iran to acquire the bomb under any circumstances, and we do have plans drawn up to prevent that militarily if necessary.  Why did he announce this?  Why now?  Well, number one, as we've been documenting here for you on a regular basis on the Watchman Newscast, Iran is sharpening its swords, so to speak, carrying out major drills involving drones and mid-range, long-range missiles, drills in the air, at sea, and on the ground.  Clearly, they are on war footing, and they continue to threaten revenge over the deaths of Qasem Soleimani last year and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the father of their nuclear weapons program, in November 2020.  So that's the obvious first answer, but the second answer, Timing is everything here, folks, with this announcement by Aviv Kohavi, the ascension of the Biden administration.  On January 20th, Joe Biden was sworn in as president of the United States.  And for months prior to his inauguration, he had been saying, we want to reenter the Iran nuclear deal.  Now, it was very interesting today to hear Aviv Kohavi say that this would be a, quote, strategic mistake by the Biden administration.  Usually Israeli soldiers and Israeli chief of staff would not kind of delve into a political matter and comment on foreign politics, let alone domestic politics.  But he felt so strongly about it, and the Israeli political and military establishment across ideological lines, key point there, they can all agree on this, they feel so strongly that the Iran nuclear deal is a disaster, not only for Israel, but for the region, that it would spark a nuclear arms race, that it would threaten Israel's existence.  They feel so strongly about that.  that Aviv Kohavi today felt compelled to comment publicly and tell the Biden administration, which has been in office for six days, tell them, don't even think about it.  Not a good idea, strategic mistake.  And oh, by the way, if you want to reenter that deal and appease and embolden Iran, like you did in 2015 under the Obama administration, we're going to do what we have to do to prevent Iran from acquiring the bomb.  Remember the sunset clause.  Not to get too in the weeds.  What does that mean?  It means the sun sets on the deal in 2030.  After that, Iran can do whatever it wants.  It is no longer beholden to the Iran nuclear deal.  The deal runs out.  Those are the terms.  The sunset clause is the key here, folks, because, hey, the Iranian regime could behave themselves for a few years at least under the parameters of the deal.  Then when the deal ends, say, aha, in a few weeks, we're going to break out.  So, The sunset clause to me is a very, very important factor that just makes this deal, the whole point of reentering this deal, moot in terms of don't do it.  But the Biden administration seems pretty set on doing that.  So look, Israel is going to be on war footing.  I can tell you when Israel sets a red line, unlike some, they keep their red lines.  A nuclear Iran existential threat because the mullahs will really use it, folks.  This is not just... When they get the bomb, it's not just for domestic consumption.  Number one, their ideology demands that they use it to take out Israel.  They shape policy around ideology.  Do not forget that.  Number two, a nuclear Iran would spark an arms race in the region with the Saudis, Turkey, and others involved.  looking to have a bomb.  How about that?  The world's most chaotic region, the Middle East, in the grips of a nuclear arms race.  You think it's a tinderbox now?  Just wait till Iran, God forbid, would get the bomb.  Number three, it enables Iran to have a nuclear umbrella, not only for Iran, but its proxies.  How about this scenario?  Hamas starts firing rockets out of Gaza.  Hezbollah barrages Israel with rockets and missiles, God forbid.  Israel looks to respond and react.  And Iran says, Don't you dare.  Because if you dare, we don't know what we'll do.  Remember, we have the bomb, Israel.  So that supplies not only Iran, but its proxies with that nuclear deterrent and that nuclear umbrella.  So doomsday scenario.  No surprise that the IDF is stepping up, putting these plans in place.  Think about the Cold War, folks.  I'm sure the United States, where I'm coming to you from, We obviously had plans to strike the Soviet Union.  They had plans to strike us.  This is what militaries do when there is an existential threat.  That's exactly what Iran poses right now to Israel.  Two more quick things to mention before I go as we're talking about this war footing.  Number one, a very interesting story.  Israel, it was reported yesterday in Lebanese media, Israeli media picked it up today that Some Israeli F-35s, those stealth fighter jets, which you usually cannot detect, they flew low.  intentionally recently over Beirut, the Lebanese capital, and over southern Lebanon, which are both the suburbs around Beirut and southern Lebanon on Israel's doorstep.  These are Hezbollah strongholds.  I found it very interesting that Israel flew these F-35s low enough so that they could be seen and even photographed by some Lebanese media.  So Israel, again, sending a For TAT, over the past month and a half or so, we had U.S.  B-52 bombers fly low over the Persian Gulf on several occasions as well.  You have a U.S.  aircraft carrier in the Gulf, and you've had... A U.S.  nuclear submarine and an Israeli submarine also transit into the Persian Gulf area, all designed to send a message to Iran.  So very interesting with the F-35's last point as we're talking about, God forbid, a coming war.  And again, I have to stress, just because Israel's drawing up plans, to strike Iran's nuclear facilities.  Doesn't mean they're going to, but to be better safe than sorry.  Any wise military will do that.  That's exactly what Israel is doing.  Last point along those lines, summer 2021.  It can't come fast enough.  Give me some warm weather.  Summer 2021, Israel will be conducting a major war simulation drill.  Very interesting, folks.  This is apparently going to last for a full month in Israel.  It will involve land, ground forces, the Israeli Air Force.  And basically, my understanding is just from reading reports on it out of Israel and out of the Middle East, that this will... be a situation where Israel is preparing to fight a war on all fronts, meaning, and we've talked about this right on the newscast more in a second, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad, his regime, and various radical Iranian-backed forces in Syria.  perhaps even the Houthis in Yemen, perhaps missiles and drones out of Iraq to the east, and Iran to the east, of course.  So what Israel is doing, I think very wisely, is having a massive simulation saying, okay, what if we get attacked on all sides?  which if you've heard us talk about the coming Great Northern War here on the newscast, you know is unfortunately a distinct possibility.  Could a strike on Iran's nuclear weapons facilities be the trigger for this?  Have you read Ezekiel 38 and 39, the War of Gog and Magog?  Very interesting times we are living in, folks.  But right now, Israel is surrounded, obviously, enemies on all sides.  And when that Great Northern War breaks out with Israel, it's a question, again, talking to Israeli military officials over the past few years, they tell me it's a question not of if, but when it happens.  Israel has no choice.  Hezbollah perched on its border with some on its border.  with some 150,000 rockets and missiles pointed at every inch of Israel.  It's an intolerable situation, not to mention the Iranian entrenchment in Syria near Israel's Golan Heights.  So when Israel's going at it, eventually that day will come against those forces to the north, the Great Northern War, You can bet that to the south there will be a diversion, a potential diversion created.  Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two other Iranian proxies will throw their hats in the ring, fire rockets and missiles as well.  Then you have a wild card in Yemen, far to Israel's south, not too far along the Red Sea coast.  You have the Houthis, that other Iranian proxy there.  Israel's got the Iron Dome missile defense battery, but man, oh man, when you are bombarded on all sides, and we're not even mentioning Iran and Iraq, missiles and drones coming from those countries to Israel's east, Israel's up against it.  They'll be just fine.  Not only has Iron Dome proven miraculous over the years in shooting down David's Sling as well, and shooting down enemy rockets and drones, the Israel Defense Forces are very well prepared.  I've been at live fire drills.  I filmed them with the IDF.  And I think the biggest point about it is Israel has an invaluable ally, and his name is the God of Israel, and he neither slumbers nor sleeps.  So take heart, don't get discouraged, bringing you this news because you need to know.  for such a time as this, 2021 will be a very interesting year.  Let's hope that the new administration here in the U.S.  makes wise choices, does not reenter that Iran nuclear deal, does not box Israel into a corner by doing so and embolden Iran by doing so.  Let's keep praying for that, but expect the unexpected.  as we head into 2021, in particular in the Middle East, the world's most strategic and chaotic region.
