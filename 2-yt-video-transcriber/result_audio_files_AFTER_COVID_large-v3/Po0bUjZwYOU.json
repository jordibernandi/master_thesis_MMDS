Paul from Colorado writes, We are fortunate in Colorado to have vote by mail.  I've been voting by mail for years, and I sincerely hope Congress is able to overcome Republican obstructionism and voter suppression to allow everyone to vote by mail.  Thanks.  You've had the firsthand experience with it.  And here's Tom from Wisconsin.  My 85-year-old parents are going to have to risk their lives to go to the polls here in Wisconsin on April 7th because they refuse to postpone.  I get it, Tom.  This isn't right and it is not a choice anyone should have to make.  Mitch McConnell should call the Senate back in session so we can get to work.  Americans are in crisis and we must do everything we can to provide relief.  Relief to students, relief to our seniors, relief to our small business owners.  And we must protect our democracy.  I've got a plan to make in-person voting safer and to offer citizens the option to vote by mail and early vote.  Go to ElizabethWarren.com to learn more and join us. ",
