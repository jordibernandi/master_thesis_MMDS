Nod my head, don't close my eyes Halfway on a slow move.  It's the same way you showed me.  If you could fly, then you'd feel south up North's getting cold.  soon The way it is, we're on land I'm soon.  the whole drill.  Keep it cool in this.  good life Won't let you down when it's all ruined.  That's the same way you show me.  Show me.  You show me And glory from above, good glory dear.  And it's all downhill from here In the wake of a hurricane, dark skin of a summer shade Nose dive in the floodlights, tall tower milk red.  It's the same way you showed me Cannonball off the porch side Older kids trying off the roof.  Just the same way you showed me If you could die and come back to life Far for air from the swimming pool You kneel down to the dry land Kiss the earth that burnt.  you Gave you tools just to stay alive And make it up when the sun is rolling.  That's the same way you showed me.  Showed me.  You showed me love And glory from above where God could feel And it's all downhill from here.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Thanks for watching! ",
