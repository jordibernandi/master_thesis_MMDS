Your body is too wrinkly, he said without pause.  I have spoiled myself over the years with young women.  I just can't get excited with you.  I love your energy and your laughter.  I like your head and your heart, but I just can't deal with your body.  I was stunned, she says.  The hurt would come later.  I asked him slowly and carefully if he found my body hard to look at.  He said yes.  So this means seeing me naked was troublesome to you, I asked.  He told me he had just looked away.  And when the lights were out, he pretended my body was younger.  That I was younger.  My breath came deep and full as I processed this information.  My face blazed as I felt embarrassed and shamed. ",
