            "text": "talk about the 80 20 rule about you know why women are all sleeping around.  well here's what women are now telling other women and this is everywhere.  Okay, female dating strategies, of course.  Your 20s are not for dating losers who drag you down and damage your self-esteem.  It's your fun decade to build yourself up.  Remember your 20s?  This is your fun decade, all the way till 30.  That is what the garbage that women are buying when they don't realize, excuse me, their fertility, their eggs will dry up.  So if they want a family, it's best to start it as young as possible.  Definitely young 20s, not waiting till you're 30. so this this is all that is all just a reminder to all the young women here.  your 20s are for investing in yourself and being the best that you can be.  they are also about learning how to attract and date high value men.  what is that code for writing the cc?  experience all the men.  Now, again, when we know about hypergamy, that if she attains one thing, she's going to want to keep going for the next.  So again, we have all these women that instead of investing in a family, and again, there are some women that don't want a family, and that's totally fine.  But that's small.  A lot of women, I think, are brainwashed into thinking, no, that's not what I want.  I don't want a family and all that stuff.  When a lot of women realize when they're older, yeah, I want a family.  I'm not going to say every woman does because there are some women that are happy with their decision, but it's very few and far between.  It's not the time to spend eight years in a relationship with someone who puts you down because he's intimidated by you, a strong woman, and wants to keep you low.  Go forth and level up.  The comments on this one we're discussing as well about how all men are like they can't handle strong women.  They just want to degrade you and put your self-esteem down and all that stuff.  It's like, nah, they just have no idea.  But again, this is the stuff that women... are brought up with two.  that goes, why would a guy, why would a guy, and I saw someone else put up in here about alpha seeds and beta needs.  And that is something that women have been able to capitalize on for a long time.  What they wanna do in their 20s is sleep with the most alpha guys, experience all that stuff.  thinking i'm gonna get it out now so i then then i can settle down for the beta provider the nice guy safe guy later to get all my resources met and all that stuff.  but they don't understand that their own hypergamy makes this a disaster for them and the guy that they the beta provider that they would end up with because the the women that taste everything in their 20s it's it's it's.  It's like if you were wanting to drink alcohol every single day.  Eventually, your tolerance gets built up to where you're going to have to drink more and more alcohol to get a little buzz to the point where then you see there's guys that will drink a whole bottle of vodka or whatever just to get a buzz because of the tolerance they built up.  That is exactly how hypergamy is working with the modern dating situation.  They test out all these guys so they think that they can attain them.  Their standards are so high that now any guy afterwards that would still treat them like a queen and everything for them, they look at that guy like that guy's beneath them.  And then they think they're doing that guy a favor by settling down with him.  And then later they get a divorce.  They take this guy to the corrupt courts.  That guy gets screwed over and they wonder why men are walking away.  Because their game plan is literally to set their standards so high that no man can live up to them.  And then the corrupt court system are going to eat that guy alive, not her, later.  And a lot of guys don't realize, a lot of times you as the man have to pay for her attorney, for her lawyer.  So she can argue as much as she wants because you're paying for all that stuff.  So she's going to try to get every nickel, dime, and everything else out of you.  She's going to try to get the kids out of your custody and to hers because she gets more money.  It's sad.  Again, not all women will do this, but when this is a possibility, why, why would, why would a guy risk this?  Why would a guy, why would any sane man risk this?  Oh man.  Let me see if this is one I wanted to.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's put, we'll put this one up too here.  I'm going to read this before we get to number four.  Okay, so this is from another female dating strategy.  It was just in one of the comment sections under one of these other memes I showed you.  For a while I was kind of perplexed by why I could find relationship after relationship back when I was in high school and college, and then seriously underemployed for years while also being overweight, but have so much trouble in the past few years.  now that I'm in pretty good shape, independent, and have a great job.  have come to realize there are not a lot of men that are actually into women they can't exploit.  That's how they say it.  Again, it's all men's fault.  So she was realizing before she hit the wall that she could get relationship after relationship, all that.  And now that she's strong and independent, no man wants her.  She doesn't realize it's because of the wall and because of her entitled attitude that men don't want her.  and instead she blames it on.  well men don't want women they can't exploit.  so again this is why culture society looks down upon men and women feed into the propaganda.  look at this one.  every man says they want a strong independent woman.  no they don't.  this is the propaganda you hear.  this is what women believe because they hear this over and over again and they are suckers for propaganda.  Like how many guys how many guys here have ever said on their list like the number one thing I want is a strong and independent woman?  No No, that's not No way.  We want sweet, nurturing, caring.  We want the softer side of things.  We don't want to compete.  We want the opposite.  We want something that complements us, not the same.  We don't want to compete with a strong, independent woman.  But as soon as they have it, they feel emasculated and like she doesn't need him.  No, she doesn't need you to survive.  She's been kicking A-word on her own, but she wants you as a partner, not a sugar daddy.  I used to not to tell men I own my own house.  Every time I have, they get insecure like they are behind or whatever word they wanna use to describe their situation.  But now I don't care.  I want someone who is proud of the things I've accomplished by myself, not some jealous, insecure child.  Again, what women don't understand is women are attracted to men with status and achievements and all that resources.  So women think that men are attracted to that too.  They just have no clue that I just don't care about an achievement a woman has.  I just don't care.  I want her to be sweet, caring, loving, nurturing.  I don't care if she has a master's degree.  I don't care how much she makes at her job.  I think a lot of men are that way.  Wake up, women.  Or don't.  We don't care anymore.  But whatever.  However, I very much feel that the more I level up my life, I'm in school and working two jobs and nearly debt-free, the less appealing I'm going to be to men and the shallower the dating pool is going to become.  She understands a little bit that, yeah, her own hypergamy, the more that she levels up, she's going to expect more in a man.  If a girl has a college degree, she's going to want a guy with a college degree or above or better.  A girl has one nice paying job.  She's going to want a guy that has a higher paying job.  So again, the more women achieve, the less their pool is.  But then the men at the highest that they want, those men don't need another provider in the relationship.  Those men don't need another breadwinner.  Those men need somebody that can take care of the social aspect of things.  They want someone that could raise a family.  So the women that compete, compete, compete, They think they're going to get the highest status men, but these men aren't looking for women to compete.  So like she said, the shallower the dating pool is going to become, absolutely.  Sleeping around and then achieving all these things, it just becomes more shallow because of her own hypergamy.  But yet, she'll blame it on men.  Yeah, homeowner and small business owner pursuing a master's checking in.  I found someone.  Look at this.  I found someone, but we're getting a divorce because I refused to sell my rental properties and he actively sabotaged me going for my degree in a couple of really lucrative business deals.  I'm sure.  I'm sure that's what happened.  I'm sure they're getting a divorce because... Because she refused to sell her rental properties and she wanted some really lucrative business deals.  And he's like, no, you can't do that.  We don't want more money coming in.  I'm sure that's the reason they got their divorce.  Again, it's all going to be pinned on the man.  Said he liked it best when I was dependent on him.  Yep, provider.  It's just the instinct that we have.  Women want one thing.  Us men, we understand that.  We respect that fine.  But now women want to play both ends.  They want to tell men what they need to look for in women too.  Sorry, honey, but I don't want to be dependable.  I want to be dependable, not dependent.
