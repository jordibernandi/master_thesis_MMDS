I am really glad to have some time today to do a deep dove on videos from a focus group with Trump supporters.  This was hosted on Monday night, two days before the inauguration of Joe Biden.  We've been talking about what do we do now?  about seventy five million trumpets?  How do we deprogram?  And it's really an important insight into the mind of the Trump voter and what we're up against for these next two and four years.  This is a focus group done by Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican focus group guy who has been anti Trump for some time.  And if we are to understand how to deprogram trumpets, we have to understand how they ended up believing the things they believe.  And this is the perfect window through which to do that.  So let's get right in.  We're going to have lots of analysis of this, but let's get right into the first clip and let me know whether you find this type of segment useful. ",

And right now, by the way, I'm living in Washington, D.C.  I'm staying with my daughter these past two weeks, and it's a nightmare here.  It's a nightmare.  But I listen to the news.

And she says, I've been watching Fox News, which has not actually made the connection that Trump incited the pro Trump mob that did the rioting.  So it's really important to see how her beliefs are directly informed by how Fox did or maybe better said, did not cover the riots.

Twitter itself isn't news, although there can be news articles posted to Twitter.  But I would be interested in seeing who these folks are following on Twitter.  So it's a lack of media literacy.

Rather than just arguing with people about the facts, if we establish a foundation of media literacy, you insulate people from even falling prey to a lot of this stuff.  This is a perfect example.

They might seem like satirical caricatures, but it's literally what they're saying and what they believe.  Now, if you think that this is useful, I do want to hear from you.

So here's the takeaway.  That's a focus group with 12 Trump voters, 11 of them just 48 hours, not even 36 hours before the inauguration of Joe Biden.  are completely disconnected from reality and they seem to be beyond reach.  Eleven of those 12 people, I don't even know how we reach them.  One of the 12, Jim from Michigan, actually saw what happened and saw things for what they are and said, I can't be a part of this.  This is wrong.  And he sort of seems to have deprogrammed himself.  That's really rare.  And the fact that one out of 12 people did that is very important.  That may be the proportion that we're working with in terms of what portion of these people can reasonably be deprogrammed.  And as you can imagine, one out of 12 is not enough.  It's not enough to fix the problems that we have in this country.  It's not a great percentage.  So hopefully this is really good work, actually, by Frank Luntz.  Hopefully this helps us to understand the issue.  And the more we understand it, the more of a shot we have at fixing it.  And we'll be talking more in the coming weeks about how it can maybe be fixed.  But as you can see, that's an uphill battle.  That's a real uphill battle.  We'll have more on this on our Instagram page at David Pakman show on Instagram.  While you're there, follow me on Instagram at David Pakman.  I'm really excited that one of our sponsors today is Helix Sleep.  I sleep on a Helix mattress at home.  I absolutely love it.  And that's why I reached out to them about sponsoring the David Pakman show, buying a mattress in the past.  was always a huge guessing game for me.  I didn't know what I actually needed.  I didn't know what I would like.  But Helix has a sleep quiz on their website.  You tell them your body type, your sleeping position, your back pain issues you might have.  And their tool matched me with a mattress that is perfect for me.  It's cool enough at night.  It's the right firmness.  I generally just do way better sleeping these days because of the mattress.  Helix was awarded number one best overall mattress for the last two years by both GQ and Wired magazine.  It is well deserved.  I can tell you firsthand every Helix mattress comes with a 10 year warranty.  You can try the mattress risk free for 100 nights and they will even come pick it up at your house if you don't love it.
