Because I'm sure you, among other intelligence professionals, are saying, as ex-president, Trump could disclose the secrets he learned while in office, current and former officials fear.  All presidents exit the office with valuable secrets on their heads, including the procedures for launching nuclear weapons, intelligence-gathering capabilities, including assets deep inside foreign governments, and the development of new and advanced weapons systems.  Trump has a history, of course, of disclosures.  He checks the boxes of a classic... counterintelligence risk.  He is deeply in debt, angry at the U.S.  government, particularly what he describes as the deep state conspiracy he believes tried to stop him from winning in 2016 and falsely claims is an illegal effort to rob him of reelection.  A knowledgeable and informed president with Trump's personality characteristics, including a lack of self-discipline, would be a disaster.

And this is the plan?  And now you have other Q people going, this election of Biden was part of the plan.  I mean, it's driving them crazy.  And that's fine.  They can go crazy.  The Proud Boys splitting in two will only create a more militant main core Proud Boys.  The problem is, since Trump has not spoken, and given them any direction.  They are sort of rudderless at this point.  My problem is going to be when Trump decides that whatever he's texting about voter fraud, voter fraud, he comes out and says it out loud and says, we won the election.  You know, I don't care what the certification are.  This Saturday, we're supposed to have the 14th, the march for Trump, right?  The march, the fans march at March for Trump.  uh dot com uh where all these people are supposed to come out across the united states and have this no million maga march.  that's what they're calling it.  i'm not joking.
