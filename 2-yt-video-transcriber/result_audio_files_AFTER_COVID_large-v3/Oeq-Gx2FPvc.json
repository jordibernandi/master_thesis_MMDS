There must be a faraway place in the sun.  When the dawn comes, we will find the most beautiful place.  How far does the wish go?  On the road, there is still a dim light in the sky.  On the other side, there is still the cold wind.  The world is passing by.  Turning around, there is still a calling.  Looking for a direction.  Less of sound.  Less of sound.  The world is changing, the world is changing, the world is changing, the world is changing, the world is changing.  The wind blows, but I don't know where you are looking at the sunset.  People talk and talk, but I can only see the dusk.  The best journey is to let us remember the appearance of love.  After a long journey, on the road there is still Ooh!  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  oh Thank you.  Chanda.  The wind blows from the south to the north.  The whole winter is indescribable.  You are like the wind and rain.  Meeting in the youngest years.  Missing each other.  My heart is like the sea, waiting for the spring breeze to come.  You are like the spring breeze.  In the years of dream, we meet and part ways.  If I love you, please listen to the sound of the wind.  If I love you, my heart is silent.  If I love you, the wind is not as strong as you.  If I love you, please give me peace.  If I love you, If I love you, please listen to the wind.  If I love you, my heart is silent.  If I love you, the wind is not as strong as you.  If I love you, please follow the rain.  I miss you.  If I love you.  The wind blows from the south to the north.  The whole winter is endless.  You are like the wind and rain.  Meet each other in the youngest years, year after year.  You, like the spring breeze. ",
