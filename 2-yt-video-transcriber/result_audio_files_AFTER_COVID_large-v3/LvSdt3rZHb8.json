This young man, he actually might be older than me now that I think about it, makes a video response to Elliot Hulse.  Not even a video response to, more a video about Elliot Hulse.  And I'll be honest, I'm a bit biased because I've been following Elliot Hulse around for years.  Guy certainly helped me improve my strength when I was a young teenager, you know, growing up.  So there is bias here for Elliot Hulse.  I'm going to admit that right now.  But I still find merit in itself of what Elliot is saying, not just that I do indeed like Elliot Hulse, just so you guys know.  More than that, I am greatly bothered by his points, his arguments, because they bleed a lot of insecurity and weakness that he feigns as strength.  And it's kind of gross, and I think... I don't think that it's a healthy mindset to have.  So we're going to go through all this stuff.  So the basic gist is that Elliot Hulse is a misogynist.  I mean, that is the title of his video.  He doesn't think Elliot Hulse respects women.  So we're going to be looking through that over the course of these three videos.  And he's just going to... ",

Or like it's wrong to only want to have sex with a woman.  You ever notice that?  Like for men, men are using women for sex if that's all they want from their engagement, right?

No dude has ever been like, man, I just really want to be friends with you.  Let's talk about Digimon.  Let's talk about Pokemon.  Let's just, let's just go walk around.  No, like every girl.  Okay.  Maybe not every girl.  Every girl.  since I became an adult, 100%, the only reason I engaged with them was so at some point, doesn't mean that night, doesn't even mean two months from now, but at some point, I'm trying to put my peen inside your wet and gushy.  And to deny that reality, I think is disingenuous as males.  It doesn't mean that that's the only thing you want.

Wanting to be with a woman that you think is great and that you think is nice and kind and wonderful is good.  And you gotta, that's okay.  Now, only wanting to be with that woman like a flashlight is, I think, a colossal waste of time on everyone's part.  But that's where context becomes very important.

Your method of responding to Elliot is you just assume everyone already agrees with you, okay?  But I don't agree with you.  I don't automatically think that you're right, okay?  I don't.  I don't.  And again, I can analyze the merit of what Elliot is saying independent for the fact that I already have an attachment to him, you know, growing up, okay?  The merit of what Elliot Hulse is saying is simple.  If you are engaging with a woman, you don't know what is your end game.  If your end game is not to make her your wife, What are you trying to get from her?  Are you honestly just trying to find a companion to chat with and talk to?  Perhaps, maybe.  Listen, people are different.  There probably are some dudes, just to be fair to just reality's complexity, there probably are some dudes who legitimately talk to some chick just to be her friend.  That can happen.  But dude, the vast majority of the time, We're trying to have sex with this woman at some point.  It doesn't mean that it's the only thing, but it's an important thing.  And making someone your wife encapsulates you would hope in principle that this is a good person that you want to rear children with.  So that means there's going to be a lot of qualities that are under the umbrella of wanting someone to be your wife that you don't have to verbally say every single time you say the concept.  That's what people are trying to do when they say stuff like that.  you're not a dumb guy.  come on man stop don't be like this. ",

If not, he's trying to regularly have sex with her at some point, only to break up with her because he wants to date someone else, or at least not date her anymore.  The end goal of dating someone would be, you would think, to marry them at some point.  And if you're not trying to make that person your wife, here's the thing.  If you think that hard, you're going to avoid a lot of bad relationships.  If you think, if you put that weight on your interactions with a woman, you're gonna dismiss a lot of bullshit that you would otherwise never have to deal with.  If you think to yourself, can this woman be my wife at some point?  That doesn't mean tomorrow, that doesn't mean next week, that doesn't even mean three years from now, but at some point, if you think, if you put that weight on there, you're gonna find a lot of traits you don't like, you're gonna find a lot of habits you don't like, you're gonna find habits you do like, and you're gonna find traits that you do like.  You will, and you're gonna find that, and that's Elliot's point.  You acting smarmy here and pretending that you don't grasp that concept is irksome.  Stop it.  You're not that dumb.

It's kind of the standard that has been kind of generated in in in recent times but like yeah having some degree of integrity some degree of virtue a lot of the time it's being a provider and being a protector of women and your children.  there is some merit to being a man.  i remember there used to be a word called vermen or fair.  I think I forgot what language it was from.  But there was a prefix that was added to the concept of being a male that denoted that you became a man.  In fact, interesting enough, the word werewolf, the word where comes from there, which means man.  So that's how you get man-wolf.  It's kind of funny.  It's kind of cool, actually.  It's cool to me, but yes, there is some standard.  There is some way of which to be a man.  If you have not inter, I don't, maybe, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know, dude.

That's not even, it's not, the presence of a female officer or army ranger or border patrol agent does not change in principle that the role of a male is to be a protector.  Just because you have a female who, first of all, those occupations are overwhelmingly male anyway.  But simply having females doing something similar to males does not change what something is Or what it means to be masculine in principle.  Masculinity are traits that are primarily found in males.  So does it mean that a woman cannot have those traits?  It means you primarily find them in men.  I feel like... I shouldn't have to explain this shit to you, man.  You're just being a sarcastic, smarmy dick.  Because I honestly think you just probably... don't feel like you're very masculine or a male.  I think this is just you kind of wrestling with your own insecurities, if I can be honest with you. ",
