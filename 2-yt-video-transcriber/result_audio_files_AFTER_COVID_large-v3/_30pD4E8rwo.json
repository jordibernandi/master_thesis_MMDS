            "text": "Well, tonight didn't go quite as I planned, and I had the evening all booked out for the Corey Feldman movie, and yeah, I'm going to have to tell you what happened.  Hang in there, and I'll be back in just a minute.  Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles, and yeah, tonight was the Corey Feldman movie, but it didn't quite play out the way it was supposed to.  But before we get to that, I just want to give you a little bit of a smile here.  This is a tweet that I found.  Breaking!  Biden has massive rally.  Just kidding.  Wait for it.  Joe Biden cannot even fill up a high school gym.  Oh, Dementia Joe, what are we going to do with you?  And so watch this.  I'm just going to play it.  You won't be able to hear the sound, but I'll just play it.  Watch as I pull the camera back.  Look at this.  Is that pitiful or what?  Oh, I tell you folks, it made me laugh so much when I saw it.  There's nobody there.  Oh my goodness, compare that to Trump's rallies.  And there's just no, no comparison.  So anyway, I wanted to give you a little laugh before we get into the more serious stuff.  Well, you know, I've been talking about this particular movie that was going to happen the story of the two Corey's the truth about it and uh... it was hyped quite a bit and the deal was that Corey Feldman put his own money into this because he wanted to make sure the story got out there.  He couldn't find anybody else in Hollywood that would produce it, so he did it himself out of his own pocket.  So he charged admission to go see this and it was supposed to happen tonight.  It was $20 to get a ticket and then all you had to do was go in here.  It was supposed to start at 8 p.m.  Pacific time, which was 11 p.m.  my time.  which means it's like really late actually very early on tuesday morning for me right now and that's why this is going to be short as it is.  anyway i wanted to tell you about that.  it was supposed to take place.  well huh it didn't go off like it was supposed to and he did.  he said if he got enough money off of this one that he was going to make another showing.  well in case you don't know if you're doing a big production like this a big live stream there's like a massive cost for the bandwidth that you have to pay so it's it's big bucks when you're talking millions of people.  it could be quite a bit And this is worldwide.  I mean, there were people from all over the world that wanted to watch this.  And so all you were supposed to do theoretically is when it came time, you just click the login to watch or there's a login up here.  You could click on that and it was supposed to take you to a login page.  yeah that didn't work.  so the first one I mean a lot of time it was just this blank page.  the first time I got in.  it said there was a 403 error and then after that it was just a black screen where it just spun its wheels.  and then finally I did get to a page where it allowed me to login.  well it said either buy a ticket or log in.  And so I clicked the login and it took me forever.  It was probably though more than five minutes before it got to the login page.  So then I put the login information in and then it came back and it, yeah, it just was.  It never did get me in there.  But then I got to see this screen, which I didn't take a screenshot of, but this person did.  It says, please be patient.  The hackers are trying to prevent the stream from airing.  program will begin momentarily.  we appreciate your patience and support.  now.  supposedly there were people at a live screening of it and as I understand it they the screening what was going on the screen for them to watch was the same as the stream.  so when the stream wouldn't work it didn't necessarily work for them but it did to a point where they could watch part of it.  I don't know what.  it was really strange and I found one place on Twitter where one person was live streaming it like taking a shot of their computer screen.  so it wasn't good quality video of course but it only lasted for about 17 minutes.  I thought was really odd that it was 17 minutes and then it stopped and I tried to go to that person's page and it said not found and yet I could still watch the video from the other person's page.  I don't know.  And that part of it was just kind of setting everything up.  It talked about Corey Hames's death and the 911 call and everything that his mom made.  And so it was kind of just setting up the situation and that Corey Feldman promised to tell Corey Hames's story.  if something happened to Corey Hames.  So since he died, then he wanted to keep his promise.  Well anyway, it had this and then, so then I tried again and I got this.  If you went to Corey Feldman's Twitter feed it was a lot of people not very happy about it.  It got.  actually it got the my truth doc trending And Corey Feldman was trending.  So yeah, they were but not for a good reason.  and There are people who say that it was faked that it was a scam and but most of the people when I saw them saying that they had like 10 followers or zero followers and maybe only 10 people that they followed or up somewhere up to a hundred but not very many so that made me very skeptical.  it seemed like all the negative people that were claiming it was a fraud and fake.  all had that kind of demographic and that's just unusual you know.  so I thought it was weird.  and so anyway I don't know what's going to go on.  It says they're going to provide access.  Who knows?  I don't know.  But the truth will come out eventually.  We'll see.  This person had this and this is a screenshot from this where it was actually being shown and they had the live audience.  somebody pointed out.  they said well but all the people in the live audience were like writers and involved in movies and and you know Hollywood and it's like well duh those would be the people that he would invite.  I mean that's kind of like his people type thing.  so it would be probably the kind of people who had maybe had the same experiences or similar experiences.  so I can understand why they would be there.  but anyway so he really was not updating people which was a little frustrating because you would have thought he would have posted something on his own feed.  the only thing he posted was like it was going to be 15 minutes late and that after that then there wasn't anything else.  so Just thought that I would share this with you.  I don't know.  I don't think it's a scam.  I think he's for real.  I think he really was abused and I think you know same thing with Corey Haim and And I don't know why he did it this way.  I know he said in order to recoup the expenses, I guess.  I think there probably would have been a little better way of doing it, but maybe not.  Maybe that was what worked best and maybe they genuinely were hacked because I can imagine there's some people who didn't want this information out.  So I don't know, a lot of people were upset about it.  I don't know, tomorrow they're supposed to, well tomorrow, which is today when you're watching this, there's supposed to be another showing about noon.  Ah, we'll see.  I don't know what's going to go on.  I don't know if my ticket will allow me into that or what the case is.  So I'll try it out and I'll see and I'll let you know, okay?  So that's my update on that.  I'm sorry this video doesn't have a whole lot to it, but I did want to point this out to you.  Thank you, Laverne, for showing this to me.  This is bizarre.  There's this guy who takes a dead raccoon into this McDonald's and sets it on the table and then he gets up and he leaves.  he leaves the raccoon laying there.  can you imagine what would you do if you're in a mcdonald's you work at mcdonald's and some guy comes in and puts a dead raccoon on the table.  Oh, because you know raccoons, a lot of raccoons, they are known to kind of carry rabies.  So you would have to really, you kind of wonder how they clean the table off.  It makes me a little skeptical.  I don't know about you, but it makes me want to carry my own like alcohol wipes with me when I go to places to eat like that.  So yeah, this was in San Francisco.  And I'm not going to play it for you.  The guy that narrates it, well, that was talking about it, who videoed it, he just starts saying a bunch of nasty words and stuff.  But he was stunned that somebody would do this.  And so he uses a lot of profanity while he's describing this crazy person.  But hey, San Francisco, that's what you got.  So anyway, that's all I'm going to give you on this one.  I'm sorry that it's a little short, but I really am kind of tired trying to figure out the whole Cory movie thing.  And it just has been a long day.  So anyway, I will see what I can come up with.  And I hope Wednesday morning I'll have something a lot more interesting for you.  So anyway, that's what I've got for you on this one.  I want to thank you for stopping by.  And I'll see y'all later.  And watch out for those raccoons, okay? ",
