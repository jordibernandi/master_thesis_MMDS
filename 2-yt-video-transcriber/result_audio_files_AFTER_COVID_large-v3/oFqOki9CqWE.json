But I'm really curious.  And in an earlier speech, he talked about the war on work.  But I'm really curious to see how the member opposite is going to contort himself and twist himself into knots when I ask the question about when he was a member of government, they had the lowest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.  And what did they have to show for it?  $150 billion in debt.  And you know what they didn't have?  A global pandemic that shot down economies everywhere. ",

            "text": "So, Madam Speaker, what... What exactly does this member propose when they added that much debt and had such a terrible unemployment record?  A member for Carleton.  I think the member accidentally told the truth when she said we had the lowest unemployment since the Great Depression.  She was right that we didn't have the lowest unemployment in the G7.  We had the best record going through the Great Global Recession, which is interesting because now... We have the second worst.  The second highest unemployment in the G7.  Only socialist Italy is higher.  And the Italian socialist policies are the ones that this government is working hardest to emulate.  Even France.  which used to be socialist and is reversing those policies, has now lowered its unemployment below Canada's.  And here in Canada, we see a government shutting down our economy, trying to nationalize economic activity, getting exactly the same kinds of predictable results that those policies always produce.  That member should look at the magnificent success and the world-famous actions of the previous Conservative government to get us through that recession.  This government could learn a lot from that.
