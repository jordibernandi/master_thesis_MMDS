You hear how belligerent she is.  You can very clearly see why.  at 29 she's got that PTSD where she's angry, she's upset, she's mad, she's belligerent, she's got an attitude, she is bitter as hell.  At 29, she doesn't sound soft.  She doesn't sound feminine.  She sounds like some dudes.  you got into it at the liquor store.  But then again, she's got Ciroc, which means she likes cheap, nasty liquor.  But that just tell you that's the type of female she is.  The cheap, nasty chicks.  This is where they end up at.  So she's trying to tell us all that she has an IQ.  And if you don't stop lying on my phone.  My mama has a master's degree.  Okay, even if that were true, which it's not, but even if it were, it's your mom's degree.  You're supposed to be a grown woman.

You start trying to brag on stuff that other people got.  I'm living off my first husband.  First of all, if you don't quit lying, you are a pathological, chemically induced liar.  But even if that were true, these fantasies you're weaving is pathetic because you're not bragging on anything you got.  You're bragging on stuff that other people got and claiming that you have proximity to it.  So somebody needs to give you credit for proximity.  And that's not the way that this works.  We judge people based on results.  We judge people based on progress.  We judge people based on accomplishments.
