And that's why today we are reacting to hate videos sent to me.  by the trans community.  If you're new here, what you need to know is that I am trans and that I also get a lot of hate from the trans community.  I often describe myself as the black sheep of the trans community.  You know I'm here.  And the trans community tends to either choose to ignore me or send me hate videos and that's what we're gonna react to today.  But one thing about it, I really don't want to paint the picture that like all trans people or all LGBT people dislike me or whatever, because that's really not the case.  My subscriber base, which combined on both my channels is now over a million followers is very heavily LGBT.  Whenever I do speaking events, the audience is almost exclusively LGBT.  And so it really is just select people in the community, but we're going to react to them today because they're always hilarious.  Okay.  So let's jump right into it.  Shall we?  This first one is from TikTok, which I just made.  a TikTok follow me.  So this person, ShutUpHeather, actually made a video and then blocked me, which I feel like.  if you have to make a video about someone and then block them from responding or defending themselves, that's really cowardly, although you are brave for coming on camera looking like this.  Here is why we do not stand Blair White in this household.  Who's we?  Glad to know you're speaking for everyone, but okay. ",

I feel like she's doing amazing for the trans community.  Me growing up as a trans girl, I never saw a woman like me that had my views and the way that I view life, you know what I mean?  Seeing Blair being open about her politics, her views, just as a trans woman and sharing in her platform that not all trans women are the same, you know what I mean?  You can be trans and you can be conservative, you can be a doctor, you can be a stripper, you can be anything.  There's so much more to you than just being trans. ",
