They don't understand the difference between good, respectable black men who treat women with respect and a thug and a savage who treats women like shit.  The majority of younger black women praise and glorify thugs and criminals.  They always defend thugs and criminals.  Every time a thug does something stupid, They'll go on the news and try to defend their behavior.  One of the main reasons why a lot of black women chase after thugs has a lot to do with upbringing.  The majority of American black women were raised without a father.  The majority of American black women were raised by a single mother.  Most of these women have never been exposed to good men.  They've never been exposed to men who treat women in a respectable manner.  The only type of men they've ever been exposed to are thugs and criminals.  Because that's the only type of men they saw their mothers date.  That's the only type of men they've seen their mothers have kids with.  So they grow up to follow that same pattern.  They grow up to follow this same dysfunction.  And when they do come across a black man who acts educated, who treats women in a respectable manner, they look at him as a sin.  They look at him as a man they can take advantage of because that's what they saw their mothers do.  This is a cycle of dysfunction that's going on in the black community.  And a lot of this has to do with these government ran programs.  These government-ran programs reward bad behavior.  If a woman has kids with five and six different men, and she can't take care of those kids, the government will give her free housing, they'll give her food stamps, they'll give her Section 8, and they reward her bad behavior.  And this is the reason why Most black families are broken up.  This is the reason why most black kids are being raised by single mothers.  A lot of people want to blame all this on black men and saying that black men are responsible for the breakdown in the black family.  It's actually these government programs that are responsible for the breakdown in the black family.  This is why I don't support socialism.  Socialism and feminism have completely destroyed the black family.  Have completely destroyed the black community.  It's not helping black families.  It's not helping the black women.  They realize... They can just have baby after baby and live off the system without realizing that they're destroying their kids' lives and they're destroying their families' lives.  I think the only way you're gonna bring black families together is we need to start being more independent.  We need to stop getting government handouts and start doing for ourselves.  Government programs like Section 8 were designed to take black fathers out of the household.  This is why Section 8 has replaced black fathers.  If you ask most black kids nowadays, and you ask them who their father is, most of them don't even know who their father is, but they know what Section 8 is.  They know what welfare is.  These government programs have replaced black fathers.  And this is why our generation of kids is so dysfunctional.  This is why these younger girls are so dysfunctional.  The government created these types of women.  And a lot of black liberals have bought into this bullshit.  These programs are not doing anything but creating a cycle of poverty.  How many people you know been living on Section 8 for 20 years, for 15 years, living on Section 8?  They're addicted to this entitlement mentality.  You tell somebody they don't have to work, they can just lay on their ass and have baby after baby after baby, and they don't have to work.  they're gonna keep living off that system.  They're gonna keep having baby after baby after baby.  And we wonder why the black family is being destroyed.  The only way we're gonna bring black families together, the only way we're gonna put black fathers back into the household, we're gonna have to start being more independent.  We're gonna have to stop living off the government.  We're gonna have to stop following these feminist-ran programs.  Now, going back to black women's fascination with thugs, I think another problem is the media.  Look at the way the media praises and glorifies thugs.  Love and hip hop, all these shows, they do nothing but praise and glorify thugs.  And a lot of younger people look at this and this is what they follow.  This is what they think is cool.  This is why when black women see a black man who doesn't act like a thug, he doesn't act like a savage, they think he's not a real man.  You're not a real man unless you act like a savage.  Unless you act like a buffoon.  And this is the mentality that most younger black women have.  And what really bothers me is when I see a younger black man who's not a thug, who treats women in a respectable manner, but he'll dumb himself down, he'll try to act like he's a thug just so he can impress a black woman.  Just so he can impress one of these black girls.  And he'll end up getting in trouble with the law trying to act like a thug so he can impress one of these black females.  Our generation is lost.  And the only way we're gonna correct the problems within the black community, we have to get these people in check.  We have to get our youth in check.  We need to stop ignoring the problem and start finding solutions for the problem. ",
