            "text": "When reformers get a measure through, They go on to their next crusade, leaving no one behind to protect the public interest.  But they do leave behind some money and some power.  And the special interests that can benefit from that money and from that power are quick to gain it at the expense of most of the rest of us.  It is clear that it doesn't really matter who lives in that house.  Government will continue to grow so long as the rest of us believe that the way to solve our problems is to turn them over to government.  As Adam Smith wrote, in the economic market, people who intend to serve only their own private interests are led by an invisible hand to serve public interests that it was no part of their intention to promote.  In the political market, there's an invisible hand operating as well in the opposite direction.  People who intend only to serve the public interest are led by an invisible hand to serve private interests that it was no part of their intention to promote. ",
