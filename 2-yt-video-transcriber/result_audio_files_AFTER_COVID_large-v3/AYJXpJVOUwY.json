That's just a pedestrian stop.  Looks like they're digging deep.  They already used a fingerprint scanner on her.  Let's see what's happening with the other one.  I'm not sure what she asked for, maybe their names and badge numbers.  This one's gone.  Yep, got it.  I'm looking out for you.  You don't gotta thank them.  They didn't do anything good.  Fuck out of here, man.  Quit harassing people walking down the street, man.  Let people live their life.  Nah, yeah, that's what I thought.  Makes you feel more like a man, huh?  Harassing a woman, cuffing her up.  Yeah, we're going to get rid of that fingerprint scanner, too, just like the facial wreck.  Yeah, we're getting rid of it, too. ",
