            "text": "hello.  this is the second video of the day.  this is a quick one.  uh this is an idea is like the idea is and then i'll explain what the idea is.  and it's just supposed it's going to be a quick little quick tips kind of thing right.  and so here in the age of um batshit bioweapons um yeah i kid you not i mean it's just.  it's really something.  Here in the age of batshit bioweapons, we have the onset of a global depression and we have the onset of a global wonkiness with up and down and up and down with monetary systems.  During that period of time, food supplies will be a prime consideration for everybody.  And so we can take some lessons.  We can do some Q shit here, okay?  So we can take some past is prologue kind of crap.  And we can say, now is the time to get inventive, right?  And we have a lot of opportunities for invention here in our country very quickly that can aid you in your personal issues with food supply certainty.  And so this will call our... or grouping food.  or group and food video, because here's the idea.  I'm doing it already.  It didn't dawn on me until now, oh, maybe I should tell people about this in case they haven't tumbled onto this, because I just assume that everybody sees these things and they're obvious.  So locally here, when the crash came and we all went into... When the batshit bioweapons showed up here in Washington State, we all went into isolation and started doing social distancing and all of that.  We have all of those necessary effects in our food supplies.  The stores are all drained out.  Well, at the same time, though, 47% of... Daily calories here in the U.S.  prior to the onset of bioweapon came from restaurants.  And so that went and became null when they couldn't run the restaurants anymore and all the restaurants closed down.  But the food is still in the distribution system that they had for restaurants.  So we have an enterprising system.  local little store that dealt with restaurants and had sold products to them.  and so this store decided well they're in the in the restaurant business.  they're in part of that distribution system.  they'll go ahead and find items within the restaurant distribution system and funnel them into retail.  and so the little store.  so here we have store and it's reaching out into the wholesale wholesale markets and bringing it down for local retail.  Now, here's the issue, okay?  When it comes to get into local retail, you know, it's not like you'd go to the grocery store and get a little cube of frozen spinach for the night's dinner, right?  You've got to buy in quantity.  through this chain here, because these are for restaurants, and restaurants store big amounts of the stuff that they're going to have in their food all the time.  So you've got to buy, you know, 36 little bricks of spinach, frozen spinach at a time.  And so necessarily, we're.  we were talking about food for groups via restaurants.  Grouping food is this weird little story.  I've got about being on vacation in Paris.  And I, you know, my wife sleeps in.  I'm a morning guy.  I had to get up early.  I'm stumbling down.  You know, I need coffee right off the bat, right?  And so I'm stumbling down there, going to the restaurant, and here's a long line.  And I see at the end of that line, I see coffee.  It's like, oh, okay, and I go and get in the line and stumble forward, step, step, step, step, get coffee, and while I'm there, I get all this other food along the way.  I didn't think anything of it, right?  And then it dawns on me later, after I've had coffee and started waking up a bit, well, wait a second, who are all those people in that line?  Why did I have to wait?  And it turns out all those people were part of a traveling group in France, a bunch of Germans that were in there touring Paris.  And I just got into the line and I had Gruppen food.  You know, I had the food that was provided to the group, which was, you know, I didn't have to have that.  I was just traveling on, you know, the wife and I were just traveling on our own.  And so it's like, oh, okay.  You know, I got cut down on their profits inadvertently by having some of their Gruppen food, which was, you know, the funny little breakfast that the Germans like.  when they travel.  Anyway though, so group and food is just, this is the idea.  Very quickly, in your local area, there are restaurant supply chain outlets that used to feed the restaurants in your area.  Go and contact them.  Go and contact your neighbors and say, okay, how many things of spinach can I put you down for?  How many things of frozen beets or peas or corn or whatever?  and how many pre-frozen pizza crusts.  You're buying into the restaurant market stuff, so it's not what's going to be available in your local store.  But if you're in a building in New Jersey, and you've got other people in the building with you, and you make the arrangement with the wholesale market that used to supply the restaurants in your area, then you can you know, basically build yourself a more certain food supply acting as an intermediary going out to the, restaurant supply store, picking it up there.  This way you don't have to screw with the Costco and all of those kind of things.  Now, yeah, Costco is a wholesale market restaurant supply store, but not like those that feed only into restaurants and never deal with the public.  They still have a lot of stuff in their market, in fact, in their system.  In fact, they're having to destroy it because they can't figure out any way to get it in the hands of the people that used to eat it out of the restaurants.  So this is just a quick little idea.  to think about the idea of grouping food.  And now is the time to do Q shit and think about, say that, you know, just because of that phrase, past is prologue.  But to think about how people reacted in the past.  Here we are in a giant depression.  There have been giant depressions in the past.  What did people do?  What was successful in each and every one of the depressions?  Well, things like barter, things like local buying co-ops.  Like this idea here.  All different kinds of things that we can just resurrect and put right to use because we know how to do it.  We don't have to reinvent the wheel.  We can just go ahead and put it to work.  And so we can recover the 47% of the food that's in the distribution system.  that's not making it into the retail.  And hey guys.  That includes things like toilet paper, you know, restaurant toilet paper, that sort of thing.  So it's out there.  It's available.  Just, you know, take someone with enough initiative to get off their butt and go on down and do it.  Now, I'm part of this little group here that does buying for our local area and I'm buying restaurant.  you know 36 little bricks of spinach that kind of thing.  i mean not actually that we got them in sacks but um and i'm growing spinach in my own in the greenhouse spinach and broccoli and stuff and uh.  so uh that was a another thing there is that not a vegetarian don't eat carbs so i don't have to worry about wheat don't have to worry about sugar other than for feeding the hummingbirds um don't have to worry about uh a lot of that aspect of things And so it's a little easier for me than people that are vegan or vegetarian that are going to have to go to some trouble to maintain a certain food supply over these coming years as we go through this depression brought on to us by your friendly Chinese Communist Party who's at war with everybody.  Those fuckers.  CCP poisoned humanity, and this is why we have this depression that everybody's going to have to live with for the rest of their lives.  It'll leave a lasting mark on all of us for the rest of our lives.  People that are born into it will become, you know, it's like my parents' generation that were born into the previous depression.  They became extremely frugal, couldn't throw things away.  because they weren't certain of ever getting them again, you know, and had to use it and use it and reuse it and repurpose it, etc.  So refurbish it, repair it, and we're going back to that.  And it's going to leave a mark on all the people that will die off during this period of time as we go through the latter part of our years, struggling against the conditions brought on by a bioweapon unleashed on us by the Communist Party of China.  Those rotten nasty bastards.  Nazi nasty bastards.  Anyway, so that was it.  Real quick.  Hey, did it under 10 minutes and I can let it go another couple of seconds and we'll say, damn.  Okay. ",
