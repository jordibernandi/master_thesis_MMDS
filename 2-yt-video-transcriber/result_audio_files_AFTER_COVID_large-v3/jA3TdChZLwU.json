And so I thought maybe we could, this would be a great place to do it because this is where a lot of your clients and a lot of our own personal metals are stored as well. ",

There's a very attractive pricing that sometimes people say, oh, look, I can save money storing if I do this pooled.  I don't care.  Why would I care if it's the same 100 ounces or 1,000 ounces I get back later than the ones I put in?  Talk to us about why it's so important, because a lot of people feel like they really want to know that their metals are separated from others.  So we see in this vault, for example, as far as the eye can see, there's these racks of boxes of metals.  I understand from some of the staff here, what's helped me understand this is that there's Everything is barcoded, everything is tracked, everything is located.  Can you talk to us about how people's memories are kept separate for them, separate, not pooled with other people? ",

It's the segregation and the allocation.  you could put a drop of nail polish on any coin that had been in these boxes and 20 years from now it would still be there when you came to open it.  It's really very, very important because frankly there is variance in the way people store their metal and if you're going to be part of a pooled program and you get whatever the bucket fills up at that moment, I've seen horrible horror stories and then most of them centered around precious metals IRAs coming from depositories on the East Coast that were sent to us that were supposed to be name brand bars as an example and when they came back they weren't name brand bars.  In silver 100-ounce bars, that could be the difference of $200 a bar.  And if someone were to be taking possession of 200 bars at a variance of $200 a bar, they're very unhappy.  I've seen that many times.  So whenever something in this industry is free or inordinately inexpensive because of the way that it is segregated or not segregated, that is the telltale sign, run for the hills.  You do not want to store in a commingled account, period.  If you're storing in any of the offshore depositories or BRICS, as an example, in Canada, if it were commingled, it would be reportable to the federal government through FACTA and FBAR.  But due to the fact that it is segregated and directly held in the client's name specifically, and audited, then indeed it is non-reportable.  So whether it be offshore, whether it be here, it's super important that your stuff is your stuff the whole way through the process.  Because I'm looking at stuff right here at a stack of 100-ounce bars, and some of them look better than others.  Well, do you want to be the one that gets the bars that don't look as well as others?  So if you're going to spend a lot of money to buy quality product, you want to get that product back when you want it. ",
