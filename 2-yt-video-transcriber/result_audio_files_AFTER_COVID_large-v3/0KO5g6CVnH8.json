You have several top aides who were there in France, including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, saying on the record this didn't happen.  John Bolton, who trashes Trump in his book, saying he never heard it.

And to me, you've got to look at not only if there's an anonymous source, but who is reporting that source.  Jennifer Griffin of our own network has confirmed this, corroborated this.  Washington Post, New York Times.  But in addition, how we have to look at a pattern of behavior.  And the president, I mean, with the mocking of the disabled journalists, the president, you know, saying negative things about a Gold Star family, a grieving mother, saying to a mother of a fallen soldier in Niger, you know, that he knew what he signed up for, the things that he said about John McCain, and also his level of defense about it.  YOU KNOW, MY MOM USED TO SAY IF YOU ACCUSE SOMEBODY OF SOMETHING AND THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, THEY'RE PROBABLY GUILTY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT, IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.

Here's what Jen Griffin told Neil Cavuto yesterday.  She said, Deep Throat was an unnamed source.  Doesn't make what he said untrue.  My sources are unimpeachable.  Why haven't they come forward?  She says, you can see how people get destroyed when they get crosswise with the president. ",

And when you also speak of a pattern of behavior, the president has a pattern of behavior of not telling the truth.  So at the end of the day, the I as a voter sit down and say, and I think other voters look at the pattern of behavior of this individual with regard to truthfulness and with regard to these types of comments about these individuals.  Look, there are people that probably believe what he said and will vote for him anyway, Howie, especially in the military.  The military are typically very pro-Republican, and the president is the incumbent Republican candidate.  But I do think, and I've heard from on my radio show, some vets that weren't shocked, but it was just sort of rubbing salt in an old wound that reminded them with the election coming up of who their commander-in-chief is.

And so he's losing conservatives.  He's losing Fox News.  He's losing the military and he's losing losing the messaging campaign, which is why he's attacking conservatives.  He is going on attack with attacking mail-in ballots.  He's attacking the validity of the election already.  He's doing everything he can possibly to stay in power.  And so we can expect that the president will turn on everyone and do anything he possibly can to maintain power.  As it pertains to this particular story, I don't think anyone who's watching this clip is surprised.  This is not outside of Donald Trump's normal pattern of behavior.  This is how he is.  This is who he is.  This is what he is.  He has no respect for anyone except for himself.  And he's only concerned with his ego.  He's a narcissistic, mangler, maniac and a sociopath.  And he must be voted out of office. ",
