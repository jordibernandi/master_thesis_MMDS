That was Larry Stevens Furtick, but you can just call him the anointed of Elevation Church, whose mothership of its multi-sites is located in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It's very interesting to see what churches are doing during this nationwide shutdown and consequent inability to gather physically caused by the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.  Steven Furtick is finding shutdown nuggets in Exodus 14 and Romans 12 and talking about a new normal.  So, to get us started, I want to pose a question.  Do you know what a scat is?  This is a musical scat.  It's a jazz thing using nonsensical syllables in a melody instead of actual words.  But there's also another kind of scat.  This, I believe, is bear scat.  Not much explanation needed there.  Now, what I intend to argue is that much of what Stephen Furtick and his wife as well are doing during this time of coronavirus-induced live streaming without an audience is one or the other kind of scat.  Let me explain. ",

It is that God delivered his people from Pharaoh in a way that no one would have guessed.  God says to Moses to have the people camp between Migdal and the sea, a very strange location, seeing that it's a dead end.  God then says, I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will give chase, and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.  The people, who are scared silly, say to Moses, It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.  But Moses says to the people, Do not fear.  Stand by and see the salvation of the Lord which He will accomplish for you today.  For the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again.  The Lord will fight for you while you keep silent.  Now that deserves a WOW!  God is telling the people through Moses, in effect, don't just do something, sit there and trust in the Lord God who has promised to deliver you.  And then we are told, Then the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and His servant Moses.  Old Testament Israel, which is the embryonic New Testament church, was saved from Pharaoh's army in the crossing of the Red Sea.  It really happened, folks!  And it was all about God's purpose in saving a people for His own glory.  Here we learn an important lesson from scripture.  Salvation is of the Lord.  It is God alone who redeems His people from all their enemies.  It is foreshadowed here in Exodus 14 and finds its ultimate fulfillment in the Son of God's death on a Roman cross.  Let's now go to Stephen's New Testament passage. ",

See, our present situation because of the coronavirus is not something that took God by surprise.  It's not something that God did not see coming.  We see it as larger than life because we Americans and other prosperous Western nations are not used to suffering.  What's happening during this crisis is that people are discovering what it is they are really trusting in.  And for us Christians in America, the question is this, is Jesus enough?  In the face of loss, of hardship, of sickness, and even death, is Jesus enough?  Good preaching will interpret the Wuhan coronavirus in light of God's Word, not interpreting God's Word in light of the coronavirus, which is exactly what Steven Furtick is doing.  The new normal began at the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the dawning of a new creation that will come into its fullness at Christ's second coming in glory.  Until then, we are to remain faithful and trust in God through His Word.  The problem with being a celebrity pastor is that you start believing that you're something special, so special, that you're required to share your visions of grandeur with your audience after the service.
