            "text": "This is Rick, Missy's dog trainer from Detection Dogs USA.  And Cheek is coming out, the one who I was the escaped prisoner with.  And he's going to show us how she bites down on somebody.  Who is this?  Oh, she already said it.  I already told them.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, I already told them.  All right, so we're going to get up.  the terrorist, I guess, is the best way to put it.  And here's the arm he's going to put on.  Because she's trained to bite down when there is an issue with, you know, an escape.  Oh, no, FedEx is coming, Rick.  Hold on.  We got to hold for a minute, guys.  We're going to pause because FedEx is coming down the driveway.  And we don't want FedEx getting bit.  We don't want FedEx getting bit in the process.  Hold on.  Okay, so FedEx is leaving.  And Chica's a very nice dog, actually, but she's trained to bite down.  Oh, there's Chica.  Hi, Chica.  Remember me?  I was your escape prisoner.  She has one thing on her mind right now.  Oh, this.  She wants to play.  Yep.  Okay.  Okay.  She's very well trained.  Okay, so he's got the... This is what Chika is trained to do with an escapee or somebody trying to hurt perhaps a police officer.  And she is trained to hold on until he says let go.  This is what they're trained to do.  They're trained to hold on.  He's doing this purposely to show you how well they're trained to hold on to the perpetrator.  This is a game to her, actually, but... Oh, very good.  Go, Chica.  You're one tough broad, huh?  We do it one more time.  There he goes.  Yep.  Someone tries to run from Chica.  I guarantee you they ain't getting away.  There you go.  What?  It's okay.  No, no, no.  She's focused on that.  It's fine.  But yeah, Rick is a really good trainer.  So Missy's going to be trained to track people.  There she goes up.  She got the prize.  Now she wants to play.  Way to go, Chica.  Good girl.  You got his arm.  Congratulations.  Oh, she smells Missy.  Good girl.  Come on, play with me some more.  I don't know, Cheek, I'll grab the other end if you want and play tug-of-war, but that's all I can do for you.  No way.  Oh, I did it with her last time.  He gave me the rope, the other end, and I played tug-of-war with her down there.  She's a strong dog.  Good girl.  Very good.  Oh, yeah, she's good.  She likes her toys.  I know.  Okay.  Good girl.  There we go.  There's Chica in action, everyone.  Now she's going.  Bye, Chica. ",
