The Blue Line gang member didn't act like the professional hero he's purported to be by our masters and corporate-backed media.  I was with extortion everywhere and we pulled up to a gas pump to get gas and this gangster pulled right in front of us to hassle these two guys who weren't hurting or bothering anyone else or their property.  Just two guys trying to enjoy what little life they are still allowed to live in this society.  This order follower wasn't called there by the store for a disturbance as he explains to the men being investigated.  He just drove by and saw them not bothering anyone else and took it upon himself to harass them and put a little fear in their minds to remind them who they belong to. ",
