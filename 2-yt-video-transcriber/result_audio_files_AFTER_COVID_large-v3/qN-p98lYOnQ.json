            "text": "I got my name from President Jeff Davis.  He was president of the Southern Confederacy.  He owned my grandfather and my father.  He worked there from Richmond, Virginia.  My grandfather was a blacksmith.  My father was a young kid, wasn't grown.  And my father had learned how to write a little bit in Richmond, Virginia before he brought him down here.  My grandfather used to keep chalk in his shop to mark the odd things.  And my father would take a piece and put it in his pocket.  and passed in front of Master Jeff's house.  He's right on the sidewalk.  And so one morning Master Jeff come by and saw I was right on the walk.  He go up there and asked the cook, Mr.  Eliza.  He's right on the sidewalk.  Who's right out there?  He said, I don't know, Master Jeff.  He said, come out there.  I'll show you.  So he read it.  He said, Mr.  Eliza, if you can find him, I might walk out there.  I can't lie to you.  He's pretty dressed.  He said, yes, Master Jeff.  So one morning she's out to have some beach water.  And She cleaned out this pan and she looked around and saw my father down with his knee right on the sidewalk.  She told him, I'll tell you.  I'll tell you something.  The boy came up to the shop, came to the house, and asked him, who knows how to write?  He said, I don't know how to write.  He said, yes.  He gave him a pencil.  He said, write my name.  He said, my father's name is Isaiah.  He called him Mike.  Write my name.  He wrote Jeff Davis' name.  He wrote two days.  He wrote two days.  He said, uh-huh, Ike, that's pretty nice of you.  And he sent him on back to the shop.  And Martha Giles went to Richmond, Virginia and got two teachers.  He opened a night school.  He educated all these niggas.  He made my father a civil engineer.  And he made Cousin Isaac of Montgomery a bookkeeper.  And on and on they made different ones, farmers, cottoners, sawmills, gins, and all that kind of stuff.  That's the real company of my father and Cousin Isaac of Montgomery.  He was born on Hurricane Plantation, just a giant piece of Briarfield.  I was born on Briarfield.  Master Jeff had five plantations over there.  Hurstina, Briarfield, Hurricane, Palmyra, and Lake Place.  It all belonged to Master Jeff.  And he had all those niggas from different places, all the parents to come back to school.  Night school.  He gave them all a form of education.  When they all got free, they could take care of themselves.  He had so much business he couldn't hire folks who got business.  He had kids.  He needed kids so he could tend to his business.  And he wanted to learn to tend to Marsha's business.  Everyone admired him, obeyed him.  Kept while he was gone, he obeyed Marsha.  Once Marsha was going to land in the boogie, in the hack, the gate was locked.  The same old man I tell you about.  Old man Jack Rainey.  He got to the gate.  He said, Mars Jeff, this gate's locked.  He said, Jack, it's locked.  It's my gate.  Break it down.  It's my gate.  Some of the boys picked it up.  And Jack didn't break down the gate.  He took the fence down.  And drove on through there.  And the wagon went on behind him, you understand, with the bands, cams, and land.  And when they come back, they put the fence up.  That's the rhythm of Mars Jeff and his negro.  And when they met his negro, On the road, first thing he looked at was his hat.  And everyone gave him the same thing back.  Gave him honor.  And when he come home from New Orleans up to the bend, steamboat landed.  Unloading freight and loading cotton.  And he bit the bed dead asleep.  The captain said, Mr.  Dave's up.  No, he ain't up.  I really wake up.  Mr.  Dave wake up.  And he come downstairs.  He'd pick up the chair and all, pack it up out on the land, set it down inside his hat, and he'd get up and buy it about the third time before he'd get in his hat.  And they would allow him to do things like that.  He just obeyed them.  They all obeyed Marshal Jeff.  The white people would always go to the bank fishing and hunting on the banks when Marshal Jeff would be in the bed of sleep.  They'd always do things like that.  They always obeyed him all the time, white and black.  He gave them all.  His best man would escort him home, escort him back when he got ready.  And, uh, He don't want to plant that one day on a lake place.  He told Mr.  Corleone, he said, Mr.  Corleone, I'm going home tomorrow.  He said, don't forget to feed my niggas.  When they get to the land by the crops, let them be with them because of the cordwood.  But don't disturb them.  I want them undisturbed.  He said, anything happen to any of my niggas, you wait to see Mr.  Davis.  And don't forget I'm Mr.  Davis.  He said, my nigga is my summer shade.  He's my winter fire.  He's my umbrella.  Don't disturb him.  So they led by a cop over there with sweeps.  Mr.  Cooke, I want to lead by the cops with a cut of this.  That wouldn't do no good.  It wouldn't cut those vines.  The Negro who must have been educated, one who actually led by a cop with double sweeps.  And he come back and held Cooke.  And the next day he fired the white man.  He wanted the place to lead like he wanted.  You lay it by the crop like you want it, you understand.  Here's the crop, clean it, must you have come.  With those big switch that go in the middle.  Clean them out, you understand.  Which are a couple of contracts.  You could at least cut those vines, jump those vines.  The switch will get them all out.  You clean this place out.  The lake place.  Here's a hundred things over there.  Now all those mules from different places, you understand, from where you clean that place.  Here's plenty of stock, you know.  These are real stock.  All the sticks down on Hurricane.  The passes there, old Long Hill Sugar.  Outside the roadside, you know.  All that stock is going to must you.  All that stock.  Mules, cows, horses, and everything else.  Hogs and everything else.  Sheep, goats, all belong to him.  Now he had those sheep sheared a certain time of year, and bailed that wool and shipped it somewhere.  Same as you do cotton.  Get a little gin and pack it.  He had three or four steam gins, you understand what I'm saying?  He had steam gin on Hurricane, one on Briarfield, one on every scene.  He had three gins, I know.  He had three gins, three gins.  And what's next he wanted?  He had a sawmill on Hurricane for a steam mill quarter.  All that was going to open Mount Jeff.  And when you wanted things done, you just put it on paper and it's gone.  It's done.  Had no trouble at all.  All those niggas had a common education, all of them. ",

            "text": "Yes, well, when the Yankees was coming south to look after those places down there, they robbed somebody.  I'm being serious.  And Ben had told Miss, Miss Irene, his wife, Miss, I've got to go to Richmond.  I've got to see Mars Jeff.  She said, you want to see Mars Jeff with Ben?  I said, I've got to see him.  She said, no, Miss, you can't do no good.  I want to see you.  I want to see Mars Jeff.  I want a passport.  Send me to Richmond to see Mars Jeff.  So I gave him Ben the passport.

I said, Ben, sit down and tell me all you know.  How's everybody doing?  I said, everybody's well, Master Jeff, but somebody came to see you about.  I said, what is it, Ben?  I said, Master Jeff, those young'uns coming south, near Vicksburg, they're coming down south, getting our high folks land, and robbing the niggas, stealing all the mules, and then pursuing Dave's land.  I said, what is it, Ben?  I said, what is it, Ben?  I want you to give that land to me, So I'll have it.  He said, Ben, I believe all good.  I said, don't you belong to me?  The land's mine.  You're mine.  I said, how you know?  I said, Master Jeff, can't you free me?  He said, my God, free me, man.  Master Jeff held his head down.  He said, Ben, you're right.  So he took a beer up to the San Diego coast and did a landing here in freedom and made notes, some notes on page, you understand, and three, four unpaid and signed back home.  And in the end, he got down to Ben, our home there, The Yankees come, you understand, they ask, Davis' land, Davis' farm.  The Davis ain't got no land.  Whose land is here?  It belongs to Ben Montgomery.  Where is Ben Montgomery?  He's on his.  He said, come here, Ben.  This your land?  He asked, where'd you get that?  Bought it from my old master.  He called Mrs.  He asked her to bring those pills, you understand.  So he come.  He laid those notes and pills, you understand.  Uh-huh.  Ben, this is your land.  I don't want to write for you.  I don't want to do kind of nigger old land.  Right along, right across the road.  And when the freedom time come back, Master Jeff come on home, you understand?  And he give him a cotton basket of money.  Cotton basket, cotton basket.  Oh, not quite high as the table.  Like I said, old basket, no.  I don't buy a few places, I don't buy a few.  That's Master Jeff's house.  Cotton basket, green basket.  That's myself. ",
