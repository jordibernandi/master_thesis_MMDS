God got my back, ain't no stopping me.  We the judges of the earth, you a wannabe.  Repented of my sins, now it's God and me.  They gonna see the beams in my eyes, no hypocrisy.  For all these damn years, I was your slave.  You don't get no credit, but you gotta pay.  Wanna bump your lips?  I'ma cut them out.  I'll put them in your hands, I'll make you watch your mouth.

Piece of cake mean the taste of vengeance is sweet.  You gonna be bitter and trying to be friends for peace.  After I served you when you told me how to cook your meat.  Next is a mouth full of blood from the raw beef.  Castrate him.  Doin' the same thing he did to me.  I'm makin'.  you knock Like when you lose your keys.  What's his name, boy?  Oh, you ain't tryin' to speak?  Rip my rod to iron, then waste it away.  See, the sight he saw Reminds him where he used to be A carcass mountain Made from his family tree.  He tryin' to make me fall and sin With all that smooth talk.  The only time I backslide Is when I moonwalk In the kingdom, no escaping.  If you break the law I'm hittin' up the fifth rib.  No Isaiah 4 Your side of my kids You tryin' to explain to Queer.  Not even transparency can make it clear.  I had dreams of pushing the mate back.  Big money, Cuban links and Meg stacks.  I'm finding out my history from slavery and way back.  So it's only right I give you the whips and change back.  No bail for a fugitive?  What is bond?  It's 2020, so it's clear to see the lack of bonds.  Who's the real Jews?  It's a face-off.  I ain't counter-clausum.  Take his face off.  I ain't talking clothing line, but this right here, the true religion.  Came from the chosen line, my mind is focused on a mission.  I ain't never make a dime off the plantation field. ",

No turning back the hands of time.  I'm putting out your lights.  We raising the bars like it's a workout.  5G's hit the streets to push the work out.  YouTube and Viacom trying to shut us out.  Via communication send the hitters out.  ADL been getting busy with the tricks.  Fake Jews operate the mouth of the dragon.  Thought you heard us, but that was a little nick.  Many bodies gettin' hit when I fire this cannon.  I leaped in a battle, that was my longest jump.  I came to pull cards, I'm ready to dump.  I am honored of victory over bodies slumped.
