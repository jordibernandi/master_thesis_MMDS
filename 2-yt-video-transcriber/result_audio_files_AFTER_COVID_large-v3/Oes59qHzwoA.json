            "text": "I really need to talk about Shane Dawson.  Anyone who is familiar with my channel will know that I tend to talk about parasocial relationships.  As a content creator, I find it really interesting to talk about the creator-fan dynamic because I just have a tendency to like things that are a little bit meta.  I'm going to get into what exactly a parasocial relationship is later in the video, I recently watched a video from D'Angelo Wallace about Shane Dawson.  And if you don't know what's happening with Shane Dawson, I really do recommend going to see that video.  It really addresses every aspect of what the fuck is going on.  In this video, I'm going to be specifically focusing on the child grooming, paedophilia aspect of this whole thing.  I'm going to be analysing what the fuck happened through the lens of parasocial relationships.  D'Angelo Wallace was extremely careful in his video to express that what was happening was problematic and it could not be argued that it wasn't because there were literal children in some of these situations.  And while I absolutely agree that this behaviour is unacceptable and it's not something that we should tolerate on platforms such as YouTube or just generally ever, in this video I'm going to demonstrate that we do not need to be specifically looking for examples of Shane interacting with literal children in real time, in real life to explain how fucked up his behaviour was and that's why I'm going to be approaching this from the lens of what I call parasocial grooming.  We're also going to be investigating the Shane Dawson subreddit.  I do believe that it's really important to highlight these experiences from former fans that consumed Shane's content as kids.  We need to become better at spotting the warning signs when it comes to people like Shane or Onision.  I do want to highlight some of the similarities that I have noticed in their content that I think are really important to critically analyze and think about when it comes to people on platforms such as YouTube.  Both of these channels were not really family friendly, but they were also immature enough to appeal to children.  They took pride in being politically incorrect, edgy yet childish.  jokes that often were quite sexual, dick jokes, boob jokes, vagina jokes, content that was specifically aimed at young kids or teens, And I know that some people will say, oh no, but Shane didn't know that his content was consumed by so many kids.  And that is just an outright lie.  Shane has always known that there were hordes of specifically young girls that were fans of him.  And he would know this because of Meet and Greets.  The Not Cool movie was specifically marketed as a teen movie.  He knew.  that children were consuming his content.  Not only did he know this, but I would argue that he deliberately played on this, and this was the specific audience that he wanted at the time.  Compared to other YouTubers at the time like, for example, Dan and Phil or even Jenna Marbles, Onision and Shane were quite unique in their extreme edginess.  They were kind of like these edgy rebels of YouTube.  So think about this for a second.  How many kids have you known that wanted to feel grown up and didn't want to be considered as children?  I've known quite a few and I know one that's right here because I was like that as a kid.  I was one of those kids that was really fucking fed up of being treated like a kid.  And this kind of content, Onision and Shane, specifically appealed to this kind of child that wanted to grow up, that didn't want to be considered as lesser than an adult.  Other resemblances between the two are the aesthetic that they used, emo, edgy boy aesthetic that was extremely, extremely popular with teenage girls at the time.  and there was also, you know, the the actual content of the videos that they were making, both of them were really into rating teens bodies as adults, both of them were receiving pictures from teenagers, both of them were sexualizing these pictures publicly in their videos, those are resemblances that i have seen personally, like if you've seen any others then please do let me know in the comments because i'm seriously interested in this kind of pattern of behavior and calling it out because I'm me.  As I've said before, although there are some really fucking awful, awful, awful videos of Shane that have surfaced of him directly interacting with children, I'm specifically going to be focusing on the parasocial audience creator dynamic that Shane managed to create.  I've decided to call this parasocial audience grooming.  This isn't actually a term that exists, I've just made it up, and I made it up by basically sticking three words together to express something that I think is important to talk about, so let's talk about that.  I don't mean targeted internet grooming.  Targeted internet grooming is what I would describe as an adult going after a specific child online, maybe pretending to be younger than they are in order to gain that child's trust, but it's a very individual kind of thing and it's not really so much parasocial because there is a two-way communication line between the groomer and the child being groomed.  So a good example of this kind of grooming would be the video of Shane sexualizing that kid on Omegle, asking her to twerk, or Shane kissing a 12 year old at a meet and greet.  Parasocial audience grooming describes the grooming of an entire audience, or an entire category of your audience, so specifically children.  Young, impressionable, insecure kids, and especially girls.  So I'm going to start by reading a quote that describes what exactly a parasocial relationship is.  One of the striking characteristics of the new mass media is that they give the illusion of a face-to-face relationship with the performer.  The persona offers, above all, a continuing relationship.  Something that is a regular and dependable event to be counted on, planned for and integrated into the daily routines of life.  It's a relationship where the technical devices of the media themselves are exploited to create illusions of intimacy.  To make this a little bit meta, this is literally what's happening between me and you at this current time.  I'm looking at the camera and you feel like I'm looking at you and there is a one-way dynamic here.  I can't see you reacting to what I'm saying but you're watching me as if I was in the same room as you.  A parasocial relationship in Shane Dawson's case is a one-way relationship that goes from Shane to Shane's audience.  It is still a relationship, it's just not a traditional relationship in the way that we know them in our day-to-day lives.  The line of communication in this kind of relationship goes directly from the content creator to the audience.  so what i'm calling parasocial audience grooming here means that there was no direct communication between the children watching shane's content and shane but there was direct communication between shane and the children.  it's just a one-way thing however because shane was the one making this highly sexualized content directly targeting kids, the effects of this on these children are really similar to the effects that we would see in individual grooming.  It's really important to remember that there is still a relationship between the content creator and the person watching.  Even if it's only one way.  And I would argue that when it comes to child grooming, you only need that relationship to be one way to groom a child.  You don't need the child to answer.  It's actually probably even better for the person grooming if the child doesn't even have a say in what's happening.  The reason I've included audience in the term parasocial audience grooming is because Shane wasn't simply making this content for one child.  How many thousands of kids have watched Shane's videos?  Hundreds of thousands.  Shane Dawson has been one of the biggest content creators on YouTube for years, and although it's technically impossible to know how many children were affected by this highly sexualized content, This is really fucking worrying.  And when you think about this, when you think about this one-way, parasocial, grooming relationship that has possibly affected thousands and thousands of children... This is something that we need to talk about and that we need to think about as not only YouTubers, but as a society.  These parasocial relationships are now a huge part of day-to-day life, even for kids.  We need to be seriously considering what is considered child grooming.  Does child grooming have to specifically target one child at a time to be considered child grooming?  Thanks to YouTube, child groomers now have the possibility to potentially groom hundreds of thousands of kids.  We can look at the general definition of regular child grooming and see if this also applies to what Shane Dawson was doing to his audience at the time.  To establish a good relationship with a child and the child's family, child groomers might do several things.  They might try and gain the child's or parents' trust by befriending them.  Child groomers might look for opportunities to have time alone with the child, which can be done by, for example, offering to babysit.  Commonly, they show pornography to the child, or talk about sexual topics with the child, or show them sexualised pictures, hoping to make it easier and easier for the child to accept these behaviours and thus normalising them.  They may also engage with hugging, kissing or other physical contact, even when the child doesn't want it.  It's easy to see how this could also apply to content creators, right?  Gaining trust by befriending them, even if it is through a parasocial dynamic on YouTube.  Easy access to the child alone via YouTube.  Time alone with the child is very easy for someone on YouTube to get because, you know, How could it be that bad?  It's just a video on YouTube, right?  And the sexualized aspect, Shane Dawson normalized sexualizing his parasocial dynamic with his child audience through his videos.  I also found the different stages of grooming online.  It starts by targeting the victims, gaining their trust, then filling a need, then isolating the child, sexual contact, and then maintaining control.  All of these things could be applied to Shane Dawson's content.  When it comes to targeting, perpetrators may target and exploit a child's perceived vulnerabilities, emotional neediness, isolation, neglect, chaotic home life, a lack of parental oversight.  Once that's occurred, the creator then starts fulfilling the need.  They become more and more important in this child's life, And flattery is described as one of the very basic tactics that child groomers use.  Jane Dawson has done this quite a lot, and Onision has too, in the videos where they would rate underage fans that sent them pictures in videos, often sexualizing these pictures as they were rating them.  And then the next stage, isolating the child, the perpetrator may reinforce the relationship with the child by cultivating a sense that they love and understand the child in a way that others, even their parents, could not.  Both Shane and Onision have done this with an entire part of their audience, talking about their own vulnerabilities when it came to weight or what they looked like and stuff like that.  Oh, Onision understands me.  Shane understands me.  The next step is sexualizing the relationship.  So once this emotional dependence and trust has been built, progressively the relationship becomes more and more sexual.  This occurs through talking, pictures, and conversation topics.  The adult exploits the child's natural curiosity and trust using stimulation to advance the sexual nature of the relationship.  They weren't just constantly putting out obviously horrendous stuff.  Although there was a lot of awful stuff there, there were also a lot of times where the child would be watching their content and just be, you know, hanging out with them parasocially and building this dynamic which then allowed these creators to introduce more and more sexualized content into the children's lives.  Because parasocial relationships are one-sided and cannot be developed mutually, very nearly the whole burden of this relationship is thrown onto the persona and on the show of which he is the pivot.  The performer should be loved and admired.  Every attempt possible is made to strengthen the illusion of reciprocity.  There is an emphasis on the ideal performer having heart and being sincere with a performance that's real and warm.  This is a post from the Shane Dawson subreddit.  When I found Shane, I was eight or nine years old.  I grew up in a pretty stable family with parents who made me feel safe, if not a little invalidated at times, but that's been addressed later in life.  I'm now 20 years old.  I remember those creepy vlogs with his cousins and his racist jokes and the Millie stuff.  I remember seeing it and thinking it was funny and shocking and that's what made people laugh.  I would go to school and make Shane Dawson jokes and my friends would be upset by it after a while because they were vile jokes. ",
