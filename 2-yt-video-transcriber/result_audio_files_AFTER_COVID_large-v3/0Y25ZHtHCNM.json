            "text": "Hello, YouTube family of Frank's.  This is Frank's fish.  My son and Frank made this tank.  I thought it would be appropriate since he made the video about the community using his fish.  And I hate being on camera, so.  Anyway, I wanted to update his YouTube family about the situation we're in and Frank is in.  I posted detail on the community page, and I don't know what I'm doing, so be patient, please.  He's still in the hospital, in the ICU.  He had an episode with his heart and atrial fib that weakened his heart.  And he's on life support.  I will say that I have had a deep sense of peace throughout this whole thing which God definitely has been carrying us and I know it's due to your prayers and my Savior is wonderful to us and to me.  Please continue to pray for him and I will post updates on the community page.  I'm also going to be posting.  I'm not Frank, so I'm not tech savvy.  I'm not, you know, I'm not good at this stuff, as you can tell.  But I usually play the piano in our church.  And this past Sunday, we played a hymn that Frank really likes.  And it's called Through the Love of God Our Savior, All Will Be Well.  And so I'm going to put in the comments all the lyrics and I hope it encourages you all because you have certainly all encouraged him.  He loves all the connections he's made.  He loves making the videos.  He loves talking to you, but this man needs rest.  He runs himself ragged for people and he doesn't think of himself.  What you see on video is who he is and He's a blessing.  So we need him here.  And I asked God to be merciful and he's answering me.  So I probably am not going to listen to this once I post it because this is so not my thing.  So I don't know what else to say, but we love you all.  I don't even know you people, but I know what an impact you've all had on my husband.  And he always wanted to be a missionary.  And he said to me, I feel like I can be a missionary for my own house.  And it's true.  So just know that how valued you are.  and I'm sure he's dreaming in his mind of where's Tom Hanks and trying to come up with new video ideas and trying to have a fun sense of humor about it.  But anyway, just please keep praying and I promise I'll keep everyone up to date.  Thanks again.  Have a great night. ",
