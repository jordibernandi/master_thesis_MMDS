            "text": "Hi.  I want to make this message short and sweet.  It's aimed at those of you who might be considering some New Year's resolutions, motivated by the hope that 2021 could be better than 2020.  A low bar, I would say, considering the nature of the last year.  Some years ago, my colleagues, Dr.  Robert Peel and Dr.  Daniel Higgins and I developed a suite of four psychotherapeutic writing programs available at selfauthoring.com designed to help people clarify their pasts, understand their present personality and improve their future.  These are available, as I said, at selfauthoring.com.  The Future Authoring Program, one of the four, is particularly appropriate for the New Year's personality renewal that resolutions are designed to bring about.  It helps guide its users through the process of thinking about their intimate relationships, career plans or lack thereof, educational goals, social engagement, optimization of mental and physical health, and productive, meaningful use of personal or private time.  Our research, described at the self-authoring site, indicates that university and college students who used this program to organize their visions and dreams for the future were much more likely to remain in their programs of study and more likely to be successful while doing so.  The program appears to work.  If you want some help with your resolutions, consider using it.  You can find the Future Authoring Program on the selfauthoring.com website under products.  Because it's New Year's, we hope that many people might be inclined to taking some positive steps forward.  And we've set up a 50% discount coupon code on the program, bringing its price to about $7.50 U.S The coupon code is FA2021.  That's FA2021.  If you want to use it, go to selfauthoring.com.  The URL is in the video description.  Under products, select future authoring.  Click buy now and then enter FA, that's future authoring, FA2021 in the coupon code box on the purchase future authoring page.  We sincerely hope that the program is useful and that the discount is welcome.  Happy New Year. ",
