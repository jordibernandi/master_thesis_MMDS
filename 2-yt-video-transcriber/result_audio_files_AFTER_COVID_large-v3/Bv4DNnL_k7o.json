            "text": "That's true.  Prisoners of war cannot be married.  Look at it that way.  I like to use the prison analogy because a lot of black people have been in what we call prisons.  The code calls it greater confinement.  But we're all confined.  We're all born in prison.  And the name of the prison system is the system of white supremacy.  So prisoners of war are not married.  We can say we are, but it has to be recognized by the prison masters.  And we just get together with someone and say that we are married, and the white supremacist says, yeah, but I officiate over all of you.  See, if you're a prisoner of war, you can't make decisions or make promises to your so-called mate.  See, when a prisoner Say a married couple, for instance, has to have what?  There's an old saying, to raise a child, it takes a village.  Well, it takes a system to support a marriage.  So if you're in a prison system, you're really not married.  You can call a person your wife, or a person, a lady can say, I have a husband.  These are just words.  But you can't promise that person anything as a prisoner of war.  Why?  Because you can't promise yourself anything.  See, marriage is based on promises made and promises kept.  But you can't guarantee anything if you're a person of color on this planet to anybody because you can't guarantee yourself that you'll even be breathing if the white supremacists tell you when you're saying, I can't breathe, and the white supremacists say it.  Yeah, I know you can't breathe because I got my arm locked around your neck.  And if you die while I'm doing it, you're just a dead Negro, that's all.  You're just a dead non-white person.  Because I don't have to answer to anybody that looks like you.  Ever.  I have to answer to other white people.  That's what white supremacy means.  So to get back to the point, you're not married unless the white supremacists say that you are.  And like the illustration you gave, black people on the slave ship say, I marry you.  You and me are going to be husband and wife.  But you can't be a husband because you can't function as one.  She's in chains and you're in chains by the chain masters.  All right?  So when you get where you're going, you say, well, wait a minute.  Are you going to take her down?  You're telling her to go here?  That's my wife.  We got married on the boat and all like that.  And that captain of the boat says, hey, this is a slave woman.  She's my slave.  In fact, I had her last night.  All right?  When I called her up from the bottom of the ship before we landed.  Okay?  So you don't have anything.  Negro, African, whatever you want to call yourself, tribal leader, you're nothing to me.  Neither is she.  So I'm saying, I'm selling her right now to this bidder here at the slave auction.  And she's going down the river.  You're going to stay here with me.  End of story.  So much for your so-called marriage.  Now that has not changed.  Because Black people will say, well, yeah, I got a wife, but she's in California, but my job is up here in Minnesota.  I got to do this, I got to do that.  Say, well, how come she's not with you and whatnot?  Well, I couldn't take her with me, okay?  Well, why couldn't I?  I mean, our money wasn't good enough, you know, wasn't long enough.  I have to move around a lot, I mean, in order to make a living.  She doesn't have it. ",
