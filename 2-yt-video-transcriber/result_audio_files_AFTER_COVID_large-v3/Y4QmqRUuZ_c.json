            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, I admit it.  I have been a very naughty boy.  Yesterday I went armed with a hidden camera to visit Daniel Andrews' office.  Are you looking forward to the day where you get to arrest Daniel Andrews or not?  Then ABC Studios.  Coronavirus and Black Lives Matter.  So forget the white people, we need them.  And finally to confront the projector.  Make sure to watch this full video to see how my day played out.  So when I heard about a protest against Daniel Andrews' relationship with communist China and its potentially devastating consequences on our state, I decided I had to do what I do and check it out.  But this time I wanted to do things a little differently.  I didn't want Andrews to see me coming.  So I armed myself with a hidden camera and I head into town.  My objectives were not to join the protest outside his parliamentary office or even to cover the actual event.  I wanted to put their legitimate grievances to Andrews himself, or at least someone from his office.  I also planned to ask him about the current gang violence in our city, including the shocking bashing of a 16-year-old at Southern Cross Station last week.  But this is what happened when I arrived.  Is anyone in their office today or not?  No comment.  If there's someone in the office, no comment.  Thank you.  What, I have to leave?  No.  I'm not asking for a comment, I'm asking if the office is open.  Your security, is the office open?  Who are you asking about?  If Daniel Andrews' office is open today.  No comment, I have no comment.  Cannot tell you.  So I have to walk in there and check myself.  No, no, you won't go in there unless you have an appointment.  Oh, you're not allowed in there?  You must have an appointment.  Is that a rule?  Do you have an appointment with the government?  I'm asking the question, is it standard procedure that you need an appointment?  So you don't need to be so defensive.  You are being extremely defensive.  I asked you if his office is open.  That's what I told you, don't go in.  How is that the answer to a basic question?  If you wish to see anyone, can I book an appointment?  We don't take bookings.  Do they take a booking?  What's that reception for?  We don't take a booking at reception.  No bookings are made for us.  Do you stand out of here every day to stop people from... Or is it just because there are people... I don't have to.  Isn't this a public building?  No, it's not.  It's a public grand hall.  Yeah, that's correct.  That's private.  It's a government building.  What is it?  A government building.  So that's public.  It's part of the government.  At the end of the day, if you wish to see anyone from government, you must make an appointment through the department.  But as a Victorian, if I want to walk into a government building, we can't stop them.  Do you feel happy to protest at the moment?  I'm not part of the protest.  We will not be allowing you into the building.  I'm not part of the protest.  I've got nothing to do with the protest.  Okay, well, we don't know that.  You know me, I'm persistent.  I'll wait.  But it did seem a little bit odd that they were suddenly locking down the public building.  So I asked the top cop what's up.  Do they always lock it down when there's protests?  Assuming isn't good enough for me.  So since then, I've looked into it.  They don't lock down Treasury Place for protests, especially a COVID compliant demonstration of 10 polite, mostly Asian protesters.  We're not talking about wild leftists.  But who's surprised?  Andrews is, after all, getting into bed with China.  Now he's just implementing CCP strategies to shutting down the media.  How long have you been on the force?  40 years.  So you're pretty new.  You're fresh.  You reckon like you want to go out with that Bane taking out Andrews?  That'd be the best way to go.  I can see you, buddy.  Oh, and we can't wait.  But moving on.  I continue to remain around, waiting for access.  When suddenly... The door opened.  It looked like lockdown had ended early.  You're getting me excited with that door opening.  Even the door wants to open for me.  Turned out to be a false alarm.  Bloody door malfunctioned.  It's causing trouble.  This is what happens when you buy a door made in China.  That's actually a true fact.  We all know.  Nothing lasts that's made in China except maybe for COVID-19.  That kind of lasts.  But I decided to wait.  And boom, the doors finally opened.  So I went to check what's up with my request for a comment from either Andrews or someone from his office.  Imagine my shock after waiting probably about an hour.  When it came to crunch time the official channels were dead shut.  But before I headed out I thought I'd just check with the security guard if I had any other options.  Is that the back entrance?  Is there a back entrance here?  For the Chinese, the Chinese entrance?  That security guard was a good sport.  Not like the first guy who doesn't understand the concept of government property being publicly owned.  But ladies and gentlemen, I wasn't going to let that ruin my day.  I was determined to get some answers from somebody.  So when you can't get the top evil, you go to the next best thing.  I headed to ABC Studios in South Bank.  My plan was simple.  I was going to ask Sarah Gench, who is a supervising producer at ABC News, why they refused to run the footage of that savage attack in Melbourne last week.  Hey, Dawn.  Yes, we're here to see if we can speak to Sarah Gench.  Yeah, one of the producers even from 7pm.  Thank you, your name is?  Arby.  Arby?  Yep.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Remember, patient me.  I'm happy to wait for answers as long as it takes.  And after a couple of minutes, the intercom called me back.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm sorry, Arby, he doesn't know you.  Can you tell us what a?  Oh, it's regarding a story.  I just want to have a quick chat to her.  So have you spoken to her previously?  No.  Or anybody here?  Do you have an appointment?  No, I don't.  Okay.  What was the story regarding Harvey?  It's a story.  It's a story about... Obviously, I want to talk to the journalist.  The producer's not... Okay, so nobody will come out and see you unless you have an appointment.  Do you want me to tell her what it's regarding?  Yes, tell her it's a story.  What was the story regarding Harvey?  Exclusive footage of an event in Melbourne.  Thank you.  Exclusive?  Alright, alright.  Ah, it's warm.  How you doing?  I just came here for the warmth.  Nah.  Should I wait?  Okay, so you'll have to wait outside.  Wait outside in the cold?  That is so rude.  Ooh, Ben.  For a second there, I got very excited.  I thought my exclusive footage offer was too good of an opportunity for Sarah Jench to turn down and that she just buzzed me in.  But nope.  Back outside to wait in the cold like the peasant I am.  She said she doesn't know you, but you're more than welcome to send her an email.  That's very harsh.  You know what that's like?  That's like getting turned down on a date with a fake phone number.  Don't pretend like you don't know that feeling.  We've all been there.  Sarah, you should be ashamed of yourself.  You've just triggered the PTSD of a person of colour.  I expect a full apology tonight on ABC News and you need to take a knee live on air.  But in all seriousness, I wasn't going to write her an email because after all, ABC News have ignored the thousands of emails I know they've received from my followers regarding this story.  Instead, this nice security woman agreed to pass my message and ask Sarah a question on my behalf.  There's a story that ABC, she hasn't run yet.  And I just want to know, I want to understand why she hasn't run it.  She knows about the story.  There's a story, you've probably seen the video of a girl getting bashed on a train, a 16-year-old girl.  Oh, I've seen it.  You've seen the video, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Now, she's in charge of the stories here, but she hasn't run it.  And I want to know why, because it feels like it doesn't suit their narrative.  You know, you and me, we're both people of color.  We understand.  Yeah.  But these people, they like to, you know, play the game and I think that that story should get airtime.  Do you agree that if somebody gets bashed, they should run it?  Yes.  But right now it's all about coronavirus.  Coronavirus and Black Lives Matter.  So forget the white people.  We need them.  But pass the message.  Tell her she should run it.  Thank you.  Now most people would give up by now, no?  Well, not me.  I told you, I'm persistent.  I'm heading to the other evil in town.  I'm going for Waleed and the project.  10 Studios in South Yarra.  Shalom, my friends.  So as I'm walking, I'm thinking, here we go, another bloody intercom.  But then suddenly, I spot a familiar face.  I forgot his name, but I run towards him.  What's his name?  How you doing, brother?  Quick question.  The project.  Why didn't they run that video of the girl on the train get smashed the other day?  I don't know the video.  So there's a video that's gone viral.  You love the viral stuff, yeah?  I love the viral stuff.  I do.  So there's a video where there's a girl getting smashed on the train.  As in getting beaten up?  Yeah.  I'll show you.  Nah, man.  I don't know.  But why didn't the project run it?  So, I don't know.  I'm certainly not in that level of decisions in there, but I... Can I give you the video and then maybe they run it?  It's important.  Listen, the girls were white and the other girls were black.  So, do you think that's a... ",

You guys go on about the Black Lives Matter.  If that was the other way around, you're telling me they wouldn't run it?  Man, I don't know.  It's eight girls smashing one girl.  I would be amazed if it were the race.  Things are a lot simpler than you think.  Seems pretty bloody simple to me.  They didn't run it because it doesn't suit the project's narrative. ",

I didn't actually hear what he said until I watched it back during editing.  So that leaves only one reason why the people who make the decisions, not Tommy, in this case, chose not to run the shocking footage.  We get it.
