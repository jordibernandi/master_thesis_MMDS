As many of you saw the result of the photograph of me at Lafayette Square last week, that sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.  I should not have been there.  My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.  As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake, but I've learned from it.  and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.  We who wear the cloth of our nation come from the people of our nation.  We must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted and the very essence of our republic.  And this is not easy.  It takes time and work and effort.  But it may be the most important thing each and every one of us does every single day. ",
