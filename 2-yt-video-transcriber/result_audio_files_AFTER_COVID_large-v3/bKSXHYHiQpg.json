            "text": "Satan will fight your prayer life more than he'll fight anything.  Because if he can undermine your prayer life, he'll undermine your spiritual life.  If he undermines your spiritual life, your Bible reading and your walk with the Lord are going to cease.  Once your spiritual life has ceased and once you no longer live in that spiritual world you're supposed to live in, then you're just like an unsaved man tossed to and fro with every wind and doctrine.  So therefore prayer becomes the anchor of your soul.  And if a man's not praying, then that man has already reached a point, whether you want to admit it or not, where you should not be.  You're starting down the wrong direction.  The Apostle James tells us here that Elias uses him as an example, and the Bible is full of examples, from the book of Genesis all the way through the book of Revelation of prayer.  Pray time and time and time and time again.  You will find the people of God as they prayed.  The Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest example in all the Bible of someone who prayed.  When you don't pray, I want to tell you a few things that's going on.  Number one, you tell God you have no desire to commune with Him.  That's what you're saying to the Lord.  You're saying that I don't need communion with God when you don't pray.  Now, folks, what I'm going to preach to you this morning, it may be hard.  But it's necessary.  For if your prayer life has died and you're no longer talking to the Lord, you need to start it up again.  Make no mistake about it.  You need to go back where you pray.  You find that place as Abraham did when he went back to Bethel.  To the place that he'd raised the altar before.  the Bible said, unto the Lord.  And there the scripture says, he called upon the name of the Lord.  Abraham had spent 13 years in Egypt, and as far as we know, hadn't prayed the first prayer.  But when he came to Bethel, he came to the house of God.  He came back to the place of prayer.  You have no desire, you really don't, if you've quit praying.  Number two, you tell God you can run your life yourself, and you really don't need Him as part of what's going on inside your life.  You're saying that I'll take the reins of my life, Lord, here from now on, and I'll be the one who makes the decisions about when I get up, when I go to bed, where I go, who I talk to, what I read, what I entertain myself with, what I am.  From this day on, I'm going to do it on my own.  I don't need your help, Lord, when you're not praying.  Number three, you tell God you can handle your spiritual warfare when you've stopped praying.  You've quit the battle.  It's hard.  I know it is.  It's a real warfare.  That's why the Bible said to war, that we are warring a warfare.  And the Scripture says when a man wars that kind of warfare, he doesn't entangle himself with the things of the world.  So you're telling God that you're through with a spiritual battle that rages.  Now folks, I don't know if you understand this morning, but Satan's after your children.  He's after your wife.  He's after your husband.  He's after your family.  He's after your fortune.  He's after your mind.  He's after your peace.  He's after your salvation.  If he could get it, he'll take everything he can get his slammy hands on.  He'll drag you down to a depth that you never imagined you could go to.  And he'll destroy everything that's precious in your life.  I have talked to time and time and time again men and women who looked at me and said, Preacher, I never imagined that it could ever get this bad, that I could get to where I am now.  But friend, they didn't get there overnight.  It didn't happen in a moment.  It is always a matter of drifting, drifting, drifting.  And folks, a ship drifts because it has no anchor.  where it anchors or it has no, it has no captain at the helm.  So my friend, you have, you can tell, you're telling God that you can handle your spiritual warfare.  Number four, you tell God your profession is skin deep.  Not from the heart.  When you quit praying, you're telling the Lord, Oh, I make a lot of racket.  I do a lot of talking.  I still profess to believe this and believe that.  But it's no more than skin deep.  For when a man is not praying, it's not coming from his heart.  The Bible said, From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  So the heart must be engaged in prayer.  It's a precious gift.  It's a blessed gift.  It's a thing according to James chapter number 5 that can move mountains.  But it's the most neglected of all the things in the Christian's life.  And that is prayer.  I'm telling you as one that's been saved since 1973.  Quite a while, folks.  The one thing that Satan has fought more in my life than anything else.  And that is my prayer closet.  and my prayer time with the Lord.  He's fought it.  He does it by discouragement.  He does it by keeping you too busy.  He does it by distractions.  He does it by getting with the wrong crowd.  He does it by false doctrine.  He does it by every imaginable thing that you can imagine.  Satan is going to fight your prayer life.  Why, preacher?  Because prayer binds up the devil.  prayer opens up the gates of heaven.  prayer carries you higher than you could ever carry yourself in your mind.  prayer is a spiritual thing.  it's a weapon.  it's a battle we fight and it can reach into the very throne room of god.  it can reach to the right hand of almighty god.  and when you stop praying that means literally whether you admit it or not i give up.  when you stop praying you're saying i throw in the towel.  When you stop praying, you're saying, I've had enough.  I'm not going to be able to do this.  I just can't keep it up.  But I say to you this morning, you can't keep it up.  It's not in you to keep it up because prayer is a spiritual thing.  And my friend, God never tells you one time to generate.  or originate anything spiritual.  It's a gift from God.  According to 1 Corinthians 12, it cometh down from the Father of lights, in whom is no variableness, nor shadow of turning.  If you've been out of that prayer closet for a long time, you haven't prayed, you haven't prayed anywhere, ask this preacher and this morning is encouraging you to get back because that's going to be the heart and soul of your faith in the Lord.  You tell God your profession is just skin deep.  number five you tell god that christ needed to pray but you don't.  when i look at the life of the sinless son of god and i think of how my friend and no guile was found in him pontius pilate said i find no fault in him when i consider the one that walked on water the one that could raise the dead.  he could heal the sick and cast out devils and yet he'd spend all night long in prayer.  he'd get in a desert place alone time and time and time again.  he would get away from the crowd.  he got alone with god and i'm telling you this morning that your finest time with the lord your finest hour with god will be when you get alone with him.  you get alone with him.  just you and the lord find you a place if it's by a riverside if it's in the woods If it's in a closet, get in your car and drive off somewhere.  But when you get alone with God, you'll find your prayer takes on new meaning.  Prayer is an experience.  Prayer is a journey.  Prayer is a new world.  Prayer is a powerful thing.  The New Testament word translated prayer is prostuneco.  And that word literally means to prostrate oneself before Almighty God.  to lay yourself bare before the One that you believe in.  If you want Him to read you, let Him read you.  If you want to walk with Him, He'll read you.  He'll look deeper into your heart than you want to go.  He'll tell you things that you don't want to know.  But when Almighty God begins to commune with you, He'll make you better.  He'll make you stronger.  You'll walk deeper.  It'll be an experience that nothing else can change.  There is no substitute for prayer.  No substitute.  Bible reading, Bible memorization, thank God for it.  And you need to do it.  And we've got a brother in here that does a good job of memorizing Scripture.  And I encourage you to do that too.  Please do that as much as you can.  But that in itself is not a substitute for prayer.  You still have to pray.  You may preach on the street corner.  You may hand out tracts.  You may witness for the Lord.  You may teach Sunday school.  You may preach.  But if you're not praying, it is no substitute for prayer.  Maybe you sing, maybe you play instruments, maybe you serve the Lord, but in itself is still no substitute for prayer.  There is no substitute for prayer, and that's something we can all do.  If you're born again by the grace of God, you may not have a tongue, but you can still pray.  You may not be able to walk, but you can still pray.  You may be confined to a building and can't get out of it, but you can still pray.  Prayer cannot be taken from you, because wherever you find yourself, locked behind a prison wall, you can still pray.  On the foreign field in a battlefield, You can pray wherever you are.  You can pray.  That's why the Bible said, I would let all men pray.  Pray always and at all time.  Talk to the good Lord.  Number five, you can tell God that Christ needed to pray, but you don't need to.  Oh, what a thing to say.  Number six, you can tell God that all the commands in Scripture to pray mean nothing to you.  You're holding the Word of God.  You're taking it in what the Bible says.  that it really means nothing to you.  You give it lip service, but it doesn't affect your life.  Prayer, therefore, becomes the heartbeat and soul.  You live it.  You breathe it.  It's what you are.  It's all about what defines who you are is prayer.  And when you stop praying, folks, you quit.  Let me say it again.  Sure, you're here.  But if you haven't been praying, you're not here in the spirit.  Your heart's not here.  Your soul's not here.  Your mind is wandering.  You're being fed somewhere else.  You're living off of the temporal things of the earth, of the here and the now.  Because you haven't been plugged into the eternity of glory.  Why and when you pray.  Let me tell you some of the things that happen.  First of all your soul is refreshed and cleansed.  When you come to the Lord and begin to part your heart and your soul to him.  And lay those burdens down at his feet.  And man do we ever have burdens.  He said cast your care upon me.  For I care for you.  He said take my yoke upon you and learn of me.  For I am meek and lowly of heart and you shall find rest.  for your souls.  My friend, your soul will be refreshed.  You'll come away feeling clean.  You'll come away feeling like you've been energized.  You'll come away feeling like a burden has been lifted.  When you talk to the good Lord and empty your heart to Him, you'll find one that will lift the burden from you.  And you'll come up from there ready to shout and praise God.  A simple prayer can make all the difference in your life this day when you pour your heart out to Him.  Number two, when you pray, your view of time and eternity will begin to change.  If Satan can keep your mind tied up with the here and the now, with temporal things, things that literally are insignificant, he can take you away from the real issues of life.  My friend, if you're born again, you ought to be thinking about eternity and my friend, not time.  You ought to be thinking about that which is spiritual and not that which is carnal.  And you ought to be thinking about that which is holy and not that which is vain and that which is as of this earth.  My friend, when you begin to search God, seek Him out, talk to Him, you'll be amazed at how your perspective begins to change.  You see men as trees walking, do you?  Do you understand that the earth is of the earth and that death is of this earth?  But I belong to a land where there is no crying and no pain.  At any moment I could say my last word, take my last step, But mark this down.  It won't be sad for me.  It'll be the grandest day that I'll live.  It's when I take that next breath in glory.  Think about eternity.  For the here and the now is what Satan will tie you up with.  But if your prayer life is what it ought to be, you'll be thinking about eternity.  You'll be thinking about holiness.  You'll be thinking about spiritual things.  Number four.  Your need for the Lord is realized.  If you get your eyes upon Him, and you begin to focus upon Him, and begin to talk to Him, you'll begin to desire Him.  You'll want Him.  And He is what you're crying out for.  You're trying to satisfy yourself with stuff.  You're piling it up around you.  Buying everything you can get your hands on.  And you play with it like a child for a while.  Throw it down.  And you got to have something else.  That's the way the flesh is.  It can never be satisfied.  But touch him one time.  And your soul is set on fire.  He satisfies you like nothing else does.  There's a great God.  a big need inside you, and that need is for the Lord.  He said, call unto Me and I will answer thee.  I need Him, friend.  I need Him more than I recognize that I need Him, more than I understand it.  I need the Lord.  i need him when i get up and when i go to bed.  i need him when i breathe and when i eat.  i need him when i walk and when i think i need him just to live.  i can't live without him.  when you pray you get a perspective on sin that begins to change.  You see it in all its vile character.  You see it, my friend, for what it truly is.  It's a cancer that eats at the human soul.  It'll destroy you and your family.  Oh, it may be a little insignificant, nothing to begin with, but sin is like a wildfire.  It doesn't take much to start it.  Then once it rages, it consumes everything in its path.  I'm telling you, friend, sin is something that'll destroy you.  The Bible said fools make a mock at sin.  And the Scripture teaches me that if I get my eyes on the Lord and I see Him in His holiness, His goodness, and His grace, my perspective on sin begins to change.  We want sin.  There's pleasure in it for a season.  We're accustomed to it.  We were born into it.  We are by nature children of wrath.  But thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.  Amen.  That I can overcome the power of hell by the Holy Ghost.  Amen. ",
