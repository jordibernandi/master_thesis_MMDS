Now, I want to start moving away from the COVID-19 hysteria and move on to other things.  But this one needs to be addressed.

            "text": "I can't help but think of Jesus' words in Matthew 7.15 and following, Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  You will recognize them by their fruits.  Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?  So every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.  A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.  Now, beware of false prophets.  Note that they are not the same thing as false teachers.  Peter makes this distinction in his second letter, 2 Peter 2.1.  A false teacher wrongly interprets the basics of the Christian faith, but a false prophet claims to bring new revelation from God himself.  In Jesus' day, that would have been the class of Jewish Pharisees, I would think.  During the time that Matthew wrote this gospel, it would have been Christians, having been influenced by Gnosticism.  Ken Copeland has the dubious distinction of being both.  Jesus says you will recognize them by their fruits.  If Ken Copeland was actually hearing from God in December regarding what's ahead in 2020, don't you think God would have made mention, at least in passing, of the Chinese city of Wuhan, or the virus that originated from it, or the worldwide crisis that has been created because of it?  These are the real words of the Lord.  Ezekiel chapter 13, Then the word of the Lord came to me, Ezekiel, saying, Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, Listen to the words of the Lord.  Thus says the Lord God, Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen  nothing.\".  O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins.  You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord.  They see falsehood and lying divination, who are saying, The Lord declares, when the Lord has not seen them.  Yet they hope for the fulfillment of their  word.\".  Do you not see a false vision and speaking a lying divination when you said, The Lord declares, but it is not I who have spoken.  Woe to Ken Copeland and others like him who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing.  And woe to anyone who looks up to him and listens to him as though he is a true man of God. ",
