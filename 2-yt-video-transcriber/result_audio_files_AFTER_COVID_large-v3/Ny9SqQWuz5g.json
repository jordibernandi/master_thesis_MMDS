Weird thing to do for something called Star Wars news.  But hey, the Clone War is seemingly over.  The armistice between Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and whoever this guy is was announced just yesterday, and the streets have filled with remembrance and celebration.  The Viceroy of Waste Management has asked that everyone dispose of their glowing orb safely in the appropriate compactors.  Along with the announcement that the Star Wars over, Viceroy of Announcements declared that under a new old Republic law, all of the clone soldiers bred to be blaster fodder in an endless Star War are now free.  Do we have a clip?  Do we have a hologram?  Because it didn't happen?  Okay.  Well, hey, at least we don't have a clip of the Supreme Chancellor dressed like death's creepy uncle ranting about how he's dismantling the entire government and reorganizing it into a galactic empire.  We do have that?  I mean, play it. ",

            "text": "So that's a thing now.  And I don't know.  Did nobody feel the need to speak up here?  Like, is anyone gonna not stand up for that?  I mean, you're right there!  You're senators!  Come on!  To the Senate's credit, Senator Amidala did hyperpost on her holo feed, this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.  So, thanks for that.  You did it.  Seems like something to worry about.  Seems like not a great guy.  I don't know, like, what's it gonna take, right?  Like, during his speech, he just ranted on about this conspiracy that the Jedi tried to kill him, and they're the reason he looks like that, and he's actually the victim, and he needs all the power, and like, I mean, We give lots of crap to the Jedi, all right?  Maybe on account of the whole still being cool with slavery thing, and their completely ineffectual governance and police state, and lots of other stuff we talk about on here.  Because here, on Cody Showdy, we try to be Force Balance, TMCR2E4.  The Jedi, the Republic, they have lots of problems, but I don't know if we should kill all of them, you guys.  And his whole speech, it just seemed like this weird, like, false victimization and personal grievance stuff mixed with conspiracies, and they don't seem like the best qualities in leadership, especially with all of the reports from the Jedi that he colluded with the Trade Federation to start the war and take power, and even if Palpatine didn't know about it.  There was definitely Trade Federation interference in the election, and Bail Organa got more applause than Palpatine anyway, and I... I still think applause instead of votes is a weird system, and I don't know, maybe super innocent people with nothing to hide don't hyperpost this nine times a day.  Also, part of me just thinks this whole, we gotta make a galactic empire stuff, was really just because he's mad he got booed at the bubble opera.  That's right, recently at the Bubble Opera, to see the final performance of Gloob Marbus Talley's masterpiece, Toronto Gosh and Chimney Choo-Doo, the crowd booed the Supreme Chancellor for three straight hours.  This was before he started looking like a Gundark's turd that was dried out in the sun and then dampened somehow, and before he started ranting about how the Jedi are meanies and he's being targeted by the droids in the beep state, and now he's gotta do an empire.  Just saying.  Also, fun, he's still hanging out with the Jedi's large adult son and hater of sand who's just worried about midi-clorturalism, right?  Like, maybe we don't need to keep legitimizing these creeps and violent weirdos who have all this power.  I mean, if you're just gonna both sides the situation and invite people on your show and just let them say stuff like, Jedi are evil!  At least challenge them.  And maybe don't do it in a pit of lava.  Weird interview.  But if you don't point out the problems with what they're saying, you're helping them.  When you run stories called, like, The Dapper Young Sith, you're not helping.  You're hyper, hyper normalizing what they're saying.  That's sort of the point of view.  Just don't do it.  And of course, when Palpatine was asked if he's worried about what this could do for people who want to not be genocided, he responded, no. ",

Like, maybe one dude isn't the solution to all of our problems.  God, the Jedi suck so bad.
