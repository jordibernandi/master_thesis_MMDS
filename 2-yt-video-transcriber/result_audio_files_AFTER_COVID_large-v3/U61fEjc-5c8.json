The first time that a civilian was shot.  Don't move.  Stay here.  All the times that people didn't listen to me.  The times that I was almost killed.  the dead bodies I've seen, the dead animals I've seen.  My spiritual mental bucket was full.  About six months into the job, a 60-year-old had a stroke, and she crossed, like, six lanes of traffic and got T-boned.  And I processed it.  Uh, like a normal, like a normal crash.  Like I didn't care.  Like I was just like, oh, well, you know, shit happens.  Um, and so this lady was injured, um, possibly dying.  She was getting taken to the hospital.  I'm, you know, going to the hospital to cut a ticket to a lady in a neck brace.  And I just don't.  I just don't have an emotional reaction like these.  people are experiencing some of the worst days of their life.  And I don't.  I got nothing.  I got no no sympathy no empathy.  because I don't even have time to feel Anything I have to process the paperwork and get back on the road.  So that was the first time that, like, I had an alarm bell go off where I was just like, you're not feeling things the way a normal person feels.  You know, most people would be like, oh, well, you know, is the lady okay?  Is this person in a neck brace going to be okay?  Is, you know, what's going on?  How can I help?  Like all that kind of stuff.  And here I am just writing a report and cutting a ticket.  So that was like my first warning sign that, you know, I'm not psychologically normal anymore.  And then three years into it, a few fights and shootings and deaths and car accidents later, there's a crack baby who's dying.  And the mom had dropped off the kid with the grandpa, and the grandpa was already taking care of like six or seven kids.  And this kid's just fallen out.  And at the time, I didn't feel anything.  So I knew that wasn't right.  And I knew I was done. ",
