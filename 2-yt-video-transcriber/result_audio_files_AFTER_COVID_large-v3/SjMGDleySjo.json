            "text": "Hello beautiful ladies and welcome to today's video where we're going to be talking about why I decided to come out as a conservative influencer.  So in my last couple of videos, you'll have seen that I have come out as a conservative influencer.  And I thought I would talk to you guys a little bit about why I decided to do that, because I know that there aren't a lot of influencers in this space who talk about their politics openly.  They definitely live a certain lifestyle, but they don't just embrace and say what they actually believe and what their views really are.  But it was really important to me that I actually come out and say straight out, I'm conservative.  The reason I felt this was so important was because I have been afraid to say outright that I am a conservative for a lot of different reasons.  The first is that I am an artist, I'm an opera singer, and in an artistic space it's very difficult to express that you're conservative without a being afraid that you'll lose jobs or b being afraid that you'll lose friends.  A lot of the time in artistic spaces, I've found that people who are on the other side of the aisle feel totally comfortable sharing their liberal views, which, hey, if you want to share your views, that's totally fine, but no one on the other side of the aisle could respond.  That, to me, is the real problem.  I think that the best conversations and the most fruitful ones are the ones where people are able to say what they think without being afraid that they'll really upset someone.  Of course, that doesn't mean you can just be willy-nilly and say things that are insensitive or rude, but really more to the point of, let's talk about our ideas, and if our ideas are different, that's okay.  Maybe that's even a good thing.  It was a really big lesson for me when I was at the Manhattan School of Music because I was there for three years, and it wasn't until I came out and said that I was conservative that I found out that there were actually more of us than I thought.  but we had all kept it secret because we were all afraid of expressing that we actually had a differing viewpoint.  I think it's really important for conservative women to have a space to be open and honest about what they believe.  For so long, it's felt like conservative women have really had to keep all of their thoughts under wraps so that they don't get in trouble from their bosses, their friends, or their teachers.  And I think conservative women, in some ways, have it harder than conservative men.  If you don't believe that women should have a choice when it comes to abortion, a lot of women will say that you're insensitive.  Well, I would say that we're not insensitive.  We care about the child, the baby.  And conservative women are very often not taken seriously.  One of the things I found fascinating is that conservative women can't even find a community when they want to because no one feels comfortable voicing their views.  So that's why I decided to come out and say I was conservative.  I don't like living in fear.  I don't like making choices based on being afraid.  So instead, I wanted to come out and say, yes, I am a conservative.  Why does it matter that I'm conservative if I'm an influencer?  Well, my conservative views come prior to everything else.  Everything that I talk about, everything that I believe in, everything that I choose to wear, or even the makeup that I put on, it comes from a conservative and classic perspective.  When I say let's be classic, to me that's a lifestyle.  And for me, that classic lifestyle is built on my conservative lifestyle.  My goal for Classically Abby isn't for it to be an only conservative woman space, but a place where conservative women feel comfortable voicing their views.  So if you find that you're on the opposite side of the aisle, or even just a moderate, I would love to have you here if you are open to the idea of having conversations and discussions with people on the other side.  That to me is an exciting opportunity that we have here, a place where women from all different sides and all different viewpoints really have a space to converse without being afraid that you're going to lose a friendship.  With all of that in mind, I did create a locals community so that we could have that space built in.  I want to have some sort of filter so that people who don't share these views of openness and open conversation can't just come in and flood the comments.  I want this to be a space that really is safe.  What I'm hoping to do is that for those who have a paid subscription, we'll have private live streams that will encourage us to have a conversation where I'll be there and you can comment in and I'll respond to questions and comments and you guys can talk to each other there as well.  And another thing I'm really interested in looking into is doing video chat calls.  with my premium subscribers where we can have a group chat, 25 people, 50 people, however many people, where we're really talking about these ideas and we can actually talk to each other face to face.  This whole thing makes me so excited and it's been a goal of mine that's been in the works for a long time.  I really love the idea that conservative women and women across the aisle would all feel comfortable sharing their views and talking about these ideas without fear.  And that is why I decided to come out as a conservative influencer.  Please let me know in the comments below what you think about all this.  If you are a conservative woman that has been silenced and hasn't talked about your views, I would love to hear how you feel about this, and I'd love to know how you'd like to be a part of this community.  What other stuff you think a premium subscriber should have, I would love to know.  And if you are on the other side of the aisle, please continue to comment.  I love to hear your guys' points of view, especially if it's respectful.  Thank you guys so much for watching today's video.  Please subscribe to my channel and blog if you haven't already.
