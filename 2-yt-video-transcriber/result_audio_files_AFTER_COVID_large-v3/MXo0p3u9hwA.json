            "text": "Now there used to be this concept called noblesse oblige from the French meaning nobility is obligated or is obliged.  And this term has been demonized in the modern context.  But it simply states that in as much as there are discrepancies between wealth, power, and influence, there emerges some responsibility within the so-called privileged classes, the classes who have this wealth power and influence towards people who are less fortunate.  And a lot of this was bolstered and reinforced by the fact that throughout most of human history, up until very, very recently, human society existed in a state of actual interdependency and perceived interdependency.  So, for example, if you look at a feudal system, you might have landed lords and serfs but there's a definite absolute interdependency there.  the landed lords depended upon the labor of the serfs and the serfs depended upon the protection and lordship of those landed gentry.  that's how it worked.  there was a give and take but the dependency was clear to everyone involved.  And even as feudalism dissipated, there still existed certain interdependencies, economic, human, social, because people back in the day existed in strangely similar environments.  The medical care, for example, available to a king in 1600 wasn't fundamentally different to the complete lack of medical care available to a peasant.  in the sense that doctors simply didn't have a clue of what they're doing.  They were taking styles of the dark,  etc.,  etc.  And whether or not this noblesse oblige was something that people felt ethically, and I severely doubt they did, it was nonetheless present to some degree.  And we can see this, I think, in many of the earlier movements of the 20th century, particularly amongst the communist movements, but not exclusively, where there was an active attempt to galvanize the so-called proletariat, the lower classes, the working classes.  the elites perceived them as being the very least useful and necessary.  Now, if you fast forward from then and all the earlier iterations I mentioned to the current year, as people are inclined to call it, you'll see pretty much none of that.  Now, yes, there are still some economic interdependencies, but as much as we're all living like kings or the equivalent, even the poor, as compared to some bygone age, the discrepancy between those people and the things they have access to, the types of medical care,  etc.,  etc.,  well, it's frightening in a lot of ways.  And I'm not engaging in some rabble-rousing, and I don't resent them for it.  I simply want to point out that the degree of cultural speciation that's taken place in the last few decades is greater than has ever existed in the history of our species.  And there's no connection there anymore.  There's no noblesse oblige.  And I didn't just pull this idea out of my ass.  This has been based upon observation for years now, and in more recent times, direct interaction with at least one of these so-called cultural elites.  Somebody I've heard speak many times, I've heard other people speak to, normal people.  And I can assure you that this disconnect I'm talking about is as palpable as you could imagine.  And let me explain why.  Because inasmuch as there's a cultural speciation, these people neither care nor do they understand your problems on the ground, the average guy or the guy.  that simply doesn't exist within that elevated sphere.  What's the evidence for this?  Well, there's a lot of evidence, but let's take a statement pulled from a horse's mouth.  One of these cognitive cultural leads was posed the following question.  What should men do if they're seeking lasting relationships and functional marriages?  And this guy, brilliant though he might be, simply stated there's a power to commitment.  They should simply commit.  Just commit.  Just commit.  Now, an observation to throw in here, based on actual data, is that in the upper classes, amongst the cultural, cognitive, social elite, marriage and the raising of children is, on average, more functional than it is in the middle class and the lower classes.  So without question, that's coloring his bias.  but the fact that this particular gentleman is completely unaware of the situation on the ground of the tinder of the dating market of the mating market and of the struggles in particular of young men is abundantly clear.  simply by dint of the statement just commit.  if just committee were the solution None of the problems that have been discussed for years would have been discussed because there would be virtually no problems, just commit.  And I hazard a guess that even the greater rates of success that are present in those social milieu are not reflective of the strategy that entails simply committing.  But I say this one example to give you a sense of how disconnected these people are, not just in terms of wealth, not just in terms of amenities, not just in terms of cognitive capacity and the things they can understand and talk about.  They don't have a bloody clue how you're doing and what your struggle is and what you care about and what matters to you.  And more to the point, they don't care.  I don't even blame them.  Imagine growing up in a complete bubble separated from the rest of the world.  That bubble becomes your world.  But when you listen to these people directly or indirectly, and as much as they give speeches or enter into podcasts, you quickly understand that they don't understand you, your situation, and they don't really care.
