            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's me, back with another video.  And as the title says below, we're going to be talking about being woke.  Oh man, what a month it's been.  I mean, we had our general election down here in New Zealand and the United States has just had its election.  And boy, Let me tell you something, the fat lady hasn't sang yet in regards to the US election.  But the reason why I want to talk about this subject, about being woke, is, as I said, we've just had the New Zealand general election down here, and some of the subject matter that I've been talking about in the previous videos, I've heard a lot of guys, or read a lot of comments, or a number of comments about guys saying, you know, about how the deep the subject matter is or this or that or whatever else is like, you know, dang, dude, this is really deep stuff sort of situation.  And it's actually not.  In all honesty, it's really not.  The stuff that I'm talking about in the last number of videos, it's what these people at the top of the pile know.  It's what a lot of these people at the top of the pile know.  It's just been kept from you, the individual.  However, the problem is today we have a specific group of people that are supposedly waking up and calling themselves, you know, they use the terminology woke.  OK, now these people are.  I mean, there's multiple YouTube channels.  Some of the YouTube channels, people have upwards of a few million followers.  It's absolutely unbelievable.  And then you've got all the woke Hollywood media.  You've got people like Russell Brand, who seems to be the King Poobah of being woke.  And then you've got Jim Carrey.  Oh my gosh, Jim Carrey.  I feel sorry for that guy.  Man, oh man, oh man.  He has not dealt or addressed his demons in any way, shape, or form.  So, yeah, you've got all this stuff.  And the hallmarks of these woke people all tend to be, you know, we want the world to be a better place.  More love, peace, and vegetable rights.  We want to save the world from climate change.  I mean, oh my God, the world is just... falling apart.  It's just falling apart around us.  It's unbelievable.  This is their thinking.  And the other real hallmark trait of the woke generation is they want more equality.  They want more things equal.  They don't want these people at the top of the pile having all the money.  The money needs to be spread out evenly around the world.  So we are going to start with the whole equality bandwagon.  Now, If anyone has ever spent any time out in nature, like literally out in nature, where you're kind of just living off the land and making a go of it, you're going to learn very, very quickly how unequal nature is.  When you look at nature, there is no equality in nature in any way, shape or form.  Zip, zero, nada, none.  I mean, nature is brutal, and it's how I have mentioned in previous videos about how nature will self-sacrifice.  And it literally will sacrifice itself for more growth.  And there's no equality in that.  When I died, when I died when I was 24 years of age, crossed over, I had the hand of God put me back in my body, okay?  I didn't want to come back here in any way, shape or form.  And there was no discussion.  There was no, well, let's just talk about this, Lawrence.  You know, we need to make sure everything's fair and equal and balanced.  And, you know, you have a good life and whatever it is that you're doing down there, it's going to appease me also.  While you're happy, I'm happy.  It's going to be a win-win.  Fuck off.  It was not a win-win.  Zero.  I mean like mind-blowingly zero fucking equality across the board.  Period.  And that's God.  And God is nature, creation, the universe.  Everything.  So these people that believe that there is this equality, how everything's got to be equal, this is a Marxist ideology.  It has nothing, nothing to do with nature in any way, shape or form.  So if there's no equality in this world, then what is the world that we live in?  What is the true nature of this world that we live in?  And this is my litmus test for all of these woke people that are out there, you know, chanting about all this vegetable rights and peace and equality and all this good stuff, right?  All this, everything's got to be beautiful and equal and everything.  If they're not teaching you this, then they're full of poo.  or they are not aware of this aspect of life, or they do know about it and they're not willing to tell you about it because it will actually go against what they're teaching.  Think about that for a minute.  We live in a world of duality.  Nature lives in duality.  Science has proven this over and over and over again.  proves this over and over and over again.  We are a part of nature.  We cannot avoid this duality in life.  What is duality?  It's really simple.  Where there's a left, there's a right.  Where there's an up, there's a down.  Where there's a hot, there's a cold.  Where there's an in, there's an out.  Where there's a man, there's a woman.  Where there's darkness, there's light.  For everything in life, there is an equal and opposite.  So this is how it works.  If all you woke people are out there wanting all this equality, what is God, nature, creation, the universe, whatever is in charge of this, what is it going to give back to you?  It's going to give you more inequality.  Because if you are focusing on all this unequal stuff in the universe, in this world, in this realm that we live in, what are you going to get back?  You're putting all your energy into this inequality.  And I've said this before in other videos, where your attention goes, your energy flows.  So you're putting all this energy into inequality.  So the universe, God, nature, creation, whatever, has to give you the opposite back.  You don't want, you want equality.  The universe will give you back inequality.  We live in a world of duality.  So all you woke people that are running around there wanting to save the world from climate change, fuck me, what do you think you're gonna get back?  Climate change.  All of you woke people that are wanting to save the world.  All your attention and all your focus and energy is going into wanting to save this world.  All of this energy, right?  We need to save the world.  Oh my God, the world's being destroyed by mankind.  What is nature, God, creation going to give back to you if this world, this realm, this place that we live in is ran by duality, opposites?  Yeah, buddy, you better believe it.  It's going to give you more climate change.  Think about all the peace.  You want more peace.  You want more love.  You want more kindness.  You want all this different stuff, right?  All this supposedly good stuff.  What's the universe going to give you back?  Yep, you guessed it.  More peace.  wars, more pestilence, more of everything.  Whatever you put your focus into, you're going to get the exact opposite back.  That's it.  It happens to all of us in each and every day of our lives.  So if you're not putting your focus, you shouldn't be putting your focus on equality.  No, you should be putting your focus in on what is it going to, what are you doing to make the world a more equal place?  And I'll tell you what you're doing.  The majority of you are doing nothing.  The majority of these woke people are running around virtue signaling the living shit out of the world, but they're doing nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  It's literally like The empty shells.  Well, I'm going to do all this feel-good stuff and put all this stuff out there into the world, but I'm actually not going to do anything about it.  It's mind-blowing.  You want to save the planet, okay?  You want to save the planet from all this bad stuff, right?  But here's the situation.  I was down in Blenheim, Blenheim, New Zealand, last weekend, and at the Marlborough Girls College.  The parking lot used to be full of bikes.  We drove past the college.  Okay?  That college has no longer got bicycles in the parking lot.  It's all cars now.  The parking lot is full of cars.  McLaughlin Street, all the way down McLaughlin Street from the girls' college on each side of the road is cars.  Cars, cars, cars, cars, cars.  Thousands of cars because nobody wants to bike or walk anymore.  Oh, we can't walk to school anymore.  We've got to be dropped off by our parents because... you know, the bad people are going against.  So all these woke muppets that want to save the world from cars and more gasoline and all this sort of stuff being used, all want to be dropped off at school now.  It's like Greta Thunberg going, well, I'm not going to fly in a plane because that uses too much gasoline, but I'll sail across the Atlantic.  in an 8 to 10 million pound yacht that was built just over there, literally over there, over that way, here in Auckland, New Zealand.  The whole bloody boat is carbon fibre and composite material with lithium-ion battery power cells and everything like that in it.  It's like the carbon footprint that that boat would have left would have been fucking massive.  I've worked in the electric vehicle industry.  Seriously, Google it.  Artisan Vehicle Systems in Camarillo, California.  Get on the phone and phone Mike, the owner, and ask him if Lawrence Bryant worked there.  They would call me in and help them with projects.  They're now the world leader in electric mining equipment.  However, previously, I'd helped them build some prototype electric vehicle vehicles.  Systems and different stuff.  as a contractor and I can tell you right now That the whole electric vehicle industry is an absolute scam.  You are not saving the world from anything.  not one single fucking thing.  Driving an electric vehicle.  The only thing you're doing is being an arrogant prick driving around virtue signaling to the world.  They're like I'm better than everybody else.  stroke my deck.  All of you, all of you people that think you're saving the world driving an electric vehicle have absolutely not one clue about the level of toxicity that it takes to manufacture an electric vehicle.  If you brought a brand spanking new Nissan Leaf and a brand spanking new Toyota Corolla today, You would have to drive the Nissan Leaf for 15 years for it to be 23% more efficient to leave less of a carbon footprint than a Toyota Corolla that's burning gasoline every day.  That is how toxic an electric vehicle is to manufacture.  I mean, seriously.  They have... A Tesla Model S has 5,000... 5,000... Lithium-ion laptop batteries 5000. that's what makes up a battery pack and a Tesla Model X. Do you know how toxic it is to manufacture?  lithium-ion batteries anyone yeah didn't think so.  a Tesla Model S is so toxic.  if you take a Tesla Model S and Once it's been manufactured, and let's say an S-series Mercedes, and you put them side beside each other, you've got to drive the Tesla Model S for, again, 15 years for it to be roughly maybe 15% to 20% more efficient than the S-series Mercedes.  It's just like... This whole woke thing is literally.  you're bringing more consumption, more use of materials, more and more and more and more and more of everything.  You go to the average person's home today.  They've got a TV in every room.  They've got their cell phones.  They've got their laptops.  They've got their computers.  All the kids have all the bells and whistles and everything.  But, hey.  We go out there and virtual signal about how woke we are without even knowing that you're actually bringing about more destruction, more material use and more debauchery on the world than any other generation in the history of this planet.  And it's only just begun because now you've all elected Joe Biden.  Oh my God, you have no clue what you've brought down the pipeline at yourselves.  Quite frankly, the woke brigade is going to go down in history as one of the most stupidest groups of people to have ever graced the face of this planet.  So there's my rant.  I am just absolutely mind blown by just how stupid woke people are.  And if you don't like what I said, guess what?  Tough shit.  Because it's the truth.  If you have a problem with what I've just said, it's your problem, not mine.  Learn about really waking up.  Learn about how things work.  Question things.  And figure the shit out.  Unbelievable.  Un-freaking-real.  So, that's my video.  I'm out.  Talk to you later. ",
