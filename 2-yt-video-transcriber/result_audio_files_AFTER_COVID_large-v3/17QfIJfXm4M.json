I'm Amy Goodman, as we go now to India, where the death toll from anti-Muslim violence in Delhi has risen to at least 34, with police accused of standing by as Hindu nationalist mobs assault Muslims.  The violence began Sunday, when groups of Hindus attacked peaceful sit-ins of Muslims protesting against Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi's new citizenship law, which widely restricts Muslim immigration to India.  This is Mohammed Zubair, who said he was on his way home from a local mosque in northeast New Delhi, when he was attacked by a mob. ",

            "text": "Thank you, Amy.  In the last three days, we've seen a spell of violence in various parts of New Delhi, especially in the northeastern district.  As of now, the death toll has gone up to 34, but the people are still in the process of finding dead bodies everywhere and using the official count.  What happened on Sunday was that since December 2019, several people across the national capital have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act that was passed.  A lot of these protests have been led by Muslim women and with the participation of various other communities.  against this law that excludes Muslims.  So on Sunday night, a pro-CAA group, pro-Citizenship Amendment Act group, which was led by a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP, which is also Narendra Modi's party, they came there.  This BJP member called Kapil Mishra, who is also a former MLA of the area, member of Legislative Assembly in Delhi, he incited violence.  There's evidence of that saying that the protesters should move and go back.  And it is from Sunday night till yesterday evening, the violence continues.  Lots of schools, offices... gutted.  Most of these are working-class Muslim areas.  A large mob has been reported in various parts, stone-pelting, using tear gas, using petrol bombs.  And all this happened in the presence of police.  There have been several videos that show that the police is standing while this kind of violence is being meted out by the mob on the people in these neighborhoods.  The other thing also happened was that This is the first time yesterday I've seen\u2014I met several people who were injured.  Apart from petrol bombs and guns and torches, acid was used on several people, which is why lots of people have lost their eyes, have damaged faces.  Again, each time somebody tried to stop the mob from attacks, the police did not help them, instead stood as bystanders.  Also, the police also joined at several places to raise Hindu slogans such as Jai Shri Ram.  So, this has been the situation the last three days.  Thirty-four people have been killed.  The bodies are still at the hospitals.  The postmortems are still conducted.  But lack of government support, lack of administrative support has led to no timely treatment for the people who have been injured.  And this has been brewing for the last two and a half months, since the government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act.  because it exclusively is meant to keep out the Muslim community in the country.  And while these protests were resorting to nonviolence and constitutionalism, clearly this kind of violence was\u2014 used, and not just\u2014various kinds of hate speeches have been used in the recent Delhi elections also.  And it has created an atmosphere by the silence of the prime minister under whose jurisdiction, under the central government, under whose\u2014the police, the Delhi police is under, that anybody who raises right-wing Hindu nationalist slogans, or takes their agenda forward on the road, enjoy impunity, and are encouraged by this kind of silence from Modi and the other ministers.

            "text": "I would definitely say that the kind of Islamophobia that we have seen in the recent past, in the last few years in India, is also kind of encouraged by President Trump in the way he has treated the minorities everywhere else.  This kind of Islamophobia is encouraged by this kind of silence also from President Trump, because he was asked a question during the press conference and he did not respond to it.  So, there is a clear connection.  Also, the fact that these elements are emboldened by the visits of somebody like Trump.  And recently, we also had Bolsonaro, President Bolsonaro from Brazil, who kind of shares similar principles when it comes to minorities, when it comes to climate, when it comes to various other policies.  that leads to displacement.  And when there is no reaction from them, and in fact they are seen as endorsing Prime Minister Modi in India, there is a kind of encouragement for such things here.  I would also like to say that this is the first time\u2014not the first time, but I would say we have not heard in the recent past where journalists in the last three days were actually attacked by mobs in the presence of police.  And they were asked for their religion.  So, several non-Hindu journalists were threatened.  They were forced to delete their videos, forced to delete photos.  They were brutally attacked.  Some of the Hindu journalists had to identify and say, Hindu prayers so that they are let off by the mob.  And this is unprecedented.  And in this kind of a situation now, even reporting what is happening with a certain community has become such a problem.  The other thing that happened was that lots of people who were injured and were in small nursing homes and needed better facilities and needed to be transferred to bigger hospitals.  Ambulances were not allowed by the police to enter.  So, which is why, on Tuesday midnight, some of the members of the civil society tried to contact the high court.  And the high court, at midnight, some judges night passed an order saying that ambulances should be immediately allowed by the Delhi police, including several other things.  Also, one of the judges who said that Delhi should not become like a 1984 situation.  In 1984, several\u2014Delhi witnessed a genocide of the Sikh community.  And today, we hear that that judge has been also transferred.  So I also want to point out that the institutions, the police, the judiciary and the other people in the administration who are supposed to protect the constitutional rights of people in India, in a secular India, are also under grave threat, under the political pressure right now.

            "text": "Well, I think that we have to drop the language of clashes and even riots and communal violence.  A lot of the language, certainly in the British press and I think in the American press as well, has been presenting this as a conflict between equal and opposite sides, as a kind of religious fight.  It is not a religious fight.  We are witnessing a situation of very deep structural violence.  There is a majoritarian supremacist party in power in India, and mobs directly incited by senior Indian politicians are roaming around in Muslim-majority areas, identifying Muslim shops, businesses, homes, setting them on fire, identifying Muslims, beating them up.  There is some pushback, certainly, as you might expect, but this is not a situation of equality.  And I've said that any press outfit which refers to this as clashes, clashes between Hindus and Muslims, or even as kind of riots, is actually culpable of a dereliction of duty and certainly of critical analysis.  a situation where equal and opposite forces are in conflict.  It's not even a civil war.  What we have is a very dangerous supremacist ideology that is now out on the streets.  And I'm afraid that the parallels with 1930s Germany are extremely clear.  What has taken place in Delhi in the last couple of days is comparable to the Reichskristallnacht, when Jewish businesses were attacked and set on fire.  And I think that the world really needs to wake up to the gravity of the situation in India, So, we are in a situation not unlike what was happening in Germany in the 1930s, in its 21st-century variation.  But I think that to just play this out as conflicts and clashes and religious fights, I think, is deeply responsible. ",

And Trump is simply picking up the narrative that has already been peddled by the Indian state.  But this is not Gandhi's India by a long shot.  What we have here is violent supremacism out on the streets of India.  And if the world doesn't take notice, then, like the coronavirus, this is also going to spread, and we will all pay the price.
