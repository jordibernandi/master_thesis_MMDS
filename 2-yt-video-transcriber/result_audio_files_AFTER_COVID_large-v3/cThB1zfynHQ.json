            "text": "in twenty seventeen a navy pilot was widely reported as describing a ufo he saw as a big tic-tac and a white forty foot long tic-tac shaped object.  this description caught on and numerous sightings since then have been described as tic-tacs when they might in the past have been described as cigar-shaped or oval.  One of these Tic Tac sightings from June last year was recently recycled on UFO Twitter.  I tried to explain it was just a plane, but some people thought that the fact that it seemingly had no wings and was moving oddly behind trees proved it was not a plane.  So to illustrate what was happening here, I waited for a suitable plane.  Here's Alaska Flight 2425.  Firstly, the lack of wings.  If we zoom in on the video, we can see there are actually no visible wings.  But if we get a better camera and zoom in, we can see that there actually are wings.  You just can't see them in the phone video because of the low resolution and the use of digital zoom.  Wings are nearly always in shadow, so they fade into the sky far quicker than the brightly lit fuselage.  Secondly, the odd movement.  This is camera movement.  If there's trees nearby and you are filming a plane, then it will eventually go behind a tree.  To keep it in shot, you move the camera.  This makes the plane move relative to the tree.  This effect can be compounded by digital zoom, which applies image stabilization to the video, keeping the tree from moving around in some portions of the shot, and enhancing the illusion that the plane is rapidly moving around.  Since this plane here has a contrail, we know it's not rapidly moving around, and the tree certainly isn't, so all this motion comes from the camera.  Of course, not having the control just makes the illusion even more apparent.  Here's a small plane at 10,000 feet.  Here's the shot with the big camera.  Note the wings are dark as they are in shadow.  Here's the iPhone video on full digital zoom.  I'm moving the camera and the camera is stabilising so it's minimising the movement of the tree, creating a very dramatic apparent motion for the plane that you could easily be forgiven for thinking was some kind of advanced technology craft.  but it's just a plane lit from above and a low resolution moving camera with digitally stabilized zoom.
