            "text": "Hello Cinnamon Bun!  Welcome to a video that I wasn't planning on doing but here we are!  A September A September bullet journal setup.  So, yeah, we're just going to have a chill time as I set up my journal for the month.  My journal setup is nothing fancy.  You will know that if you watched my last bullet journal video.  I basically stick to the original Ryder Carroll bullet journal method and add some little flourishes here and there.  So it's not going to be anything too complicated, but I thought we could... Yeah, just do it together and have a bit of a chat.  So the first part of my monthly planning process is setting up my mental inventory, which is kind of like a pensive or a brain dump for the stuff that needs to get migrated from last month, but also just whatever is in my head at the moment.  So I start by setting that up.  so that I've got it ready and then I'm going to start sifting through my pages from the previous month, which is August.  And I'll just go through all of that and look for any open tasks, migrate them over onto the mental inventory.  I also use that third column to make note of the big events that happened that month so that I can use that for my review when I get to that point.  It's funny, like, I have not been doing much witchy stuff at all for a while now.  maybe the past few weeks or months, it's just not something I've been really going to.  And I was kind of like reminded of that when, uh, I was talking about some things with my therapist and he was like, have you thought about doing some witchcraft in and around, you know, this particular thing we were talking about?  And I was like, no, because I haven't been doing any really.  Um, It's funny that like the second that we got into September and then I was thinking about setting up my journal and also just now, this is like the first month of autumn.  It's like the second like summer was over in my head, something just clicked into place and I was like, oh, I want to get back into everything again.  which isn't really much of a surprise. ",
