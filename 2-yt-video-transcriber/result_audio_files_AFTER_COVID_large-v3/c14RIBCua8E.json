            "text": "Yeah.  I went to Stateline, Idaho over the weekend to do a little cop watching.  With bars and restaurants in Spokane, Washington being forced to require their patrons to wear masks, a lot of people have opted to cross the border into Idaho for these activities where masks are optional.  Stateline is basically a strip of road consisting of places.  Washingtonians can cross the border and drink, purchase one plant to smoke but not another, visit an adult club, or watch some car races and pay less in taxes than they would in Washington.  I made my way over there Saturday night to see if I could catch any order followers from Kootenai County, Idaho harassing anyone just trying to get home after a night of fun.  As I showed up in the area, there was one stop already in progress, and this was immediately followed by two others, all within walking distance of each other.  and then shortly after, a fourth.  And I'm happy to say that none of these stops resulted in tickets being written for these infractions.  The third stop was when I was finally approached by one of these order followers from Kootenai County.  They just couldn't help themselves.  Someone had to step up and give me a directive, even though as you'll hear, there was no reason to.  I guess when you're trained to follow barked commands, it's all you know.  The lack of critical thinking, or any kind of thinking for that matter, before these order followers speak is astounding to me.  What do you think?  Let me know with a comment.  And while you do, don't forget to smash the like button, reblog and share this post on all your social media, and of course, subscribe if you haven't already.  Guys, I made it to 20,000 subs, and I couldn't have done it without you all.  Thank you for the support, advice, information, well thought out ideas, and of course, your love of freedom and opposition to tyranny.  It's been an interesting ride, and it's only going to get more so with this medical police state squeezing in on us. ",
