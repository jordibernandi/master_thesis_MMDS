Come let them scavenge their fill.  I'm your dear leader, you'd die for my love And some of you probably will.  Feed the birds, trumpets and mag.  Trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and mag.  Feed the birds, COVID and lies.  Summon the buzzards and blacken the skies.  A debate and a rally, an indoor fundraiser, four plane flights, eight rides in a car.  Sweating and shedding, he goes super spreading to who knows how many so far.  Feeling great, he says, feeling no pain.  I'm not either, says Herman Cain.  It's a plague wrapped in a flag.  Trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and mag.  Feed the birds from body bags.  Trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and mag. ",
