            "text": "On Monday, we got some promising news from a drug giant Pfizer when they announced that their COVID-19 vaccine trials were going very well.  And that, uh, people in the trial had a 90% success rate in being immune from the virus.  Uh, so far as this trial continues.  This is significant.  A lot of the other drug companies that have had vaccines developed and they're in the trial stage.  A lot of those trials have actually been halted because of dangerous side effects that patients were experiencing and the vaccines they were coming up with were ineffective.  So the news from Pfizer is phenomenal.  Uh, sent the stock market up four points.  It was a good news.  It's a good thing.  Pfizer also announced by the way that the CEO says they're going to distribute this for free.  Hey, that'd be awesome.  I don't believe him for a second, but it would be awesome.  But of course, shortly after this news was announced, uh, the Trump administration immediately had to take credit for it, right?  Vice president Mike Pence tweeted out the following.  He said, huge news.  Thanks to the public private partnership forged by president Trump.  Pfizer announced its coronavirus vaccine trial is effective.  preventing infection in 90% of its volunteers.  Nikki Haley then tweeted out the news about Pfizer vaccine being 90% effective is great news for the American people.  Many thanks to Donald Trump and operation warp speed.  This will be one of the most important action items done by the administration in response to this pandemic.  And then Pfizer immediately had to come out and say, yeah, we weren't a part of that.  Sorry.  We know you were pushing this.  We know you've, you've pumped billions of dollars in the drug companies, but, uh, yeah, we weren't one of those.  So not quite sure why you're taking credit for, for our accomplishment because we did this, not you.  And then Pfizer said, okay, well actually we are a part of warp speed just in the delivery process of it.  But in terms of accepting any federal front funds from the Trump administration to develop our vaccine, we didn't do it.  You get no credit for this.  Thanks for trying though, but don't worry.  We will be using the government apparatus for distribution of the vaccine.  Once we finish the clinical trials, Joe Biden came out and he said, this is great news.  Keep in mind, folks, let's not get, you know, let's not jump the gun here.  It's going to be many months before this thing is available.  if not longer.  And Biden is correct to do that.  We don't know how long it's going to take.  The earliest the vaccine has been developed for, for an ailment is four years.  And that was warp speed.  Usually it's at least 10, at least 10.  So here we are maybe a year into the first COVID-19 case.  And we got a vaccine would not.  let's wait and see, as I mentioned, Most, most of the other vaccine trials have been halted because of dangerous, severe side effects.  I know it sucks.  I know it sucks being stuck at home.  I know it sucks with the economy tanking.  I know it sucks even more for people who have lost their jobs folks, but we can not jump the gun because if we jumped the gun, the surge we're seeing right now will be dwarfed by the next surge.  Not to mention the additional injuries that we could see from an improperly tested vaccine.  So let's cool our jets.  Let's be optimistic.  Absolutely.  And let's also give credit where credit is due.  And none of it is due to the Trump administration.  Their response to this pandemic has been abysmal.  If Pfizer does the right thing and makes this vaccine available to every one of the, everyone in the United States free of charge, and then doesn't, this is a second part of this.  Doesn't screw over the rest of the world by charging them the markups that they usually charge to us.  Then we're good.  If any of those things don't happen, then this is not something worth celebrating. ",
