            "text": "Robert O'Brien said that the intelligence about the alleged Russia plot was being taken so seriously that US allies were alerted and that it could impact military tactics.  So how is that a hoax?  Well, as I mentioned yesterday, what happens when any intelligence comes in unverified, if there is any way that it could affect American troops or allies, it is immediately communicated on the ground to ensure that troops and commanders and generals can make the best decisions, tactically speaking.  So that's the way it's done.  But what I would say is, at the same time, until there's a strategic decision for the President to make, until it is verified, it is not briefed up to the President of the United States.  That's how intelligence works.  angry or frustrated or upset about the fact that he was not in the loop on this when members of Congress were briefed and US allies were briefed?  No, the President believes that and has great faith in Ambassador O'Brien and the others who made the decision that this shouldn't be risen to his desk.  It was a career CIA officer with more than 30 years of tenure who made the decision not to brief it up.  And the National Security Advisor agreed with that decision.  She's an excellent officer and does great work and made the decision not to brief it up.  It was the right decision to make.  And at this moment, as I speak to you, it is still unverified.  You and Robert O'Brien and others expressed real outrage about the leaks.  Is there outrage about what the intelligence community is investigating, which is the possibility of these Russian bounties targeting U.S.  troops?  Make no mistake that this administration has acted tough on Russia, always makes the decision that's in the best interest of protecting our troops, like killing General Soleimani, who killed 600 American troops, maimed thousands of others, and al-Baghdadi.  We always act in the best interest of our troops.  But this is unverified still at this very moment.  John.  Kelly, why is the president calling Black Lives Matter a symbol of hate?  Well, what the president was noting is that that symbol, when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by Black Lives Matter, like pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, that's not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets.  Look, he agrees that all Black Lives Matter, including that of Officer David Dorn, Patrick Underwood, two officers whose lives were tragically taken amid these riots.  All black lives do matter.  He agrees with that sentiment.  But what he doesn't agree with is an organization that chants pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.  about our police officers, our valiant heroes who are out on the street protecting us each and every day.  Americans of all races have protested in all 50 states around that phrase, Black Lives Matter. ",

Yes, Jamel.  Thank you, Kayleigh.  The President has stated in the past that he will not tolerate defunding police, and he's said this multiple times.  Considering that many Democrat-led cities have now done so, including New York City as of this morning, What does not tolerating this move look like from the president's vantage at this time?  Yeah, I mean, speaking out fervently against it.  And what it means is, you know, this executive order gives additional funding to police departments if they meet certain standards.  We want safe policing.  We want to make sure that police officers are trained to deescalate.  That's why there is this supplementary funding in the EO that incentivizes and rewards police departments that train their officers in deescalation, that get rid of chokeholds, except when uh there's an incident of lethal force.  but look he stands firmly with america yet again on this with 64 of opposing defunding the police.  that's a huge number 57 and according to another huffpo you gov poll stand against it.  and um look they they.  Where America stands is here, where we're at a place where 64% of the nation are concerned that the growing criticism of America's police will lead to a shortage of police officers.  That will harm all Americans.  It's an untenable principle, and it's unacceptable when you have people like Representative Ocasio-Cortez really suggesting where the Democrat Party stands today, because taking a billion away from NYPD police officers wasn't enough for her.  She wants to take it all away.  She doesn't want police officers, and that's a really unacceptable proposition.  The USMCA also, it takes effect at midnight.  What immediate changes is the White House hoping to see immediately starting tomorrow?  And then are there any elements of the USMCA that may be hindered because of COVID-19?  The USMCA today, that goes into effect.  It's a huge deal.  For years, for decades, NAFTA wreaked havoc on American society, closing our factories.  hemorrhaging American manufacturing jobs.  And the USMCA is a massive win.  It will create 176,000 jobs, add $68 billion to the US economy.  28,000 manufacturing jobs are expected to be added.  and agricultural and food exports will increase by 2.2 billion, a big win for our farmers.  So we expect to see that start to take effect.  It's a big deal, and it's a reversal of decades of failed U.S.  policy with the USMCA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, horrible trade deals that betrayed America's workers.  Under President Trump, the forgotten man and woman is forgotten no longer. ",
