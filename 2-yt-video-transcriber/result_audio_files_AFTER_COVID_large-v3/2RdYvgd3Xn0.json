Magic boom!  You win!  Greetings, fellow space travelers.  Bionic Dance here.  Before we go any further, I'd like to introduce you to another member of the Bionic Dance family.  This is Xander.  He's four months old, and he's been in the house for about five days, the first two of which were spent convincing Columbia she shouldn't murder him.  There is a good chance you'll be seeing a lot of him.  He's rambunctious, full of energy, and he desperately wants to explore this desk in front of me.  For you Geekatrons out there, yes, I named him after the character from Buffy.  I had about five minutes when I thought it'd be funny to name him Kung Pao Chicken, but the humor wore off fast and I couldn't think of a good way to nickname it, so I went with Xander.  And before anybody points it out, yes, this guy sounds like Kyle Butt.  That's because it's the same channel.  Someone always has to say something in the comments, and yes, we know.  It should be unremarkable at this point. ",
