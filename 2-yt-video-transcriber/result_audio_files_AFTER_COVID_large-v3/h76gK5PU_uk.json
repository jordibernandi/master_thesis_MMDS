So what's going on?  sir can i get his name and bass number?  that's officer stinson also with omaha police department.  okay okay what's going on today?  i don't know.  man what do you think is going on?  well the reason we were called is uh first i just wanted to say ask you uh what's going on today?  the reason we were called is because we got somebody with a mask.  you know i don't know what that means.  i'm gonna walk around and mess.  i know it's cold but uh you know covered up you know see you're nicely uh loaded up with some cameras.  so i'm presuming you're probably videoing things.  We just got a call saying you're standing here filming.  I see that's what you're doing.  What's going on?  What are you doing?  You're just going to film me the whole time?  You're not going to say a word?  You do understand it's a little suspicious.  you're standing here with a phone across the street from a bank, sunglasses on, big coat, not that cold out, and you've got a face mask on.  No?  No?  What's your name and BAS number?  Officer Bishop, 332.  Bellevue Police Department.  Can I get three forms of ID?  Need your name, BAS number, and business card.  No.  No?  No.  What are you doing here?  Am I being detained?  No, you're not being detained.  I'm just asking what you're doing.  Well, you haven't provided me with three forms of ID, so... I don't have to.  And you see, the point is, I just described to you why I'm here.  I described all the points.  You're here, across the street from a bank, filming.  Hold on, hold on.  How do I know you're a real officer, though?  I got a car here.  I got a uniform here.  You think I bought this stuff at a discount store?  You'd be surprised, man.  Yeah, well... Unfortunately, you'd be surprised.  He did the same thing then?  We're in on this together?  Is that what it is?  You never know, man.  What's your name and badge number?  We got a name and badge number after.  Oh, okay.  What's your name and badge number?  Right here.  Officer Severn.  Bass number?  314.  Cool.  Didn't answer me why he was standing here in a coat when it's not that cold out, why his face is covered, why he's filming the bank.  He just wants to know three forms of ID from me and what my badge number is, and I already gave that to him in his name.  Yep.  My badge.  Asked if he's being detained.  I said, nope, I'm just standing here asking you questions.  Yep.  Is there a particular reason you're recording everything, or just a beautiful day out?  You guys have not gave me three forms of ID yet, man.  I don't have to provide you three forms of ID.  Told you that already.  You got my name and badge number.  It's right here in big letter print.  Sir, I don't know if you guys are real officers or not.  All right.  Well, like I said, we didn't buy this stuff from a discount store.  I didn't go buy this.  A uniform in a police car is kind of given away.  With tags and all that stuff on it, so.  Like I said, we got called here.  We didn't just pick your name out of the hat to come and talk to you.  We got called here by somebody because you're doing what you're doing right now.  there's nothing wrong with that though under the illegal we're just main contact with it.  absolutely robin arrested or detained right now.  right now you're being detained for what?  because it's an investigation of to what crime?  what crime are you investigating?  that you're taking pictures of me and that's not a crime?  is it?  is it a crime?  is it a crime?  simple as that is a crime.  is it a crime yes or no?  i have to confiscate your camera and so do you have a warrant whatever i know.  Then you cannot confiscate my camera.  Okay, we'll find out.  We will.  I want you to call your supervisor now.  He's on his way.  That was your supervisor?  He's on his way.  That was your supervisor just now?  He's on his way.  You just called him, yes?  He is on his way.  You're not answering my question.  Did you call your supervisor?  I just said he's on his way.  That doesn't mean you called him.  You're just saying he's on his way.  Did you call him or not?  And what is your supervisor's name, actually?  Are you the supervisor?  He'll talk to you in a minute.  Are you the supervisor?  Yes, he is.  Okay, can I talk to him?  No.  What was your... You will talk to him in a minute when I advise him of why I'm stopping you.  Okay, go ahead and advise him.  Go ahead and advise him.  Name and badge number, please.  Who?  You.  For what?  I mean, you're a public official, right?  Who do you need my badge number for?

Are you refusing to identify yourself, sir?  He identified himself.  Let me see some ID.  Am I being accused of a crime?  Let me see some ID.  Am I being accused of a crime?  I told you, I'm investigating.  What crime?  It's an investigation right now.  An investigation?  It's not a crime.  Then I want to know why you're taking pictures of me.  Because you're parked in a no parking zone.  Now you know.  Okay, so what?  Okay, let me see your ID.  Am I being accused of a crime?  Because right now I'm going to have to write something on this.  Write something there.  Let me see your ID, sir.  Am I being accused of a crime?  Let me see your ID.  Am I being detained right now?  Yes, you are.  For what crime?  It's not a crime.  It's an investigation.  Then you can't detain me.  Yes, I can.  You cannot detain me unless I've committed a crime.  It's an investigation.  Or you suspect me of committing a crime.  I know the law.  I'm not trying to give you a hard time.  It's an investigation.  I was taking pictures of you.  That's not a crime.  You took about six or seven pictures.  Yeah, I got different angles, yes.  If that's the case, why did you just take one picture?  I got different angles.  You can't get multiple angles with one picture.  Okay, so why are you taking pictures of where I'm parked?  What does that have to do with you?  You're parked illegally.  I'm in my vehicle.  This is my patrol area.  Are you responding to an emergency right now?  It's my patrol area.  Are you responding to... I don't have the... Then patrol.  I'm sitting here in the car.  You're sitting.  I'm sitting here in the car.  There you go.  What was your name and badge number?  Supervisor, what was your name and badge number?  You took the picture?  What was your name and badge number?  Did you take the picture?  No, this is a video.  Did you take the video?  What's your name?  You're not going to identify yourself?  I don't know who you are.  Are you the highest ranking person on scene right now?  Did you take the video?  Are you the highest ranking person on scene?  Did you take the video?  You are the highest ranking.  I'm assuming you are because he said he called you out here.  Why won't you identify yourself?  Why do I have to?  It's the law.  Because it's the law, that's why.  No, it's not a law.  Are you a public official?  Are you a public servant?  You're not.  No.  You're not.  No.  You don't have a power of arrest.  Yes.  Then you're a public official.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  How you doing, sir?  Good.  I don't shake hands, though.  Oh, that's fine.  I just don't want you to get hit and trapped.  Hey, is there anything that we can help you with at all?  I'm all right, man.  Okay.  Because you're not doing anything wrong.  You know that, right?  It is your constitutional right to stand here and take pictures.  You know that?  Yeah.  All right.  My concern is I just don't want you to get hit in traffic, okay?  All right.  Okay.  So, again, you're not doing anything wrong.  Do you mind if I see your identification?  I'm all right.  Okay.  All right, sir.  So just please stay in traffic and you have a nice day, okay?  Yeah, you too, man.  I'm Thaddeus Gregory.  Can I ask what you're doing?  It's recorded.  Look at his hand on the taser.  Ready to tase someone, aren't you?  Taken, sir?  None.  What do you guys want?  Just ask what you're doing, sir.  I don't know.  This line right here is actually base property.  This line you're standing on right now?  Right here?  The dirt.  So right here, I'm good.  So basically this line right here that you're actually on is public.  Air Force public.  So I thought this was public property right here.  That this was government public.  So you're telling me right now that the cars that are driving right now, this is the public property?  So but aren't you guys funded by government taxpayer dollars?  Is there a reason you're recording?  Isn't it constitutionally protected?  Under Department of Homeland versus Mossberry, I can be on federal property because this is a federal base.  This is public property.  As long as I don't pass that down.  So I know that this is a street as far as this goes right here.  See, there's a difference in policy and law.  It's not law.  It's your guys' policy.  I don't have to follow your guys' policy.  I have to follow the statute of the federal law and state law of Nebraska.  Have a good day, sir.  What are you taking pictures of the secure parking lot for?  Jay Brown.  Yeah.  Don't really see a bash number here.  965.  All right.  I'm just wondering what you're doing.  It's okay.  You're standing on a public sidewalk.  I just wanted to make sure what you're doing.  I told you it wouldn't be a secret, and I would it.  And I would it.  Have a nice day, all right?  That's good.  Thank you.  First National Bank can't be recording or taking any pictures.  What property is this?  No, the buildings.  Oh, but who property is this, though?  It's public property.  All right, then.  You're not even a cop.  What?  You're not even a cop.  What are you, an accountant?  What are you doing today?  Am I being detained?  What?  Am I being detained?  Did I even say you were being detained?  I just asked what you were doing.  What does it look like?  Looks like you're walking around with some cameras.  Is that illegal?  No, did I say it was illegal?  Well, then why are you worried about what I'm doing?  Right now I'm just gathering stuff.  But I'm not going to answer questions.  Not today.  Can I help you?  Sir?  Can I help you?  Can I help you?  Yeah, what's going on?  Nothing.  What kind of bike are you on, then?  Badass, right?  It actually does look pretty cool.  Thank you, thank you.  What brings you over here?  Checking on my employees.  On your employees?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that on?  It is.  All right.  Is yours on?  It is.  Is there something I can help you with, though?  People are calling in because they're worried because you're driving around the parking lot.  I don't want you to get hit in that bike, huh?  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm cool.  Okay.  So there's nothing I can help you with?  No.  Just out filming.  Okay.  Can I get your name and badge number?  Lewis, badge number 477.  Lewis.  So they called you on me?  Yeah.  Why?  What'd they say?  It's not normal.  What is?  It's out of the normal.  Recording?  Yeah.  You're recording?  It's not normal.  Well, it's not normal driving a little mini bike out in the parking lot.  So when you go to a call, do people call the cops on you for recording them with that little camera?  Sometimes, believe it or not, they do.  Do they?  Really?  I think some people have a big problem with that.  There's nothing wrong with recording.  There's nothing wrong with you recording.  No, no, no, there's not.  I just want to make sure that you don't need me because you are at the Sheriff's Department and the front door is closed because of the pandemic going on.  I just want to make sure that you don't need law enforcement help or anything like that.  No, no.  You need any gloves or anything?  I do have some.  Do you?  I appreciate it.  Awesome.  Yeah.  You guys got any more mask things?  You got any extra ones?  think i have any extra ones.  i just have the one i got from the from the department.  oh all right then let's talk about this.  i don't even know where to where you could even get them.  you know what i like taco bells taco buzzers are cool but they're masks.  yeah they're all purple.  yeah.  So you do know the front door's locked, so if you need us, you gotta call us.  Yeah, that's why I was already about to leave right now.  Okay, awesome.  If there's nothing I can do to help you, I'll let you be on your way.  Have a good day, okay?  Awesome.  You too.  Hey, you mind real quick if I pat you down?  Pat me down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why is that?  For my safety.  All right, man.  I was just asking.  All right.  Take it easy.  Why are you guys doing this?  Why are you pulled up to us?  I'm just asking you because you're on government property.  That's all.  This is our property.  Okay.  I'm just wondering, too.  I mean, that's all.  We just want to know who we're talking to.  We're asking for ID.  Did I say I asked for ID?  I didn't ask for ID.  No, I'm asking for ID.  If you want to film us, you need to get the permission.  Oh, you do?  From whom?  This is my face.  I have my right.  This is privacy.  Is it?  Go to your house and go close the blinds.  What?  We're seeing what's going on right here.  Filming me?  For what?  Working on a project?  You're on federal property.  You have to get permission to do that.  We do have permission.  You do?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't give you permission to film me.  I don't need it.  Huh?  I don't need it.  Then don't point your camera at me.  I don't need it.  Walk away.  I am walking away.  Good.  We could.  What are you going to do?  I'm not filming.  Film my face.  You're going to be a star.  It doesn't matter.  You don't want to be a star?  Nope.  God, man.  If I find my face in the web or whatever, YouTube, I'm going to sue you guys.  Oh my goodness.  Hey man, where'd you get a phone like that?  Hey, it works.  Can I get, I want one of those, man.  Hey, and the reason I'm doing this. ",
