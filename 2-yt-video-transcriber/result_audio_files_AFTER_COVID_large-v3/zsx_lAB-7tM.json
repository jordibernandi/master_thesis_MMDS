            "text": "Our movement is about restoring the American people as the priority for the economic framework of the United States.  About restoring the importance of our civic culture and our sense of national purpose.  About restoring the promise of the American dream for all American families.  For too long, America's immigration laws have failed us as a nation.  For too long, America's immigration system has been for sale.  for sale to corrupt political operatives multinational corporations and power seeking party manipulators.  our immigration system has been hijacked by greedy corporations and k street lobbyists who have tried for years to convince us that we are too lazy or too stupid to take care of our own country.  the corporate elite use immigration to keep our wages down and ensure americans don't get paid a decent wage.  Our universities use foreign students for cheap labor and costly tuition.  Foreign investors use immigration to buy their way into our country.  And self-appointed ethnic identity politicians use mass immigration for power to divide us along racial lines.  These are the same people who outsourced our jobs, signed terrible trade deals, and promoted and rewarded massive illegal immigration.  For years, the political establishment has promised strong enforcement and secure borders.  But what have they delivered?  A policy of extreme open borders, sanctuaries for criminal illegal aliens, the destruction of state and community law enforcement, and billions of dollars in taxpayer money sent to illegal immigrants and countries overseas.  The only thing that can stop these corrupt political forces is you.  The only people strong enough to take away their power is us, the American people.  Our movement is about taking it back.  About taking back the power to decide who gets into our country, who gets our jobs, and who gets to become a citizen.  It's about making sure our nation's immigration policies serve our national interests.  We are about making sure our country's population density does not continue to increase in dangerous and unhealthy ways.  About placing priority on our nation's natural environment and the preservation of our precious resources for future generations.  About ensuring that all of us have a chance to live the American dream.  We are the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization of millions of Americans working together as national leaders in immigration reform and real border controls, fighting to beat back the corrupt global special interests that have almost sold away our nation's heritage.  Enough is enough.  Let's take back control of our immigration laws.  Let's take back our national future.  Together.  Join FAIR today. ",
