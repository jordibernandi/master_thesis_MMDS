            "text": "what's up everybody?  it's your girl back for another video.  so in this video i hope i can quickly answer some of the questions i've been getting.  i've been getting a lot of emails people wanting to know what is my opinion on this so-called plandemic pandemic and where do i think we're headed.  you know what is the end game in all this.  so i'm getting a lot of those kind of questions.  I hope I can answer him briefly before I head home.  I've been out running errands and.  So let me just start here.  I think the the end game is a. One world government, one world religion, and a cashless society.  They've been gearing us up for this for a long time.  And folks, I don't claim to have all the answers either, but everything I'm about to say is really not an opinion.  This is all facts.  If you just take the time to look it up, the mainstream media is not going to tell us all this stuff.  They're going to lie to us.  They're going to manipulate us.  But so basically the evidence that I've been seeing is obviously throughout the pandemic, they've been being dishonest about many things.  I think they're gearing us up for what's to come.  I think they want to see how many of us are going to comply, like with the mask mandates and things like that.  How many of us are going to just believe whatever we're told and go along with it?  They're gearing us up for taking freedom of speech away.  You know, they got all the rioting and protests going on.  They want to defund the police.  They want the thought police instead.  They want to control what your thoughts are and your opinions are.  Even though we have freedom of speech, they're slowly taking that away from us.  You know, even though we're not being arrested for it just yet, they are shadow banning YouTube channels.  They've done it to mine.  They're banning people on Twitter.  They're banning people on Facebook.  They're not allowing people... you know to be on these big platforms having a different opinion from the state.  um so slowly but surely they're taking our rights away taking our freedoms away.  and now i've talked about this before but in the uh the vatican the pope The Pope wants to call all world leaders to the Vatican and reunite everyone.  He wants a one world religion.  He wants to reunite the world on religion, have everyone come together and, you know, sign some kind of peace treaty or something.  reuniting everyone keeping everyone under one religion re-educate the world on religion and save the planet.  he's been on this.  Pope Francis has been on this save the environment kick for a while now.  you know you would think that the Pope belongs in the church praying for people but instead the Vatican the current Pope and all the popes before him have been involved in political matters a very long time.  the vatican you know is a very powerful religious uh political organization.  so that meeting was supposed to take place this may the.  the meeting got postponed because of covet 19 and it's going to take place this october.  i don't think that's coincidental at all.  i think that all along it was going to be in october.  because think about it Right after that is the election, the 2020 election.  So I think we have some major things coming.  The Pope wants to re-educate the world on religion, Catholic religion.  Folks, think about the Dark Ages.  Think about the past when Catholics were persecuting people for not believing in the Catholic religion. ",
