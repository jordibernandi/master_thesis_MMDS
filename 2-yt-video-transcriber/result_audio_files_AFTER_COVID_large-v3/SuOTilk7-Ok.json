What Mr.  Carrion did was disgusting enough, but there's even more to this story.  To cover for his behavior, Carrion told police that I made racist remarks during a supposed conversation with him.  This is an absolute lie, because I never had a conversation with Mr.  Carrion, and that can be proven.  The police can tell how many phone calls were made and whether there was a conversation.  Jeremy Carrion of Laurel Hills, North Carolina, they now know that you're a liar and so does everyone else.  Word is that Mr.  Carrion is a truck driver and that he makes runs to Illinois, where I live.  I hope Mr.  Carrion's bosses find out about the charges against him before he gets stopped for anything in Illinois, because that'll mean a stranded truck once those felony warrants pop up.  If you have any information about Mr.  Carrion's employer or his Illinois trips, please feel free to contact our tip line.  To those involved in cockfighting, my best advice, my only advice, is to get out while the getting's good.  You don't want to end up on our radar like Jeremy Carrion of Laurel Hills, North Carolina.  Once you're on our radar, you'll likely never get off.  No matter where in the U.S.  you live, the campaign of SHARC and the Humane Farming Association is going to crush cockfighting.
