            "text": "Hi, I'm Eduardo Naret for Campus Reform.  Today we're at Harvard University asking students about a recent trend on colleges and universities to scrub their campuses of history.  We've seen campuses change the names of buildings, remove statues, so we're here to find out if students agree with that trend and if they agree it should be applied to their own campus with the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.  Alright, so there's been a trend on campuses to change building names, remove statues that reference either current figures in current events or historical figures who may not share the same views of the student body.  Some examples of this are like Thomas Jefferson.  There have been attempts to remove statues of him across the country.  There was a school in Georgia that tried to remove a building name that was after Clarence Thomas.  So what do you think about that movement?  Do you think it's appropriate to change the names of buildings, statues to sort of fit the current views of the student population? ",

On one hand, yes, it does have historical significance, but when you have a whole new generation of students, and some of those students might feel hurt by the memories these figures hold, History is not always good, you know, and like we don't always need to commemorate people just because they have a big part in history.  Because someone is important or like has contributed to the history of a country, I don't think that's particularly like a very strong argument to keeping something like honoring basically their legacy.

JFK also did a lot of... great things for our country.  At his time, like what other people were also doing and what was more acceptable.  That was in a different time on things that we are now focusing on now.  Okay, so in that case, I feel like you have to kind of separate political and personal.  I'm not saying he's like a necessarily good person, but if he was a good president, then you have to take that into consideration.
