And so the people that would have died from that survived is the data the doubters are using.  Unacceptable.  In its peak during the flu season, I think this was like the past two years are mild flu seasons because it was like 30,000 people died or it was like 17,000 and then like 20,000 or 30,000 people died.

I don't have any proof, but neither do you to disprove God.  I just like to go to church on Sunday.  It's a good community.  It gives me like spirituality, makes me feel good, makes me feel like there's a purpose.  It's probably better off than whatever kind of atheist black hole that you exist in, you nihilistic fuck.  Say all of that, and I'm like, okay, that's cool.  All right, you've made some good points, lady.  But it's like, no, every Christian was actually joined in a mass prayer to lift up Donald Trump into the highest office in the land.  Like, why you got to take it to some psychotic level every time?  Just be normal, dude.  That's pretty dismissive on someone's faith.  Man, I am the most understanding person when it comes to faith.  Are you kidding me?  I shit on... r slash atheism dipshits all day who are like, I'm an anti-theist.  Like, I am the most, most understanding person of people of faith.  But when they say stuff like, yeah, we were praying, we were engaging in a mass prayer to get Donald Trump elected, literally the antichrist.  We were engaging in a mass prayer to get the antichrist elected into office.  You sound like a psycho.  You're completely out of your mind if you're like, this man is... very religious and very christian-like and very christ-like and we're all casting a spell together like it's the last sequence of full metal alchemist like we all got together in a city and we drew that alchemist circle.  and now we're all summoning inside of that circle.  and now we summon donald trump to the highest office.  you're a psycho.  let he who is not raw dog the porn star after his fifth kid with his third wife cast the first stone while his third wife is pregnant.
