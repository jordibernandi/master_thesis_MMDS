            "text": "On May 25th, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered in cold blood by a cop, who kneeled on Floyd's neck as he was begging for help.  Floyd was already on the ground and handcuffed, and the sole accusation against him was that he used a fake $20 bill.  The video of this incident led to protests in Minneapolis that eventually developed into riots and spread over the whole state and eventually the entire country.  Several police stations were burned down and police officers retreated to the point where several districts have effectively abolished the police.  In the few days since then, so many things have happened that it's hard to keep up, but the protests show no signs of dying out, and have even spread to several countries around the world.  Of course, riots such as this do not happen because of a single incident.  The death of George Floyd was only the last in a long line of cases of police violence so commonly directed against black people.  It set off the anger that had been building up for decades.  In the US, despite the fact that being a taxi driver is a more dangerous job than being a police officer, police have been responsible for almost 5,000 deaths since 2015.  And a disproportionate amount of the victims have been black.  Black people are more likely to be stopped and searched or pulled over by the police.  After the killing of Michael Brown, for instance, a study found that, although only 67% of Ferguson's population was black, 85% of the people pulled over by cops were black.  A study from 2004 found that black people were between three to five times more likely than whites to be asked if they're carrying drugs or weapons, asked to leave their vehicle, be searched, have a passenger searched, or have their vehicle searched.  Black people are three and a half times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite rates of use being similar, and cops will often specifically target black neighborhoods when they're looking to fulfill their quotas.  These riots must be understood in this context of decades of mistreatment, abuse, and murder of black people by cops, who almost never face consequences, and the state does next to nothing to fix the problem.  When anger at injustice is combined with increasing unemployment and poverty, low wages, housing insecurity and the complete ineptitude and callousness of our politicians, riots are bound to erupt.  As MLK said, they are the language of the unheard.  Over the years, various solutions have been tried to stop police brutality, most of them fruitless.  Neither body cams nor police training programs showed any signs of reducing police violence, while more substantial reforms like demilitarization seem unlikely to be implemented.  Biden's proposal is, why not shoot unarmed citizens in the leg instead?  We will never understand why this is the case unless we understand what the function of the police is in the first place.  The police force, as the institution we know today, for the most part developed in the 19th century, and its main function was to protect property and secure profits.  In Europe, it was established to deal with striking and rioting workers, large groups of people fed up with being mistreated and exploited.  An organized violent force was required to suppress workers' uprisings, and so the police was established.  While in the US, the police was established to protect property and profits as well, it was from the very beginning fundamentally linked to racism, as it developed out of slave patrol groups, and one of its main functions was preventing and suppressing slave rebellions.  The link between racism and profit was never broken.  Owing to lack of legal protections, black workers have often been subjected to unlawfully low wages, high working hours, and workplace discrimination.  Today, billions of dollars are made in the prison economy, with companies like Walmart, Microsoft, and McDonald's utilizing prison labor, forcing people to. ",
