Or you might find yourself being dragged out of a supermarket by a complete stranger.  Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of Playing a Blinder with me, the Creaky Blinder.  Now I know we don't usually look at videos like this, but I'm not one to keep my pointing and laughing skills limited just to flat earthers.  Today, we're going to take a look at some of the most ridiculous public outbursts I can find on Twitter when it comes to people being required to wear masks in public.  It says you have to wear a mask.  Wear a mask.  Bye.  Wear a mask.  This first clip is just to set the tone.  This lady looks perfectly harmless.  She's obviously embarrassed, which is why she's just going, Bye.  But I'm sure she's got some really good reason for not wearing a mask.  I have a mask, but I have an anxiety check.  That's fine.  Just wear a mask.  Now, anxiety is an emotion characterized by feelings of tension.  Let me ask you this.  What would make you feel more anxious?  Fear of wearing a face mask for the five minutes you may be in the supermarket or fear of catching a virus which has killed half a million people worldwide.  So I read something online, obviously from an anti-masker because a normal person wouldn't say it.  And that anti-masker said that wearing a mask for an extended period of time reduces your ability to intake oxygen and can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide.  But surprisingly enough, it just isn't true.  Now, there are certain medical exemptions.  I mentioned this in Friday's video.  My own dad has COPD, and he's got an exemption from wearing a mask.  But guess what?  He still wears one.  Because his inability to breathe properly is outweighed by his fear of catching a virus that will almost certainly kill him if he gets it.  Okay, seriously?  Yeah, seriously.  Cool.  Thanks.  I'm going to talk to him.  Do it.  I'd love that.  Would you?  I would.  Call him, please.  What are you doing?  Now this is something that I really don't get.  This is obviously a couple.  She is the mouthy one who is wearing a mask and her boyfriend who's got his mask dangling off his ear hasn't said a word and she's threatening to call security.  What exactly for?  Because if the security guards are worth anything the second they turn up they are going to tell your boyfriend that he should be wearing a mask as per this store's policy.  One of the store employees has approached him, told him that it's now law that you need to wear a mask, and he has just said thank you and put his mask on.  But whether it's a law or not is kind of irrelevant in a store setting anyway, because as the proprietor of a business, you can enforce any rules of your choosing.  for example you could quite easily say only people wearing red t-shirts are ever allowed to enter my store.  you probably don't want to do that though because that's a really terrible example because you wouldn't get any customers.  but you know what i mean.  it's your own policy which you are free to implement as you see fit but the boyfriend is one thing but what the woman does next just beggars belief.  Okay, you're actually disrespecting me because you're in my space.  Far be it from me to be nitpicky, but she is challenging him about being in her personal space, which is something nobody likes.  But surely, being this far away from his face isn't the best way to get your point across.  Hmm.  Well, this woman clearly doesn't understand how the internet works, does she?  But it's fine anyway.  Only 42,000 people have seen this clip on Twitter so far, so she'll be fine.  Go make yourself at home.  You need to get the fuck out of our state.  Like, seriously.  Pack off.  Why don't you stay at home?  You're going to be staying at home now because I got a phone.  So she's coughed in his face like a child and then said to him, you're going to be staying home now because I've got COVID.  Good for you.  You've just made yourself look like a complete turkey in front of tens of thousands of people.  Because apart from that, I can't see how this has achieved anything other than making you look like a really horrible person.  And another thing I've noticed while trawling through all these clips for you over the last couple of days is that somehow these people that refuse to wear masks always seem to be able to twist it so that they look like the victim.  Much like the lady in this next clip.  And I use the word lady quite loosely.  Stop it.  Now please forgive me for repeating myself and stating the obvious, but before you listen to the statement this lady is about to make, please keep in mind that she is, well, white.  Well besides the glaringly obvious fact which is that white people are most certainly not a minority, you've been removed from this flight for refusing to wear a face mask.  I seriously doubt that race has got anything to do with this at all.  Now ladies, this next one is for you because I wouldn't want to be accused of being sexist Because it turns out that it's not just middle-aged women that can be entitled assholes.  Men can as well.  Who would have thunk it?  You dumb fucking faggot.  What's your problem?  What's your dumb fucking faggot problem?  You don't know the law.  That's how stupid you are.  I love people like this.  Now, I'm not going to repeat what he said.  I'm sure you heard it.  He called this guy with the camera a dumb F. ",
