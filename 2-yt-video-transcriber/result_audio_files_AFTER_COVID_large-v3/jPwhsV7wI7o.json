            "text": "So, we all know that old adage that thoughts and prayers don't actually solve any world problems.  What if there was a group that was praying desperately for the spread of something like coronavirus?  Now, you and I would probably say that that won't do anything, but what if this group was actually trying to spread it?  Nope, actions speak louder than prayers, and these actions are... Well, let's roll the intro.  All right, guys, you know the drill.  If you haven't subscribed already, then why not go ahead and do so, and you'll probably know if you want to do so by the end of the video.  With that said, fan art, and then the topic.  So first, we have a shaved head Rule 63 Surris by Disco Scone, a surprised Surris by Napkin Squiggles, and then another Rule 63 Surris by Wombologist.  As always, thank you all for your submissions and making me question my gender identity every single day.  Anywho, onto the topic at hand.  We've been recently seeing more and more cases of coronavirus pop up in the United States, and we've had our first few deaths in the last few days.  While there is certainly some sensationalization from the media, and it's causing people to panic about coronavirus a little more than they should in many cases, the virus has put a bit of a damper on international travel and has caused a lot of issues, especially in one place in South Korea.  So for those who don't know, currently outside of China, South Korea has the largest cluster of infections, with over 5,000 people infected in the country and at least 28 deaths.  Now to give some context, historically South Korea was able to actually contain the outbreak of the MERS virus in their country.  There was also an earlier outbreak of a different coronavirus mutation which surfaced from the Middle East in 2012, and they were also able to contain that.  Historically, they've been able to manage stuff like this pretty well, but what's different now?  This is where patient number 31 enters the picture.  She was a 61-year-old woman who was a member of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus Christ.  I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing that incorrectly, but Shincheonji looks to be what it is, Anyway, this particular church was located in the city of Daegu, and she was considered to be ground zero of the explosion of the coronavirus cases within that region.  It's so bad that currently health authorities in South Korea are convinced that one in five people within their borders who are infected can be linked directly to her.  Last month she went to the hospital because of a minor traffic accident, and it was there that doctors recommended that she get submitted for coronavirus screening.  She, however, completely refused the screening.  But why is this?  Well, as it turns out, the beliefs in the Shionji Church, if you're to believe the locals, are that getting sick is a sin because it prevents you from doing God's work.  It should also be noted that during the time that she was in the hospital, she left temporarily to attend Sunday gatherings at the Shionji Church.  You know, during the time that she should have been being screened for coronavirus.  It was during this time that she came in contact with thousands of other faithful people.  So instead of seeking medical help while you were in the place where you could be seeking medical help, instead, this woman decided that the best thing she could do is go to church.  That was more important than potentially stopping a viral outbreak.  This is what happens when people put their faith over their common sense.  And I know that sounds insulting, but just think about it from a base, intuitive level.  Your god is omnipotent.  He's omnipresent.  You can literally worship him wherever you happen to be.  But instead of taking that into consideration, there are people like Patient 31 that would instead risk the lives of thousands of people.  This is also one of the reasons why people get perpetually sick in the food and retail industry.  Bosses here in the States don't want to let you spend an adequate amount of time making sure that you aren't an incubator.  Anyways, I'm getting sidetracked.  What actually caused the issues with Patient 31?  what about the Xi'anqi church leads us into the scenario we encounter today?  Well, the church is currently led by one Li Man He, and he's currently being put on blast by his entire country, because either through inadmission that the coronavirus could potentially affect any of their believers, or through sheer negligence in the face of the virus, his church is at the epicenter of an epidemic.  So, let's take a look at his church and see why this might be the case.  The Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle, and the Testimony was informally known as the Shincheonji Church and as a Protestant organization and new religious movement that was established in March 1984.  Lee Man Hee was the founder of the group, And the adherents are known to be incredibly secretive.  They believe that Lee is the second coming of Jesus Christ, of course, and they also claim that the Bible is written in secret metaphors that ONLY Lima and he can correctly interpret.  Before he had started his own religious movement, he was part of the group known as Olive Tree.  Now, how big is this church, and how could it possibly be the center for a viral outbreak?  This is where we start to get into some of the issues that the church has, and why the government is currently trying to crack down on him.  In 2014, it was estimated that they had about 120,000 members, but in 2020, that estimation put them at about 200,000, so a pretty sizable chunk.  However, here's the problem.  The church refused to provide an actual list, up until recently, of the members they had in attendance.  Also, due to the secretive nature of the church, it seems like they spent a lot of time allegedly making sure that their leaders wouldn't get tested for things like coronavirus.  They would cite their religious belief to privacy, which eventually resulted in widespread national dissent and the mayor of Seoul filing a lawsuit on the church itself.  Following this lawsuit, Lee Man Hee stepped out into the limelight and started apologizing for what his church did and his negligence leading to the outbreak in the country.  Following this, he finally actually gave a registrar of the different attendees to the church.  And upon looking it over, it seems like they have 317,320 exactly registered Shinshianshi members.  So a church that will not get tested because of religious belief in privacy has hundreds of thousands of adherents, and because their members will actively leave the hospital when they should be getting tested, Just to have one more day at church with thousands of other followers?  It's pretty easy to see how not only due to practice, but due to scale, why there are now 5,000 cases of coronavirus with at least a fifth of them related to a single church member.  Well, 5,000 cases in Seoul.  But we got into what the church does and when it was founded, but what other controversies did this church have, and is there a pattern that we can look at?  to understand why this is happening today.  Oh, and please note that according to Lee Manhee, his church has been cooperating with the government as best as possible, even when they weren't providing their registrar, even when they were convincing their people not to get tested, even when his church's actions were directly contributing to an epidemic.  Okay, now that we've poisoned that well, let's get into some of the history.  Turns out, this church actually has its fingers in more places than just South Korea, strangely enough.  But let's start there.  Many of its members have actually been cited in the Myeongdong Cathedral, which I'm probably mispronouncing as well, pretending to be pious believers of a completely different religious sect so that they can try to lure other Koreans or even foreigners into their religious meetings.  You know, the ones where they knowingly spread viruses to people.  Oh, sorry, that one was a low blow.  I'm gonna continue on.  I'm just gonna say that that's a little bit underhanded.  Like, if you as a Christian go to somebody else's church so you can try to recruit them into your church, that's... kinda scummy.  Let's see here, in November 2016, the Church of England actually issued a formal alert to around 500 parishes in London.  This is because of a Shionchi affiliate known as Paracristo, a registered charity in the United Kingdom, which ran Bible study courses in the London Docklands.  And what were they using these courses for?  A recruitment, of course!  They were attempting to recruit members of the Church of England to become part of the Church of Shin-Shionchi.  And I think we can actually start calling them a cult at this point, because it seems like those who become involved in Shin-Shionchi gradually withdraw from their friends and family, and actively start to lie about their real lives.  This lying and secretive behavior is also the behavior that contributed to the outbreak in South Korea.  More recently, in 2019, the Baptist Convention in India had to warn its worshippers to be wary of Shincheonshi.  saying that their leader claims to have access to secret knowledge of scriptures which other church pastors do not know.  Moreover, he claims that one can only truly know God by following and listening to the teachings of Shinji Ochi.  Once they are into the group, they spend most of their time inviting people to join Shinji Ochi and spend less time with their families, friends, and churches and neglect and quit their studies or work.  So yeah, I'm perfectly fine calling this a cult.  In fact, if I actually ran this by Telltale, I'm sure he would call it a level 3 cult.  It has a figurehead leader, it organizes regularly, and it seems to try to tell its people that they shouldn't associate with their friends, family, or anything else, and starts engaging in information, thought, and behavior control.  So we see that they've got their fingers in organizations across the world and are constantly trying to recruit people, and there's even warnings in other Christian organizations about this church specifically.  So now that we know that, let's go ahead and circle back to coronavirus again, as that's the topical thing.  Of the 5,000 cases in South Korea, how many cases of coronavirus are linked directly to the church?  Well, 60% of the total infections nationwide are from the church directly.  It's so bad that the Seoul city government is asking prosecutors to press charges against the religious group's founder and all of its senior members for murder, causing harm, and violating the infectious disease and control act.  Since a spotlight has been put on this church, over and above the 5,000 reported cases of coronavirus within the country, nearly 9,000 more members of the religious group were said to be showing symptoms of the virus.  As a result of this, the mayor of Seoul has a lawsuit against the founder and its sect, primarily for refusing to get tested and convincing their members to not get tested and to cite their religious beliefs as a shield and scapegoat.  Several places of Catholic worship within the country have been posting signs at their doors forbidding access to any Shinchoji Church of Jesus members, because again, these members are noted to infiltrate other churches and try to steal and recruit members.  Currently, a petition has been signed by over a million people and has been presented to the South Korean government requesting the dissolution of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, citing in particular the different types of harm that that group has engaged in across the world, though the catalyst was certainly the most recent coronavirus outbreak.  So, what can we take from all of this?  Well, I think the biggest thing is that if you have a religious leader who's telling you to completely ignore important medical testing or even treatment, then that religious leader is not your friend.  Not all religions are cults, but if you find that a religion is a cult, then you owe it to yourself and the members around you to leave.  This is some of the dangers that extremism like this can birth.  It doesn't have to be a violent episode like Jonestown or a mass suicide like Heaven's Gate.  Sometimes it's as simple as just ignoring basic safety and health regulations.  The cult need only be large enough and have enough influence for that to affect an entire country.  Anyways, I don't want to drop the name of the friend of mine who handed me the name of this church on a platter for this video.  I'm not sure how comfortable they are with that kind of doxing.  But I am glad that I got a chance to look into these guys.  This was a little bit scary.  All it takes is a similar church like the NIFB here in the States to do the exact same thing, and suddenly we've got more outbreaks.  Remember, the media is currently sensationalizing coronavirus.  But all it takes is enough incidents like this, and suddenly that sensationalization becomes reality.  Please, do yourself a favor.  Wash your hands.  Get tested if you start showing symptoms.  And for the love of God, don't listen to an extreme cult when they tell you not to.
