            "text": "Yes, I was going to play golf.  Okay.  And, you know, hopefully when I'm done with this stupid press conference, I can go play golf.  It's a beautiful sunny day.  And we're actually celebrating at my New Jersey property.  We have a new jobs program.  Okay.  It's called Good Employment.  Okay.  The economy's coming back.  We recently hired a bunch of out-of-work conservatives.  Scott Baio is now cleaning the men's locker room.  And James Woods is is serving up refreshments.  He's working behind the bar.  And Antonio Sabato  Jr.,  you can't forget the junior, he's now one of our top caddies.  So we're doing great jobs for great people.  Okay, that's what we're calling it, great jobs for great Trump people.  No, but I heard there was sad news today concerning an African-American of some prominence.  prominence that's a good word you know.  it means sort of almost famous.  you know kind of like.  well not like me but you know.  so we're sad.  oh herman who?  no i thought you were referencing the fact that michelle obama now has a podcast which is a disgrace.  you know nobody's going to listen to that.  i've never even heard of spotify.  it's like a i don't know.  mike you know spot where you listen to gaga that's where you listen to gaga and spot it.  well Mike, he's all up on the sort of dance music.  But no, we're very upset.  You know, it's sort of a disgrace that she's doing podcasts.  You know, I have a podcast called Making Podcasts Great Again, and it's a lot better than hers.  But her first guest is, of course, the failed Kenyan President Obama.  You know, sort of nepotism kind of thing to get him on as the guest.  You know, she's not having a great conservative on.  So we're very upset if that's what you're referencing.  You know, in African-American tragedy news, we don't like that.  she has a podcast.  But you're telling me Herman Cain, the not, oh, the black, the black who ran for president, who failed.  I thought, well, that wasn't Ben Carson.  It was another one.  Well, you know.  I guess he should have worn a mask.  You know, we were very strong all the time on masks.  You got to wear the mask.  So kind of his fault.  We'll see what happens. ",
