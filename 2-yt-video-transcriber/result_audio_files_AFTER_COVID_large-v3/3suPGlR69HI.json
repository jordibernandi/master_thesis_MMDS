            "text": "huh so the twitter user richie mcginnis just tweeted if one clip from my camera roll sums up 2020 it's this one and i believe he's absolutely accurate.  welcome back beautiful and amazing human beings.  this is okadowski of.  we are change.org.  happy freaking new year.  we made it.  Congratulations for surviving a crazy turbulent insane ... year.  if we have time in this video I'm going to go over my ... year in review but personally there's so much ... news especially about the great reset from the latest ... Time Magazine.  disinformation propaganda puff piece with of ... course the latest announcement from Wall Street that has ... officially begun the process that is the great reset.  something of course that as a critical thinking ... independent media outlet we are automatically against and ... we even made merchandise specifically stating so cheesy ... plug.  yes you could get this shirt right now.  say no to the ... great reset on teesprings.com.  forward slash stores ... forward slash.  we are changed.  the link is down in the description below.  Lots of important news to break down on that front so we'll ... see if we have time.  during this absolutely strange ... confusing year where now police officers are literally ... gathering together to make sure that people aren't ... gathering together in Times Square.  Whoever would have thought that one year from now if ... you were told that police officers are going to make ... gatherings illegal especially in Times Square ... especially during the New Year's.  you wouldn't believe ... them.  you wouldn't think that's possible but that's exactly ... what's happening right now and as New York City's finest ... and brightest that protect and serve you all the time are ... making sure Lordy what is.  what is happening in new york city which is absolutely breaking down in utter freaking chaos from what we're seeing from the outside.  i have family and friends there.  they're.  they're not happy with the current state of events.  there's angry squirrels attacking people down the street because they are hungry and can't find any food.  and now imagine imagine what's going to happen to the hordes of unprepared individuals living on top of each other when that situation translates from the natural world to the real world.  yeah i don't know about you but maybe that's not the smartest strategic place to be in.  and this year i actually finally moved out of that city hellscape and i'm Happier than ever.  Started my year off on a farm in Pennsylvania.  Transitioned into the Free State Project in New Hampshire.  I now was supposed to be in Florida.  Working on some sustainable hippie commune.  But I've been stuck here at Timples parking lot.  And I've been co-hosting the Timcast IRL show.  Which I've been... pretty fun.  I don't know how long I'm going to keep doing ... this we'll see.  we're still kind of playing it out but as you ... know we don't quit so you could definitely expect more ... crazy insane exciting things in 2021. then even our ... flamethrower 2020 bash government pedo connected ... scarecrow scavenger hunt which of course we had in New ... Hampshire with our survival courses.  and yes now I'm ... It has been an absolutely wild year that has tested ... everyone especially in myself.  and hey this was the ... year where the alleged conspiracy theorists were ... more accurate with their predictions than the quote ... experts.  yeah we got that going for us also never ... coming back to New York City ever again the murder rate ... literally surged 41% this year.  it's only going to go up in 2021. especially when you look at the larger economic ... ramifications coming our way soon that will have a tsunami ... reckoning our on our social and political life something of ... course created by establishment elites that are ... now telling you that they have the solution to the ... problem that they caused.  that solution is of course.  the great reset which we're going to get into in just a ... little bit.  make sure to of course see that you are ... subscribed and notified to this channel.  many people are ... unsubscribed.  to get more information from us go to ... wearechange.org and sign up on our email list.  we also have many ... ways where you could help us and get directly involved on ... wearechange.org.  forward slash donate for the few that do ... sincerely love you guys.  from the bottom of my heart I ... wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and just sincerely thank you.  Now let's talk about that great reset and of course the term ... build back better.  that has been a major talking point for ... many ruling establishment elites for a very long time ... now people have to understand this larger concept of the ... great reset isn't something new.  it's been around for a ... while and it's been advocated by many elites that are now ... trashing the economy becoming richer than ever while ... creating the largest income gap between the rich and the poor.  that we have recently seen.  in our modern times many ... globalist organizations years ago were using the term ... build back better.  and it's important to also understand ... that this is the major slogan and talking point of the Joe ... Biden presidency that literally makes this a staple ... of their platitudes that they put on the president's ... promise with their very open generalized generic language.  the same Biden administration that is devoted to the radical great reset movement.  even according to their own administration members like John Kerry who said himself the Biden administration supports the great reset and will quote will happen with greater speed and with greater intensity than a lot of people might imagine.  the PR propaganda this information efforts have been ramped up to push this larger great reset with of course time magazine recently coming out partnering with the world economic forum highlighting how this sickness quote provided a unique opportunity to think about the kind of future we want.  we not really meaning mean you we meaning the Pope the Rothschilds the World Economic Forum the IMF the World Bank Bill Gates Jeff Bezos all of which have advocated along with the Rothschild Foundation that's bringing together the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation along with the Pope who wants to redefine capitalism.  those individuals are who they mean by we because all of those individuals are the ones that are advocating for this.  The future of course will be shaped by them and to think ... that this is done in some kind of consensus by the people is ... absolutely ridiculous and naive.  to think so just on that ... basis time magazine is absolutely wrong but they ... continue on with their post time partnered with the ... World Economic Forum to ask leading thinkers to share ... ideas about how to transform the way we live and work.  Now again this is not new talk that we've seen.  we've seen ... it a couple weeks ago with many think tanks and ... corporate organizations saying that this is a great ... opportunity to push the great reset.  then the mainstream ... media specifically the New York Times said you're crazy ... conspiracy theorist if you think there's a great reset ... agenda.  and now we're back on the propaganda push effort ... with not only Time Magazine pushing the larger talking ... but also the major move made by Wall Street right now that many people say has begun the great reset.  but before we get into that of course we need to understand some of the proposals that these individuals are pushing.  of course they're trying to make it seem that when you own no property when you actually own nothing when you have no privacy that somehow you'll be happier than ever.  and again rhetoric is just very opened bland language about equality ... and fairness essentially admittedly pushing global ... collectivism and more central planning because you know ... historically central planning has never gone wrong at all and ... again who's doing the planning?  the Rothschilds the Rockefeller ... the Ford Foundation but the banking elites the corporations ... Bill Gates is the Jeff Bezos.  is that the people who are most ... responsible for?  I would say in my opinion the most amount of ... human suffering?  they're the ones they are now using the ... talking points that they will now build back better from ... their own destruction.  that's what I personally see ... happening here and they use this term the great reset to ... galvanize this larger propaganda push that ... essentially is what the great.  reset is in in layman terms explained to you.  but this is ... the amazing thing.  not all hope is lost here especially ... when you look at the comments section to time ... magazine and they're absolutely being destroyed.  and ratioed to an extent that is absolutely impressive and awe-inspiring.  one user wrote so quote you consult the oligarchs elites to determine how we the commoners have to live and work while the elites have not been affected by this sickness at all but have actually profited?  are you out of touch with reality?  time equals totalitarian indoctrination mass education and uh he has a point.  the comments go on.  what right does time or the ... World Economic Forum have to consider how others live and ... work?  at least your desire for chance central planning and ... control is in the open.  time has fallen far since the days of ... Henry Luce quote.  you should be ashamed of yourselves for ... even contemplating such an effort and he is absolutely ... right.  sadly time magazine is acting like a rag that will ... just republish what the elites tell them to publish another user rights.  technocrats and oligarchs ... want total control but we are not going to just hand it over ... another user rights.  I'm good thanks.  if anything this ... sickness has taught me our government officials don't ... have a sweet clue what they're doing and I wouldn't ... trust them to reimagine a lemonade stand.  hallelujah I ... definitely agree with that sentiment as well as many ... I'm not a conspiracy theorist but this is freaking me out.  the ... ratio is absolutely incredible.  as in the making ... of this video the post has over a thousand responses ... which is less than half of the likes and again people ... bring up very important points like how.  The sickness has essentially made the rich super rich for ... these people to come out out of everything and say that they ... have more solutions to fix the problems that they are at least ... at the very minimum profiting from is absolutely naive.  I'm ... sorry but I don't believe the experts in the politicians ... that are literally lecturing people about how horrible it ... is to spend a time with your family during the holidays as ... they literally jet off to the Caribbean Islands with their ... I'm sorry when the quote experts and political ... commentators have art like this inside of their homes ... they're individuals that shouldn't be trusted seriously ... a lot of sick people in our society and most of them are ... within the upper echelons of it.  now again the time ... magazine piece used language like we were going to ... determine this.  we're going to figure this out meanwhile.  They're not waiting for you or your consensus or for you ... even to say jack squat about this.  they're just implementing ... this right now as we speak as one of the world's largest ... asset management firms that has been getting extremely ... favorable treatment from the US Federal Reserve ... specifically BlackRock.  right now is quote fueling one of ... the biggest transfers of capital in the world.  who of ... course don't go along with the agenda.  of sustainability.  now again that's just another key ... generalized word out there that has been used and ... manipulated without any exact specific details.  Blackrock ... specifically said that their clients will quote double their ... environmental social and corporate governance with ... investments within five years and they call this ... specifically the new investment order sounds very similar to the New World Order as they talk about ... the same kind of generalized language like we see from the ... World Economic Forum about how this sickness this year has ... quote accelerated profound shifts in how our economies ... and societies operate again.  just very snobby boozy ... language.  and they talk about how there's going to be major ... differences in sustainability.  inequality geopolitics and the quote joint macro policy ... revolution.  as they say themselves this calls for a ... fundamental rethinking of investment portfolios again ... almost the exact same language that we see on the World ... Economic Forum website congregated with of course ... all the other elites who are using the same talking ... points to push this larger reset.  they go on talking ... about the green movement has finally been accepted by ... Wall Street and this is a major move since of course BlackRock is one of the largest global investment management companies in the world that manage 7.8 trillion dollars.  this is one of the head honchos out there that the Federal Reserve literally divvies up and prints all the money for.  When they lose money the Federal Reserve pays for it ... when they make money their private investors benefit ... from that.  they are the company that's literally ... getting socialism by the government while everyone ... else is getting screwed over now again.  when they're ... talking about sustainability and fighting climate change ... and inequality when you see some of the measures that ... they're putting in there essentially closing off their ... private club that of course you're not in to make more ... money and if anyone wants to join their club they're going ... to invest and have to put up a lot more money to be in their ... special controlling club.  they just set the bar a lot ... higher for that levels of entry and essentially they're ... setting up a landscape where in the future if you want to have.  business you're going to have more regulations more ... fines more restrictions.  that of course will stop you ... from even being competitors with the big guys the big ... club that of course is becoming ever elitist ever ... exclusive and ever more powerful.  and that's ... predominantly happening because of our participation ... with it.  we have a choice to shop at Amazon or at Walmart ... you choose what you incentivize not just what your ... dollars but what your clicks and what your attention.  you ... just by watching this video is of something in my opinion ... that is.  that is good.  you sharing this video getting the ... word out is even better.  it's more crucial than ever ... especially with the algorithm timeline curation of news feeds ... that's happening right now.  that of course is making sure ... hear voices that are from the outside that are alternative that are questioning the prevailing logic that of course Time Magazine is being paid heavily to shove down your throat.  fight back against that by sharing this video.  and because you do I am still here have a hell of an amazing New Year's.  I love you guys.  I want to be here.  if it wasn't for you stay tuned for more here on wearechange.org. ",
