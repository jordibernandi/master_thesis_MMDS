So if we're, like, seeing these two-dimensional roles, like, we're seeing, like, Hispanic people, Latin people be gardeners, and, like, we're seeing, like, Russian people, like, they're still white-passing, so I'm not really that... sad for them.  But, you know, but still, like, there's, that's a thing where, like, a lot of Russian characters are, like, villains or, like, you know, like, if we're seeing all of it, like, Indian people owning, um, shops, like, uh, convenience stores or, like, whatever, their accents being a punchline, if we're only seeing that and we don't get any real life experience, then that, you know, like, that fucks up how we, how we see each other, you know?  Um, So yeah, so that was my experience of myself.  Like that's how like internalized racism happens is I'm seeing myself be portrayed in this two-dimensional way.  I'm not able to relate to any of the characters I see on screen that look like me.  I'm like, I'm not.  So then it's also like a question, it becomes a question for myself of like, am I even black?  Like, if I don't talk like this, if I don't wear these clothes, if I'm not attracted to these men, like, if I don't like this kind of music, am I still black, you know?  Like, there was, like, a whole identity crisis that I went through because I talked a certain way.  And then that also gets reinforced when people are like, why do you talk white?  Why do you like, why do you only hang out with these people?  Like the closest I've ever gotten to being in a fight at school was like over this kind of thing.  Cause like somebody, they kept calling me like Oreo and I like was cool with it for a while.  And then at one point I was like, yo, keep my name out of your mouth.  Like, you know, and like everyone was shook.  Cause I've never, I'm not a fighter.  Like, no, thank you.  You know?  But I was like, I was tired and that's, That's like what happens when you are not shown, when you're not, when what you are, a Black woman in this example, or like whatever marginalized group is not allowed to be shown to encapsulate the full spectrum of humanity.  That's what happens, you know? ",
