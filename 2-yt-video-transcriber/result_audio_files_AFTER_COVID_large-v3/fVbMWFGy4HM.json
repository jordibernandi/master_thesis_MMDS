There's a lot that gives them a reason to be concerned about the future, but there's also a lot that folks just carry in their hearts and their spirit that is truly born out of optimism.  And so when you have those conversations and people share with you their hardships, but also They're there because they also believe that things are possible, that all things are possible.  And I agree with you.  Those interactions, those one-on-one interactions really do inspire and help you to keep it real.  And obviously that is critical if we are to lead effectively.

But look, the main thing to know about Joe is that Joe has never lost his sense of why we do this.  And we do it because of, you know, for him, memories of His family back in Scranton and then the people at Delaware that he represented, the folks on the Amtrak train, he met each and every day.  He is constantly aware that that is why we do this and that everything that comes up his focus is going to be how's that going to help those people who sent him there.  Now, what that means is that if you have a joint event, he may be taking a little longer than what appears on the schedule.  Because he will be talking to every single person. ",
