            "text": "Good afternoon, people, or good morning.  Watchwoman65, Lisa Boyce here.  I'm doing this video, but my son's on lunch right now with his class.  This just came out.  I'm going to come back later and do more.  First, let me give you the gospel.  It's in 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  That Christ died for our sins, past, present, and future, was buried and rose again on the third day according to scripture.  We are saved by grace through faith in Christ alone.  We are justified by the blood.  The only requirement is to believe in what he did for us at the cross.  That's the gospel.  Believing.  That's the gospel.  Nothing else.  I wanted to do this article because this just came to me and it could explain the dream that came out yesterday and the other videos about this and people have been seeing demons.  This happened this morning.  There's a giant fireball seen across the skies of East Coast.  Now, it says a huge meteor was seen streaking across the skies on the East Coast this morning, lighting up several social media platforms and users in Pittsburgh and up and down the East Coast.  Now this is a tweet from one of the newscasters that saw it.  He said, and his name is Jeff, I can't pronounce his last name, but he's off of WTOV9.  Says, I'm seeing reports of a fireball that lit up the sky around 625 a.m Lauren Borough walked out walking her dog and snapped these photos.  And I'm going to link it in the description box off her phone.  And he's asking, if you have any photos that you would like to share, please chime in on it.  And it says here, people are saying that they saw a bright flash of light and a streak across the sky.  This spectacular fireball was seen just before 6.30 AM.  One trucker who was driving along I-76 in Pennsylvania captured video of the meteor from his dash cam.  I'm going to link this.  It's got pictures and I'm going to link this in the description box.  I just thought I would pass this along to you, especially since Zach is on lunch right now.  So you can see this.  Wake up people.  We're about to get out of here.  Something is happening.  Something is happening.  And it's big.  That's not a coincidence with that fireball.  Not at all.  I'll be back later.  Thank you. ",
