            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  Today's video is brought to you by Surfshark.  In just a little bit, I'm going to talk to you about an offer exclusive to my audience this holiday season.  But before that, let me tell you about something that I'm not going to miss.  When all of this is over, when Donald Trump is gone, And I assure you, he will be gone.  I'm not going to miss talking about him all the time.  I'm looking forward to a time when we can discuss policy differences as Democrats.  Where we can discuss in the weeds policy details.  I'm looking forward to that day.  because the constant barrage of misinformation and insane headlines is taxing on all of us, not just our system and our institutions, but on us as citizens.  So I'm very much looking forward to getting back to a time where there's nothing to report on a presidential speech.  that it's boring and uneventful.  That's what I'm looking for.  I can't wait until things are uneventful or back to a time when it's uneventful ish.  It has been reported right now that Donald Trump from time to time is floating, not leaving the white house.  This has been a fear of many for years, that when it finally came time for him to leave, he would choose not to.  He would refuse.  He would dig in his heels.  He would take the famous pose.  of a tantruming toddler cross both his arms and refuse to leave.  CNN is doing the reporting, and New York Magazine did a little piece, a very brief piece on it.  Before I get to that, I want to talk about today's sponsor, Surfshark.

All right, now let's get to this New Yorker or this New York Magazine article talking about the reporting from CNN.  In it, they're talking about the delusion... factor of Donald Trump, how he tells insane lies, then he begins to believe them, and that's where this quote picks up.  A point in favor of delusional comes via CNN, which reports that Trump not only insists he actually won the 2020 election, but has maintained at times that he will not vacate the premises on January 20th when his term ends.  In his moments of deepest denial, it reports, Trump has told some advisors that he will refuse to leave the White House on Inauguration Day only to be walked down from that ledge.  To be perfectly clear about this, Trump 100% will leave the White House on Inauguration Day, if not well before.  Even the scholars who expressed the deepest fears of Trump's intentions to undermine the system did not put credence in the possibility he could defy the outcome by simply refusing to leave.  Squatting is not one of the tools in his authoritarian toolkit.  Indeed, you can't just not leave bed that morning and stay in the residence and then hope to find some nook or cranny to hide in.  You're going to leave, Donald Trump.  That's not a way to subvert the election, just refusing to leave.  And in the actual CNN reporting, there was this line.  The possibility has alarmed some aides, but few believe Trump will actually follow through.  He's throwing a fucking temper tantrum, an advisor said.  He's going to leave.  He's just lashing out.  Which is what Donald Trump does.  Lash out.  And we're seeing that right now related to multiple people who have crossed him by admitting that the election didn't go his way.  From Bill Barr, who has admitted that there was no widespread voter fraud, to Mitch McConnell, who just admitted and calling Joe Biden president-elect, to Brian Kemp, the obsequious, fawning sycophant of Donald Trump, the governor of Georgia, who's now an enemy of Trump because he abided by the law.  He had no choice but to do so.  And he won't interfere in the election results.  Fox News even can't catch a break related to Donald Trump.  He's constantly tweeting and freaking out about them.  To look at Donald Trump's Twitter profile right now, his Twitter timeline is a shitshow.  It's not a clean looking timeline because every tweet, every other tweet, every... More tweets than not are appended with a warning that says... What's the warning exactly?  What's the verbiage exactly say of the warning?  This claim about election fraud is disputed.  Those words appear more often than any other words on his Twitter profile.  Here's one from December 16th.  the morning of September 16th.  Can't believe how badly Fox News is doing in the ratings.  They played right into the hands of the radical left Democrats, hiring fired Donna Brazile and far worse, allowing endless negative and unedited commercials.  Fox News is dead.  Really sad.  Here's another one.  Later in the morning, perhaps the biggest difference between 2016 and 2020 is Fox News.  Despite the fact that I went from 63 million votes to 75 million votes, a record 12 million vote increase, Obama went down 3,000 votes and won rigged election.  And again, that one is appended with the disclaim about election fraud is disputed.  It is a lie.  Now there's actually reporting that Twitter might just ban him when he's not president of the United States because they don't have some obligation like they have it now, but no obligation to coddle him that he could be dispensed with because he's not president anymore.  He's just a civilian.  He's just like you and me.  Justice finally will apply.  And here is a Trump retweet of Lin Wood, who is a wacky conspiracy theorist lawyer who is pseudo-representing Trump, holding rallies encouraging these whipped-up-in-a-frenzy supporters of Donald Trump not to vote in the special election to ultimately give control of the Senate over to us.  as uh... as uh... a form of protest uh... temper tantrum uh... that will have ultimate political consequences which is great.  uh... this is the retreat uh... this is the tweet.  the dump truck route retweeted president trump at-real.  Donald Trump is a genuinely good man.  Well, we know his judgment is off there.  He does not really like to fire people.  I bet he dislikes putting people in jail, especially quote-unquote Republicans.  He gave Brian Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State every chance to get it right.  They refused.  They will soon be going to jail.  Donald Trump retweeted this.  And you can't hide behind.  retweets aren't endorsements when you're the president of the United States and you're forwarding this kind of nonsense.  Loyalty is dead for Donald Trump.  It doesn't matter how loyal you've been.  If you've been a bootlicking lapdog for Donald Trump like Bill Barr, it doesn't matter.  The moment you go against Donald Trump, you are cast aside.  You can order peaceful protesters tear gassed in the streets for Donald Trump.  But as soon as you verify a fact that goes against his fantasy land, you are cast aside.  Here's another one.  from Trump about the governor of Georgia.  What a fool Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia is.  Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way.  Demand this clown call a special session and open up signature verification now.  Otherwise, could be a bad day for two great senators on January 5th.  Here's another one.  Again, here's another one from, about the Supreme Court.  that ruled against him, another body that ruled against Donald Trump, that there was no voter fraud, that these 59 of 60 lost lawsuits in the courts relative to this election from Donald Trump's team, one of them, it was in the Supreme Court, his Supreme Court, the 6-3 conservative majority.  that said to pound sand, get lost, nothing to see here.  The fact that the Supreme Court wouldn't find standing in an original jurisdiction matter between multiple states and including the President of the United States is absurd.  It is enumerated in the Constitution.  They just chickened out and didn't want to rule on the merits of the case.  so bad for our country.  They just chickened out.  The five-time physical coward, draft-dodging coward says people chickened out.  The weakling, loser Donald Trump is saying that the Supreme Court as a whole chickened out.  Chickened out about what?  What are they afraid of?  They have lifetime appointments.  They don't face re-election.  What do they have to be chicken of?  Donkey, you dipshit.  Anyway, rest assured Donald Trump will leave the White House.  He's not leaving public life.  He's been raising hundreds of millions of dollars through his PAC.  under the guise of fighting this election in the courts, which they're not most, the vast majority, maybe 75% of that money is going to Donald Trump and political contributions, which he will remain rich because of.  Anyway, I'd love to know what you think about all this.  Don't worry.  Tell me if you're worried.  You can put it in the comments, have a conversation in the comments.  You can leave me a voicemail, 714-576-4054.  Of course, you can email me daily at dollamore.com.  I read every single email.  I listen to every voicemail.
