The complexity and the diversity of life spread as changes in DNA resulted in changes in those entities.  At some point, the egg-laying offspring became a thing.  And that's led into whether those eggs stay inside for the duration and gestate with a soft thing in the way of humans and many others and have those animals that give live birth.

And when you are calling in to prove that a God exists, and your argument is essentially, Matt, you know there's a God, you're just denying it, then you're not only a coward, but you are massively confused about the way evidence works, and you are pretending that you can read my mind.  Because as I asked you, you seem to think that I witnessed the divine in the same way that you did.  And now I'm just denying it when that is simply not true.  So maybe stop pretending you can read people's mind.  And if you're going to actually call someone a name or make an accusation that they are dishonest, perhaps go ahead and do it in a forthright manner, as I did when I called you a coward.  And now I'm hanging up.  Goodbye, Kia.  I'm not gonna sit here and let someone call me a liar and pretend that they know what's going on in my head more than I do.  It's just not gonna fucking happen. ",
