And Pad Pop is here with some of your favorite creators.  Because let's face it, I got some bad news.  Shocker!  But our channel is on the verge of being taken down.  Apparently, YouTube doesn't like it when people tell the truth and they reinforce it with facts and sources.  At 9.05, May 10th, our episode, Name Redacted, 1984, was taken down.  And why?  Because we violated their precious nebulous community guidelines.  African American gentlemen, please, this is YouTube's version of Best Interest of a Child.  Both terms are used to ignore laws and violate your constitutional rights.  Strangely, we didn't get a strike until we appealed it.  Didn't this happen to a couple of doctors in California recently?  I think I can smell shite.  Seven hours later, in the middle of the night, the appeal was rejected.  How social-crat of you, you bunch of goddamn snowflakes.  We can't upload now for two weeks, which means all our videos are now alt-tech exclusive.  And that's why you're watching me on someone else's channel and not Redonkulous' channel.  But... If you really think the popster's going down without a knockdown drag out fight, you're out of your goddamn mind.  Of course I'm in a fucking fight.  we have an asymmetrical warfare plan for this channel moving forward.  phase one we are demonetizing the entire channel.  well most of the ads they put on there are stupid.  and number two if you can turn off the thermal sight it's harder to shoot you in the dark.  And if you want to help us fight against all of this censor... You see what I did there?  Now it's more important than ever.  Go to redonkulous.com slash donate and help us survive this fight.  And if you want to see our content moving forward, alt tech links in the description.  And please, subscribe to them all.  Because phase two... We are blowing the ballast tanks and we are going to dive, run silent, and run deep.  Kind of like I ran through your mama last week.  We are going to be privatizing any videos that we think YouTube can use against us.  This number could be extensive.  It could be 20.  It could be 500.  We don't know.  But redonkulous.com will be celebrating Throwback Thursday on our alt tech channels.  Every Thursday we're going to put up one of our older episodes and link it on all of our social media.  Phase three!  It doesn't look right, does it?  We've been working on a contingency plan?  But I'm not going to tip my hand just yet.  We'll release that info when we deem it is safe.  Phase four.  Pretty good movie.  When we're allowed to release again on YouTube, it's just going to be very, very short previews.  For the next three months, YouTube is going to be a glorified notification tool.  Because if they're going to f*** with me, I refuse to let them make money off of it.  Just saying.  After the three month mark, we will re-evaluate the plan and decide if we wish to continue as a notification or go back to business as usual.  With all the bullshit that's happened, there are two things in the forefront of my mind.  Number one, I'm not surprised this is happening.  And number two, it's only going to make me stronger.  Bottom line, YouTube is some censor shit.  Love and fools.  Gee.  I wonder where they got that.  Space Ghost.  You ever try to watch Space Ghost like this?  Kinda funny.  They want to censor this old army grunt who served his country for 33 years because they're afraid of the truth.  Spoiler alert, you mother fornicators.  I'm still going to get the truth out there with you or without you.  I was content with you making money off me.  But remember, you wanted this boogaloo.  And now you're going to get it.  How many times do you think you can do this before it backfires?  How many people can you censor before you drive your audience to your competition?  And I know I'm not PewDiePie, but guess what?  It has already begun.  You might think BitChute is just a pimple on the ass of humanity, but you just wait till they get a mobile app and then you're gonna be fucked.  With that being said, I want to give thanks to all the creators that are helping us get this video out.  Please show them some love with a like and a subscribe.  With that being said, we actually have to film a whole other episode.  I gotta refill this menagerie and watch me some Space Ghost. ",
