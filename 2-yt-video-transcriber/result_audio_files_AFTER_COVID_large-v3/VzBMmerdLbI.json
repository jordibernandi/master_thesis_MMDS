            "text": "All right, guys.  We got one being towed over here.  63rd Street in Maine.  All right.  Looks like he's having one toad.  I guess they arrested the guy.  He's stealing this SUV.  I just saw a vehicle pull out, probably with whoever they arrested.  Damn, I drove by this and I didn't see any lights here.  So this happened quickly.  Got unit.  1852.  They kidnapped the driver and the vehicle.  As I was pulling around the corner here, they were putting a guy in another vehicle.  And the tow truck came to tow this one away.  So this tow truck was here fast.  They're dragging it up there.  Thank you.  I don't know what this was about.  I don't know what the store called in or what.  There was two vehicles here.  And as I was getting out of my car, the one vehicle pulled away.  And the tow truck backed up to this vehicle and started hooking up to it.  Thank you.  I don't even know why anybody ever gets fuel here.  Might be just because it's a 76 and they have a 76 credit card.  Because the price is outrageous.  You can drive just half a mile down the road and get it for $2.09.  $2.09.  So they kidnapped this guy in this vehicle.  Good night, Mr.  White.  You being safe?  Careful when you walk out there, okay?  I don't need fucking instructions from you.  You're not supposed to even talk to me.  You're not supposed to say a word to me.  Yep.  And you noticed I didn't say a word back until you fucking barked an order, right?  I'm fucking 58 years old.  I've been walking since you were shit and yellow.  I've been walking since you were shit and yellow.  Your mama's titty milk.  Yeah, go do your fucking job.  Don't violate people's rights.  Be careful walking out there.  His ego, his ego just got to him.  He had to say something.  He had to bark in order and say something just to make himself feel better.  I don't understand it, guys.  All right, man.  I'm out here on 63rd Street in Maine.  We'll head to the next one.  I'm out. ",
