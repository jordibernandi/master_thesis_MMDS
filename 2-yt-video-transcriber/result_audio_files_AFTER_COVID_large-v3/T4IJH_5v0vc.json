You guys are unemployed.  You don't have a job.  Your economy's in tatters because Trump ruined it with his pandemic response.  You have all the free time in the world, and what you come up with is, I'm going to go drive around his bus.  Cool, man.  super creative way to go.  Nobody got hurt, which, you know, God bless you because anything can happen with these morons, right?  You got guys who are like, yo man, let's go drive around Joe Biden's bus.  Like, you know, they don't, they're not thinking like clearly, right?  I don't even want to try to get into the psyche of these guys, but it's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing for us as Americans.  It's sure as hell is embarrassing for, for Texans.  Um, It's also a reminder that Joe Biden is in Texas, right?  That Democrats think they can turn Texas blue, which is huge.  We have a precinct in Texas.  that's reporting.  it's got over 700,000 early ballots.  A lot of those are from young people.  They say that around this time, it's about 100,000 ballots, right?  90 million people across the country have already cast their ballots.  These Trump trolls only have a few more days of trolling before it's over.  So they got to squeeze the juices, you know?  And this is them squeezing juices.  Like, I'm going to go drive around that tour bus.  Cool, guys.  Cool. ",
