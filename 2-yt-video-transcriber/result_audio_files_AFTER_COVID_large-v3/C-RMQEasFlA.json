            "text": "Hi.  I want to talk to you today about the ethical problems facing international businesses.  Globalization presents a lot of challenges.  Political challenges, economic challenges, cultural challenges, and ethical challenges.  Those are the things I want to talk about today.  A multinational corporation faces some unique moral conflicts, some unique dilemmas that require creative ethical thinking.  Now some of these are ones that one could encounter in a domestic sphere but usually in a less intense form.  Globally we face these problems in a much more severe way and to some extent there are political differences and other kinds of differences that present unique challenges of their own.  So let's talk about where some of these things come from.  When a company that is primarily based in one nation locates branches for example in another nation or starts working with companies in its supply chain in another country, or actually takes on a multinational character of its own and starts viewing itself as not really a company in one country with a station, an outpost as it were, in another country, but instead really as being multinational in its very essence.  It has to face a number of different problems.  For one thing, it's dealing with a lot of different political systems.  different economic systems, different legal systems.  There is not one framework, politically, economically, legally, that it's coping with.  It's in many different frameworks at once.  That presents problems.  In addition to that, there are differences in cultural norms, in values.  And sometimes the values of people in that culture, in that other nation, as expressed sometimes in legal codes and governance systems, but sometimes simply as expressed informally.  in terms of cultural norms and values, those things may come into conflict with corporate norms and values.  It might turn out, for example, that in that culture there are practices and there are values, there are attitudes, that are simply inconsistent with the attitudes the company brings into the country.  They may be incompatible with the corporate mission, and so that presents special challenges.  But even if it's not exactly a practical problem in the sense of interfering with the mission, it may interfere with the company's values.  There may be values in that culture that are incompatible with corporate values.  What do you do about that?  Do you cling to your own values, even if the cost of that is not doing business in that country?  Do you adapt yourself and adopt the practices and values of that country?  It's a difficult question and sometimes one has to face real moral choices there.  There is a real conflict and it's not at all obvious which direction you should go.  So one of the things we're going to be trying to do this week is sort out some of those questions, understand where they're coming from, and how to go about thinking about them.  What norms should multinational corporations conform to?  What should they use in governing their own decisions about such moral choices?  Here are some examples of divergences between at least standard American values and practices and those that might be encountered in other countries.  There may be different expectations about the employment relationship itself.  In the United States, we typically have something like Well, a series of models that we use, and a variety of them that might take place, just as no individual real-world relationship is likely to manifest and satisfy just one of the kinds of relationship we've discussed.  in terms of relationship regulation theory, it's also true that often corporations have a mix of models.  Nevertheless, a company that has a strong authority ranking type model moving into a culture where the expectation is communal, for example, is going to face problems.  They have a hierarchy that has a rather rigid format.  People in that culture working for the company expect it to be much more family-like.  How does one reconcile those kinds of problems?  It's not just a question of models of corporate governance or, for that matter, a question of the employment relationship.  There are a variety of other things.  What are the expectations about equal treatment?  What forms of discrimination are acceptable or unacceptable in that country?  In the United States, we tend to rule out discrimination on the basis of a wide array of factors.  In other countries, those may not be the case.  There may be a strong practice of discrimination on the basis of sex, for example, or race or ethnicity within that country.  And so what does one do when one faces an environment like that?  There may be very different expectations about working conditions, about expectations of performance on the job.  Some cultures are highly driven and expect people to work overtime.  Others, it's hard to get them to work the assigned hours.  People in that culture often have reduced working hours, or sometimes one moves into a culture where There is, for example, a pattern of work in the mornings, then a long siesta after a large meal, and then work into the evenings.  That can be disruptive when people have to be in communication with people here in the United States who work much more of an eight to five type of pattern.  And so a variety of issues come up that you might not expect and don't initially look like ethical issues at all, simply a difference of cultural norms and practice.  There isn't really a right or wrong about many of these things, but a company facing those differences has to make certain choices.  Now, sometimes, of course, there is a real ethical dimension.  It may be that some of the employment practices one finds in that country, especially among, say, subcontractors in your supply chain, really are ethically repugnant to you.  And so those present special challenges.  A lot of countries, for example, have forced labour.  A lot of countries feature widespread corruption.  Standard practice is bribery in order to get a contract, in order to get government permission to do anything.  There can be complications that arise there.  Sometimes in order to do business in a country, you simply have to do things that would be unethical and even illegal in the United States.  One of the difficulties here arises from the different perspectives that have to be reconciled in conducting the affairs of a multinational corporation.  I'm going to take as a paradigm case the situation where a company whose business is primarily in more advanced, industrialized countries has some operations in a less developed country.  There are all sorts of divisions there that are intensified beyond those you would find in another more advanced, more developed country.  So, for example, one might face not only a very different legal system, but a legal system that is relatively undeveloped, where a lot of questions that are decided in the legal systems of the United States, for example, or Western Europe, are simply left open there.  They're a matter of informal agreement.  There is no expected or agreed upon legal code at all governing that kind of arrangement.  That can be difficult.  How does a contract become enforced in that kind of setting?  The expectations of each party may be fundamentally different.  In addition to that, within a country, one might face a variety of different perspectives itself.  There may well be a government agency with which one has to deal.  It may have a highly regulated economy and you have to in some way get permission to operate in the company.  That may require bribery.  It may require undertaking actions that would look like corruption or at least a kind of undue influence in the United States.  What about questions of employment there?  It may be that one has to engage in practices that, again, in the United States would seem unsavory.  But not only does one have the perspective, you might say, of individual government employees, as well as government agencies as a whole, One then does have the perspective of the people who one's going to hire, the potential employees.  You have the perspectives of the customers.  You have perspectives of people within that country who are operating already in business, your competitors or your suppliers.  And those are all perspectives that have to be combined.  They may be quite different.  Sometimes class divisions in other countries are much more marked than they are in the United States or Western Europe.  And so you may find that that the expectations of government officials and the expectations of customers, suppliers, of your employees are very different from those that are being imposed from the top.  Those people may come from very different social classes.  They may even be of different ethnicities.  They may not see the world in similar ways at all.  There are a variety of other issues that arise there.  There may be radical differences in wage scales, for example.  In fact, often multinational corporations locate some operations in other countries precisely because there's a cost advantage to doing that.  They can get the same work done at lower wages, paying lower wages.  However, what that means is that a company can come in and pay wages that look exploitative from the point of view of more developed countries, but may actually be above the market average for that less developed country.  Does that count as exploitation?  Some people think of that as in some way morally questionable itself.  Others respond, no, look, you're offering people opportunities they would not otherwise have.  You're improving the situation of your employees, even though, of course, you'd have to pay much more for that work in the United States.  And so that kind of difference can present problems of its own.  There are also environmental questions that arise.  Environmental regulations are quite stringent in the United States and in Europe, but in less developed countries, often they're much less stringent.  What are one's obligations to the environment?  To the exploitation of resources, for example.  There is one kind of code we have in the United States and other developed countries.  In less developed countries, does one apply the same standards, or does one try to adapt to the standards of that country that may be far looser than those in the United States?  What about the perspective of employees?  After all, you should think something about what is going to make the job not only attractive to them, but ethically acceptable from your point of view as well as from theirs.  There can be all sorts of different perspectives there that have to be sorted out.  Among them are, to what extent do you view this as a question of developing employees there?  Are you taking employees from that home? ",
