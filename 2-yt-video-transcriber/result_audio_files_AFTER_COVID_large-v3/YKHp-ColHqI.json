Chris Marcus here with you for Arcadia Economics in a wild time in the financial markets and fortunate to be joined by a good friend of mine, Bill Murphy of Gatta and LaMetropole Cafe, who's going to dig into some of the wild action we've seen in the metals, both gold and silver, the stock market.  I don't know, maybe you've solved coronavirus too.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Is there anything Bill can't do?  But it's a pleasure to have you here, especially Bill, because we have begun the Big Silver Short Countdown.  That's the book that I am releasing, which you were a part of, which I'm quite grateful for.  And I think folks will certainly appreciate as in these trying times in gold and silver.  So great to have you on here again today.  And how is everything going, sir? ",

It's just all debasement and you're going to have the gold and silver prices go nuts.

This was before the coronavirus.  That's why the gold was making its move and recently hit 1,700. and they just don't have it.  And what they're doing now is sort of a last gasp in the futures market to try to get the price down, but they're gonna be overwhelmed and you're gonna see gold goes nuts.  and then, silver is so cheap relative to gold.

Although it's interesting, we've heard people talk for years about the paper market and the physical market decoupling.  And so far, we've not had the stock markets close.  I think that did actually happen for a couple of days after September 11th.  and people have been rumoring that it could be closed, which is interesting because should the COMEX be closed and you actually want silver and there's no COMEX trading with these premiums that you've mentioned right now.  In fact, if you have physical silver, your price actually is higher.  So there's, it seems like the degree to which we're seeing a decoupling already. ",

You see down here, it looks like it was about $14.70-ish and got as high as $15.40.  And we've seen some odd divergences on, you know, for years, these are always trading together.

Now that open interest is coming way down as they cover their positions and rip off the speculative longs, which they just did.  And silver went from what?  1718 down to 12.  So it's about ending.  And I don't know what will happen as we move up again, but I wouldn't be surprised if JP Morgan, who has won for nine years in a row, just doesn't let it go again.  and So they made their fortune, so what?  And they can't do anything about the gold price because the physical supply is gone.  They're probably gonna reset the prices.  People talk about that.  But gold and silver are gonna go bonkers to the upside. ",

As I've thought about what might happen if there were a gold reset before that happened, you'd sure think that some of these conditions would be along those lines.  And perhaps the last one to wrap up with here is, We saw what was really stunning to me.  We saw what the Fed did.  It's almost like by the day trying a new move and it's like, oh, we'll toss a trillion here.  If it doesn't work, we'll toss three trillion out on Thursday.  But especially to see how Sunday night the Fed did their play and then the market just got destroyed yesterday.  have you think we're reaching the point where the fed is kind of making itself irrelevant because if it's using its big bazooka and just getting laughed at i wonder i'm wondering if we've crossed the point of no return for the fed.  maybe we crossed that a couple decades ago but in a new level this week.  do you think?
