So I watched the full leaked George Floyd body-worn camera video of the incident leading up to his you-know-what.  Now, I have mixed emotions about this.  I'm not going to lie, man.  I have mixed emotions.  I can see it from his perspective and I can see it from the police perspective.  Let me start with his perspective.  Now, I think that it is reprehensible for people to be using drugs.  Clearly, the autopsy showed that he was on methamphetamine and fentanyl at lethal dosages.  That's exactly why he was acting the way he was acting.  But I do understand, because I have family members that are on drugs, currently on drugs, was on drugs, died from drugs, my stepfather died from a heroin overdose, so I understand what it's like to be around somebody or what it is like for people to be addicted to a substance.  And I believe that there is a level of compassion that could be had that can lead to a better outcome and a better situation.  Not saying the officers were right or wrong in this situation, but I can see that George Floyd is definitely struggling from some type of ingestment or he has ingested a lethal dosage of a drug that's causing him to be radical, causing him to be crazy, emotional, and unstable.  Now, that's his perspective.  Now, the police perspective.  I mean, what do you expect them to do?  They get to a gentleman who they don't know, who they have no reason to know, that has just committed a crime in a convenience store or in a place of business.  He's outside.  He's not complying at the beginning of the video.  He's not complying.  At one point, he didn't even show his hands.  The officer had to pull his gun out to threaten him to display his hands.  Now he's what we call passive aggressive.  That means that he's not overtly doing any action that's aggressive to the police officer like punching them, hitting them or whatever, but he's passively not following directions.  That is some of the most dangerous situations you can put yourself in or be in as a police officer.  When somebody's passively not complying, then they end up getting a weapon and then you hurt.  So they gave them commands.  I think I'm totally cool with that, 100%.  I never cursed on duty, so I don't really think that it's necessary to curse at people.  But if that's the way you conduct yourself, that's the way you conduct yourself.  It's not against the law.  I think that the officers did what they're supposed to do.  He was resisting arrest at the door when he was parked on the side of the road.  And you'll see the full video.  It's on Tatum Report.  You can go watch the full video.  Obviously, I can't play it here.  But you can see he was resisting arrest.  He wasn't complying.  He was incoherent.  He gets out of the car.  He's still incoherent.  He's not following directions.  He's up and down, emotionally here, emotionally there.  He gets to the patrol car.  He's resisting arrest.  He don't want to get in the car.  He's not making a statement and then moving with it.  He's inconsistently back and forth.  I don't want to get in the car.  I'm claustrophobic.  Well, I'm cool.  Well, you was... Totally fine in the driver's seat of that other vehicle.  Now you want to get in the back of a police car.  Now somehow you're claustrophobic.  You've been arrested several times before.  So he's having these emotional drama that the police officers are observing.  He's not complying.  He's not seeming to want to ever get in the car.  If they just let it go, he'll never get in the car.  Some people may think that, no, he would never get in the car.  He would make an excuse all the way to the end.  Now, when he was in the car, they put him in the car.  He kicks himself out of the car, tell them, I want to lay on the ground.  That's information that nobody's talking about.  He pretty much told the police officer that he would rather lay on the ground.  So they laid him on the ground, not against his will, not malicious force, but they did what he felt he wanted to do because he was so noncompliant in the vehicle.  Now, obviously they called the paramedics to come and see him because they knew he was high on something.  Erratic behavior is very consistent with the way he was acting.  Now, that's the synopsis of the entire video.  But let me add something to the very end of this, which is a result of George Floyd dying that I think people aren't talking about it.  I spoke about it in my first video.  Let's talk about the excited delirium phenomenon.  now one of the officers who was a rookie matter of fact.  two officers were rookies and then there were two officers that were on the department longer than rookie status.  officer Chauvin who was the main police officer involved in this was on for several years over a decade so he has a lot of experience.  He was the lead police officer.  I think he was even the FTO of one of the young police officers.  So while he was on the ground having these experiences, when they called medical assistance, the younger officer alluded to, according to his lawyer, that George Floyd needed to be rolled to his side because he could be experiencing excited delirium.  Now, those of you who don't know what excited delirium is, it's pretty much when you get on an upper, a drug that's an upper, like methamphetamines, like fentanyl, and it gets your heart rate up.  You get very aggravated.  You get superhuman strength.  And then you begin to crash, kind of like a sugar crash.  You begin to crash all the way to the point that you die.  You never stop crashing.  You go into cardiac arrest.  It's called excited delirium.  They teach us in the academy way back in 2010.  I'm sure they've been teaching it all over the country.  That was a indication that George Floyd could have been experiencing excited delirium, which had nothing to do with the knee.  I'm not saying that that's the cause of it.  We'll find that in court.  But what I'm saying is that it possibly had nothing to do with the knee.  It had everything to do with the drugs he ingested, which caused him to crash and burn pretty much.  And I'm not trying to be offensive, but that's kind of the term that we use.  So those things are important to note.  On top of the video that you saw, on top of the response that the police had, and people don't know this, but I think it's invaluable to talk about this.  One of the officers did conduct CPR on George Floyd while he was in the back of the ambulance, waiting for them to hook up all the vital cords or whatever they had to do to treat him.  He was giving them chest compressions and CPR.  So the myth that nobody helped him, the myth that everybody should go to prison is that.  It's just a myth.  All the other officers, in my personal opinion, should not be held accountable for the knee and Officer Chauvin.  Now, Officer Chauvin is in a pickle because what he did visibly did not look appropriate.  I mean, as a former police officer, and I taught new officers how to become officers.  I was the FTO as well.  It does not seem to be appropriate.  When you got your knee on the man's neck, no matter how much pressure you're putting on him, you got to, at some point, you kind of got to play to the camera.  I don't know, I don't understand how police officers don't understand this.  You got to play to the camera to a certain degree.  You got to be communicating with him like, hey, man, look, I took my knee off of you, but you started acting up.  I'm putting my knee back on you because you're not.  Okay, I'll get off.  If you start moving, I'm going to go back on.  Play that game, even though you know it's bull crap.  Play the game.  so on Monday morning when people begin to evaluate you, at least it looks like you were attempting to Work with him instead of looking like you're just kneeling in the death.  Now, what I will say is that he's in a dilemma because he could be charged and he could not be charged and people aren't ready to entertain it.  If excited delirium type scenario occurred, he died from heavy doses of fentanyl and methamphetamines.  It's going to have nothing to do with Officer Chauvin's actions.  then he's not gonna get charged.  If they decide that Officer Chauvin's actions exacerbated, excited delirium, or exacerbated, he had a reason to know that it was causing the death of George Floyd, then he's gonna be in trouble.  But I think this video was very revealing.  It showed a lot of context to what was going on.  People like myself, Candace Owens, and others were already telling people that he had resisted, that it wasn't just an innocent black man doing nothing, crying for his mama.  It was a lot of other stuff involved.  Now, he was high on drugs, but they also had no reason to baby him and put a pacifier in his mouth and rub his back while he go to jail.  So I hope this video will give you some context.  TatumReport.com will have the full video.  You can watch this like eight minutes long.  You can go on there.
