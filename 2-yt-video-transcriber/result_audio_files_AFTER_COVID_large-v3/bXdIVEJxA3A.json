            "text": "All right, we talked about Biden, someone who's dirty and needs, God, I mean, he needs this soap.  He needs a lot of things.  He needs some intervention.  And there was an old article that, And the Gateway Pundit that came out, I think it was Cassandra Fairbanks who did it.  I don't have the name in front of me, but but she had written this article and there was a Secret Service agent who had spoken on, you know, anonymously with her and asserted that basically.  And this was a quote.  We had to cancel the VP Christmas get together at the vice president's house because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriends asses.  The annual party was for agents and Navy personnel who were tasked with protecting the Biden family.  Also quoted as saying he would mess with every single woman or teen.  It was horrible, the agent said.  So lots of reports about this.  And this jives, right?  You know, there's the Tara Reid stuff that made hardly any noise this year because he's a Democrat and he's running for president.  And God forbid there's an issue with the Me Too movement on the Democrat side.  So that kind of just went away.  But we've seen, I mean, even a CNN montage, which we'll show just quietly here in a second, we've seen Biden's creepy behavior around women.  There's no disputing it.  Regardless of what the motivation is behind it, I'm from a different era or a different time or whatever, it doesn't matter.  It's there.  We've all seen it.  There's literally... Maybe not hours, but there's a lot of footage worth of Joe Biden sniffing, smelling, groping, kissing, hugging inappropriately a bunch of women and young children who typically cry and have the foresight and the wisdom, even at that young age, to turn away from the creepy guy.  So according to a Secret Service agent, there's one that once got suspended for well before this article was written, back in 2009, after Biden cupped the Secret Service agent's wife's breast.  You don't do that to another, you don't do that to anyone that's not asking for it, and you certainly don't do it to another man's wife.  So I guess it happened at one of these parties that they eventually, fast forwarding ahead to the article, that's why they would stop having them, they would cancel them and were concerned about them, because this kind of behavior happened all the time.  But back in 2009, this happened, and the situation got so heated that there was actually some shoving, and people had to step in to prevent the agent from actually hitting the vice president.  Typically, you don't threaten the vice president or the president because that comes with a steep consequence.  But things do change when you all kind of know each other, you're hanging out and partying together, and then the vice president gropes your wife's chest.  Ridiculous.  You'd be holding me back, I can tell you that.  But additionally, the agent claims that Biden would walk around the VP resident naked at night.  Stark naked.  We've heard that.  We've heard about him swimming naked, right?  Again?  While you're naked, go ahead and scrub down with some of this Hero Soap Company soap.  It's amazing.  Um... But no, so this whole thing happened.  And while a lot of conversation happened at the time when this article came out about Biden's naked swimming, I got no problem with people swimming naked.  It's weird when you've got secret service agents and people on staff at your house.  But whatever, you do you at your own house.  But this agent was suspended.  And because he was, Tom Fitton and the folks over at Judicial Watch, who do an amazing job, put in a Freedom of Information Act request.  hoping that some paper trail would appear.  The problem was there wasn't a paper trail, which of course stopped them in their tracks.  But here's where it got interesting and where the double standards are alive and well, as they always are for the Democrats, is the Secret Service told Judicial Watch and Fitton that the file had been destroyed.  So you don't have access to it.  You can't get access to this file of Biden's getting in an altercation with a Secret Service agent after he allegedly groped the Secret Service agent's wife's breasts.  You can't get access to it because we destroyed it, which if you're a smart person, you understand, oh, but there was a file.  The file did exist.  So they failed to recognize that in their response back.  And that's what Judicial Watch and others have since said.  is you just admitted it by not showing it to us that it existed.  So there's something, we don't have all the details But it's interesting.  And what's so remarkable about it is everything you see, you see his other files that were locked away that you could not see, Biden's that is.  You see incidents like this.  You see incidents like Tara Reade.  You see the constant stuff that you see this like 18 second hug with Hillary Clinton that's playing on the screen.  The constant stuff that surrounds Joe Biden.  You see the health issues now.  You see so much and it all just should leave lots of questions in your head.  You shouldn't be saying, this is a good candidate.  This is the guy.  You shouldn't be saying that.  You shouldn't be saying that, and that's Democrat or Republican.  Again, I said at the very beginning, and I've reiterated several times, I thought he would have been the best candidate for them way back when, when all of this discussion of 2020 started.  And I was thinking about it for us, for conservatives, because he was the most moderate.  Yeah, he's creepy.  He's odd.  He's got lots of experience.  He's never accomplished anything, but he was more moderate.  Now, no matter what side you're on, you say, okay, well, he's gone further left because he wants the job so bad that he's radicalizing himself to keep the young bucks like AOC and the squad happy.  Keep people like Bernie who keeps getting screwed over by the DNC happy.  Keep Elizabeth Warren happy since she's depressed that she found out she's not actually Native American.  So he's gone that way, which should scare conservatives, should he win.  And then it should scare everyone that there's all of this information out there.  There's all of these reports out there that if this was on Donald Trump, if this was on any other GOP member for that matter, it would be all over.  the press talked about ad nauseum all day long.  But with Joe Biden, it's nowhere.  And he's the Democrat nominee for president of the United States of America.  And maybe there's a justifiable reason for it.  Maybe there's an answer to it.  I kind of tend to doubt it based on his track record, but maybe there is.  But we should at least know.  There should be conversation about it.  We should be able to know some of the facts, if not all.  All would be great, but we should know more and be able to come to better, more rational, logically-minded solutions and understandings of where we are on this candidate.  Again, left, right, center.  But it's not going to happen because there's two tiers.  Hillary Clinton shouldn't be able to do that interview that we showed you earlier in the show.  She should not still be a voice out there for the Democrat Party and for everything else she's involved with, the foundation, etc.  She broke multiple laws.  Her husband is a sleazebag.  And there's all sorts of new stuff being surfaced and talked about with him with regards to Epstein and visits to the island and this, that, and the other.  But they're untouchable.  Biden, Obama, untouchable.  I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of seeing all these stories come up.  We get a glance.  Some conservatives get spun up about it.  And you look at it and you want more information on it.  But then it gets squashed right away, goes away.  Let's dump out another fake story about how Trump did this or that to distract from this.  And I'm not saying that's exactly what's happening with this particular Biden story, because, again, it's an old story.  But people are remembering that it happened, that it was covered up.  And this is now, again, the guy that they're running to be president of the United States.  Could be your president. ",
