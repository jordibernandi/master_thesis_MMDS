            "text": "Welcome to Code Breakers.  My name is Danae Clement Petrushka, and I am Kim Clement's daughter.  Amidst global pandemic, quarantine, and crashing economies, the entire earth is about to witness a great outpouring of the spirit as we see more and more prophecies fulfilled.  One in particular that has caught the attention of the world at this time is the sudden disappearance of Kim Jong-un, the dictator and leader of North Korea.  Suddenly, I began to see and hear my father's name and his prophecies about North Korea all over the internet.  Being that I have full access to everything he prophesied about North Korea, I went back through the archives and pulled them all back up again and realized that it's time to look back at these and reevaluate what God was showing my dad.  What I saw above all is that these prophecies, all of them are ultimately about a united Korea and the fall of another dictator.  This is happening in a time where many in power who are corrupt are being exposed and dealt with.  We are seeing the truth begin to shine through no matter how hard darkness tries to hide it.  I began this Code Breakers with a prophecy from Portland, Oregon in 2009.  What caught my attention immediately was when my dad said, it shall happen even in the sun.  The sun is shining and blazing.  The event that brought about the suspicions about Kim Jong-un's health is when he missed his grandfather Kim Il-sun's birthday celebration.  This is the most important national holiday in North Korea and is called the Day of the Sun.  My dad saw that something would happen, even in the sun, and that North Korea would say, let us take a chance.  Knowing that, in the past, North Korea has hidden and lied about the deaths of their leaders.  In the case of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il, it took them almost two years before they admitted that he had died.  So in looking at this, knowing it would be considered blasphemous in North Korea to miss such an important event, why would Kim Jong-un not attend?  Let's have a look at what my dad prophesied on April 13th and 14th of 2012 from Nashville, Tennessee. ",

You will enter in and say, what has happened to the tyrants?  What has happened to them in North Korea?  What has happened to those that have said, we will raise up a generation of people that will not pronounce the name of God properly.  God says, they shall pronounce my name, every one of them.  They shall say shalom.  They shall say every name.  They shall say nishti.  They shall say every name of God.  And as they say it, I will pour out of my spirit upon the musicians and upon the authors and upon the poets.  God said, you are entering in beyond the veil, says the Lord.  God says, look at Korea, the miserable people.  pig that has stood and defied the nations of the earth.  And God says, you think I cannot dethrone you in North Korea?  Keep your eye open, God says.  Before the summer months you will say, look what's happening in North Korea.  And this shall be a sign to you that I am causing leaders that have wicked intentions to be brought down.  So, who will lead this nation?  Who shall I place at the helm?  God said, I've chosen myself.  Yes, I've chosen myself.  I, the Lord.  will change the hearts of the people in the station.  They will be declaring, enough is enough!  Enough is enough!  Enough is enough! ",

            "text": "As we enter the month of May, this appears to be another sign or indication that the season we are in could very well be the time when we see things set up for a united Korea.  I found it interesting also that we're all in speculation over the condition of Kim Jong-un as we go into May in the middle of a global pandemic.  And many are wondering if the COVID-19 virus will flare up again in the fall and winter.  And with so much else going on in the world, it appears things are beginning to align, especially since my dad prophesied to look to the month of May and then the month of October.  In a time where we are seeing more and more tyrants exposed, it's hopeful to know that God gave us a glimpse into the future many years ago, and that this year may have more victories than we expected, because it's already had more battles than we anticipated.  Another point to note is that on April 14th of 2012, my dad spoke very strongly against Kim Jong-un, and God showed him that before the summer months, we would be saying, look what's happening in North Korea, and that it would be a sign to us that God is causing wicked leaders to be brought down.  As we cry, enough is enough.  all over the world, God told us that he would be taking the reins.  Now the next prophecy I want to play for you is from September 15th of 2006 in Loveland, Colorado.  Now there was some confusion this past week with the prophecy, with this particular prophecy, where the date was circulated as September 15th, 2016, but that would have been impossible because my father never spoke publicly again after September 5th of 2015 and was unable to speak and very ill in September of 2016.  Now, this was a small error, but necessary to clarify and certainly unintentional.  Regardless, this is a powerful word from God.  So let's watch it now. ",

Kim, your days are numbered, says the Lord.  I'm speaking of the prime minister of North Korea.  God said, enough is enough.  I want a sound to come.  And God said, I will do it.  But the other shall be the stepping down of a prime minister of the lion of the nation of Great Britain.  For when he does this, says the Lord, it shall be a sign.  Not because he stepped down.  A sign that something shall advance.  Something shall advance out of Great Britain.  Something shall advance, says the Spirit of God, from the United States. ",

With all of the suspicions as the ruler of North Korea has disappeared amidst speculations that he is dead or dying, perhaps in a vegetative state, it is also interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Theresa May, resigned her position on July 24th of 2019.  Are these the two signs my dad was seeing back in 2006?  My only reservation is that when he prophesied about the Prime Minister of Great Britain stepping down, he said he, not she.  So I think this is something we should keep our eyes on and pray about.  The headline that got my attention concerning Kim Jong-un that I saw everywhere this past week is that he is a vegetable in a vegetative state.  And I remember God showing my father that on April 4th of 2009.  So let's watch that clip now. ",

We pray for the people of North Korea who have suffered under this cloud of separation and deceit, and that God can bring about unity in Korea so that his light will shine from there again.

And this is what it says.  You are praying, says the Spirit of God.  And as you pray, at this very moment, there is coming a sound from South Korea, a sound of prayer warriors.  And as you are standing on this ground in Los Angeles, in South Korea at this very moment, there is a prayer movement that has been going on for years.  But now it has been struck with a fresh baptism and a fresh fire.  Yes, I have taken your prayers.  I have interlocked your prayers with South Korea, and God says it's too late.  It's too late, little Kim.  It's too late.  South Korea has prayed now, and because they have prayed, I will abolish the control and the witchcraft, and I will abolish every desperate move because I have linked your prayers, and it shall be done, says the Lord.  Now, as Christians in this time, as the people of Christ, one thing I know that we need to be doing right now, as so many signs appear to be emerging, is that we need to be praying with the Christians in South Korea.  We may not be able to go there physically, but we can pray.  And these prophecies are pointing to the uniting of the Koreas, and we have a part to play in that.  We will stand with our brothers and sisters in Christ throughout the earth, And God's will, not the will of man, not the plans of the enemy, but that God's will be done.  So I want to thank you for joining me today for this Code Breakers on North Korea, the uniting of the Koreas and the exposure of corruption worldwide.  And don't forget, we have declared this year our year of victory.  And so early in the year, we have already faced so many battles, but we can't have the victory without the battles.  So we declare victory over our families and our lives, our destiny, and over the nations of the earth, because the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.  Get ready to hear his name reverberate throughout the earth.  And as always, I'll keep you updated as we get more information.  Please feel free to email me at codebreakers at houseofdestiny.org.  And remember, there has never been a time where we needed to pray more than now.  I'm Donna A. Clement-Petrushka.  Thank you for joining me for another Code Breakers. ",
