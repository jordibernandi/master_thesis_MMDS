            "text": "The Lord of hosts says to the remnant warriors, the triumphant reserve.  I said it is finished, not I am finished.  I am not finished.  Finished redemption for sins on the cross, but I am not done.  I am not done with my church.  No, I will now finish building my church.  It will be glorious.  It will be without spot or wrinkle.  It will reign in my name.  It will not be intimidated scared or confused Bewildered tepid or spineless.  I am not done.  I'm not near done.  I i've got much to finish and i will now finish it.  i have saved the best wine for your times.  i will now finish the releasing of outpouring after outpouring after outpouring after outpouring of my power and anointing revealed in my manifest presence.  the world will now see my power manifestly revealed on my triumphant reserved.  my glory will become demonstrably real in your times from glory to glory to glory to glory.  I'm not finished.  I'm not finished says the Lord.  I'm not finished healing blind eyes.  I'm not finished opening deaf ears.  I'm not finished restoring crippled limbs.  I'm not done reaping the harvest of the end of the age.  I'm not finished saving the lost, setting the oppressed free, or delivering captives.  I'm not done penetrating the nations with the gospel.  I'm not done with alcoholics.  I'm not done with drug addicts.  I'm not done delivering the bound.  I'm not done removing lust and perversion from those who are wounded, broken, and lost.  I'm not finished with abortion.  I am far from finished.  I'm not finished, says the Lord, with America.  I'm not finished with this world.  I'm not finished with my kingdom on this earth, which means you're not finished.  My church is not finished.  My ecclesia will now bind hell.  My ecclesia is not done binding hell.  It is not done standing for my word without compromise.  It is not done confronting demon doctrine.  It is not done confronting rebel government.  It is not done confronting rebel kings.  dictators, presidents, and evil dignitaries.  My reigning church is not done prevailing over the gates of hell.  It is not done promoting righteousness that will exalt a nation.  It is not done preaching my word without compromise.  It is not done prevailing over principalities and powers and mights and dominions.  It is not done salting the earth, lighting up darkness, reversing evil laws, treading on demons, preaching hope, preaching deliverance to the captives.  It is not done reaping my harvest of lost men and women, boys and girls.  It's not done discipling a nation.  My church isn't done when the government says it's done.  It's not done when the president says it's done.  It's not done.  when the media says it's done.  It's not done.  when professors say it's done.  It's not done.  when the IRS says it's done.  It's not done.  when hireling shepherds say it's done.  It's not done.  when the Supreme Court says it's done.  It's done.  when I say it's done and I say you're not done.  Occupy till I come.  Take care of my business.  It is finished, but I'm not finished.  Focus on what I say and let that settle the issue. ",
