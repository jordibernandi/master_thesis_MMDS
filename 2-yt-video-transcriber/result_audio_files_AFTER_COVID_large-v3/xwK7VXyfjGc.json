She says, I really ended up enjoying the first season.  I have some disappointing news to share with you.  That doesn't mean the season won't be very enjoyable, and it doesn't mean all hope is lost for season three.  So what's the bad news?  What's the bad news?  Why is that?  Well, that's because while filming season two, Pedro Pascal really wanted to have some scenes with his helmet off.  This is Randolph about the division between Pascal and the Mandalorian creative team.  Now, before we get into that, this is like a Hollywood thing.  Like, you ever wonder in these superhero movies why Robert Downey Jr.  is seen most of the time with the Iron Man mask off?  or you see him inside the... The suit, it's because it's a branding thing.  It might actually be in the clause.  I think it was in, I think I remember reading it was in Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man contract.  It could have been him or somebody else that he had to be out of the mask.  So people were like, why does his mask always get shredded?  Why is he?
