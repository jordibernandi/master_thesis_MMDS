I decided to come out to Blanchardstown to meet Pat Quinlan and help him do his petition to have Roderick O'Gorman, the Minister for Children, removed from his position and get him to resign.  I decided to give him a hand and we're out here and we've had an amazing response at the doorsteps here in Blanchardstown.  I would say at least 9 out of 10 people are quite happy to sign this petition to have this man removed.  So I think it's great work that he's been doing and I'm delighted to help out.  So Pat, how are you feeling? ",

            "text": "Absolutely fantastic, to say the least.  When I started on this endeavor, I didn't think I'd be getting that much of a positive response.  I thought people would just think all sorts, being honest.  I wasn't really sure what people would think of the party or what I'm doing trying to get rid of Roderick because there's a lot of other voices in that arena and they just kind of like bat you down with every type of word they can.  But what I'm finding the more and more I go to the doors and the more and more you actually chat to people and just break it down why you want them gone.  Children at the age of 16 being able to change the agenda.  No opposition to the RSE sex education.  Won't fully disavow Peter Tatchell.  And then recently, he's after making it easier for any Tom, Dick and Harry to foster a child.  It's been received with welcome arms.  Yesterday, out of 200 houses, we got 178 signatures.  That tells you where the people of Dublin West stand with this man.  They don't like his policies and they want them gone.  And I want him gone as well, and I'll be here for help until the end of time, collecting signatures until he's gone.  But thanks very much as well for coming out.  No bother.  And it's been great as well, just in general, the party membership, being able to help and come out whenever they could. ",
