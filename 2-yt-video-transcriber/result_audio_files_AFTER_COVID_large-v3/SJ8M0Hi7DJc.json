Because here's the thing, and here's what we don't realize, right?  Because it's gone on for so long, it is literally embedded in people's subconscious, right?  So that's why I ask you that question, because if you can step outside of yourself and any personal biases and weigh the possibility that there's something subconsciously that white supremacy has played a role in your relationship, right?  Because me personally, I think that anybody who's not white Man, woman, child, any nationality that deals with a white person, it is purely based off of white supremacy, right?  I'll explain why, right?  I'll explain why 100%.  Now, it could be the attraction is based on white supremacy.  That might not mean what you are attracted to, right?  You might not just think, oh, look at this white man.  He's just white.  He's great, right?  That might not be it.  But there's other advantages, right?  Because naturally, women want certain things out of a man, correct?  Naturally, every woman wants a man that, you know, takes care of himself and, you know, has certain economic advantages and things of that nature.  And these people that put themselves in the position to be best suited for these types of things and systemically lock other groups of people, specifically your people, specifically the men of your people, out of those types of positions, right?  Not saying it's impossible, not saying people don't do it, people do it, but they go out of their way to systemically inhibit it at all costs, right?  So they literally, through their supremacist system, put themselves at such a high advantage.  And I'm going to explain how it plays a role in your relationship.  How he's able to recognize these qualities in you is because he, being who he is, has a different perspective on life than your brother might have.  Your brother might be looking at things more different or more pessimistically because the hand that he's been dealt in life versus him more optimistically and more observantly because the hand that he's been dealt in life.
