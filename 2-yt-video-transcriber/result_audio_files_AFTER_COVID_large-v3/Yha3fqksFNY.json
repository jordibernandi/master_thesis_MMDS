            "text": "Two top Democrats in Illinois at the center of a major corruption investigation have now spent millions on legal fees according to new campaign finance records.  Big update on some more bad news for Democrats in Illinois, the latest after a series of FBI raids we've been continually following on this channel.  Mentioned in previous videos how many of these Democrats arrested for corruption have close ties to House Speaker Michael Madigan, an influential establishment Democrat who directly endorsed Barack Obama.  One of the many previous big scandals involving Madigan includes the time he and Rahm Emanuel decided to steal $100 million from taxpayers to give to Obama for his Obama Museum.  They attempted to give away this money in violation of the rules of the Illinois House of Representatives, which states that a committee cannot vote on a measure unless the proper posting requirements have been met and a quorum is present.  And yet another major related update happening this week as a federal judge imposes court oversight on a Cook County clerk who is also a close political ally of Madigan.  Democrat Alderman Ed Burke's Chicago offices were raided by FBI agents back in November of 2018, one of the first in this series of FBI raids which continued throughout last year.  There's another picture here of Ed Burke with Michael Madigan.  Recent article from an NBC affiliate in Chicago points out that since the beginning of 2019, Burke has spent over $1.1 million to a variety of law firms, state records show, and he is hardly alone.  Legal fees for House Speaker Michael Madigan top Burke's.  In that same period, records show that Madigan has spent $1.7 million in legal fees.  So this investigation, which has already included multiple FBI raids and led to several arrests, is being led by John Lausch, the U.S.  attorney for Chicago that was picked by President Trump.  Some key points in an article from October of last year as this investigation was escalating.  That article opened saying, and grabbed boxes and laptops from suburban town halls.  Later on in the same article, they add that to consider just how low-key Lausch has chosen to be, think of it this way, when he indicted the longest-serving alderman in Chicago history, the one who essentially ran city council as head of the finance committee, Lausch didn't even hold a press conference.  Now that's restraint, they say.  Mainly, Lausch is letting high-profile public evidence gathering and quietly filed subpoenas speak for themselves.  Looking more at one of the most recent related updates, a federal judge has just imposed court oversight on Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough, an ally of Democrat House Speaker Michael Madigan.  A new article from the Chicago Sun-Times with the title, Judge Orders Oversight of Yarbrough's Office, Finding Patronage Violations in Proper Use of Political Considerations.  The Cook County clerk says she'll appeal the decision from a federal judge who found Yarbrough disregarded a series of orders aimed at curbing political considerations in hiring for government jobs.  Yarbrough has called the allegations preposterous and outrageous, while her lawyers have suggested it seems apparent plaintiff's issue is not with the office, but the office holder.  Yarbrough told the Chicago Sun-Times last fall that the complaints were purely personal, but wouldn't directly say why, though she noted, quote, \"...I'm the first woman and the first African-American in this  position.\".  On Friday, the judge ordered court oversight for more than a year in a 44-page decision.  The judge ticked off concerns that Yarbrough disregarded requirements to post jobs, failed to get court approval for various ranking positions, favored people with political pedigrees, and tried to make some workers miserable by assigning them to far-flung suburban offices.  The judge ordered a monitor to oversee hiring in the county clerk's office through August of 2021 and said he will determine then whether that should stay in place longer.  In response, Yarbrough says that she completely disagrees with the ruling and, quote, will be appealing our complex argument to a more appropriate legal venue.  Yarbrough said that she plans to take up the matter with the U.S.  Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  Same article also notes that this is the second county office that Yarbrough has led to be engulfed in charges of putting politics over fair play.  The judge noted Yarbrough held the smaller office of recorder of deeds for six years and couldn't shake free of a monitor due to numerous allegations of quote unlawful political discrimination before she was elected clerk in 2018.  The clerk's and recorder's offices are set to combine in December after voters approved a merger referendum several years ago.  That's another cause for concern, the judge said.  What is significant is that under her tenure as recorder, the office did not approach substantial compliance with federal court orders, the judge said, adding that the recorder's office, quote, still has some distance to travel to meet the standard.  Yarbrough, an ally of Democrat House Speaker Michael Madigan, the state party chairman, said that she is focused on putting in place innovative ideas that would improve her office's presence on the internet.  I have to move on, Yarbrough said.  I've got bigger fish to fry right now.  One more recent related article just from this past week pointing out that Michael Madigan, the Illinois House Speaker, has now spent more than $462,000 from campaign funds with a law firm that employs former Chicago Mayor, fellow Democrat Richard Daley.  Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan's main campaign fund paid nearly $462,000 in legal fees in the first three months of 2020 to a law firm that employs former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.  New campaign finance records show federal investigators over the past year have raided the homes of two close Madigan associates.  reports late last year that four people have been interviewed as part of an ongoing corruption probe had been asked questions about the speaker and his political operation.  Article adds that as of right now, Madigan himself has not been charged with any wrongdoing.  Last fall, he told reporters at the state capitol that he is, quote, not a target of anything.  Another quote reads that the fee's represent legal counsel engaged over the past year to monitor ongoing investigations.  Madigan's spokeswoman wrote in an email late Wednesday adding that the speaker's status with respect to any probe remains unchanged and he expects to continue to engage counsel to monitor the situation and provide counsel until investigations conclude.  Madigan's spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the emailed statement and wouldn't say whether Daly, who joined the firm after leaving office in 2011, was involved in representing Madigan.  Just a few of the recent events leading into this, some we've mentioned here already, including previous reports on how the FBI has recorded phone calls of Michael McClain, a former lawmaker and close confidant of Madigan and Commonwealth Edison lobbyist who retired in 2016.  Federal authorities raided McClain's Quincy home in May.  Around the same time, agents raided the home of former Chicago alderman Mike Zalowski and former Madigan political operative Kevin Quinn, the brother of 13th Ward alderman Marty Quinn.  Federal agents also sought records related to ComEd and four unnamed Exelon officials, among a host of other materials during a September raid on the Capitol office of State Senator Martin Sandoval, according to a search warrant.  The Chicago Democrat's daughter, Angie Sandoval, works for ComEd.  Sandoval has already pleaded guilty to bribery, back in January, and has agreed to cooperate in a corruption probe that spans from Chicago City Hall to suburban village halls to the State House.
