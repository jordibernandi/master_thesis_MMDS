Joining us, retired Los Angeles Police Department Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey.  Sergeant Dorsey started with the LAPD in 1980.  She worked in patrol and specialized units, including gangs.

Adam served as a police officer for 30 years.  He oversaw homicide cases, robberies, special victim units, and a gun assault team.  And he's the former Assistant Police Academy Director.  Lots of experience, lots of knowledge.  Let's get to our first story tonight.  We've got this video.  It comes to us from the Phoenix Police Department.  And this is a man pretending to have a gun.  Let's take a look. ",
