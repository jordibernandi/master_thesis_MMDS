It blows your mind.  You need to hear the whole thing.  Incredible.  And that's just one of his predictions.  It's an incredible, we got footage, we got pictures, we got diagrams.

But first of all, NASA is saying that potentially hazardous asteroid is going to skim by the Earth so close, way closer than the moon is to the Earth, flying at an insane 18,253 miles an hour.  NASA's reported this asteroid will become dangerously close and is a near-Earth object of dangerous warning.  Now, this is the thing about.  the name of the asteroid is 2011 ES4, and Heidi brought this up a week ago, and nobody was paying any attention, and now people are starting to pick it up.  While the size and speed may be somewhat normal, the asteroid flying by this close to the Earth is insane.  This thing is way too close.  Is Doomsday September 1st?  Is September 1st, 2020 Doomsday?  No, not according to the Mayan elders who've come back and said, no, no, no, no.  The winter solstice, December 21st, 2020, my birthday.  December 21st, 2020, my birthday.  The Mayan elders says it's gonna be the end of the world.  Based on their calculations, they say they were eight years off.  And it also so happens to be the grand conjunction.  That's when Saturn and Venus gets, I mean, excuse me, Saturn and Jupiter gets so close together.  They get within 0.1 degree that they look like, they come together so close that it looks like one huge star, which will be brighter than the star of Bethlehem when Jesus first came to the world.  And it won't do this again.  It won't even get this close for 500 years.  The last time it even got close to this, wasn't even this close, 1623.  Is this the end of the world?  It's the winter solstice.  Okay, December 21st, 2020.  It's the grand conjunction, Jupiter and Saturn, 0.1 degree.  It causes the brightest star in the sky since the star Bethlehem.  The Mayans say it's the end of the world.  And it's my birthday, which you know is apocalyptic.  So are we talking about... So my question is, so should I not even worry about September 1st and this asteroid?  Right?  Or is this asteroid the first deep impact of Revelation 8.8 that the Bible says is coming?  And a lot of people are starting to get nervous.  Now, I don't think so, but I don't know.  Because according to Mike from around the world, there are so many debris clouds coming.  There's two huge, what he calls clumps coming.  of, of, uh, asteroids and meteorites debris coming.  And what about comet Neo wise?  How wise are you on this one?  Neo wise is so bright guys.  It has the tail extended and they're saying now the nuclei on that thing is huge.  So there's a lot of signs in the heavens.  We just had a solar eclipse over the Holy land, right over Jerusalem, which was insane.  Uh, then we had a Blood moon, half blood moon, half silver lining on Independence Day, July 4th at the midnight hour over America.  We're dealing with a coronavirus.  We got lightning strikes hitting people, killing people everywhere.  We got large hail falling in Mexico, weighing four pounds.  Hail weighing 5.6 pounds in Texas.  We got road, I mean, road.  Roaches, yeah, we got those in New York City.  No, we've got rats, that's New York City also.  No, I'm talking about we've got massive locusts, the plagues of locusts of a biblical proportion that are wiping out the crops in Kenya, Somalia, Yemen, a part of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, India, China, Egypt.  Are you serious?  Are you seriously serious?  And then Steve Quayle drops the bomb on me today.  He just dropped, he's never said this before in public.  We're filming him in this tremendous presentation he did today.  And he says, I've never said this.  I've had this intel for some time.  Information he has from people deep, deep, deep, deep within the deep state who said that there's going to be a day coming After the second pandemic that the Vatican will reveal, after a special prayer, 33 days later, an invasion of extraterrestrials.  I want you to hear him.  He explains it all.  I can't just throw it out there.  I want you to understand it.  but it's doomsday, but maybe doomsday.  It's doomsday, September 1st.  Mike from around the world needs to give us some information.  So let me tell you what the Bible says, okay?  If you go to Revelation chapter 8, the Bible says this, and people are starting to understand that the scriptures are coming true right now, right before your very eyes.  In Revelation 8, The Bible says in verse six, and seven angels, which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.  The first angel sounded, there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up.  and the second angel sounded as it were a great mountain burning and fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood.  And a third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died.  And a third part of the ships were destroyed.  And a third angel, how many thirds do we got here?  Sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp.  And it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters.  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.  And the third part of the waters became wormwood.  And many men died of the waters or the radiation because of the poison because they were made bitter.  Poisonous.  It's September 1st.  Doomsday.  Give your life to Jesus Christ.  It's time to be saved.  It's time to get right with God.  The apocalyptic events.  Look at this virus.  It's... There's a plandemic.  There's a pandemic.  There's an epidemic.  And what about this?  There's some more viruses and more diseases and Ebola and everything else breaking out.  Bubonic plague.  It's all starting to happen now.  But it's September 1st.  Doomsday. ",
