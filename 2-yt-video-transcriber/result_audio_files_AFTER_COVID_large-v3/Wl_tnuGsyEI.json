            "text": "My fellow Uncle Sam has got a children tribe.  I want you to watch this video and I want you to share it far and wide.  This video is very important, has a very specific message.  Now, I'm usually making videos about politics and some other types of issues that are trending, but this particular video means a lot to me and it means a lot to you.  Uncle Sam has got a children is an acronym for United States Marines.  I am a United States Marine veteran and so many of our followers as well, but we are Uncle Sam's misguided children.  And all of us are Uncle Sam's children.  So, we support all branches of the military, okay?  Army, Navy, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Air Force.  We support all of us.  This is a big tribe and we're all part of the tribe, including civilians, alright?  Because usually messages like this don't go viral because people don't care as much, okay?  Everybody talks about 22 Veterans Suicide a Day, but Everybody needs to really walk the talk.  When we talk about veteran issues, we need to walk the talk, okay?  Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story here in this video about a particular message, why I get messages all day.  I deal with veteran to veteran issues every single day, every week, okay?  With veterans having some challenges in their life.  And they message Uncle Sam has got a child because they feel that there's a trust there and they're part of that brotherhood.  So this particular story should be a story that you probably hear a lot.  OK, when you're talking to veterans who are dealing with depression, we're dealing with PTSD, we're dealing with some heavy demons in their life.  And my message might get a lot of you guys offended.  Just to put that disclaimer out there.  I am not an expert by no means.  I am not an expert psychologist or psychiatrist.  I am not.  All right.  So this particular story involves a army ranger who, uh, did about three, four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And he recently got out, uh, after this particular phone call, uh, which lasted about two hours.  on the phone with this particular individual, which I'm going to keep anonymous, okay, for his own privacy.  But I did tell him that I will talk about this.  I will create a video and talk about this with our tribe.  His message was to cry for help.  asking my advice on how he could deal with some of the challenges that he was facing.  And reaching out is the number one step when you're dealing with your demons, your depression, your PTSD.  28 years old, Army Ranger, about eight years in, and he recently got out.  And, you know, he's dealing with the whole transition process.  So he sends me a message and he tells me, he says, you know, I'm dealing with a lot of, I don't know how I can make it.  I can't transition to the civilian force.  I can't find understanding with my friends, with people that I grew up with.  They're not understanding where I'm coming from.  It's hard for me to talk to them.  I can't talk to anybody.  Is that something common that you hear a lot from veterans going through this?  And basically what I call is, I call the wall.  person serving the military deals with this and everything starts to kind of.  you know uh become fake become unreal all right and that's exactly what he was dealing with at this time.  uh he was trying to face a challenge.  he was having problems with relationships.  his girlfriend just left them and he was trying to get her back.  he also just got fired from his job.  so all these little things starts building up.  you know you got fired from your job.  you're having problems with your relationships.  you have problems with um you know, with your girlfriend, you know, your girlfriend left you.  And he's having that problem where he cannot transition.  He's having issues.  He's just basically thinking about giving up.  He actually tells me that he wants to commit suicide.  He's thinking about it, right?  First of all, your first attack is usually most people is to cuddle them, right?  Most people that I have talked to, even my friends, when they're dealing with a veteran who dealing with suicide, they usually talk to them and they usually, oh man, don't do that.  You know, you know, just think about your family.  Think about this, you know, and you kind of go through.  And here's my thing to you.  And I'm going to be real.  You think they didn't think about that?  I'm going to tell you what works for me when I'm dealing with a veteran who's thinking about taking out his life and just, you know, and giving up and quitting.  So, you know, I listen to them.  That's the first step.  First step of dealing with veterans, they're hitting that wall.  It's listen to them, man.  That's all you got to do.  Listen to them.  Ask them questions.  You can ask them questions, but you got to listen to them.  Listen to what they're saying.  And then, you know, once they're done, once they get it out of their chest, because they got to get all this shit out of their chest, man.  And they're reaching out to you.  They want to get it out of their chest.  So let them get it out of their chest, okay?  All you right now is just listening.  And once they get out of their chest, Then you'll be able to put in your own views and opinions.  He had his demons controlling his well-being.  Okay?  And controlling the way that he acted around his friends and around his family.  So I told him, I said, brother, you got to take a step back and you got to just run, walk, whatever you got to do and think.  Just think, meditate, meditate what you're going through right now.  But I'm going to tell you right now, my friend, if I was you, I wish I was 28 years ago.  28 years old again?  Oh, man.  No kids, no child support, nobody to report to.  Man, I'm telling you right now, you ain't got a damn motherfucking problem.  Problem.  Excuse my French, but you ain't got a problem, son.  You don't have a problem.  All your problems right here.  Now, some of you guys are going to get upset the way that I explained that to him, but you got to understand where I'm coming from.  I'm not going to cuddle you.  I'm not going to hold your hand.  You call the wrong guy for that.  You call Uncle Sammy's guy children.  So I'm going to give it to you straight.  You're 28 years old.  You ain't got a problem in your life, son.  Pack your shit and travel.  Go travel, man.  Pack your shit.  Put your light, dirty underwear and whatever you got, your four little rags into your backpack and just hit the road, Jack.  And just, you know what?  And you're going to find yourself.  Somewhere around the line, you're going to find yourself.  Oh, well, I don't have any money.  I just lost my job.  Son, there's jobs everywhere.  There's unemployment like 2.3.  There are jobs anywhere.  It's what you're willing to do, my man.  You know, what you're willing to do, swallow that ego, swallow that pride.  It's just like if you join the army once again.  It's just like you're dealing with those ranger, right, ranger challenges that you had to deal with to become who you are.  You are a motherfucking hero.  You are a warrior.  You are not a quitter.  You are a badass motherfucker.  So get up and move.  Right?  Move.  Okay?  You ain't going to have somebody tell you that every single day.  You're not going to tell somebody.  Somebody told you that.  Get up.  Get up from the bed.  Get up from the bed.  Put your feet forward and start walking.  You're not going to get somebody to tell you that, son.  Now you got to be on your own.  You're going to have somebody babysitting you, holding you, cuddle you, tell you, oh, everything's going to be okay.  Oh, don't do that.  You're going to leave everybody behind.  You know?  You're going to leave everybody behind.  Listen, man.  Okay?  Listen.  Tomorrow is not promised to you.  And whatever challenges you're dealing with today are going to be there probably worse tomorrow.  Because you know what?  Tomorrow is not promised.  Why do you want to take yourself out of the equation?  You don't even know what the formula is going to be.  Right now, you could just be building yourself up to that point in that mountain where you're going to be raising that flag.  All you got to do is put the foot forward and keep going.  Right?  So why speed up the dial?  Why take yourself out of the equation for no damn motherfucking reason?  If you knew, if you knew right there, you'd be somewhere down the line, you'd be a successful man.  Because most of the people that have been successful have had some serious challenges bigger than you could ever fathom.  And yeah, they just kept putting their foot forward, keep moving forward, keep jabbing, keep kicking, keep punching, and keep moving forward.  And that's exactly what they did.  And all of a sudden, they get on top of that mountain and they're like, holy shit.  If I knew, if I knew, man, this was, oh, man, I would have been like, you know, speeding up at that top of that mountain, right?  But some of them deal with that wall every single day.  And what you got to do, man, is you got to look at that life, man.  You got to be like, man, this... Woo!  This is a beautiful life, baby.  Beautiful life because tomorrow is not promised, right?  Some of us are here for, you know, 20-something years.  Some of us are here for 120 years, you know, the lucky blessed one.  Or are they?  Are they really lucky?  Or are they really blessed, right?  But they're here for 120 some years.  Some of them get.  You're going to live a very short life.  13 years old.  13 years old.  With a whole life in front of them.  And they are not here anymore.  Because whatever reason.  Right.  So you're 20 years old.  You're going to live a full life.  You're going to meet other people.  You're going to meet more friends, more girlfriends.  All right.  You're going to enjoy life, embrace life.  So all the brothers that you left behind, all the brothers and sisters you left out there in a foreign land.  OK, you're going to live their life.  You're going to live their life the way that they would like you to live their life.  Okay?  Make a plan.  First of all, make a plan.  Make a goal.  Make some goals in your life and some plans in your life.  Where you want to see yourself in the next three, four, five years.  You need to do that right now.  You need to start planning that.  What you want to do.  What is really going to make you happy?  Because if you're not happy, nothing else matters.  So find your happiness.  Find that thing that makes you take.  That thing that you want.  Now you're looking at things differently.  Okay?  You're looking at things differently in a positive manner, right?  And those positive things just come, just come, man.  They start thinking, I don't know why, it just rains, man.  Rain, happiness, and love, and all that good jazz.  And that's what you got to do, my man.  That's what you got to do.  You ain't got a damn motherfucking problem.  You ain't got kids, child support.  You ain't got a house, mortgage, nothing.  You're 28 years old, young, full of cum, and just ready to rumble.  I mean, you are just sick, full of energy, looking handsome as hell, and all you got to do is go out there and just... Listen, a good friend of mine, okay, very successful man, very successful man, right?  Today, man, he's richer than Hamill, man.  This guy's, whew, this guy's worth a lot of money.  And I ain't gonna tell you who he is, privacy issues, but this particular man was left with nothing.  At some point in time in his life, he was down to nothing, right?  Lost everything, lost his home, lost everything, everything.  Had no money, everything.  Just the clothes on his back.  All right.  Ended up in the streets in the worst neighborhood in the United States of America, Chicago.  He started doing drugs.  I mean, you name it.  So he was one of those videos you ever seen with the guys naked, running around, all cracked up.  That was him.  But here in America, you can make yourself.  You can remake yourself.  This is a beautiful thing about the United States.  motherfucking America is that you can remake yourself and do whatever you want as many times as you want.  You know, it all depends on your will and your power to do things better for yourself.  Okay?  This man lost everything.  He ended up in jail.  found Jesus in jail and found God.  That's very important, man.  And he walks out of that jail, man, with a goal in mind.  He wrote it all down.  He said, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, I'm going to do this.  You know what he did?  He went himself, found himself a job.  Not just a job, two, three jobs.  He found himself two, three jobs.  First paycheck, he even got himself a bicycle.  A little bicycle.  He started bicycling from job to job, okay, because he didn't have a car.  And then once he had that money saved up to get his own little place, he got himself a little place.  How about that?  He got himself a little apartment, right?  He's a little bicycle.  Now he's down to two jobs.  He doesn't need three jobs.  He got two jobs that are taking care of him financially and his job.  And this man saved up a little bit of money.  He was a good cook.  He was a good cook, man.  And this man, when his first money he was able to save in that first year, instead of buying himself a car, he bought himself a dog stand.  He bought himself a dog stand.  He went around selling hot dogs on his weekends.  He was working two jobs, but on the weekends, he would take some jobs during a certain time of hour and sell hot dogs.  Right?  And before you know it, guess what, man?  He had a little cafe.  He got himself a little cafe, a little shop.  Okay?  Everybody knew who he was because everybody seen him all over the place.  Some of the hot dogs, his best hot dogs in the world.  He make the best sausage and hot dogs in the motherfucking world.  Now he ain't working two jobs, he's working for himself.  And guess what?  That man owns a bunch of franchises.  He owns a thousand franchises all over the United States.  He sells hot dogs and french fries.  He has a great, great business model.  And he's making millions of dollars.  So at any point in his life, he thought to himself, you know what?  I'm going to quit.  I'm just going to go ahead and quit.  I'm going to give up.  I'm going to quit.  I'm going to just take down my life.  He didn't know what was going to happen.  He didn't know that by him buying that one first dog stand and selling hot dogs on that corner every single weekend for a couple of years was going to have him saved up for his little restaurant.  He didn't know that that little restaurant, cafe, restaurant was going to turn into a bunch of franchises.  He was going to become a millionaire.  He never knew that.  Never knew that.  But he had a goal in mind that he was going to make this happen.  And he was living on the day, on the present, on that point in time.  Dealing with those issues that he's facing on that point in time.  And all I got to tell you about this message, the only thing that he did not have, and especially I'm talking to veterans, you have dealt with some of the biggest challenges 99% of our population would never face.  You're the 1% of the United States of America.  You're the 1% who's willing to sacrifice your life for something greater than yourself.  You've done your job.  You have signed up for that mission.  You have honorably served your country.  And now you want to quit?  Go out of your damn mind.  Because you're not a damn motherfucking quitter.  So you better tell your demons and whoever is talking in your head, they better sit their ass down because it's not your time yet.  And that's all I got to say.  All right, guys, I want you to share this video far and wide.  I want you to tell me what you think of it.  And I love you guys, okay?  100%.
