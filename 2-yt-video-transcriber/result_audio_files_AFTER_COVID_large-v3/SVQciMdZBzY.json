As you recall, Twitch streamer Destiny has been removed from his partnership with Twitch over comments he made in support of the Kenosha militia, which killed people, which is essentially a fascist group.  That's right, Destiny literally came out in support of fascists.  because he didn't like the rioting that's been going on, not to mention that the rioting might be because of an injustice that had been taking place.  There might be a reason.  those riots are taking place.  In the Twitch clip, Destiny condemns the ongoing protests and claims that they needed to stop, even if it required violence, and said he would support the Kenosha militia or the individuals involved in killing unarmed protesters.

And if that means like white redneck fucking militia dudes out there mowing down dipshit protesters that think that they could torch buildings at 10  p.m.,  then at this point they have my fucking blessing.  because holy shit, this fucking shit needs to stop.  It needed to stop a long time ago.  Like, holy fuck. ",

            "text": "There is an old expression that goes, scratch a social democrat and a fascist bleeds.  So this is that so-called, you know, left.  This is the left right now.  I mean, the liberals that are trying to pass themselves off as leftists.  You know, the ones that I've been complaining about.  The people like Vosh.  People like Destiny.  And for some reason, the rest of BreadTube, and some of them are legitimately Marxists, are somehow nowhere to be found to criticize this.  No one's there to criticize Vosh for using the N-word.  No one's there to criticize him for his pro-pedophilia remarks.  Just somehow they just don't seem to find the time or the energy to call these people out on things that they should be called out for.  It should not be any more obvious that Destiny is a fascist.  He literally agreed that fascists should gun down people that are protesting and rioting because of an injustice that's being committed.  I mean, you can go into white settler colonialism.  Straight up would explain why he's taking this position.  And why it definitely does explain that he's also a racist.  And why Avash is also racist.  And this liberal trend of pretending to be a leftist is also racist.  Because in the end, isn't this exactly what it is?  Oh, there's an injustice, but don't do anything about it.  Because the people being attacked... Let me put this another way.  There is an assault on the American people by the police.  that disproportionately affects the African-American community.  And if somebody rebels against that, they're just as bad as the person doing it, so you would support someone trying to stop them.  Because the violence of the victim is equal to the violence of the victimizer, right?  And that is a liberal position.  That is a total centrist position.  to oppose violence to stop violence.  Isn't that amazing?  how unending amounts of black people being killed by the police is something you should denounce, but don't do anything about it because then you'll support a militia going in and start killing people that are trying to stop the violence that is being carried out.  I mean, I don't know how much more you have to be told to recognize that he is not a leftist.  He is a liberal.  Bosch is a liberal. ",
