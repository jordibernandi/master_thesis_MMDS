            "text": "Hello and welcome back to hell.  Satan couldn't be here today so I am filling in.  A few months ago I made a video about the creator of the Netflix show 12 Forever and her lust for 14 year old boys.  Guess who was in line to go on Sizzler with us?  This beautiful androgynous long black haired emo 14 year old boy wearing tight black pants and a black t-shirt with the name of some band that probably sucks and his lip-injected fake red-haired mother who looked like a washed-up rock star.  Tony was nice enough to follow this poor boy around the small carnival with me as I tried to sneak photos.  Oh God, if only his mom hadn't been there.  Fuuuuck, this was the best day ever.  Why am I so creepy?  Hashtag awful.  Hashtag pedophile.  Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.  But I had to take the video down because there was some misinformation in it.  She actually was not fired.  So I had to take the whole video down.  That was the misinformation part.  Now in the comments of that video, and a quick reminder, I am always reading the comments.  I'm always there, screen capping and saving the weird shit you say.  I see all.  I'm watching you.  I found this cursed comment.  I'm gonna have to go against the grain here and say what she did was cute and completely harmless.  This excessive obsession with hunting down pedophiles has become completely absurd in recent years, especially when it comes to female-on-male pedophilia, which honestly isn't a big deal 99% of the time.  I still remember my friend and I asking these older college girls in their early 20s to give us a ride to the local pool, which was about a mile away when we were 14. they said sure and let us get in the car.  after we were in they both turned around in their car seats and said you know that we're child predators right and me and my friend both looked at each other and said sounds good to me in unison which they left.  teenage boys want to get molested and by older girls believe me so let's get this out of the way.  i doubt that happened.  and second of all What?  Could you imagine?  Could you imagine someone saying teenage girls want to be molested and by older men?  Believe me!  Yeah, a little weird.  It's weird that you even have to switch it for it to sound weird.  Today we are going to be discussing the creepy double standard when it comes to female predators.  How one of them is played off as a joke and a fantasy, and the other is rightfully condemned and shamed.  South Park famously did an amazing episode about this.  Kyle's little baby brother was like dating his kindergarten teacher, and like nobody cared.  Even the police were like, Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  You always see articles like, teacher has sex with male student.  Teacher sleeps with male student.  Has sex with and sleeps are really funny ways to spell Rick.  And they almost always show like really hot photos of the teacher.  Like sometimes they even show them in like their bikinis.  Could you imagine an article like this?  There is an epidemic.  Grown ass teachers molesting and raping young boys.  So we are going to take a look at some of these stories together.  Brittany Zamora was bored, she allegedly told her class.  The Arizona teacher, then just 27, had only joined the Goodyear school as a sixth grade teacher the year before.  It was there, according to documents, that Zamora and the 13-year-old boy known as John Doe first connected.  I'm bored, Zamora allegedly told the boy.  I don't know about you, but when I'm bored, I like to watch movies, I like to go on Twitter.  Brittany Zamora, she likes to molest 13-year-old boys.  We all have our hobbies.  Zamora became more aggressive in her interactions with the 13 year old.  She openly flirted with John Doe during recess, according to multiple students.  Recess!  This boy has recess still!  I just... Okay, we have to get through this because there are so many articles like this.  The first alleged full-on sexual encounter between Zamora and John Doe took place just after Valentine's Day.  While the boy was staying at his grandparents' house, Zamora allegedly drove over in the middle of the night and the boy snuck out to meet her in her car.  She allegedly returned the following night and they had sex.  She said she wanted to give me a blowjob and my stuff was really big and stuff like that.  When the interviewer asked to clarify what stuff meant, he whispered, Penis.  These are children!  That is a thing a child would say!  So he told a friend, because of course he told a friend, he's a 13 year old boy, he's gonna be like, dude, I totally hit that.  And then his friend said this.  It's like, weird how a 27 year old can like, love a 13 year old and do stuff.  It's just crazy.  They can like love each other, they don't love each other, sweetie.  And then the friend said, she's not a good person.  His mom then noticed that he was acting quiet and he eventually came out to his parents and his dad said this to the teacher.  You're a child molester, do you understand me?  Based dad.  Why do you say that?  Zamora answered.  What?  At one point, Zamora's husband got on the phone.  She has a husband.  Imagine being the husband in this scenario.  Like it's one thing to find out your wife is having an affair with somebody like around her age, It's another thing to find out your wife is having an affair with a child.  This is what he said.  You ready for this cucked shit?  Brittany has been a great teacher for a long time.  Five years.  She's done so much for so many students.  Yeah, I'm sure she has.  She made a huge mistake.  Everybody makes mistakes.  I've driven through a stop sign.  I've made many typos.  2014.  Just... the whole year.  Video recorded at the time shows Zamora sobbing as she tells police that she's worried about what might happen to her in jail.  I'm little, she said.  They're gonna tear me apart.  Wow, it's almost like you're small and vulnerable, like a child.  I can't, I can't with this bitch.  So as time went on, the kid started getting depressed.  He started to express different emotions.  He's sad and he slept all day.  it's starting to hit him, the reality of what actually happened.  So at first, this kid was probably like, nice, nice, yes.  The reality of being a literal victim, as always with these cases, as you'll see as we go on, always catches up to them in the worst ways.  Texas teacher had sex.  with her eighth grade English student on an almost daily basis, police say.  Alexandria M.

She stated that she and the boy had sex on almost a daily basis at her home and they love each other.  Lawson did not classify Vera as a traditional pedophile, but believes she was truly in love with the student.  So she's a map.  We got a map on her hand.  In January, Vera said she discovered the boy had gotten her pregnant.  When the couple told the boy's family, according to the teacher, they were ecstatic and supportive.  Eighth grade.  An eighth gra-.  Eighth grade.

The detective said the teen told them that Peterson asked him not to tell anyone about their relationship or they would get into trouble.

Teacher who drunkenly had sex with students and claims she didn't remember it avoids jail time.  Since when is that an excuse?  Florida teacher accused of having sex with teen several hundred times.  Florida special education teacher.  It's already gross that these women are taking advantage of their powerful position and preying on vulnerable kids, but there's something even grosser about the fact that a few of these teachers have been special education teachers.

Your babies, your fetuses.  I will protect you from the pedos.  So one of the things people kind of jokingly bring up often is like, oh, some of these women are so attractive.  Why are they going after kids?  The power.  They're not going after these kids because they're like in love with them or something.  They're going after them because they can.

If it was a male teacher, people would want him castrated.  It's wrong no matter the gender.  Always such a breath of fresh air to see normal people on this hell site.

Do you think teenage girls aren't hormonal?  Do you think teenage girls aren't attracted to older men or teachers?  But this ongoing thing of like, the pedophile was hot, so it's okay.  God, when I was like eight years old, all my friends were like super into the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.  I thought they were super hot.  That doesn't make it okay for the adult to prey on the child.  You are literally making the children can consent argument.  that creeps like this have made.  I feel that only at around the age of four are children perhaps able to consent to sexual acts.  I know that it's funny to be like, nice, cool, like.  I'm not dictating that you can't joke, but this kind of attitude is what makes it so easy for these women to get away with shit like this.  That's why all these articles say, had sex, sleeps with.  and the only one that didn't word it like that was when the victim was a girl.  Because of this attitude, it's rare that these predators ever get caught.  It's rare for a young boy to speak out when this is happening to them.  There's a lot of, I'm supposed to like this, right?  This is cool, right?  My friends will think this is cool.  I shouldn't say anything because people will think I'm gay or a pussy.  Oh shit, she's pregnant, I'm a 13 year old dad now.  I've actually talked to a few male victims, like this one, just on my Twitter alone.  I know from personal experience the mental and emotional damage this can cause.  To this day I have extreme difficulty forming any sort of relationship with women.  I both fear and crave intimate connection and it has killed my self-esteem.  But I've been seeing therapists for a number of years and I'm learning to move forward.  It's a slow process undoing the damage and not living in the past.  I refuse to blame anyone for my issues, but understanding my past helps fix my future.  People who abuse children, regardless of gender, are sick in the head and are causing damage that, in many cases, is irreparable.  I've attempted suicide seven times in my life and I'm positive.  the destruction of my childhood is the root cause of my suicidal self-loathing.
