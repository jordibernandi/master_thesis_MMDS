            "text": "Welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  I'm here with Pastor Kyle Swanson, one of our pastors at Redeemer Bible Church, and we are going to be talking today about tithes or tithes and offerings and the commands, New Testament commands, for generosity and giving.  The first thing I want to say right off the bat is that this is a hotly debated topic that can sometimes get a little controversial, but here's the deal right off the top.  Demanding that people give 10%, commanding And saying they're robbing God if they don't is absolutely false.  It is unbiblical.  You cannot tell New Testament Christians that they have to give 10%.  Now, let me back that up.  Malachi 3, verses 8 to 10, typical offering sermon would be, you know, will a man rob God?  How have we robbed you?  Well, you've robbed me in your tithes and offerings.  You're not giving a tithe or what means a tenth, 10% of all you have.  So bring it all into the storehouse.  Stop robbing God.  And then if you do stop robbing God, he's going to unload the riches of heaven on your life.  That'd be a typical, you know, type of thing you'll hear.  Well, here's the deal.  In the Old Testament, the Old Covenant, The tithe, scholars have surmised this rather certainly, actually, so they're not even surmising, they know this, is at least 20%.  Some scholars argue 30% when you add up all the offerings and the different type of things that Israel had to give.  Another thing is the priesthood at that time couldn't own land, and so this was a way that they would be supportive.  In the theocracy of God's government, if you will, this was a taxation system, and also it was food like grain, and it was livestock and vegetables and what have you.  And so all of that is clear.  However, let's go a little further.  The storehouse typically taught now as the church or even the pastor's bank account, insisting that 10% tithe is law, but leaving out all the other Old Testament laws.  that I guess we should be doing as well if we're supposed to be tithing, that it's a command for churchgoers and they need to be giving 10% of all their gross income.  And then often people will say, you know, when you give a tithe, when you give a tithe, and then you give an extra offering on top of your tithes, you're really tapping into that extra anointing, the extra blessing.  And so on and on and on it goes.  I want to pass the ball over to Kyle and get us into the New Covenant, into the New Testament, because at best... The idea that 10% is commanded is well-intentioned, principle-based, people just trying to use an Old Testament principle, and some poor hermeneutics they haven't been taught.  At worst, it is manipulating people so that they give a base amount so that you can guarantee the church budget will at least have 10% of everybody's pocket.  Help us understand the New Covenant, New Testament giving, and beyond. ",

            "text": "So this is a great discussion for our church, and I think you've made some great points and some interesting distinctions between how the text can be misused.  Because we have two different issues here, either bad hermeneutics, a misunderstanding of how to apply the Old Testament, like this passage from Malachi that you talked about, or... just ill intentions that a pastor is going to manipulate his audience in order to increase his bank account, or at least the church's bank account.  And we don't want to assume the worst about people, but these things both do happen.  So what's important for Christian preachers and what's important for Christians to understand is there is a difference between living under the old covenant versus living under the new covenant.  And Jesus clarified this quite well in his ministry when he summed it up by saying, you've basically been enforcing the letter of the law, and it's more important to understand the spirit of the law.  He said this over and over to Pharisees when he's talking about lust and talking about adultery and all of these different things.  So the idea of the spirit of the law versus the letter of the law, the letter of the law being the Old Testament, Old Covenant life, And the spirit of the law being the idea that God has been generous with us and we are to be generous in return is spelled out clearly for us in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.  So when we look at that and we look at Paul's encouragement to give generously, that's the principle here when he talks about the churches in Macedonia under severe affliction, but yet with abundance and joy.  And in their extreme poverty, that's so good, having overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.  For they gave according to their means, and I can testify beyond their means, of their own accord.  It wasn't under compulsion. ",

            "text": "Okay, so let me jump in real quick.  So what you're saying is it's okay in the new covenant.  for there to be different levels of giving, different percentages.  You may have wealthy people who, like 1 Timothy 6, they're rich and they're instructed to be rich in good works, generous, ready to share, like Paul says.  And they could give 50%, 60% of their income, and they're still living very well and enjoying life.  And you could have people in tough seasons in poverty giving 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% of their income, and that's a sacrifice.  Are you saying that that is okay in the new covenant that the Lord is working through those who have and those who have not?  And our hearts just need to be motivated towards generosity.

It's about the heart of the worshiper.  And so in this case, if you have somebody who has millions of dollars extra in their bank account and it's just sort of a pad there and they can do whatever they want with their money, that's fine.  Pastors are not telling you you have to give it all or you should give it all.  What we're saying is go before the Lord and ask, is it sacrificial for me to give the amount that I've been giving or has he blessed me to give more?  And for those people who are in a season of life where the finances are a little tighter, say somebody's out of work, say somebody is struggling to pay down some debt, maybe it's wiser to put that money aside for those lean seasons.  And the Lord understands that in that season, he's providing enough for them to get through, but he's not burdening them with a tax. ",

I mean, you can't be\u2026 really experiencing the fullness of the Christian life without, you know, being generous towards someone else in any way, shape, or it could be small or big.  So there's that.  But what most of the time guys mean is, you know, you can't afford not to give.  You know, test God, right?  Just like, and they go back to Malachi 3.  And, you know, I can't afford not to give.  You know, I'm blessed.  I'm given.  And that is where the abuses come in, right, to what you're saying.  It becomes this compulsory, manipulative demand, right? ",

There are seasons where people go through burdens.  That's really good.  And if they're burdened heavily financially, we should not burden them further by saying, you need to support the work of the ministry right now faithfully or God's not going to bless you.  Now, the principle still stands in 2 Corinthians 9, 6.  The point is this, whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly.  And whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  But this is an issue of the heart.  If you sow sparingly thinking, well, I'm going to keep what's mine and I'll give a little bit to the Lord.  All you're going to see is that tiny little seed be put to work and turned into something that's a little bit bigger.  And, you know, the Lord will work faithfully with that.  But what God is promising here is that if you give joyfully out of a position of blessing and out of a desire to see others served, The more so that you can do that and the more you're faithful to do that with whatever God has blessed you with, you're going to see that infinitely return.  Not just to you, but also to the church around you so you witness the blessings to everyone else.  It's not about us.  It's about caring for and loving the body and serving the Lord. ",

When Paul says in the chapters that we've been talking about that Jesus became poor so we could become rich, what he's talking about is the lavish pouring out of the grace of God.  He emptied himself of all that he could have had so that you and I could have a sinless future in heaven.  Purification of sin, glorification one day in glory.  He was lavish and generous with grace as a model for our generosity here and now to one another and for the gospel.  So that's the heart of giving.  And we'll put some links in the bottom of this video if you want to look at some articles or check out more.  But don't feel burdened to tithe.  But do feel a burden in the right way, in a good way, to joyfully participate.  Feel a conviction to say, I get to give.  I get to serve the Lord in this way and be generous as he provides. ",
