And I'm joined by my colleague, Michael Bendis, who is taking a case up to the Supreme Court that we thought would be pretty interesting to talk about.  So this case has been around IJ for over nine years.  In fact, Michael filed it so long ago that a lot of the people that worked on it haven't been around, but Michael has been sticking to it.  And it really asks an interesting question, which is, do we have a constitutional right to use navigable waterways?  And so while that seems simple, how we get there is a little bit more complicated.  So, Michael, can you tell me a little bit about this case? ",

This case, we've been litigating, as you said, Justin, for nine and a half years on behalf of two brothers, Jim and Cliff Courtney, who live in a very remote part of central Washington, an unincorporated village called Stahican.  And Stahican lies at the end of a 55-mile-long lake, Lake Chelan.  And it's very... largely inaccessible.  You can get there by a very, very long hike.  You can take a boat or a float plane.  That's about it, though.  No roads lead to Stahikin.  And that's a problem, has been a problem for businesses and the folks who live in that area.  The Courtney family has several businesses in that area, and they have long sought to provide better transportation for either the public or at least for the customers of their businesses to get to and from.  And so they tried to do that.  They tried to do that since 1997.  But at every step of the way, they have been blocked from everything from operating a full-blown public ferry on the lake to something as simply as transporting customers to and from their own businesses.  They've been blocked by an anti-competitive state licensing law that Washington has applied to bar anyone from providing this type of transportation on Lake Chelan.  And we file a lawsuit challenging this licensing requirement, alleging that it violates the Courtney's right to use the navigable waters of the United States. ",

You know, good luck with that.  The Courtney's have tried it.  They have been unsuccessful.

            "text": "In the wake of the Civil War, when we as a country adopted the 14th Amendment, we included in that provision a clause called the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  The Privileges and Immunities Clause was meant to be the real kind of substantive workhorse of the 14th Amendment.  It was supposed to provide substantive protections for the newly freed slaves who were now U.S.  citizens by virtue of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.  And it was intended to protect them in, among other things, their economic liberty, right?  Their right to work for themselves rather than be forced into labor to work for others.  And it was meant to protect other rights as well.  Unfortunately, just five years after the clause's ratification, the U.S.  Supreme Court decided a case called the Slaughterhouse Cases.  And that decision largely gutted the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  It held that the clause does not, in fact, protect a general right to economic liberty.  And it really kind of pared back the scope and the protection that the clause provided.  It was a terrible decision.  It's widely recognized as having been a terrible decision.  But there was a silver lining in Slaughterhouse.  That is, the court recognized that while the clause doesn't do all the work it was intended to do, it does do some work, and it protects a handful of rights of national citizenship.  And among those rights is the right to use the navigable waters of the United States.  That is the very right that Jim and Cliff Courtney are trying to exercise.  Lake Chelan is a navigable water of the United States.  It's been designated by the federal government as a navigable water of the United States.  And the court in Slaughterhouse recognized that U.S.  citizens have a right to use navigable waters of the United States as a right that adheres in their federal citizenship.  And that's the right Jim and Cliff are trying to exercise, but that the state of Washington is prohibiting them from. ",

The Ninth Circuit in this case narrowed it even more to the point where it's meaningless.  The Ninth Circuit held that while there is a right to use the navigable waters as recognized in Slaughterhouse, that right is only a right to use them in interstate or foreign commerce, meaning you have a right to use them if you're crossing the political border between two states or between the United States' border with a foreign country.  But if you're looking to use the navigable waters within your own state, this right doesn't encompass that type of activity.  It basically created a home state exception to the right to use the navigable waters.  And the court didn't stop there.  The court went even further.  and held not just that the right doesn't encompass uses in your own state, but that the Privileges or Immunities Clause itself doesn't protect you against abridgements of rights by your own state.  That holding flies in the face of everything we know about the 14th Amendment, which was that it was adopted first and foremost to protect the newly freed slaves from their own abusive southern state governments.  Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit held that the clause doesn't protect you from your own government. ",

We filed this case back in 2011, and we filed it alleging two privileges or immunities clause claims.  One was that the state's licensing law was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited Jim and Cliff from operating a full-blown public ferry.  The second claim was that it was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited them from doing something as simple as shuttling customers to and from their businesses.  And we litigated those claims.  The federal courts dismissed the first one back in 2013, the public ferry claim.  And we petitioned for review in the Supreme Court, which back then denied that aspect of the case, denied review on that part of the case.  The federal courts never reached the second claim, though, back then, the claim concerning private transportation just for customers of particular businesses, because the courts said that it wasn't sufficiently clear whether the licensing requirement applied to that type of service.  I think the Ninth Circuit was perhaps in disbelief that Washington would apply this law even to prohibit something as simple as taking your own customers to your own business.  So the courts abstained from deciding that second claim and said, look, go to the state, go to the state agency, go to the state courts, find out for sure whether this licensing requirement applies to that, even to that limited type of private transportation.  And if it does, you can come back and litigate that second claim.  That was in 2014, I guess, and we spent the next half decade doing exactly that.  We went to the state agency and asked for a declaratory order about whether or not the licensing law applies even to that limited service.  Lo and behold, the agency said, yes, it does.  We weren't done, though, because we had to see it through in order to get a fully determinative answer from the state court.  So we had to appeal that decision to the Washington State Superior Court, which agreed that the licensing requirement applies.  Then we had to appeal to the Washington Court of Appeals, which, lo and behold, held that the licensing requirement applies.  Then we had to ask the Washington Supreme Court for review, which perhaps mercifully denied review so we didn't have to litigate the issue up there.  But the end result was that we now had a binding determination from the state judiciary that the licensing law that we knew all along applied actually does apply.  And so we returned to federal court finally to litigate that second claim.  And the district court and in turn the Ninth Circuit rejected the claims.  And that's where we are now, petitioning the Supreme Court on that question.  Can a state prohibit you even from something as simple as shuttling customers to and from your own business? ",

This isn't just a case about a couple of brothers from eastern Washington who are trying to get people to and from a ranch.  It's important for that reason alone, because that is their livelihood after all.  But it's more than that.  The right itself, as we note in our petition and as was noted in some of the friend of the court briefs that were filed on our side, this right traces back to Magna Carta.  It was protected at common law by the English courts before the founding of our country.  It was enshrined in the Northwest Ordinance, which is part of the organic law of our country.  This is an incredibly important, historically rooted right and one the court should protect.  That's one way to look at this case.  Another way is more broadly at the privileges or immunities clause itself.  Are we really going to let... the privileges or immunities clause be relegated to meaninglessness.  Even if slaughterhouse was correctly decided, which it wasn't, but even if slaughterhouse was correctly decided, surely the privileges or immunities clause does some work.  Slaughterhouse after all said it does some work.  The Supreme Court needs to make clear that, yes, it does do some constitutional work, that the lengths we went to as a nation to ratify the 14th Amendment, to provide these protections for the newly freed slaves and for all Americans, for that matter, actually mean something, offer some protection, including against a citizen's own state.  That is a profoundly important issue that goes to what should have been the cornerstone of the 14th Amendment, certainly something worthy of the Supreme Court's attention. ",
