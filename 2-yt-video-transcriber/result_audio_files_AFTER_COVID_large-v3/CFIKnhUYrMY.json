We have the right for a candidate, say the president's campaign, the president, to call for recount in several of these states that are very, very close.  You have Al Gore, who litigated for 37 days in one state, really three counties, but one state, went to the Supreme Court twice.  And yet it seems like Joe Biden, the Democrat Party and everybody else is in a very big hurry to get an answer today.
