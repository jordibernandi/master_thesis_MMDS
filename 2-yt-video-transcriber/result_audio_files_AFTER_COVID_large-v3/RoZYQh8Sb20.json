            "text": "Welcome to the 50-day ascent from Passover to Pentecost.  In the historic Jewish calendar, it's a 50-day period between the Passover and Pentecost.  We believe in some way we have experienced a global Passover communion explosion.  And if that was true, then we should expect to have a global Pentecostal explosion, which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  Pentecost day.  You know, over the years when we've done extended fasts, I've always seemed to receive revelation that opens the door to the next season of our lives.  For instance, when we did 40 days at the Cal Berkeley in 2014, God gave us dreams that we were to hold the Azusa Street, Azusa Now gathering in the Coliseum.  It was birthed in the 40 days of fasting.  this thing now pentecost i believe has been birthed in the last 40 that we were involved with recently.  let me tell you the story.  it was in um 1977 in the jesus movement where i ran into a young man named duke smith in the um in ashland ohio.  he was a high schooler but was hungry for god and i was in seminary And I was seeking God, and God joined us together in the Spirit, praying together for revival.  And we made a vow, and the vow was this, that our lives, we would vow our lives, that we would seek Acts chapter 2, no matter what.  what it cost us or where it would take us.  That vow was a defining moment in our lives.  It led us to actually to Maryland, where there was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit among young people, a movement called Take and Give, tagged 2,000 students gathering every Tuesday, healings taking place, blind people seen, hundreds being saved, miracles taking place.  We were in that milieu.  And then my friend Duke left Maryland and I lost contact with him for 12 years.  We moved out because of a dream.  We moved out to Pasadena, California with a vision of revival.  And in 1994, the spirit was poured out in Pasadena.  1995, we begin to hold meetings.  Thousands begin to come and I receive a phone call from Duke Smith.  I get the phone and he said, Lou, hey, we haven't seen each other for 12 years, but I've been reading about it and hearing there's a revival going on in Pasadena.  I said, yeah, where are you?  He said, Lou, I'm in Rosemead.  I'm living in the town right next door to Pasadena.  I was in shock.  He said, I have not walked with the Lord for 12 years, but I want to get back with the Lord.  He came to the meetings and God visited him and moved on his life and he became the worship leader of that revival movement.  Here's the stunning thing.  God watched over our covenant 12 years of separation.  Brought him 3,000 miles away.  Right next to where the revival was taking place, we saw Acts chapter 2.  That's the power of covenant.  God locks on to someone, a transaction, and he locked onto us.  But he is still locked onto us.  Here's the situation.  During this last 40-day fast, I have a dream.  And in the dream, I'm walking on a sidewalk, and I see Duke Smith and his wife.  get out of a car and i could hardly imagine it.  i was so filled with joy.  i ran crying his name to hug him and and he and his wife were disturbed inside because they said you haven't called me you haven't called us.  and i was said oh i've tried to call you.  and i woke up by the dream and i felt like the lord says it's time to call on the covenant again.  it's time for acts chapter two.  The oath is still on.  I remember your vow.  And I was so thrilled.  What was amazing is that my friend Chris Berglund, a prophet to me for 35 years, had a dream that I was connecting with Duke Smith the very same night I dreamed my dream.  In other words, I believe we could be in the.  You see, you don't just gather together and think that you're going to bring revival at any moment, though we should always be praying for that.  But there are times and seasons where God says, as in Acts chapter 1, tarry here in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high.  And then Acts chapter 2, they were all together in one place and in one accord and suddenly out of heaven.  For the next 50 days, our team is gathering four or five times a week, praying for a Pentecostal explosion, not just here in Colorado, but all over the world.  And in the last 10 days, we're going to be joining together daily, seeking, waiting for God.  What if you joined us for such a time as this?  What if you made a covenant?  I am going to seek Acts chapter 2, no matter what it costs us.  You would prepare people who have deep heart connection with you.  They would be in one accord.  They wouldn't have issues in their heart.  They'd be forgiving one another.  You would find upper rooms all over the world in which you can visit on Pentecost.  We thank you.  what you've done, Lord, with the 40-day fast.  We thank you.  what you've done, Lord, with the virus even now, preparing the harvest and causing the ripening of men's heart to turn to Christ.  Thank you for the global communion movement that's taking place.  Thank you for the harvesters that are being prepared to be hurled forth.  But Lord, we ask for a mighty baptism of the Holy Spirit, like in the book of Acts, that tongues of fire loosen again in Jesus' name.  Amen.  Come back tomorrow and join us for our third day from Passover to Pentecost. ",
