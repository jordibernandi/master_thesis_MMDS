But regardless, it's important to understand that what he means by nothing isn't a state of nothingness.  That would be a contradiction in and of itself, because if there is a state there, I mean, there's something that you can slap the label nothing onto, right?  So it's not nothing.  If there is a state, then there is something there.  There is a state.  What he means is that there was no prior state from which the universe arose.  A better phrasing would be, because there's such a thing as the law of gravity, a universe will arise without an external cause. ",

The uncertainty principle says that you can't have, with certainty, zero energy and zero time.  nature does not decide on values with that sort of precision.  There's always going to be a margin of error, and that means that there's always going to be an energy axis and a time axis.  The law of gravity and general relativity, or well, Einstein's field equations, I should probably say, from general relativity, what they tell us is that when you have energy, you have space and time.  Space, time and energy are inseparable.  So it follows from the uncertainty principle that if there is such a thing as the law of gravity, which there is, then there is space, time and energy.  There is a universe.  Removing space, time and energy does not remove these laws, because the laws are not physical things that can be removed.  They are descriptions of how nature behaves.  And nature will be there, even if the universe isn't. ",
