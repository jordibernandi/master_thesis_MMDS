The harbinger, too, is saying we are now approaching this.  We are we have been given a warning.  We have now been in this window of time.  And there are many signs that the window or at least part of that window is beginning to close.  We are watching now the shakings coming.  Now, we are standing at a moment that can determine America's future.  If America falls, which is the warning of the Harbinger and the Harbinger 2 now, is if America falls, the whole world is going to be affected.  The whole world order is going to be affected.  This would unleash all these end time things that we have spoken of.  So this is why, number one, because of the warning, the biblical template and mystery says that this is the most dangerous time.  If America had repented after 9-11, it would not be.  But we have not.  So therefore, we are not only at a dangerous time, we are at a precipice, and we're also heading for an election at the same time, which is going to greatly affect our future. ",

And again, it's not about Donald Trump.  It's about the fact that God will raise up whom he will raise up.  For those who know the paradigm, the book that I wrote, it has the mystery behind this, that God sometimes raises up somebody unlikely at the moment that a nation is falling, to hold it back.  So we had a reprieve.  If he had not been elected, things would have gone, would have already, the avalanche would have already come on abortion, on immorality.  Now, it's already, it's still happening, even under a conservative administration.  But if you remove that, and if you remove the Republicans from the Senate, There is going to be nothing stopping all-out abortion, each of us funding abortion from our taxpayers' dollars, the indoctrination of our children, the closing up of religious liberty.  I don't think that most believers are ready for what is in the works if it goes this way.  Now, even if Donald Trump and Republicans retain their position, if we don't have revival, It is still, we are still, America's gone.  So we, more than anything, we do need the window, you know, and we need to pray for God's will on the election.  But even regardless of the election, if we don't have revival, America is gone.  That's how critical this is. ",

But imagine you have a house and you have children, you have a family.  and you have two firefighters, and one of them's a pretty nice guy, friendly guy, has a family.  The other guy is not as nice.  He's kind of rough around the edges, and he says things that we don't like.  But the one guy who seems to be a nice guy or a pleasant guy It says, I'm okay with your house burning down and your children dying in the house.  The other guy who's rough and all around the edges says, you know what?  I might be rough around the edges, but I'm going to save your children.  Well, that is what you've got.  You've got on one hand, you may have somebody who seems pleasant, but if they're for the killing of children, I don't care how pleasant they are.  It's ultimately not pleasant to have the blood of children.  And if the other one is kind of a rough guy and says things like, oh, what's he saying now?  But he says, I'm going to defend the life of those children.  I'm going to go for him.  I don't care, really, whether I like his manner or not.  If he's going to save my children, if he's going to save my house, I'm going to go for that.  And the same way, listen, Sid, imagine we were there in ancient Israel, and there are people for, a nice guy, he's for Baal worship and sacrifice of children, and the other guy's maybe not as pleasant, but he's against that, like Jehu, by the way.  Donald Trump is following the template and mystery of Jehu, who was not a gentle guy, but he was used of God.  And so we are accountable before God, not about people's personalities, but about the issues and about the blood of the innocent, among other issues.  But this is it.  It's the issues that God is going to look at. ",

So that's the first.  Secondly, in September, I prayed to the Lord.  I said, Lord, what do you want me to write?  I always, you know, seek God off court.  Lord, what do you want me to write?  And I got the Harbinger too, which I've held off for eight years, you know, actually since 9-11.  And so I got that.  Okay, Lord.  And you know, what is this?  And then And as I'm approaching, you know, 22, I'm getting more and more that this is going to be a year of shaking.  And so I shared to the congregation, I believe it was the first week of the year.  I always pray for a word for the year.  And I share with, you know, with with the congregation.  And I said I spoke about about a year of shaking.  I spoke about judgment.  I don't usually speak about it like this for each year.  I said for judgment, I spoke about dark events coming, but that through those events, through the darkness, God wants to bring light.  So I spoke and I said, we have to be ready.  This is the year.  And that's why I also felt and others that this is the year that we have to call for a day of repentance and prayer.  And if my people, which is, as you know, is called the return in September, I believe September is going to be critical.  So, yes, I shared all of that with my congregation.  And that was before.  and then it all happens. ",

Anybody can come.  But there is a website called thereturn.org, so just check it out to come.  But also, you can do this in your church.  You can do it in your state.  You can do it, but it's going to be, that's a day of prayer, not just prayer, prayer, as you said, Sid, repentance, prayer and repentance.  Without repentance, there's no revival.  But it's not only that, if you notice, that happens during the Holy Days.  It's also the 10 days of awe that Sid and I grew up with, the 10 days of awe that begins with a Feast of Trumpets.  I believe there's something very significant about the Feast of Trumpets this year.  And it's going to begin with the Feast of Trumpets.  And that's September 18th, that night.  It's going to end with the Yom Kippur Day of Atonement.  And that's September, I believe, 28th.  And the Saturday, September 26th, near the end, is the day of the return.  But we have this whole time.  And those days are set from ancient times.  for prayer, for repentance, for coming back to God.  So I just believe, I believe, Sid, this is a very critical period, September.  This is actually the 19th anniversary of 9-11.  And also you begin with, I believe there's something about the Feast of Trumpets and that it's going to be a very critical time.  And going into the autumn, it's going to be a very critical period, prophetic time for America.  and touching the world.  All right. ",

And so I believe that we are, you know, it's like Moses said, you know, I set before you life and death.  Choose life.  I believe the stakes are so high that we are heading either for redemption or calamity.  I mean, judgment and calamity.  And the thing is, sometimes, Sid, people from ever since I wrote The Harbinger, they're saying, well, what do you see for America?  Do you see judgment or revival or redemption?  And I said, sometimes it can even be both.  Sometimes God can allow an initial judgment.  to shake a nation that they will come and there can be revival.  So, I'm praying for no matter what it takes, let revival come. ",

They were worshipping Baal.  They were lifting up their children to sacrifice.  And God raises up out of nowhere this guy named Jehu who is wild.  who's unpredictable, impulsive, you know, uncouth, all that stuff, and yet he even uses the sword, and yet he's used by God to hold back the weight and the wave of judgment.  And God delays the judgment for Israel.  Now, I believe Donald Trump has been raised up, It didn't matter if he knows it or doesn't know it.  He raised up as a Jehu to hold back and give an extra window of time at the end of this window.  You know, we're in this window to begin with.  And so, Donald Trump has been a window of time.  If he is swept out, or if he does not come out, I believe then we are going to witness, if the Republicans are out, we're going to witness the ceiling, the dam going.  You know, but, Sid, I have literally seen... God changed American history through that scripture.  Even if you remember with Ronald Reagan, there was a prophetic and spiritual event where God's people did rise to that scripture and literally God changed the history of the world that lasted all the way up to 9-11.
