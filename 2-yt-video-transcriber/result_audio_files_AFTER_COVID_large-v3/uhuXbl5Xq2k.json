            "text": "All right, everyone, for the purposes of this video, we're not assuming whether Trump leaves office or not.  It really wouldn't matter what the SCOTUS decision that appears to be pending will be.  And of course, everyone's doing the Clarence Thomas meme because Clarence Thomas on SCOTUS, the person who mainly raked him over the coals with regards to the so-called affair that he had, which who cares at this point, that was Joe Biden.  So now Clarence Thomas gets to be on the court that decides whether the election's results are actually certifiably legitimate.  But here's some advice to Trump.  Don't wait to see the SCOTUS decision or anything like that.  Immediately begin breaking all of their toys, and by that I mean this.  And this is something I'm seeing suggested by leftists too.  Pardon Julian Assange, pardon Edward Snowden, Pardon Bradley Manning.  Pardon all of these people that have revealed to our country various crimes from the deep state throughout time.  Number two, begin issuing blanket pardons for federal inmates.  And of course, people are saying, well, you should pardon Kyle Rittenhouse.  He can't because those are state charges.  The president can only pardon for federal charges.  There are so many federal inmates that have really committed no actual crime or are in there for extended sentences for no reason.  Get them out of prison.  Basically, commute their sentences or issue a pardon or whichever you prefer.  get him out of prison, make a big show of it.  Rake the system over the coals, begin to declassifying things related to some of the US overseas efforts throughout time, to spying on its citizens, to violating the constitution in the most blatant manner on a fairly constant basis.  Declassify internal reports showing this, break all their toys.  See, Trump is in the enviable position Where he can play up not only to the people who voted for him, but the left and leave Joe Biden basically a big stinking mess.  In terms of the left that congealed behind him, at least for the most part, if not enthusiastically.  Taking them potentially and alienating them from Biden so that his presidency is crippled from day one.  Trump, even if he loses this particular presidential bid, could come back in four years on the.  I helped you out and I told you so campaign.  sort of platform and completely crush the Democrats.  This in addition to the very high degree of likelihood that the mainline Democrats over the next four years are going to lose leverage against the left anyway.  The left comprises an increasingly hostile and increasingly energetic, although smaller core of the voting base.  A younger one, a more dynamic one, one that's more tech literate.  They are slowly displacing at least part of the mainline Democrats.  This was Biden's problem during the campaign.  You can't take an issue on your platform without alienating someone.  So like on the New Green Deal, if he says that he's for the New Green Deal, which his campaign website suggests, well, then he goes to the left.  The leftists like it, but the moderates are like, well, how are we gonna pay for that?  If he says he's against it, the moderates are like, okay, that's fine, because they don't care about it.  And the left says, well, Joe Biden hates the environment.  Joe Biden wants the world to die, and they'll go full.  Greta Thunberg.  This was a problem for him.  Trump can up the ante and make that problem for him so much worse by potentially doing things that will out Herod Herod, so to speak.  Imagine that he manages to swing left on these issues like pardoning Snowden, pardoning Assange and stuff like that.  Those are widely supported by the far left.  Trump can outdo Joe Biden, leaving him nothing to potentially accomplish.  that's feasibly capable of getting through the legislature, especially with the GOP at least having a tie in the Senate.  Joe Manchin, by the way, exists, everybody, and is easily bought off.  West Virginia Senator, blue dog Democrat.  Keep that in mind, it won't always be a Harris tiebreaker if that sort of situation occurs.  And I'm pretty sure the Republicans will eke out 51 seats.  So poor Joe, he has to deal with that shit.  He'll no longer have a mandate.  The deep state, I mean, Trump has been spending the last four years saying, well, the media is coordinating with the deep state politicians.  These people are corrupt.  This is the swamp.  Expose, therefore, the swamp.  Give people undeniable declassified proof that these sorts of things are happening.  And of course, I know that they're happening.  Trump knows they're happening.  Most of his fans know they're happening.  A lot of America's asleep.  If Trump starts breaking the toys on his way out of office, he can come roaring back in four years regardless of what happens.  And that's of course, right now the betting market still holds out a 10% chance Trump ends up in the presidency anyway.  They're doing all sorts of recounts in Georgia.  You've got proven irregularities in Michigan.  Yes, it is feasibly possible still at this 11th hour that we end up finding out that the election had enough fraud and enough glitches or they'll probably just blame the latter.  They'll cover their asses somehow and blame the machines to flip the election.  It is absolutely possible.  Is it likely?  No.  But if SCOTUS gets involved, you've got a 5-4 Supreme Court probably in favor of Trump.  Certainly Trump's the one that the three justices he appointed will want.  And Clarence Thomas is no friend of Joe Biden.  That's four justices right there.  And Roberts almost doesn't matter.  He's a liberal.  He'll side with the left.  It'd be so funny if you had a vendetta-driven Clarence Thomas joining four other justices in order to essentially repudiate Joe Biden just out of animus.  Now, of course, the SCOTUS is not supposed to do that, but every human does have bias.  Meanwhile, Trump should focus on doing things as he potentially, at least, leaves office.  that will benefit the country, expose his enemies, and set the groundwork to, again, basically fire an atom bomb into the incoming Joe Biden administration, crippling him completely.  Trump can save us so much trouble by crippling the incoming administration if that happens.  But he's gotta start doing that now.  You got two months regardless of what happens to break all of their toys.  Bring the whole apparatus down.  Sunlight is the best disinfectant.  Trump has openly campaigned on wanting to drain the swamp.  Well, you know where the skeletons are and which closets, you know where the bodies are buried, fucking expose it.  Start declassifying criminal probes into various political figures, into various activistic figures, the legacy media.  I guarantee there's plenty of information there.  It can be declassified unilaterally, pardon a bunch of people, release a bunch of federal inmates, break their toys.  And by the way, in addition, Trump still stubbornly uses only Twitter.  Since Twitter has been instrumental in constantly attempting to silence you, here's my suggestion on how to work around.  And somebody, I guarantee someone from Trump's staff will see this video.  Fucking bring it to the big guy.  Tell him that he needs to start trying to popularize alt tech sites.  on Twitter in retaliation for how they're treating him.  It'll be seen as retaliatory by people who don't care to begin with.  Hell, I'll know it's retaliatory, I'll support it.  Start promoting Gab and Parler on Twitter, Twitter's competitors.  Promote them, get accounts on those sites.  Get a BitChute channel, not just have like the White House YouTube upload page.  There's an unofficial White House BitChute page already with more than 10,000 people subscribed to it.  begin promoting Odyssey slash library, LBRY.  Start promoting like a brighty on Subscribestar.  Some of your fans have had their fundraising apparatuses torn apart by Patreon and then kicked off PayPal and stuff.  Well, use Subscribestar.  It's wonderful.  Start promoting the sites and services.  By the way, if Trump, let's say he ends up outgoing, SCOTUS decides that Biden won.  If he's gonna run again, he's gonna need the support of all the same people that supported him before.  Probably half of them will be kicked off mainline tech over the next four years.  And by the way, that's not even saying, well, Biden is going to amp up censorship.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm just saying they'll amp up censorship on their own.  They're kicking independent commentators off.  Twitter is openly demoting the president of the United States official Twitter feed and live fact checking everything that he says that they do allow through unacceptable retaliate against them.  Trump has literally tens of millions of hardened fans.  They would be capable, trust me, of massively expanding the alternative side of the internet practically overnight.  And all of them would be fans of the big guy.  And then when big tech tries to censor those firms, they've already tried before to no avail, then potentially legal action can go forward because it'll be so blatantly political.  And such blatant violation of 230s auspices, by the way.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
