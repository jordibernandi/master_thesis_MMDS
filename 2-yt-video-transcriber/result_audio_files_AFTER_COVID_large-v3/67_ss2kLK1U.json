Falwell and his wife have denied these allegations.  Joining me now, Bishop William Barber, co-chairman of the Poor People's Campaign and author of We Are Called to Be a Movement, and Reverend Jim Wallace, President Obama's faith advisor and author of Christ in Crisis, Reclaiming Jesus in a Time of Fear, Hate, and Violence, which will be available in paperback next week.  Bishop Barber, I think I have to start with you, the birthday man of the hour.  Happy birthday, sir.  I'm so honored that you joined me for your birthday.  I'm very happy to have you with me on a very special day.  You are someone that is indisputably, I would call, an evangelical.  You are the pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina.  You are actively reaching out to poor people.  In your view, are people like Jerry Falwell and some of the people we see at Trump rallies calling out these Christian epithets, are they evangelicals? ",

In fact, I'm actually encouraged to see Jim and so many pastors who are standing together and recognizing how dangerous Christian nationalism is, what one of my professors called Americanity, not Christianity, and how dangerous silence is, not only to the nation, but to the church.  You know, the heretical claims that we saw at the RNC cannot go unchallenged.  But let me also say, Dr.  King was right.  Prophetic Christianity must be a headlight and not a taillight.  It's not just, you know, criticizing individuals.  We have got to shine a light of truth and call politicians to follow that truth.  And with police murdering and lynching and killing black people brazenly and openly, let us sit with that for a moment.  And then on top of that, 180,000 people needlessly dead and 140 million people poor and low wealth, many of them hurting and dying before and during this crisis.  And 100,000 people, excuse me, thousands of people dying from not being insured and 40 million facing eviction.  We, our endorsement has to be, or an endorsement, has to be more than just anti-Trump.  It has to be more than just.  let's return to civility and good government.  We must endorse a way forward as a headlight that declares we need transformative change.  And every nation needs to hear this.  Woe unto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their rights, which is why in the Poor People's Campaign, we also have a clear moral agenda that we must endorse and push all our candidates towards.

And as you just showed so well, people like Jerry Falwell and others have tried to control what the religious issues are for decades in the election.  We're trying to say now that racism, racism is a religious issue in this election.  Racism is central religiously, as you were saying.  Let's go to the Bible, the foundation.  The foundation of politics for people of faith is the first book of the Bible, Genesis 1, verse 26, where it says God made every human being in God's image and likeness, no exceptions.  So the kind of violence that my brother was talking about, the idea of white supremacy and racism being fueled is an offense to the image of God.  This is theological.  This isn't just political.  And how do we, in fact, understand the kind of violence we've seen is throwing away Imago Dei, the image of God.  That's where we start.  So for white Christians, I'm a white Christian, so I want to say, when the phrase white Christian, when the most important word in that phrase is not Christian, but white, we have a problem.  When the adjective Cancels the noun.  We have a problem.  So we have to show that isn't the case.  Let's talk about how when you fuel racism and bigotry and hate and fear and violence, which in fact this White House is doing, that is contrary to the way of Christ.  This isn't liberal, Democrat, left, right.  And this election isn't just electoral.  This is confessional.  will all be in that booth under God.  And I'm saying to fuel and use and campaign on racism is contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ.  So I want to confess Christ in that voting booth, and I will. ",

I agree with my brother, Barbara, here.  This is about going forward.  This is about a whole different direction.  This is turning around from America's original sin.  So I am going to be supporting Joe Biden and out there in the campaign, focusing on the election full time to make racism a religious issue in this election.  So that's why I'm doing it.  That's why I'm supporting Joe, good and decent man, man of faith.  But it's because he's willing to make racism a religious issue.  And we're going to turn that around in this election. ",

And that's what we are saying in the Poor People's Campaign.  The people of faith must be the headlight and not the taillight and challenge the lies, wherever the lies are, and we must move forward.
