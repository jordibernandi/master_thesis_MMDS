In fact, I made an entire video about this years ago called Why Do We Hate When Men Cry?  Or something about men crying.  I'll upload that old video somewhere around here.  But yeah, I've came to similar conclusions.  It's because... In our cores, I believe that everyone understands that if men are weak, then that means we're screwed when things hit the fan.  I gave you a good example, actually.  I think I used the same example in that video, but it was like, it was a feeling I never really understood until I thought back on it.  And there was an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!  Waking the Dragons where Yu-Gi-Oh!  lost to Raphael, right?  And so when Yu-Gi lost and little Yu-Gi got his soul, so I guess a Tim, a Tim lost and Yu-Gi got his soul removed, a Tim started crying.  And I was so scared and terrified as a kid because I was like, If the ace just lost, if the ace is sitting here crying, what does that mean for the rest of us?  If the best can't win, we're screwed.  We've got nothing.  It's over for us.  If he can't win, we're done.  If he's weak, we're done.  It's over.  That's how women feel with men.  That's why women don't like weak men because they recognize that terror and fear is brought into them.  It's like if dudes can't perform, if they can't provide, if they can't do, that's just game over, man.  So, yeah.  Yeah, that's why.  That's your explanation.  Continue. ",

I just think that that's just us expressing our emotions.  And it's a bit disingenuous, I think, as a culture to pretend that men don't have this ability to emote and feel and be.  I'll give you a good example.  The day before my dog died, And he had been slowly suffering for a while, actually.  He had lots of scabs and, you know, liations on him from him scratching and biting himself so much.  His skin was all cracking.  He looked damn miserable.  He was all dirty from the dried blood on him.  He just looked awful.  And he could barely walk.  And I remember... I took him to give him a bath one final time.  I was bathing the dog.  It's kind of funny, actually, right?  I was bathing him one last time.  See, he hated the water.  He would always fight and struggle, but he didn't have the strength to struggle anymore.  So he just had to sit there.  You know, I was cleaning him off and everything.  And I looked at him.  And he put his head on the edge of the bath.  And he just looked me in the eyes.  And I put my hand on his head.  And I said to him, I said to my dog, I said, I don't want you to die.  And I started crying, you know, in front of this dog.  And he died the next day.  You know?  Being able to emote like that is just being a human.  You can do that as a human being.  So that's why I don't really agree with this idea of men having a feminine side or a feminine side being our kind and caring ability.  I actually started crying there for a second, reminiscing about my dead canine.  You can do that because that's just being human. ",

Because otherwise, you could just be talking past each other.  And you both could technically be, and it's funny, you both could technically be right at the same time because you're arguing about two different things.  So it's always important to recognize that our effeminate friend here does not see the value there.  And I just needed to highlight it to you guys. ",

Think about video games, right?  The very nature of a lot of Japanese RPGs is fighting, struggling, and growing stronger.  The theme of Mega Man X is growing stronger.  In fact, the theme of most Mega Man games is that you have to fight this opponent first And then after you learn his patterns and his traits, you can then adapt to it and then overcome them using his own weaknesses that you got from the other Robot Masters or from the other NetNabbies.  That's, you know, Mega Man Battle Network.  That's just one... Video games.  I mean, but life in general.  The literal act of your body growing stronger physically is one of that.  You exercise.  You struggle first.  Your body says, oh, wait, hold on.  This is weak here.  Let me reinforce this so it doesn't break down like it did the first time.  That's just... Oh, my jeez, dude.  Ugh.  That's literally just how our bodies function.  And our minds work the same way too.  The only difference is our bodies heal automatically.  Our minds have to be healed with a purposeful action and point.  But the same thing still applies.  You have to struggle and overcome and through that you get better and you get stronger and you gain wisdom and you can adapt and fix problems you couldn't before.  That's just life.  You can't be mad at Elliot for just saying that you have to appreciate that challenges make you stronger.  How could you even begin to be upset with?  that is what I'm trying to figure out.  And so we'll end the video here and we'll finish it off with part Triss.  So that being said, I just want to hope you guys got something out of today's video.
