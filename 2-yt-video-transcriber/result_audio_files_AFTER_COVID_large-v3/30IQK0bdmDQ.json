This can be described as a rational insight.  Secondly, it's deduction.  So, arriving at true knowledge based on logical valid premises.  For example, we understand the concept of a triangle and that it has three sides.  So, if we were to hold a triangular object, we can deduce that the object we would be holding would have three sides.  Thirdly, the concept of innate knowledge or innate concepts.  This is the idea that the human mind is created with certain types of knowledge already programmed.  It can be seen as a priori knowledge.  It is knowledge we do not need experience of to know.  Although experience may trigger the knowledge into consciousness or awareness, ultimately it is part of our nature and it is there since birth.  Innate knowledge can be seen as coming from God or from another life or even from a higher reality like Plato's world of forms.  Nonetheless, all humans have a certain innate knowledge. ",

I tend to agree with the idea of tabula rasa for the simple fact that if we had innate knowledge from a previous life, or from God, or from a greater reality, Then why do we not carry this when we are born?  Why do we have to learn how to speak if we could once speak in a previous life?  Why do we have to learn how to go to the toilet, or how to use cutlery, or how to ride a bike, and so on and so on?  Surely, if we had innate knowledge, we would be born with all this knowledge already programmed.  We wouldn't need to learn it, but we do.  To me, a baby seems more like a blank slate rather than having innate knowledge, so instantly I see problems for the rationalist approach. ",

Although rationalists may differ quite a lot in their beliefs around innate knowledge, I think it's fair to say that no rationalist would argue that all knowledge from another life or another world is with us as innate knowledge, only some core concepts or principles that we can recognize, and even this may need to be brought to the forefront of our consciousness by an empirical experience.  Secondly, I would argue that tabula rasa as a concept is a lot more problematic than innate knowledge.  Think about how different people are.  Think about how some people excel in certain areas compared with others even though they have had the same empirical experiences.  how can two people attend the same school yet one is fantastic at writing while the other is a gifted musician?  this is definitely down to some innate ability.  we also see how different people have different interests.  they like different things.  i for example enjoy country music whilst you enjoy heavy metal.  i enjoy literature whilst you enjoy football.  How, if we do not have an innate disposition, can we differ so much?  Surely if we were born blank slates, we would be more similar than not.  It seems people have their own natural desires and interests, and these are with us from birth.  These are innate.  We come stocked with these from birth.  We are not blank slates. ",

We understand the concept of pi without seeing a physical representation of 3.1415 etc.  etc.  I would argue numbers are purely a rational a priori game and so to dismiss rationalism as having nothing to do with scientific truths is a mistake.  Hmm.  Okay so outside of science, I would say rationalism is a better approach to ethical truths.  How comes?  Because an intuition and innate knowledge explains why we can recognise good and evil, moral and immoral instinctively.  Although we may struggle to exactly define what morality is and come up with a universal behavioural code, We can still recognize morality.  We understand it.  We know when something is good and we know when something is evil.  And it is just our intuition guiding us.  We cannot use our senses to determine whether something is right or wrong.  Our senses cannot determine justice, loyalty.  These are larger concepts.  We just recognize them when we see them.  These are our innate concepts. ",
