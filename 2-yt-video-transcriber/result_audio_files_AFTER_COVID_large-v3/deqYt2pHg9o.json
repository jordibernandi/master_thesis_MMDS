Don't wanna complicate ya, complicate ya, complicate ya.  what is going on?  everybody?  and welcome back to my channel.  my name is keith or you might want to call me the youtube jesus.  i don't know something like that.  who cares?  uh today i was listening in on my daughter's zoom class for school aka work from home and they were discussing i forget what the class was but they were discussing um self-esteem and things of that nature how to better address your self-esteem how to build your self-esteem how important it is the like that And the things that were being said, honestly, some were okay, a lot I didn't agree with.  Not that I didn't agree with them, it was just they were weak.  They're the same old weak talking points that are over and over again that don't get us anywhere.  So I thought that what I would do is share with you my top five lessons in life for building self esteem and just for overall, uh, living a life that is filled with more positive than negative.  So I got my little list here.  I'm just going to read right off of them.  I just got some bullet points and then I'm going to elaborate on them a little bit just off the top of my head.  Are you ready?  Here we go.  Number one, be yourself always.  Always, okay, always be yourself.  I don't even know how much I can stress this one, but just the time that you waste worrying about what other people think of you is complete wasted time, 100% wasted time.  Do not give any time to worrying about what someone else thinks of you, especially a stranger.  or just an acquaintance, you know, your family.  Yes, you want to have a good standing with your family, your close inner circle of friends, which by the way, a side note, you should not have a giant circle of friends.  You should not.  You should have a close circle of important people to you who actually make a difference in your life.  Okay?  That's what's important with friends.  These people to have tons and tons of friends and they're constantly trying to hang out with all these different people.  The joke, always be yourself.  Okay?  Don't worry about what these other people think.  Don't worry about what girls think.  Don't worry about what guys think.  Don't worry about what anybody else thinks.  Because at the end of the day, your life is your life.  You have to live it.  None of them do.  So you need to be you and be happy with who you are.  Number two, this is a hard one.  This is a little weird one.  You need to recognize your greatness, okay?  And I think that the hard part about recognizing your greatness is a lot of people judge their greatness off of what makes other people great.  You know what I mean?  So they'll look at somebody else and they'll say, man, I wish I knew how to draw like that and I wish I had a skill like that or I wish I knew how to play that sport so well.  A lot of it comes down to finding out what your greatness is.  Because you might not be an artist.  You might not be a sports player.  But there's something out there that you can do that you do great compared to everybody else.  For me, it's fixing things.  You know, I used to always say, boy, I wish I was an artist.  Boy, I wish I could draw.  I am an artist.  I just took apart a transmission the other day and rebuilt it and put it back together.  Not just pulled it out of the car and put a new transmission in, pulled it out, split it apart, pulled all the gears out of it, repaired what needed to be done and put it back together.  That's my art.  That's my greatness.  Find yours.  Number three, ",
