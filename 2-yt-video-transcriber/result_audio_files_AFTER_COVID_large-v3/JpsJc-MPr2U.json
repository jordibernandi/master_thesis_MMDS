Do you think that that's what those proper scientist guys do when they make a presentation about an important discovery to the world?  No, of course not.  While I'm sure there will be some oversights, in general they will have tried to make sure that they are ready for every eventuality, even having stuff prepared for questions and the like.

That was a perfect impression of this guy and what he said, and I do not know what you are talking about.  Secondly, dude, just because what you have said is largely incomprehensible gibberish doesn't actually make it deep and meaningful.  It makes it, that's right... incomprehensible gibberish, and if your whole intention is to send people who don't understand away still not understanding your truth, then I have to question if you even believe its validity.

And apparently, if you are notification belled up, they have reset it or something.  So check them settings to make sure you're getting what you're supposed to.  Hopefully, we can get my numbers back up because my self-worth is directly related to how many internet people show up on my videos.  I'm sure that's completely healthy, right?
