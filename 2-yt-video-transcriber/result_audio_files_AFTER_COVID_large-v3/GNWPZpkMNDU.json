And on this, may I say, some of us were embarrassed, if not frightened by what appeared to be the return of the biblical giant called Goliath.  Are we having a return of Goliath to our midst?  who threatens the extinction of other countries.  And may I say to the United States President, Mr.  Trump, please blow your trumpet.  Blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness, dialogue, which we have always stood for and which well-read in our very sacred document, the Charter of the United Nations.  Upon those values, each nation can build its greatness, including the United States.  And it's a greatness the greatness in recognizing those values, unity, peace, cooperation, dialogue, togetherness, that we would want to be guided by the United States and not by the promise of our damnation.  Damnation we shall always resist.  no matter whence it comes.  We have resisted it when it was in the form of imperialism, as we fought for our own independence, our own culture, our own sovereignty to be masters of our own destiny.  That's why we call ourselves free today.  It is because the monster of imperialism was defeated by us.  Bring us another monster, by whatever name, he will suffer the same consequences.  As I conclude my remarks, it is worth reminding each other that the world today by its very interconnectedness demands more, not less, solidarity, more, not less, cooperation and dialogue, more, not less, multilateralism.  We have brought more and more issues under the global agenda and within the global discourse.  This acknowledgement has found expression in the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.  Our survival and progress calls for reinforced solidarity.  for partnerships and cooperation for development in unity, in cooperation, and in peace.  This is a call to which we all must respond positively and actively.  Zimbabwe is already doing so.  I want to thank you. ",
