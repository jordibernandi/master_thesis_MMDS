            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  The architects of the world's greatest illusion, the Great Reset.  Every element of nature and life form will be part of a global inventory, tracked, registered in a central blockchain database run by AI.  But first, all areas of life need to be disrupted.  We've seen nothing yet as Libor phases away in January 2021, replaced by so far the secured overnight financing rate, meaning everything is scraped to zero and restructured for market settlement.  Once in a generation opportunity to restructure the foundations of the market.  This goes live 25th of January 2021.  The designers of this change also see a huge range of challenges, price contracts, IT processes, breakdowns.  Out of the $680 trillion need to be revalued, they've only set up $70 trillion so far.  And where is all this going to run?  Right on the central banks in the Ripple network.  And with the U.S.  election happening in the blink of an eye, it's time to take a step back and survey the political uncertainty that could be devastating for your retirement fund if it's not handled properly.  I think you'd agree, whatever the outcome, things are going to be rough for a while.  So if you're worried about your finances taking a hit, you should look at protecting your savings, especially your hard-earned retirement fund.  A gold IRA uses the value of precious metals to keep you out of trouble.  The team at Noble Gold knows how to do this and they've done it for thousands of other people before you.  Don't let a sudden stock market, banking crisis, or currency reset wipe out your finances.  And if you need an extra reason to jump on this, with every qualifying IRA or 401k rollover, Noble Gold is gifting a 10th ounce solid gold American Eagle proof coin.  Grab the phone and give Noble Gold a call now.  877-646-5347.  And you'll also find the link in the description box below the video.  The key phrase in the Great Illusion, the Great Reset, enabling money to move like information, and the derivatives rate reconversion.  You need blockchain to do this.  A distributed ledger would work best.  But if we do look at what the Great Reset is in earnest, it's that this infinite expansion model of economy that we've built on for the last 200 years does not work any longer.  People who are used to high standards of living, quote unquote, resettling the Western peasants, reducing the lifestyle, distribution.  so everybody is equal.  And these circumstances did not just rise instantly out of the ether yesterday.  The Fed was injecting hundreds of billions of dollars in the market to keep them from fully collapsing back last year in 2019.  First, it was panic in September, and then it was like super double uber panic in December.  And then suddenly, lockdowns, all economy crushed.  No problem.  Everything hidden at that point.  So the amount that they were putting in every single night, at least $100 billion, then it was $110 billion, $105 billion.  And it was going to continue upward.  And these repo rates were unsustainable.  And the house of cards was coming down at that point anyway.  And this reset has been talked about for such a long time in Agenda 2030.  This 2020 is nothing more than a benchmark year.  It's not the end of the plan.  It's benchmarks moving into the 2050 ultimate completion of this plan.  So Agenda 2030 is just a benchmark.  And no, Adapt 2030 is not based on Agenda 2030.  It was that we have to adapt our food growing strategies well before 2030 so we as a human species can get through this and keep our civilization intact.  This grand solar minimum's throwing some curve balls already with agricultural production, and suddenly the sustainability language comes in.  And this was the whole thing about the last 20 years, IPCC, sustainability, it was all part of this same movement to the 2050 completion date.  There were the different years, 20, 2021, 2030, 2035, 2050, and keep your eyes out for those.  But what's the best way of making the population cooperate with this strange reform?  Because it has to be a complete destruction of the old system, the old ways of life, the old things we know, and rebuild it from scratch again, literally from zero up new.  How do you retrain people?  That's impossible.  There's so many people on this planet that are going to say, no way.  And they said it.  well, promises of pleasure are not enough to get you to switch over, so it's going to be fear and stress.  Now the problem with that is, if we're gonna go on a scale of one to 10 of fear and stress that we've experienced since the beginning of 2020, where we need to go to get this whole reset done, so far, if we're gonna use that as a unit, so let's say from January to November of 2020, I'll give that about a one, from one to 10, where we're gonna go.  Because the reform is meant to disrupt all areas of life to the point that it shatters to zero and then they can restructure, rebuild it.  On a planetary scale, everything from government, international relationships, going to the global governance models, finance, energy, food, medicine, jobs, urban planning, real estate, law enforcement, human interactions, six feet apart.  They're going to reshape the way you perceive reality, how you interact with reality.  This global reset in itself can be broken into two different main points here.  This is the end goal, really.  Every element of nature, every life form is part of a global inventory managed by the state using technology to determine who gets what.  A better term is a technocracy.  Point two, all inventory needs to be strictly accounted for, registered in a central database.  Now this can only be done by blockchain technology and AI, artificial intelligence.  It's too much to even comprehend for even every human on the earth to start to do this.  So it doesn't take that much of a jump or a stretch to think.  once everything's inventoried in a new reset of economy, then a nation's resources could be the base of a new monetary system issued like gold-backed, natural resource-backed central bank digital currencies.  Because if you're a student of history and you notice every 400 years we go through these same changes.  The economy collapses, population migration, food price increases, inavailability of food, and the fabric of society unwinds for some time.  And then it's restructured.  I encourage you to go back every 400 years, back about, say, 3,000 or 4,000 years from present day, and just keep going back about every 400 years and look at the massive changes, massive volcanic eruptions, huge societal disruptions, and it's all in a pattern.  Yet this pattern seems to be something special because the level of technology is here to oversee and control literally every aspect of every human on this earth.  And another key point and almost the cornerstone of the entire plan here is your ability not to access food.  Your ability to get food being the main reason that you'll go through every single hoop, hurdle, and fire ring to get to it.  Because by destroying the livelihoods of many independent farmers who are competing with edible products, can you think cricket, protein, cockroach milk, etc.  Check.  And disrupting of the supply chains for the food, whether it be the slaughterhouses, the packing houses, processing facilities, grain storage, transportation, whatever it is, the more you disrupt the food supply, the more scarce food gets.  Well, that would raise prices anyway and collapse the economy.  But now use that as a control device.  And we're getting into the nefariousness of it all.  Now, you might say that's great and dandy, but how are they going to do that?  And why would they do that?  What about this money reset thing?  Doesn't make sense.  Dollars still working.  You're crazy.  I'll say LIBOR.  You'll say, what?  I'll say SOFOR.  And you'll say, I don't know, are you speaking English?  LIBOR is going away.  It's going to be replaced by something different called SOFOR.  Where we need to start is the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, ISDA.  And they even quote here, the current derivatives infrastructure is hugely inefficient, costly.  It has to run through too many different protocol systems, banking wise across the planet.  You can't scale it.  You can't put the automated solutions in there.  It's got a huge bottleneck at the moment.  What they want to do is break down that system completely and reset it up under blockchain, distributed ledger technology running off Ripple net.  And even there in blue, once in a generation opportunity to restructure the foundations of the market.  Grasp this opportunity.  So we're looking for the timelines on this, and this is what I want to talk about here.  When is this all going to kick off, and when is the biggest amount of financial chaos going to start ripping through the planet here?  Well, the thing that needs to go away, as you look for this in the news more and more, is called the LIBOR.  It's the London Interbank Offered Rate, or the London Interbank Overnight Rate is another way to term that.  where banks will lend to banks in the evening when one bank's closed for however many hours during the evening.  You know, they quit work at, what, 4 or 5 o'clock, and then they don't reopen until 9 a.m Well, that money can be sent over somewhere, and a digital transfer in another part of the world can use it, and it's just a big shell game.  This is where we started in 1986, and underpins about $300 trillion of financial contracts.  That is a really low number.  I've seen it as high as $780 trillion.  Most numbers are right around 750 trillion, so that's about less than half.  Ones are going to be phased out by the end of 2021.  All right, so that gives us sort of a ballpark figure, but let's see if we can zoom in on a day exactly when this is going to start.  They're going to need an alternative.  They're going to have to switch systems, and they're going to be moving over to what's called the secured overnight financing rate, SOFR.  And there's another sliver of that over in the UK there, the sterling overnight indexed average.  These are unsecured transactions, which again, RippleNet's instant liquidity on demand liquidity option fits right into this.  And you'll start to see that all these central banks and banking institutions that are involved in this are the same ones that are on RippleNet and the base layer protocol to move money around the planet.  So this secured overnight financing rate is just a benchmark floating rate that's on the way to supplant or replace LIBOR.  And if you want to lump all these into one single, I guess, catchphrase, alternative risk-free rates, RFRs.  So you'll start to see this more.  That includes Sonia and SOFR both.  So it's kind of like saying a central bank, but it includes the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan.  Sort of the same thing.  So look for RFRs popping up in the media more, and you know that's the risk-free rates that they're moving to.  Now, these new protocols overseen by ISDA, that ISDA, which was the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, is going to help market participants transition from the interbank offered rates from London, Libors, into the new risk-free rates, SOFR and Sonia.  Now, this is going to happen no later than the end of 2021.  These platforms are already up and live, so you can see what the interest rates benchmarks are going to be moving forward.  And even the designers of this whole switchover, it's gonna be a full collapse to zero, so everything's gonna go to zero on the LIBOR.  It's gonna move over and be switched, revalued into this new system in which the transition is likely to lead to a range of challenges.  Okay, that means breakdowns, bottlenecks, complete fiasco in my opinion until they really work out the problems with this.  But how long is that going to take?  Imagine of those of you who worked in corporate America or corporate world saw these kind of incredible breakdowns in your IT departments just trying to wire together 50 or 100 or 200 computers to run off of a central database.  Can you imagine trying to rewire the world to get them all to work together at the same time on a flick of a switch on day one?  So they even put the range of things expected to break down in the transition here.  The price contracts themselves.  Can you imagine?  They'll have to halt trading, period.  They're going to shut down the entire markets.  Price contracts broke.  How about to communicate the challenges to the customers?  How do you explain this to others?  Your customers out there.  They'll be like, what?  I don't know.  The fallback language is all about contractual defaults and obligations.  If something were to go wrong, that's your fallback language.  And it'll have to do with the different rates as well.  So maybe if you're quoted in one rate and it goes wrong, then the fallback language will be where it settles at.  Adjusted IT process, again, that's going to go wrong for sure.  You can guarantee IT is not going to work correctly.  The new benchmarks in the risk management procedures, I mean, how long is that going to take to get up and running?  And here's the biggest one.  Ensure that the legacy exposure is minimized.  Well, that's going to be a tough call to pull all that legacy exposure of $750 trillion into the new systems here in a single day and not have it go haywire.  I can't see a smooth transition.  I really can't do it.  Can't see it.  Because in addition, what they're going to be riding on is this CDM data model.  Machine readable, machine executable models for derivatives products.  This is all about standardizing how derivatives are traded and managed through the life cycle.  And talking about the fallback rates, this PDF is also linked in the description box below.  But look at the players inside here.  And if we're looking at the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Reserve Bank of Australia, Federal Reserve of New York, they're all inside the RippleNet protocol as well.  using their own internal ledger settlement systems.  So they're all running on RippleNet, which is interesting because the protocol and supplement live date day one, January 25th, 2021.  In my opinion, this is going to lock the markets up completely.  They're going to have so many difficulties trying to get this thing to go live that they're just going to cease trading.  They're going to cease everything in the markets and just lock it up until they figure it out.  What a convenient excuse for chaos upon chaos.  Having you wear a mask is one thing.  Losing your life savings is completely another.  So the fear factor, again, it's all about the fear.  And if we look through what's already been pledged in for the conversion on day one, we're looking at about $70 trillion or so.  Now, this was supposed to have pre-executed already, and I haven't seen much in the news feeds about this.  And Lynette Zhang over at ITM Trading, who's much more well-versed in this than myself, I linked to her videos as well, so you can look at the way she describes this derivatives fiasco.  She's also saying that 80 trillion, she can't find or see in the news media as well.  But this is straight from the CME Group pushing out off of Silver's publication the amount pledged already into execute minute one, day one.  And this is why the transition is moving.  It needs to go to this distributed ledger technology, this DLT.  It's not blockchain as you understand it.  It's distributed ledger.  which is different.  They can settle every three seconds.  But it's got to be seamless, real-time, certain, cost-effective across all nations, everywhere across this planet, integrated into one global system.  It's very close to one global currency, but it's not a stable coin going out where you and I will be able to get it.  This is institutions within finance operating in the interbank system.  So this is all about the access to on-demand liquidity through digital assets.  So there'll never be another constraint like there was with the overnight lending rate.  that really crashed the system from September into December.  And that's truly the reason I think that the economy is being locked down right now is because to hide that fact.  And a RippleNet Advantage solves all of that.  55 countries, 120 currency pairs so far, and then it's gonna get into the derivative swaps, and away we go.  Decentralized infrastructure, modern messaging, liquidity solutions, brought to you by RippleNet, by the Bank of International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and those under seen in that, central banks, and the credit default swap markets.  They're pulling for you.  They love the individuals.  And also when we see ripple sharpening focus on dynamic payments across Europe, Southeast Asia, and expanding the development arm and investment arms, boom, that's right in the center of that.  So right on cue, they're getting ready to roll out in Asia as well.  It's all about the fear.  Control you, you're going to lose your life savings.  Imagine how much terror that's going to cause and what people will do to try to save any penny they can.  A mask is nothing.  So we'll see on January 25th what's happened.  I thank you for watching.  Hope you got something out of the video.  Hope you're getting your preps in order.  Whatever's happening right around that January time, it's gonna be tumultuous, so you might as well get prepared now.  Long-term food storage, you can get it from your supermarkets and pack it yourself, or two-week, four-week emergency food supply from MyPatriotSupply.  The link's in the description box below.  It's a great way to support the channel.  Get your family's grand solar minimum and chaos prepared.  Because I think 2021 is going to be the real show.  2020 was the warm-up act.  See you next time.
