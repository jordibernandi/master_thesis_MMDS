            "text": "Historically, classical Christian theology speaks of what we call the status intermedius or the intermediate state, and that has to do with where we go immediately upon death as distinguished from our state after the final resurrection.  That is to say, as the New Testament would indicate, Paul says to depart is better than to stay.  He was more needful to stay here for us, but to depart and be with Christ was far better.  And he certainly indicates that as soon as we die, our souls go immediately into the presence of God and into the presence of Christ.  But in that particular intermediate state, we're disembodied souls.  and we won't have our glorified bodies until after the coming of Christ and the great resurrection, where our souls will then, at that point, be reunited with our bodies.  So first, souls, continued consciousness of our personal existence.  The instant we die, we go into heaven in our soul state, and then we await the final consummation of the resurrection of our bodies.  Thank you. ",
