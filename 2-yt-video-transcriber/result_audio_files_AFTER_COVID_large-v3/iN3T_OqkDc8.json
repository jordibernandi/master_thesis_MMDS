            "text": "Beloved Brown graduates of 2020, Eid Mubarak.  Let us pray.  Across Earth's meridians, the degrees of our separation clear.  Join us.  Be among us.  Across virtual bridges as we strain to hear and to hold stories long formed in Brunonia's halls, now untethered amid our grief, our yearning, and joy.  Breathe into this circle.  as we deeply honor all family and friends, especially those lost to us during these years of study, vast our depth and radiant their joy, even from eternity's shores.  We name Will Pavel and Noah Arnold, classmates in the college gone far too soon, whose place in our Brunonian circle remains ever true.  For all victims of this virus, we pray rescue and cure, even as we offer thanks and admiration for clinicians and all who serve in this pandemic.  Grant strength and capacity to rescue, to care, to end this scourge swiftly, that we may together do justice, love kindness, and walk in sacred humility.  We accept the accolades of our education in hope and seek to honor our teachers deans, coaches, benefactors, family, and dearest friends to transform our privilege into rescue, remedy, and an increase in human dignity.  Rising stars of Brunonia, accept these, the prefix or suffix of authorization, the rights and privileges of your degrees, and may God grant you grace to embody our Charter's vision to discharge the offices of life with usefulness and reputation, this day and always, in peace.  Amen. ",
