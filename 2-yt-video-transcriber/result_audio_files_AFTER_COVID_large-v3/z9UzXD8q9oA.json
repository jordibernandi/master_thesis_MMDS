            "text": "Do you have any identification?  Hi, sir.  Do I have what?  Any identification?  Do you?  Yes, sir.  I'm, uh, Hunter Security.  You're Hunter Security?  Yes, sir.  Well, that H doesn't mean Jack to me, dude.  Gonna have to see a D. Hands out your pockets for officer safety.  So where you coming from?  And what does it make you think that you have freedom?  How's it going, sir?  Hey, good, good.  Yeah, can somebody explain to me, or maybe you or somebody here on the parking situation in the rear, the back?  I have some questions about it.  Okay, let me get the watch commander for you, okay, sir?  Watch commander?  That would be fine.  I've got a gentleman here who wants to speak to somebody regarding the parking behind City Hall.  He's got a camera pointed right at the window, and he's got a shirt that says, I don't answer questions.  Right, that's what my shirt says.  I don't answer questions.  So it was it important that you told him my attire on the phone?  What does that have to do with anything?  He's coming up to a concerned citizen.  That's all that he needs to know.  You're already giving me a negative connotation.  What's your name, officer?  Officer, what's your name?  You're not going to identify yourself, officer?  My name is Officer Plata.  Plata?  Yes, sir.  What's your badge or serial number, Officer Plata?  91.  Thank you, Officer Plata.  It would have been a lot easier after the first question, not three times.  Here we go.  Hi, good morning.  Do you have any identification?  Hi, sir.  Do I have what?  Any identification?  Do you?  Yes, sir.  I'm Hunter Security.  You're Hunter Security?  Yes, sir.  Well, that H doesn't mean Jack to me, dude.  Do your security in there.  I was just wondering why you filmed here.  Don't wonder Jack.  I'm on public property right here, Matt.  Okay.  Just go about, do your security in there.  Okay, well, are you recording me?  May I record you as well?  Sure, you're free to record me.  Oh, great.  You know, you're free to record anything you want.  Okay.  Here, let's get a good facial picture, so like that we know what you look like.  Sure.  All right.  That's good.  Now go back in.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And do your security.  All righty.  So you just don't want to cooperate, let us know who you are?  Cooperate?  I don't need to let you know who I am.  You're just filming?  Yeah, I'm just out here filming.  Okay.  I'm just doing a story.  Why do I need to identify to you?  My mother told me never talk to strangers, dude.  Didn't your mother tell you that too?  Okay.  Yeah, so just go back in, do your security.  That's what you do.  Okay.  I'm on public property.  Okay.  Right?  Yes, it's just... We've never had somebody filming before, so it's a worry.  You understand that, it's a worry.  We understand that.  No, I don't understand that.  Why would you worry about me filming?  Um, that's what the office said, so that's why.  Okay, well, no disrespect.  I wouldn't be here bothering you, because you're right, I'm in there.  No disrespect, dude.  I know you've got to make a living, and the office is telling you, hey, you've got to go out and question people because it's policy.  Yeah.  But policy doesn't trump the law.  Okay.  And I have a First Amendment right to film anything I see in public, and that's where I am.  Okay.  Not on your property.  Okay.  Think about it.  Okay.  Think about it.  I have a right to do this.  Okay.  Anything I can see in public, I can film.  So when you come out and you want to ask me for ID, do they tell you to ask me for ID?  Yes, because we don't know who you are.  Well, you don't need to know who I am.  Okay.  You want to show me your driver's license?  I would if you showed me yours like that.  Oh, no, no.  My uncle did that to me one time.  He said, show me yours and I'll show you mine.  No, I don't do that game anymore, bro.  Well, excuse me then.  Okay, you're excused.  Have a good one.  Do we need to wait to come through this security monitor or we can just go through?  You need to have permission from our administration.  Permission from administration?  Is this lobby open to the public?  The lobby?  Well, are you a felon on probation?  No.  No, no.  All right.  We do have people who are felons on probation who come through who do have their own civil rights and are able to give or deny you permission to photograph them, just as I do as a private citizen.  No, but are you on duty?  Yes.  So that's just, actually when you're on duty, then that is the point.  You are not going to come in to this building further than you are without administration.  Okay.  Okay.  So is there a supervisor that we can actually speak to?  I don't know.  I will find out.  Okay.  Thanks.  I don't want to be filmed either.  I'm not giving you permission to film me.  And that's the same with me.  Did you guys write the Constitution?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  When somebody comes in here who is on felony probation, and you don't know who those people are, you do not have... I am a public employee, okay?  So you feel like you're empowered to come in and violate my space?  That's okay.  No, no, no, no.  That's your wording.  Listen to what I am saying.  As a matter of fact, I don't have to listen to what you're saying.  I'm not going to fight with you, but when you have people coming in here who are on felony probation... You gave us bad information.  Oh, I'm dismissed.  Thank you so much.  You told us you weren't allowing us in any part of this, and then you came back and changed it.  I told you that I was going to check.  I said you can't do that without administrative... permission.  I went back and called my administration so you were incorrect.  no I was telling you.  I came back out here to tell you that I had spoke to my administration right.  so Are you dismissed now because you misquoted me?  You didn't know that in the beginning that we had a legal right to be in here.  You had to check with your administration.  They didn't inform you prior, right?  No, they did not say that, oh yeah, people can wander through here.  Okay.  Well, that's great.  Now you know and we'll just continue doing what we're doing.  And who are you doing this for?  For what purpose?  For you and your children and your children's children.  And we make sure that our rights are not taken away.  Well, can you be a little more specific?  A little more specific.  Because you're very vague.  You are being very vague and expecting very specific things.  Don't give me any vagaries.  That's vague.  Don't tell us not to talk the way we want to.  We're being cordial.  Don't say don't be vague.  What does vague mean to you?  Well, you describe it.  You came up with the word.  What's this for?  Are you angry?  You saw him.  Are you?  Yeah, you seem angry.  Well, I'm used to asking questions and getting straight answers.  You're used to being in charge, the boss.  And when somebody doesn't want to answer the way you want, it elevates it with you because you're used to getting what you want.  Well, what I have to do is go back to work.  All right.  You're dismissed, like I said.  Thank you for dismissing me.  I appreciate that.  You're quite welcome.  Don't feed anybody.  Don't let the door hit you in the ass.  All right.  Do you have permission to be taking pictures?  What'd you say?  Do you have permission to be taking pictures?  Yeah, I do.  From who?  From who?  It's called freedom.  Excuse me?  It's called freedom.  First Amendment allows me to take pictures when I'm in public, man.  It's freedom.  Not inside.  Yeah?  Not inside.  Sure I can, dude.  I'm on a sidewalk, dude.  Get the camera out of the space.  No, it's right here.  You pulled up to me, man.  You don't like it?  Get out of here.  Here we go, another idiot.  Pulls up, tells me get the camera out of his space.  I can't film here.  Let's see how far this numbnuts wants to take it.  You want to come in the office?  Why would I want to come on your property, dude?  I'm in public property.  I don't want to step on your property.  What's your name?  What's your name?  So this is for you to write.  What?  This is for you to write.  Maybe.  I don't know yet.  Depends how you act.  So far you're acting ignorant.  Your shirt tells me that you don't answer questions, right?  Yeah, at least you can read.  That's what my shirt says.  I don't answer questions.  So I don't know why you're asking me questions.  You don't know me, I don't know you.  Yeah, so leave me alone.  So I'm here to make sure you don't pull in here, okay?  Pull in here?  Yeah.  Pull in what?  I'm not in a car.  What do you mean, pull in?  How can I pull in anything?  I'm standing here.  Okay, just do whatever you do.  Yeah.  Just don't bother me, okay?  Well, you're bothering me, dude.  Really?  Yeah, you came up to me.  I was minding my own business.  First you say I can't film in here, and then you tell me to take the camera out of your face when you pull up to me.  I wasn't even filming you until you pulled up to me.  So, so far, you're strike two.  Say something else and you're going to be hitting the ball out of the park and it's going to be caught.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Because you don't know what you're talking about.  All right, Mr.  Wise Guy.  Wise Guy?  Yes, sir.  I may be a wise guy, but you're an ignorant guy.  Get out of here before I call the police.  Call the police right now.  I'm calling the police right now.  You're a dumbass, man.  Really?  What you said?  That I'm a dumbass?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How come?  Because you have your camera here?  What is your camera going to do about it?  What are you going to do?  Huh?  What are you going to do?  Are you going to hit me on public sidewalks?  You should be in there.  That's your property, dude.  Not here.  You're not going to tell me what to do here.  You're not telling me what to do.  Am I telling you what to do?  Yeah, you should get out of here.  I'm on a public sidewalk.  Keep going.  No, you keep going.  You keep going.  You don't have no business here.  Just keep going.  Really?  Who are you?  You're nobody, man.  Remember, you're nobody now and you'll never be anything.  You're coming on a public sidewalk.  You're going to see who I am.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good, man.  Little boy in a green vest.  Get the hell out of here.  Now you're harassing me, okay?  You're harassing me?  You're harassing me now.  You're on a public sidewalk.  Get out of here.  No, I'm not moving.  Get out of here.  I'm not moving.  I'm not moving.  Okay.  Let me call my friend, the police officer.  He'll be right here.  Yeah, good.  Call him.  I'll be right here.  Make sure you don't get in the place.  Shut up.  What?  I said shut up.  Why?  Why do you want me to shut up?  Why?  Why?  Is there a special reason?  You don't want me to shut you up?  Why do you want me to shut myself up?  Huh?  I'm ignorant.  Say it correctly.  I feel sorry about you.  Call the cops.  Pull up your pants too, dude.  What?  I said pull up your pants.  Why?  Because you're a pervert?  That's why you want me to pull up my pants?  Is that the reason you're here?  That's the first thing you think of, huh?  Huh?  Pull up your pants, man.  They're saggy.  Okay.  Be a good representative for safety.  Okay.  You know what I'm gonna do?  Yeah, you told me you're calling the cops.  You told me.  So where you coming from?  And what does it make?  you think that you have freedom? ",
