You know, Donald Trump was.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I don't know what I was going to say.  Tomorrow's Superstar Tuesday.  And I want to thank you all.  I tell you what, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?  I would eliminate the capital gains tax.  I would raise the capital gains tax.  We choose unity over division.  We choose science over fiction.  We choose truth over facts.  I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware, over 500 miles a day.  Excuse me, 250 miles a day.  all right chuck.  thank you very much.  all right it's chris but anyway i just did chris.  no no i i just did chuck.  i tell you what man and these are back to back.  anyway i just i just can't figure the guy.  it's like it's i don't know.  it's like watching a yo-yo.  i shouldn't have said it that way.  it's like it feels that way.  i want to ask you i'm coming directly to you for ask a quick favor and i tell you what i'm so darn proud and those poor people who have Lost, you know, anyway.  In fact, I've been here a number of times.  Last time was, I think, all the way back in 2014.  But I've been here before that.  I love this place.  Look, what's not to like about Vermont in terms of the beauty of it?  And what a neat town.  If elected, you would turn 82 at the end of your first term.  You'd be the oldest president in American history.  Like Winston Churchill.  Are you willing to commit American history?  No, I'm not.  We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense.  They go directly to mandatory prison.  I would see for immediately moving toward, you know, we're in fact in a position now that if in fact we dealt with mitigation across the board, just what we did in the last administration and before leading to a standard that we provide efficiency for appliances.  That saves billions of gallons of gasoline.  I mean, billions of two.  point, I think it's $2.3 billion worth of, excuse me, $500 billion in savings and two point something billion metric tons of CO2 going in the air.  Electric vehicles, in fact, the biggest problem is you can't stop to charge.  We should have charging stations along every interstate highway in the country.  You pay for it just like you did gasoline.  Sure.  But if you can do that with bicycles in town... And you can put a nickel.  I'm serious.  Play the radio.  Make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone.  Make sure the kids hear words.  A kid coming from a very poor school, a very poor background, will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.  What is that first issue for your presidency?  The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump.  You've already done that.  Why in God's name couldn't we provide an $8,000 tax credit for everybody who has child care costs?  It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.  Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration.  Hard to overcome the damage he's done, but we can overcome it.  Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way.  The America we know will no longer exist.  By the way, this is my little sister, Valerie, and I'm Jill's husband.  This is my wife.  This is my sister.  They switched on me.  I'm prepared to say that I have a record of over 40 years and that I'm going to beat Joe Biden.  No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.  And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it.  Do you agree with me?  Go to Joe 30330 and help me in this fight.  Oh, yeah.  The lying dog-faced pony soldier.  You said you were, but you're... Why attack Sanders?  Why, why, why, why, why?  You're getting nervous, man.  Calm down.  It's okay.  150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability.  There are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there who are just not very good people.  We hold these truths to be self-evident.  All men and women created by gold, you know the thing.  We have this notion that somehow if you're poor, you cannot do it.  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.  The long way until November, we got more questions.  You got more questions.  I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.  I'm ready on day one after more than three years in office.  Why isn't Donald Trump ready?  Mr.  President, wake up.  Because we cannot reelect.  We cannot win this reelection.  Excuse me.  We can only reelect Donald Trump. ",

I mean, look, you can see, I mean, why there is no excitement for this guy at all.  You don't have to love Trump.  But I implore you, people, do not choose that.  Do not choose... And as they say on that show, and you can check out live from Studio 6B, we give them mad props for making that, pulling up the clips, 8 to 10 p.m.  Eastern weeknights over on America's Voice News.  We don't normally plug other shows on this show, but hell of a job, gentlemen, for making that.  But... As they say on there, and as we've seen and heard just in life and seeing through the news and checking stuff out on the internet, there is way more than that.  That's just a four or five minute snippet and a little picture into who Joe Biden is right now.  And it's terrifying.  It is really, really terrifying.  If you feel like you can actually legitimately go and vote for that... then we've got a problem, and you need to do some inward looking.  Again, you don't have to love Trump.  Just don't choose that.
