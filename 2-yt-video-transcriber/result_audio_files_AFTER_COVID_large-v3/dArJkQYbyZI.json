            "text": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to The Vortex, where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  I'm Michael Voris.  December normally is a month where the Marxist media trots out more important distortions than any other month because they produce zillions of stories about our blessed Lord, which distort the truth about Him.  In short, they distort the divine.  This year, however, they have ramped up the distortion game, this time against democracy, claiming Biden won.  To which you got to say, well, if you're willing to lie about Jesus, why wouldn't you lie about Joe?  In the case of our Lord, they are lies in the negative, detracting from his divinity.  In the case of Joe, they are lies in the positive, claiming he won.  He did not win.  First, the case of our Lord.  Since Christmas falls in December, Marxist media usually flood the airwaves, newspapers, and periodicals with investigations and reporting claiming everything you have ever heard about the birth of our Lord is simply wrong.  In short, He was not conceived and born of a virgin.  He was not born in Bethlehem.  There was no star.  There were no wise men from afar.  There was no slaughter of the innocents.  One point, however, they do push is that the Holy Family did travel to Egypt.  They never get into the real reason to escape the murderous Herod, but they do use that little part of the gospel to push the narrative that they were illegal immigrants.  Now, as someone who's been in news my entire professional life, I'm very familiar with these tired claims of so-called scripture scholars, who are generally atheists, for the record.  Various outfits I've worked for always did their own follow-up stories on these asinine claims around this time of year.  They'd mask them under titles like, In Search of the Historical Jesus, or What Really Happened That First  Christmas?,  The point, of course, is to weaken faith by raising distortions of the truth in people's minds.  No one single story on its own probably inflicted much damage on faith, but one story added to others and then still others creates a cacophony of noise which drowns out truth.  It's the old death by a thousand cuts approach.  Take, for example, standing in line at the grocery store or the pharmacy checkout where various magazines are on display.  The shopper's just standing there and sees various publications like Time Magazine or a host of others whose covers raise the question in their minds about the truth of our Lord's birth.  Well, that's the whole point, just to raise doubts.  Well, almost the whole point.  The actual point is to raise sufficiently. ",
