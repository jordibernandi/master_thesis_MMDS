            "text": "okay youtubers this is the angry prepper.  so today's video is going to be a heads up video and the heads up is there could be a possible emp attack soon.  now this is coming from the home department of homeland security.  they're talking about a possible attack but they didn't say when.  That being said, there was a bit of a chatter back two, three months ago about how there might be a blackout situation in November during the election, right?  Whether that's the internet going out or the power going out, I kept hearing different chatters.  And I know a lot of you have heard the same thing.  Now the DHS had come up, or not come up, they updated their EMP attack on their own website.  There might be some validity to the in the dark thing in November.  Darkness in November, some crazy shit like that.  So, all I'm doing here is giving you guys a heads up on what might be coming in November.  That's when this might be happening.  Hell, guys, this can happen next month.  This can happen this month.  It can happen in November.  Nonetheless, there's a possibility of an EMP attack.  Now, of course, the party involved.  It's supposedly China.  I keep hearing that name come up a lot and they were supposedly rumored, now this is rumoring guys, that they were going to launch an EMP attack in the United States and attack us or launch one of the biggest cyber attacks ever seen in computer history.  I don't know.  Again, guys, a lot of shit is rumor mill, but the Department of Homeland Security had an update on their website about an EMP attack.  There was an article that talked about the Chinese being involved in this attack or possibly being involved in this attack.  So we have to unfortunately wait and see.  Now, I am going to put the link to the Homeland Security EMP attack in the comments, not the comments, the description section below.  I am also going to put the other article and two PDF files about an EMP attack on China attacking the United States with an EMP.  Now, China has gotten technology to protect themselves from EMP, but I think that's just their military infrastructure.  I don't think that's the whole country of China.  It would be impossible for them to do that, actually.  I think that would be the military infrastructures and all their important cities, but not the small towns and not the shittiest cities they can care less about.  So, we have the same thing here in the United States.  Military infrastructure is EMP-proof for the most part.  I don't know how much of it is, but I know that some of it is.  So, military will hold its own, but... The United States as a whole is screwed.  So like I said before, there are some credible sources.  There is the Department of Homeland Security, and there are guys that I know who've been talking about this, a lot of them in the military, some of them not.  They're all saying pretty much the same thing around November, around election time.  So we, again, we have to wait and see.  Now, this can get extremely bad.  Obviously, an EMP in the United States During what's going on right now, we got rioting, looting, we got COVID, food shortage on the way or here.  We got all this shit happening and then we got the cherry on top, the EMP.  If EMP happens now, we are screwed.  Bottom line.  So with that being said, guys, you're going to have to implement backup plans.  You're going to have to get your backup plans written down on paper or something or a napkin or whatever the fuck you do and start thinking of what you're going to do if this happens.  This is not the time to panic.  This is the time to problem solve.  This is why we become preppers.  so we problem solve the shit out of everything.  You're going to have to do the same thing.  You're going to have to problem solve this for yourself.  My backup plan is already in play should this happen.  But again, we have to wait and see.  We do not want to run off so early in the game and be like, oh my God, and then it doesn't happen.  Because that has happened more than enough times.  But this video is just a heads up video.  This is not to get you scared.  I'm going to say half the country is going to be screwed when this happens.  I don't mean half the country screwed, dying off.  Starvation, the elderly, people who need their meds.  Those are the people who are going to get affected first and fast.  and then there are those who have like diabetes.  You're gonna see their death and it's gonna be prolonged.  And the only reason why I'm bringing it up is because for some of the ailments out there, there are natural remedies to those ailments.  But because we become so dependent on Big Pharma, Big Pharma got us brainwashed into thinking they are the soul saviors of all of us, which is absolute bullshit.  There are a lot of remedies out there, guys, and you have to figure out which remedy is for you and your ailments.  listen carefully not all ailments can be handled by natural remedies.  unfortunately.  some of the suffice to say guys it's just going to be bad for a lot of people and they might not make it out.  so like i said you need to prepare for the slight possibility that this is going to happen.  therefore you keep prepping.  you start canning your goods drying your goods getting more canned goods uh developing a backup plan like i said having cash on hand.  do not go in the month of November, or even October for that matter, with no cash on deck.  Have cash on deck.  You also want to come up with a backup communication plan.  Now, Bofang radios and things like that might still work, provided that repeaters and certain communication systems are not affected.  If they are, then guess what?  It's wiped out.  But if it's not, you need to come up, you're going to need to have, sorry, a backup communication system.  So with that being said, guys, You're gonna have to think of it.  You're gonna have to contact your comms guy if you have a group and ask him what's the backup plan for an EMP attack on communications.  Now, I'm here to say this last part.  Do not fucking panic.  Panicking is not an option.  Panicking is only going to get you more frustrated, more anxiety.  You're going to start feeling sad for yourself, bad for yourself.  Don't panic.  Fuck that shit.  This is what people want.  They want you to fail.  Whoever it is, if it's the Chinese or the elite that people keep talking about, whoever it is that wants you to fail, don't let them win.  This is not the time to panic.  This is not the time to contemplate suicide.  This is the time to get your shit in order and get everything ready and squared away.  Because believe it or not, whether the EMP attack happens or not, there's going to be an interesting rest of the year.  I'm going to dive into EMPs a little bit because I know there's some misconceptions with EMPs.  The misconception is an EMP goes off, and an EMP, by the way, is an electromagnetic pulse.  The electromagnetic pulse is a nuclear device that detonates three miles above Earth's atmosphere.  It rains down electromagnetic pulse, like little electrons, and those electrons affect all electronic Devices.  so there is one last shred of hope with this whole thing solar technology.  now solar technology can Save us or save a lot of people who have the solar technology in their homes Obviously hospitals.  you hope that they have solar technology at least the newer ones.  So you might have a little bit of hope regarding solar technology.  So the other thing with solar technology guys is A lot of the battery banks, the places where the power is stored, is either A, underground, or B, in some kind of metal shed.  So that portion should be protected.  The panels, on the other hand, I'm not sure whether or not they're going to be affected.  Now, there's no studies on them.  I am 1,000% sure some of you guys are going to be like, yes, it will.  We don't know because we've never tested an EMP on solar panels.  But we can't rely on that altogether.  If you don't have solar technology in your home, you're screwed.  The Amish, who is the people we should be learning from, they do this shit every day all day with no electronics, with no electricity.  So they'll be fine.  It'll just be life for them.  But for those of us who are dependent on it, we're going to have to fucking pivot and pivot fast.  Solar technology is the way to go.  If you want to get prepared for this EMP, you have enough money, try to get yourself, again, solar panels to keep your house running if an EMP happens.  All right, guys, this is the Angry Pepper.
