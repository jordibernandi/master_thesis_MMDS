For 2021, Fellowship Church is embarking on a one-year-wide reading of the Bible chronologically, meaning it lays out the writings of Scripture in the order in which they happened, more or less.  Now, I wasn't actually aware that there was such a thing, but getting Christians to read their Bibles is a good thing, and I'm glad to see that Fellowship Church is doing this.  Now, I'm the kind of guy who likes to poke around church websites and see what's there.  And I was fascinated that there is a page dedicated to the artwork of the senior pastor.  Among the t-shirts and socks for sale, there was this little nugget.  It's called the Jesus Journal.  It's for 10 bucks.  Featuring original artwork by Ed Young  Jr.,  It's intended, he says, to cause one to reflect on Jesus, the shaggy, white, northern European Jesus, when reading God's Word.  Ed says, Now, on this day, January 10th, 2021, Ed is in a series called Cover to Cover, and the title of the sermon is God's Open Door Policy.  This is tracking along with the year-long Bible reading plan.  Ed said, Jesus stands at the door and knocks.  And if we open the door and allow God to enter that door, the door of our hearts, then Christ will transform our lives and will become a new creation.  Well, Ed would do well to check that verse he's using there, since it is Jesus knocking on the door of a church that Jesus rebukes as being lukewarm in Revelation.  Anyways, let's take a gander at what Ed has to say about God as he reveals himself in his word. ",

I'm not trying to just find fault and simply pick on Ed Young Jr.  But we need to discern the signs of the times.  You know, it's going to get increasingly more difficult to be a Christian in this day and age as we go forward.  There simply is no more place, and there really never has been, to play church.  Christians need to, as Jesus says in Luke 14, 25, Now a great multitude went with him, and he turned and said to them, If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and yes, his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.  And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.  For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it?  Lest, after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish, and all who see it will mock, saying, This man began to build and was not able to  finish.\".  Or what king going to war against another king does not first sit down and consider whether he is able with 10,000 men to meet him who comes against him with 20,000?  Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends out a delegation and asks conditions of peace.  So likewise, whoever of you who does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple.  Celebrity pastors who have their own designer t-shirts and socks, mega churches that have coffee shops and cafes, I'm telling you guys, those days are coming to a close.  Those days are numbered.  When it is dangerous to claim Jesus Christ as king, these behemoths, these megachurches, will lose many people and their doors will ultimately close.  Find a church where the gospel is central and where sin and repentance are acknowledged.  Find a body of believers that are passionate for the pure milk of the word and pastors who will preach it undiluted, without props and fancy backgrounds. ",
