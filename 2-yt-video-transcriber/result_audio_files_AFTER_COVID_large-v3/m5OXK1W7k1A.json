            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  Every one of us has a guardian angel watching over us.  And the role of our angel is to light and to guard, to rule and to guide.  In paragraph 336, speaking about the angels, it quotes St.  Basil who says, Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life.  Now, what is the one thing that your guardian angel wants you to do.  I would say that it's exactly what he is doing all the time.  Our Lord Jesus in chapter 18 of Matthew says, See that you do not despise one of these little ones.  For I tell you that in heaven, their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.  The angels gaze upon the glory, the beauty, and the majesty of God.  And this gives them a radiance.  Our angels are radiant.  They're beautiful because they see the face of God.  And the angels want us to do the same.  Scripture says, look to the Lord and be radiant.  And this gazing upon the Lord is something that we can do even throughout the activities and even challenges of our day.  To be able to have a contemplative gaze and to see deeper than the circumstances.  To see God.  scripture says the pure of heart will see god now in the story of the sisters mary and martha.  mary was sitting at the feet of jesus gazing upon the lord listening to his words.  martha was busy serving and martha complained to.  jesus said tell my sister to help me.  and our lord.  jesus said martha martha you're anxious about many things.  there is need of only one thing mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.  This is the one thing that the angels do all the time.  They gaze upon the Lord.  They hear his wonderful voice.  And we too were called to that one thing, to gaze upon Lord.  And this gaze is a contemplative gaze.  In other words, when we contemplate something, we take on the likeness of that which we contemplate.  And heaven says we will be like God because we will see him as he is.  And so see that your guardian angel is radiant with joy because he gazes upon God.  And strive to do the same, to let your gaze be upon the Lord throughout the day so that you too, like your guardian angel, can be radiant with joy.  Viva Cristo! ",
