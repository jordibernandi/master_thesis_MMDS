            "text": "Good afternoon, my brothers and sisters.  This is Susanna.  I am looking for that blessed hope and the glorious apparent of the great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.  Titus 2, 13 and 14.  I have a message from the Lord, from the Holy Spirit.  And the message is not a nice message.  I got in the spirit yesterday, titled Jerusalem, my chosen land.  And Jeremiah chapter 15 and Isaiah chapter 47, the Holy Spirit gave to me.  I prayed upon this message and I received two confirmation number that I asked the Lord for.  I got number 895.  895 in Hebrew means corresponding to Babylon.  So the Lord gave me the exact thing I wanted to hear.  And also in Greek it means without life.  The other confirmation is number 45.  It means anchor and it means an Israelite.  My brothers and sisters, on Friday at 1.32  a.m.,  the message continued while I was praying, and the Holy Spirit told me to write.  I heard in the Spirit, I am the God that created the heaven and the earth.  Write, for I have a lot to tell thee.  The enemies have established themselves into your land.  It is now time for the slaughter to take place.  Thy walls will be broken down.  Thy storehouses will be disrupted.  Fire shall burn thee.  All the cities shall fall and no one shall help thee.  My people do not need thee, for I am their God, thy Lord.  I shall restore my land.  You have interceded.  Therefore, you have caused my people to go into war.  You have falsified your friendship with my people.  You have made their hearts sorrowful.  My people dishonored me and broken my everlasting covenant.  They went backward.  This make me angry with them, so Israel will be punished for their wardens and serving other gods.  But, O America, land of the Chaldeans, I have waited for thee.  I will strip you and everyone shall see your shame.  If only my people will return to me so I can save them.  Bombs shall fall on thee.  Nuclear warheads shall destroy thee.  Together with my judgment, the time is now at hand.  I am the redeemer of Israel.  Israel is my holy land.  My people shall be glorified.  I shall fend for them.  What thinkest thou?  I am going to allow thee to let the heathen make a pact with my people?  I am their savior, and no one can make decisions for me.  Your land will be desolate.  Famine, earthquakes, and Yellowstone shall evolve and explode.  I am sore displeased with you, America.  You arrogant people who sit as a queen.  Those days are over.  Judgment shall come upon thee and devour thee.  I will bring comfort to my people.  I will make peace.  Not you, a nation filled with iniquity.  How can you make correction when you are in the pit?  The world shall see it.  The despicable generation reprobate mine.  The lawless one is rising soon.  He shall comfort thee.  He shall be your savior.  America, land of the free, thy hour has come.  I shall visit thee with great vengeance, and I shall send great hailstones into thy land.  Do not cry out to me, I will not hear thee.  Thy abominations have reached to my throne.  I have forgotten thee and buried my face from thee.  destruction commence.  My fury will be poured out on all the beasts of the land, upon all the people filled with abominations and iniquity.  Thy visitation is soon and the world shall see it.  I am sorry.  I created thee.  My eyes shall not spare.  My face is hidden from the America.  Fire will continue burning, O land of America.  The fire shall not be quenched.  And this is the end of the message.  So my brothers and sisters, as always, please seek the Lord in prayers and ask the confirmation for this message.  Do have a wonderful night and God bless all of you.  Bye-bye. ",
