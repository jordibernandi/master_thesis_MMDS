            "text": "Cool, so if we're lucky, some of this will clear up tonight and we'll be able to do some astronomy with these two boys here.  So for those of you who don't follow the Voice of Thunder channel, some time ago I had this sort of skepticism about, you know, expensive red wines versus cheap red wines and there's this big debate that I had with my friends that you know.  did it really make that much difference?  could if I got say six bottles of wine ranging from a few dollars to thirty dollars per bottle or something?  yeah how much does it change with a blind taste test?  and this is and the answer by the way is very little very little for people who aren't professional wine tasters.  so the question comes is the same same thing sort of true of telescopes?  if you have a telescope that costs 10 times more Is it really ten times better?  So what you've got here are two refractors.  That's those guys who have lenses at the front there.  And this is a... It's 102mm, that's 4 inches at the front there, that's the lens.  This thing is a 90, 3.5 inches.  This thing is f5, it's relatively short focal length.  This one's a little more, it's about f7, that sort of thing.  This thing is dead light, weighs about a couple of kilos.  This thing is almost twice as heavy.  And as you might expect, this one is the cheap one.  This cost about $200.  And this one was about $1,500.  So the question comes is... Is it really that much better?  So refractors have this problem.  The main reason this one is more expensive is it's an apochromat.  It's a triplet.  There are three lenses in this one, which means that all of the light focuses down here to give beautiful images.  With this one, with bright objects, the red light and the blue light focuses in different areas.  The practical upshot is... get this purple halo around bright objects.  But that doesn't really matter if you're looking at faint objects.  And because this is a short focal length, it's more of a wide angle thing.  So if I'm just using these as essentially camera lenses, You know, is there really that much difference between these two?  The cheap telescope.  I'm going to focus it first.  Oops.  And for the focus, we're going to zoom right in on the bit that we think is interesting, which is... The Orion Nebula.  Let's just center him up.  There we go.  And now to focus.  One more time.  He's about there somewhere.  Excellent.  After that, it's just a matter of pushing the single button on the timer.  And stand still for, let me see if I can just jiggle around.  Oh wow, there's quite a lot of movement on the focus there.  Yeah, that's just from the atmospheric shimmer.  But we'll go for that.  So I'm not going to stay still for 30 seconds.  So I've got a deep sky filter in this boy at the moment.  Which basically just reduces some of the orange sky glow.  So I'll just put it a bit down there.  We'll see how it goes.  Right, okay.  So that.  Let me take a look at what we've got.  And I just want to zoom in on one of the stars.  Oh, and that's pretty decent.  Good.  Good.  Okay, he's tracking nicely.  He's burnt out completely, of course, but there's just way too much stray light here.  There's not a lot you can do about that.  In fact, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'm going to reduce the exposure there to, oh, what do you reckon?  20 seconds.  No, 15.  15 seconds, then we'll try again.  Okay, so we're all set up again.  And here we go, we're going for 15 seconds now.  Nice and still for 15 seconds.  And we'll see what we can see.  I just about see the Orion up there.  They make it out well with the camera.  There you go, 15 seconds, good.  Let's see what that looks like.  And it's... So the reason it's all blue, of course... Actually, that's pretty... Oh, that looks gorgeous on the screen.  Okay, we'll stick with that.  Assuming it's tracking well enough and it's tracking beautifully.  Okay, excellent.  So, there are some blue halos around the stars.  Let's see how that compares... to the telescope.  that costs almost 10 times as much.  Okay, so now I've got the fancy telescope out, which you should just about be able to see in the red glow of the light.  And in the middle there, we have, again, the trapezium, which I'll just make sure that's focused.  Should we say the build quality in these things is absolutely no contest, but, eh, what do you expect?  It costs 10 times as much.  So the micro-fine focuser.  I'll do this while eyeballing it, actually.  Oh, wow.  So, it's getting over a chimney or something.  It's shimmering like a son of a bitch.  Okay, that looks okay.  Good, right, so now all we need is nice and relaxed and we'll see what we get some 15 seconds later.  All this horrendous light pollution.  Boom.  Let's see what that got us.  Okay.  Yeah, so we don't have the blue halos on the stars, but I'm not sure what that'll look like, you know, just in the direct comparison.  We'll see.  Okay, let's see what those look like side by side.  Oh, it was a plane or something that went across there.  Awesome, so let's take a look at the raw data and see what we can learn from all of this.  Now you'll recall that I had two telescopes.  There was a somewhat shorter focal length F5 cheap telescope and a more expensive, somewhat longer focal length telescope.  So the longer focal length telescope looks at a smaller area of the sky.  So the brighter image with a wider angle is the cheaper telescope.  Which, I mean, immediately you can see that they're very comparable images like this, you know.  Now, you've got to bear in mind that this is bottlenecked by the quality of the sky.  If we had really dark skies, you would probably see more of a difference.  And it should also be stressed that... The reason the sky is blue is because I had a deep sky filter in there and there's an awful lot of sky glow there.  So the deep sky filter basically filters out a load of the orange from the sky, but there's still quite a lot of more other stray light coming in from somewhere.  Now, I could make a little more effort to try and get rid of some of that, but hey, this is just a 15-second raw comparison of about an F7 apochromatic telescope at about $2,000 and a F5 achromat at about $200.  And they are immediately, I mean, if you know what you're looking for, you can see which one is better color corrected, even without sort of zooming in.  So the wider angle one, you can see that the stars have more of a purple halo around them.  And for certain, if you were to zoom right in on these images, the purple halo becomes much more noticeable.  But I mean, for me, on these wide angle shots, it's not greatly noticeable.  to the point where, you know, if you were under... not so great skies and you were just doing some if you were starting out there's really not that much point in going for the apochromatic telescope which costs 10 times as much.  if however you were looking at bright objects particularly the planets then there would be a huge difference between these two.  And I'll try that sometime.  But if you were looking at planets, planets are small.  And if you're looking at small objects, you don't want a short focal length refractor.  You want something that's much longer focal length.  So yeah, looked at like this.  I was surprised at how little difference there was between these two telescopes.  Cool.  So what are these telescopes and where might you be able to buy them?  Well, the good news is I can't really give you any affiliate links to any of these things.  So, you know, you can make up your own mind.  The Stellavu, the expensive one is over 10 years old and they don't actually make them anymore.  But yeah, all of the apochromatic triplet type refractors They look like they're going to have very similar performance.  They're superbly made.  The engineering is fantastic.  But the one that people will probably be more interested in is the cheap one, which was a Skywatcher.  It's a Skywatcher 102mm refractor.  It's very short focal length, 500mm, f5.  This one I got bundled with, it looks like they're actually quite difficult to buy, just the telescope on its own.  I think this is because they're an entry-level telescope.  They always seem to sell it with a mount, so you can get it on a sort of Altas-type mount, or I got it on a cheap, very portable go-to mount for about $500, that sort of thing.  I want to stress that whilst for this test, it really did perform very similarly to the more expensive telescopes.  Once you get this thing onto planets or the moon, I've certainly had this cheaper telescope looking at the moon, and you get a significant purple halo around bright objects like this.  Now, there are sort of shortcuts, things you can do to get around that.  You know, you put in yellow filters that cut out some of the purple light and all that sort of thing.  But, whilst for this test it was very comparable, for other things it won't be.  In any event, a refractor with this short focal length won't be so good for planets in any event.  So this is one of the things.  Whilst I did the review of, what was it called, the EV scope, there's another telescope very similar to it called the Stellina.  And the Stellina uses a quality of telescope somewhere between these two.  And the thought occurred to me that I'd never actually... directly done this comparison between the performance of essentially what is the cheapest telescope and the most expensive telescope.  Now, admittedly, it's a niche comparison, but I still found it actually quite interesting just how little difference there was between these two.  So I did actually have a choice of which mount I should use to drive all of this.  In the event, I was just lazy because the heavier duty mount shakes less and has less trouble and all that sort of thing.  And that in this case was a Celestron Evolution mount, Altaz type thing.  um i will at some point get around to testing the gti.  uh lightweight uh head that the.  uh the cheap refract came with.  uh i i've done some tinkering with it before.  it looks like it's a perfectly serviceable mount.  i'll leave the links to the amazon affiliate store below and not directly relevant for really anything in this video.  but If you're interested in that sort of thing, you might want to take a look through that.  Anyway, if you enjoyed the video, give it a thumbs up.  Many thanks for watching and see you next time. ",
