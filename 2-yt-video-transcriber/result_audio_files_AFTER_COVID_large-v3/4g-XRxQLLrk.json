            "text": "Hi, beautiful people.  Well, it's official.  God is Gray slash.  I am being sued by Angie and Isaac Tolpin of Courageous Parenting.  We're also going to discuss how to save the life of this man, Purvis Payne, which strangely enough ties together, you'll see.  I was made aware of the lawsuit on Tuesday, September 22nd, when my lawyers reached out to say that the Tolpins had filed a summons and complaint against myself in L.A.  Superior Court.  The Tolpins also released a video titled Why We Are Suing Brenda Davies, God is Gray for Defamation and False Light, which will be linked below with all the pertinent materials regarding this suit.  I informed the God is Great community this may be coming when I initially received a cease and desist from the Tolpin's lawyer in July.  This was in response to the video, We Did It Out of Love, in which a member of the God is Great community came forward to share her own story.  Stell is an alleged victim of corporal punishment, and she believed that coming forward was important, which is explained in detail in the initial video.  The cease and desist demanded that I remove all reference to the Tolpins and their ministry from any and all video sharing slash social media platforms and audio slash podcast platforms, along with a demand for $20,000.  So immediately after receiving this cease and desist letter, I spoke to legal counsel.  They warned me openly that litigation is expensive and draining both monetarily and emotionally.  So I hope to connect with the tulpins, human to human, Christian to Christian, to resolve this peacefully.  In response, Angie and Isaac sent this email, which in bold letters and underline asked, are you going to comply with our demands or not?  How do you propose you clear our names so that we can all move forward?  I sent this to my lawyer and they advised that I cease communication and acquire them officially to write a response, which would cost $2,100 at minimum.  They also advised that the following steps, if the Tolpins did choose to pursue a lawsuit, would cost anywhere between $12,500 and $120,000.  I don't have the money for any of this.  So I released a video with Stell to crowdfund for our defense.  At the time, Stell was sent the cease and desist as well.  So we were unsure if she'd be named in the lawsuit.  Thanks to your generous donations, I couldn't have done it without you.  My lawyers sent their response.  On that same day, I received an eight-page letter from the Tulpins, which was listed as confidential but is now being linked beneath their own video if you'd like to go read it.  Again, I was advised not to respond.  And from here, we waited.  After GoFundMe's charges, I transferred the remaining $9,679.74 into my bank.  $2,100 of that would have to go to my lawyer, but I asked if they thought I was in the clear to go ahead and donate the rest of the money.  They gave me the go ahead and I reached out to donors on the GoFundMe to be transparent about my plan to donate excess money to the Innocence Project.  Donors expressed they liked this idea, so I went ahead and reached out to the Innocence Project and did an interview with Vanessa Podkin, the director of post-conviction litigation.  Vanessa has helped defend and exonerate over 30 wrongly convicted people.  She's incredible, and you can hear our full interview today on the God is Gray podcast.  Her latest call is to save the life of Purvis Payne, who's maintained his innocence for 33 years, but is scheduled to die by the death penalty on December 3rd, 2020.  Purvis also has an intellectual disability, which makes it unconstitutional for him to die by the death penalty.  So this very week, I had planned to share Purvis Payne's story with you.  I wanted to share his story and action statements, which are all linked below.  so that God is great community, we can advocate for this man's life.  Let's definitely still do that.  Please go follow the action links below.  But before I could donate the money, I was informed about this lawsuit.  Thankfully, my lawyers are amazing.  They knew I had already pledged money to the Innocence Project, so they gave me the go ahead to donate a smaller amount.  I will be sending $3,000 to the organization.  I will note that the Tolpins have set up their own donation page.  And I may be overlooking something, but I was not able to find transparency on how much money they're requesting, how much they've received, or what they mean when writing they plan to donate to a charity, quote, after our expenses of legal fees and time spent fighting for the truth.  Nor do I understand why they're saying their ministry cannot continue without suing me.  If they want to continue their ministry, they should continue.  And from what I've seen, they have not stopped putting out podcasts and videos.  As for the claim they've lost 15 to 38% of their revenue due to me, I do not believe this alleged loss has anything to do with myself, God is Gray, or Stell.  We are in a pandemic and we've all lost income.  Because this is a legal issue, I'm not going to bullet point and defend everything that the Tulpins have accused myself and Stell of doing.  But I will clarify several issues that I think are important.  First, and very importantly, the Tulpins allege that their children have received messages from this community online.  I know I can't control what this community or anyone does online, but I'm going to say right now that I do not want anyone in the God is Great community or otherwise reaching out to the Tulpins' children.  Two, the Tulpins believe that I deleted a live video with Stel because we were supposedly caught in lies.  The truth is, I like the engagement of lives, but I don't always keep them up.  I think you all know I have high standards on this channel, and the recording quality of lives is not always up to par.  and that's not something I like to leave up.  I wish I'd had the foresight to save the live, but I am not at all worried about that video being public.  Three, I will say that apparently I misstated that Angie and Isaac were deleting comments following the We Did It Out of Love video.  This was information I received from people in the God is Great community, but when Isaac claimed he didn't delete anything, I read that out loud and have not claimed he's deleted comments since.  Four, the Tulpins allege that I spliced pieces of Angie's homeschool video even down to splicing words together to change their meaning, which I absolutely did not do.  The video is linked below so you can look into that for yourself.  Disagreeing and commenting on the courageous parenting doctrine, a doctrine of which I still disagree, is not equivalent to the accusation of child abuse.  So here we are.  I simply wanted to tell you what has transpired.  Thank you so much for your support and donations.  And to enlist your help alongside of the Innocence Project to save the life of Purva's pain.  And again, all the pertinent materials are linked below so you can look into this yourself.  And please like, subscribe, share with your friends, donate to my Patreon or Venmo if you can.  I love you all so much.  God bless. ",
