There was no need to even bother the sergeant.  You're going to tell me that handing this paper was above that guy's pay grade?  I hope that guy's getting fucking volunteer pay.  You know what I mean?  So anyways, I'm here with him, the new auditor at San Diego, guys.  We'll get a link to his channel as soon as he decides what it's going to be.  That's how new he is.  He has been doing a little bit of work.  And he's been watching attentively, so he's learning.  Once we get his page up, I'll put a link, and you guys send him some love, show him some support.  All right, guys?  Hi, that's Community Watch.  The city of San Diego, we out.  This is where you pull in and get stuff inspected?  Thank you.  You guys are all upset. ",

Nobody gives a fuck what you got to say.  I take pictures of any vehicles I want, because the license plates and everything, that's the whole reason it's displayed for the public.  Don't be a fucking moron.  Okay?  That's why you can fucking take, that's why you can, that's how you run on fucking plates.  Fucking idiot.  Because you come up, you told me to move, motherfucker.

Yeah, fat ass.  Get the fuck out of here.  Look, you came up and tried to tell another fucking man to move.  You have no business what the fuck I do.  What you do is none of your fucking business what I do.  And you sit there telling me to move?  Who the fuck are you to tell me to move?  You're my public servant.  Yeah, exactly.  You laugh because that's how... I bet you've ruined a lot of lives with that fucking attitude.  Thinking you're not a public servant, huh?  Thinking you're not a fucking public servant.  I can see just by your smile.  People are going to see that.  You're going to be on the internet and you're going to get like 20,000 hits in one day.  Fucking moron.  Next time, just drive.
