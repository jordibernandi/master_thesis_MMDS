It's called the Answer Center at the Ark Encounter, where we have the life size Noah's Ark attraction.  We have a special announcement for you.  Now, this is really special.  We have special guests here.  And who are they?  Oh, I remember.  We have the Collingsworths with us today.  And you are coming back here April 8, 9, and 10.  You were here in 2019 and the place was packed.  It was sold out for what, three days?  Three days.  That was absolutely incredible.  You're coming back for three more exciting days at the Ark Encounter April 8, 9, and 10.  You won't want to miss this.  You may as well just move to Kentucky and move to Northern Kentucky here.  But I'm going to get Phil to tell us all about what's happening.  But five different sessions, three days.  You can get a ticket that includes entrance to the Ark Encounter, the Creation Museum, the parking, and of course, to sit in on some phenomenal programming.  not just the Collingsworth family, but many other guests as well.  So Phil, get us excited. ",

We'll be doing what we did last year, and we've got some great friends coming.  This crew right here are huge fans of Larnell Harris.  He has been a classic in the Christian music industry, and he's going to be joining us this year, along with Pastor Jim Cimbala, who's a very special friend of the Collinsworth family.

It was three days of just gathering together and worshiping the Lord.  And we had, as they said, phenomenal music.  Brooklyn Tabernacle, of course, was over the top, the choir.  And just so many, many great artists.  But we had a group of people for six months that fasted and prayed for this event.  And let me just tell you something.  It paid off because the people left encouraged.  They left very, very blessed in their hearts.  And we need that today more than ever.  We need that right now.  And so it was that that sticks in my mind.  probably more than anything else was the worship that took place.  And it was happy.  It was a joyful time.  It really was.  So that was my big deal.  And that's exactly what we're anticipating this year as well.  Greater Vision will be with us.  The Booth Brothers will be with us.  I've got to look on the screen to see Ken Davis, Gordon Mote, of course, Lornell Harris, the Collingsworth family.  And I'll tell you the most special thing to me, but let's let them talk first, then we'll come back to that. ",

And then we did several sessions, and then other groups like the Booth Brothers and Greater Vision and some great comedy, too.  From last year, we had Dennis Swanberg.  This year, we'll have Ken Davis, who is a hilarious Christian comedian, really just helps everybody just kind of relax in this big environment.

And so I grew up in a singing family and we are bringing 81 of my family members all here to the Ark on Saturday morning.  Some years ago we got together at Thanksgiving and we sang a song called Bigger Than Any Mountain written by Gordon Jensen around the piano at Thanksgiving and it became a YouTube kind of sensation and I don't know how many millions of views we've had.  and so that crew that you saw on that singing that song they're all coming here to the Ark And mother and daddy are coming and all of my siblings and grandchildren, nieces, nephews, whatever.  And we're going to sing harmony and we're going to tell of the goodness of God.
