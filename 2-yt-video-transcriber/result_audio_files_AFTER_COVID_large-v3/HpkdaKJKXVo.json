            "text": "I came all the way up from Atlanta to tell you this mission.  It's embarrassing.  All y'all embarrassing the whole nation.  Why?  You should have went.  You should have went and locked your boy up.  You should have locked him up.  You should have locked him up.  Why you didn't lock him up?  Why you didn't lock him up?  If you fire him, you know he should be in jail.  You know that.  You know that.  Y'all know you don't train.  nobody like that, man.  And I ain't out here stunting, so my mess is done.  You know, it's just a lot of pain, man.  You know, I do civil rights.  You know what I mean?  I'm the Georgia chairman for National Association of Equal Justice America.  I'm working the case right now for my Aubrey.  A couple hours, I got to be on the phone with the FBI.  You know what I mean?  It hurts.  We don't even got enough people trained to black people dying every day.  We don't even got enough civil rights leaders to respond to all this stuff all over.  I'm still with this.  I'm in Georgia.  We in Brunswick.  I got to catch a flight.  Same clothes, man.  I ain't even shower.  I got to catch a flight.  Same coat just to come up here and tell them what they know.  They went through training.  I don't know.  You'll pin nobody's knee on nobody like that.  But they think they're going.  They think people ain't going to call them out.  How you gonna fire somebody and not arrest him?  It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just pain, man.  This original sin is racism.  Like, yo, I appreciate everybody.  Like, when we start calling each other out, when we stop this blue, this blue shield stuff, when we stop that and we call it out, our nation gonna be better.  Like, look at this, man.  All this is embarrassing.  This is messing up the economy.  But when you back people on the wall, they try to make a point.  They're trying to say, yo, we don't like dying.  Because at the end of the day, Floyd could have been me.  You know what I mean?  It could have been you.  It could have been you.  It could have been you.  Because at the end of the day, regardless of the fact that this Black Lives Matter year, we got to respect that 100%.  But the police is just police state rogue.  They're killing people of all colors.  You know what I mean?  We still got it because slavery and human trafficking is real.  I'm still going to rock with Black Lives Matter all day long.  But these dudes are straight police state.  They will kill a dude regardless of their color.  And that get away with it.  The police accountability numbers is low.  You know what I mean?  So that's just me.  You know what I mean?  I did the lobbying with Oscar Grant's parents.  We passed the AB 392 in California.  It's one of the strictest use of force laws in the nation.  You know what I mean?  So we're going to be trying to probably do something up here again.  increase the law and the training on the state level.  Can you just expound upon that a little bit?  Well, first of all, I've got to give all blessings to Uncle Bobby, you know, Aunt BX, California Families United for Justice, you know what I mean?  The Families United for Justice, you know what I mean?  They're doing great things, you know what I mean?  Whoever is listening, If you got an issue with police accountability, you know what I mean?  You got to look up Uncle Bobby.  He's the greatest in the nation at it, right?  So when we come in, young dudes, we come in and we mad because it was a little lost.  The policy had to be watered down.  He's been in that thing since his nephew died.  And he teaches, you know what I mean?  So the only thing, the law is the law.  You know, it's past what it's past.  We didn't get everything we wanted on it.  We got some stuff, you know what I mean?  And it's the... They basically say it makes the use of force policy in the United States of America equal with international law.  But that's only in California.  Now we try and take that to the federal level and kick it out.  But people ain't even doing work in the federal level.  So now you've got to spread the knowledge.  And basically you take AB 392. copy and paste the clone and edit a little bit, and you get some lobbyists who know what lobbying is, and they push it out here in where we at, Minnesota?  I don't even know where I'm at.  I'm just, boom, okay.  Has it worked in California?  It's too early to say.  That was less than too early two years ago.  So you got to get the data to say.  You know what I mean?  Too early to say.  But look, all this stuff is patterns.  I got to come down here because I can't even believe the fucking news no more.  So I'm like, I need everybody.  Oh, you're gone.  Don't tell me nothing because I got to go find real people who know this dude.  Oh, yeah, people telling me real stories.  Yeah, oh, yeah, he let me in the club, this and that.  I got to get it first here, then I go, I ain't even seen the video.  I just came to find out what really real people think about it, what the real story is, you know what I mean?  And the thing is, as soon as they tell me this, as soon as they tell me that the same cop that murdered him killed somebody else, we in Oakland looking at data like that.  So when I'm telling state legislators that this is stupid, this is stupid that you don't got a law yet where when you fatally shoot somebody, yo, I get it that it's your livelihood at stake, but we got too many good ideas of how to give somebody another job, but they don't.  PTSD is real.  If you kill one dude, you know what I mean?  The data show you likely to kill somebody.  It's just sad that we come here.  We already knew this.  We knew this in Oakland, that the more than most of the killings come from people that killed twice.  Right.  If you kill once, you're going to kill again as a police officer.  So it's sad because we got to take this energy and then we got to eventually check, put policy in place where it's like, oh, you killed one person.  Here you go.  You go do security without a gun.  You know what I mean?  I'm a two-way fan, so let me clarify.  I'm not saying that you can't have your personal hammer on you, you know what I mean?  But you can't take that sort of employment no more because you already showed yourself unfaithful.  Last thing, man, I go all around the nation.  You go to London, the way people police here in America is stupid.  I talk to people, London police officers, they say, you know what?  We train to tell people what not to do.  We literally look at police film to see what not to do.  You feel like I'm in London and I'm talking to the dude being my girl.  I'm talking to the dude.  I'm about to go in my pocket.  I said, look, I'm just going to my pocket to get my cell phone.  He laughed.  He said, we ain't that jumpy around here. ",
