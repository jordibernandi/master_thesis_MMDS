One of his bird babies mated with another local chick, and aside from these two interbreedings, they have remained a reproductively isolated line.  They have a distinct beak shape, they are sized differently from the locals, and they have a distinct song.  This was a speciation event, specifically a homoploid hybrid speciation event where there isn't a chromosomal doubling.  This type of speciation event is rare, but has been observed several times in plants, butterflies, flies, fish, mammals, and birds.  Since macroevolution is simply evolution that happens above the species level, then by definition, these were macroevolutionary events. ",

            "text": "check number three when you're doing so.  Consider the source.  Is Answers in Genesis a reliable source for scientific information?  Well, let's just take a look at their website for a second.  Okay, under the Answers menu, I clicked on Evolution, and this is right at the top of the page.  Notice that they refer to people who accept evolution as evolutionists.  This is not a label that people generally self-identify with, so it strikes me as an attempt to create an us versus them dichotomy where one doesn't necessarily exist.  Then, when talking about evolution itself, they use derogatory language to throw shade on the part of evolution that they are most strongly opposed to.  Given that the worldview of this source is decidedly anti-evolution right from the get-go, I'm going to go ahead and use these derogatory phrases as evidence that AIG clearly has ulterior motives for making their case like this.  So AIG fails AIG's critical thinking check number three.  This is quite the contrast from the scientific sources that confirm evolution.  They openly disclose where they get their financial support from, and any shenanigans about hiding their financial backers can result in a retraction of their work.  Their work also has to be reviewed by other scientists working for other often directly competing organizations before it can be published.  And what's more, papers that have supported evolution or been supported by evolution have come from scientists of vastly different worldviews.  So applying AIG's critical thinking check number three to Answers in Genesis and to the reputable scientific journals, we find that AIG definitely has some worldview motivations that drive them towards certain conclusions over others, while the other accepts submissions from people regardless of their worldview, as long as the submission meets their stringent scientific requirements.  And yeah, sometimes bad papers do make it through, like that horrendous alien octopus paper.  But this is where the beauty of the system comes in.  You don't even have to wait for the next issue of the journal it was published in to find criticism of that paper.  With a quick commentary on it that ends with the line, \"...the main statement about viruses, microbes, and even animals which came to us from space cannot be taken  seriously.\".  So scientific journals pass AIG's critical thinking check, while AIG themselves do not.  Even if you count their research journal, which states right in their submission guidelines that your paper has to come to approved conclusions before they will consider publication, being so explicit as to state that the editor in chief will reject papers that don't conform to AIG's statement of faith, a statement which includes beliefs that contradict the scientific consensus in several areas.  In other words, you can't get your paper published by their research journal unless you agree with conclusions that they decided in advance were true.  So not only does AIG fail critical thinking check number three, their supposed peer-reviewed research journal fails it as well.  All this to say that if you are learning things from AIG resources like she just suggested, you are learning things that don't even pass AIG's own critical thinking standards. ",

It's the usual creationist tripe about no new information being created without ever clearly defining what they mean by information or explaining what constitutes new information.  It is often claimed by creationists that mutations cannot create information, only destroy it.  Usually, there is a heavy implication that the information is based on genetics with emphasis on new genetics.  Okay, so insertion mutations should count as new information.  then, right?  Because those happen.  Is a point mutation, one where a base pair simply swaps to another base pair, an addition of information?  And of course, all of this ignores the fact that most types of mutations are reversible.  If there is a point mutation in a sequence that was originally CGTTA, but then became CGTTG, did this count as new information or a loss of information?  Let's say that the mutation completely broke a gene.  Would it then be a loss of information?  OK, so in the next generation, there is another point mutation in the same place that brings it back to CGTTA.  If the first mutation was a loss of information, then this has to be a gain of information.  And of course, this also ignores things like gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer, which are more ways that your genetic code can get new information. ",

Are you trying to pitch me softballs?  But more than that, no, the beaks are not in and of themselves evidence that dinosaurs evolved into finches.  Because dinosaurs didn't evolve into finches, dinosaurs evolved in different populations over time, And one group of theropods develop traits that we now associate with birds.  And so we have the avian dinosaurs, which include finches.  And when discussing natural selection, it is easier to conceptualize it with regards to fairly small changes over short periods of time, like the finches beaks.  So those are the examples that they use.  These variations will add up when extrapolated out over long periods of time, but creationists love to point out that natural selection by itself only acts on traits that are already present, and so doesn't explain the origin of new traits.  And you're right.  The origin of new traits is not explained by natural selection.  But natural selection does not exist in a vacuum.  The new finches that we observed in a speciation event have traits that are not found in either of the parent species of the new hybrid species.  We watched these new traits develop.  Sure, you can complain that it's just a beak or just size or just a song.  But the fact of the matter is that these are traits that are absent in the parent lineages, making them new traits for that lineage by definition, making that a good example of evolution also by definition.

If you want to learn about how we know birds are dinosaurs, that will usually be in a separate chapter of the textbook with all sorts of evidence of its own, and without reference to these finches or any statements at all about how finch evolution is equal to the fossil evidence, because they're not even in the same category of evidence.

Considering how eager scientists are to criticize each other's work and find problems with it, I find this to be an unrealistic expectation.  But even so, the historical sciences are not anywhere near as unreliable as AIG would have you believe.  The historical sciences are often based on the nomothetic data.  A geologist, for instance, will recreate conditions in the lab to figure out how these conditions would have worked in nature.  Think of it this way.  The nomothetic sciences simply ask, if these conditions were found in nature, what will happen?  Well, the historical sciences say, hey, we found these conditions in nature.  Look what happened.  Of course, this is drastically oversimplified, but we're not supposed to be dealing with the actual claims here, just the critical thinking skills.  And by applying some critical thinking, we find that AIG is presenting a very skewed view of how science works in order to get their point across. ",

            "text": "See, this is what I was talking about.  We know that the rock layers are old, billions of years old in some cases.  How do we know this?  Is that through a direct observation or through an interpretation?  Well, if we go to radiometric dating, we directly observe the rate at which certain particles decay, and we directly observe the fact that these rates have been constant for as long as we've been able to measure them.  We directly observe situations in which these particles can enter or escape from rocks.  We directly observe what sort of signs are left behind on the rocks from undergoing these situations, etc.  So when we measure the amounts of these particles and rocks collected from nature, we perform calculations based entirely on direct observations and find that these rocks are millions to billions of years old.  Where does the line get drawn here?  We directly observe the rock in the present.  We directly observe all the features of the particles that we use to date it.  The only extrapolation into the past is the calculation itself, which is entirely based on direct observation.  So technically the calculation could be called an historical science, but it is so caught up in the direct observation part that it's difficult to attribute this to an interpretation based on a worldview.  In fact, to call radiometric dates into question, the creationist is left attempting to falsely prevent these direct observations as though they are interpretations.  Meanwhile, they are left assuming things for which there is absolutely zero evidence, like that the radiometric decay rates were different in the past.  Meanwhile, they ignore the fact that scientists are perfectly aware of the limitations of these dating methods, and so will usually date the same sample with multiple different methods when possible.  And since the decay rates are so different for these different particles, in order to come up with figures that agree with each other, each decay rate would have to have been changed not universally, but specific to each individual rock formation in just such a way as to give agreeing numbers with different decay rates.  It is completely unrealistic and runs counter to all of the evidence. ",
