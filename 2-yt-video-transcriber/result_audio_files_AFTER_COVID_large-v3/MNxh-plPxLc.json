            "text": "how's everybody doing?  my name is anthony brian logan and today we got to talk about candace owens gofundme account being suspended and the campaign that she was raising money for being totally terminated.  now there is a whole lot to quote unquote unpack here as the cool kids would say.  we got to talk about what this campaign was for why she was raising money and also why the campaign got suspended as well as her account.  that's two different things.  Then we got to talk about the general hatred, the unwarranted hatred and vitriol and jealousy and envy that Candace Owens gets from white liberals, black liberals, and also some black conservatives.  But let's start with this whole kerfuffle with the campaign and what happened there.  Now, a restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama called Parkside Cafe got into some hot water because of what the owner said in a private text message.  He texted.  I think it might have been the co-owner of the spot about George Floyd and this whole thing that was going on.  And our place said text on the screen before you.  All that he was saying was, look.  George Floyd was a thug.  Did he deserve to die?  No, he didn't.  But honoring him is disgraceful.  Honoring him is irresponsible.  And I don't see anything wrong with that.  That's 100 percent facts.  That's all facts.  OK.  George Floyd was a thug.  George Floyd did not live an honorable life, all right?  There's records of this, there's documentation of that, and if you wanna see it, I'll link it in the box.  You know, beating pregnant ladies in the head to ransack the crib, home invasion, finding drugs and guns, or trying to find drugs and guns, okay?  When he died, he was on drugs.  When they called him, when they called a 911 on him, they said he might've been high on drugs.  Methamphetamine, fentanyl, That does not mean he deserved to die.  Everybody says that.  However, if he were not living that kind of life, then maybe, just maybe, he would not be in that predicament to begin with.  That's all that he was saying.  And that echoes the sentiments that Candace Owens had in the Now Vow video.  And if you've not seen that, I'll place that in the box as well.  That's what she was saying.  And for that video, she got a ton of hatred, but also a ton of support on the low.  You know, she was saying on social media that she was getting all kinds of messages from people, all kinds of celebrities, football players, basketball players, politicians and whatnot.  They're saying, hey, I agree with you.  You're right on point.  But I can't say that publicly because I would be what a cool kid say, cancel.  I will lose my job.  I'll lose my position.  All right.  So that's that.  Now, as a result of his statement, you had three people that quit.  They were getting, laying basically all over the internet.  So Candace was like, okay, you guys are already dealing with the virus.  Now you're dealing with this.  I'll start a campaign to raise money for you.  Now that money that was raised for Parkside Cafe. ",
