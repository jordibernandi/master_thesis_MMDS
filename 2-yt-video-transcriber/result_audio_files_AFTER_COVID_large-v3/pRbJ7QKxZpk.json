            "text": "You touch a child in general, but especially over some political bullshit, you belong under the jail.  There isn't a punishment out there.  that is good enough for that.  Well, I'm on the road with Ryan Upchurch right now, and I wanted to just take a moment to talk about something with y'all because this is the type of stuff that makes my skin crawl.  So this woman's name is Ariel Robinson, and she was on a show called The World's Worst Cooks.  And I think she won like 25 grand on it.  But anyways, when someone is adopted... There's a process that they go through to make sure that this family isn't just going to go beat the shit out of them and leave them in a ditch somewhere.  And the system really failed on this one.  So this black woman, Arielle Robinson, adopted this white girl and later on beat her to death.  Beat her to death.  This woman, Arielle Robinson, has posts all over her Twitter with Black Lives Matter stuff, hating on white people, talking about white supremacy and white privilege and all this crap.  I still haven't figured out what white privilege is yet.  But how is a person who is that politically inclined to talk about Black Lives Matter able to adopt a person who she is online bashing?  What happened?  You were at a Black Lives Matter rally and you got pissed off and came home and beat the shit out of your daughter?  This has to stop.  And I said this in the Cannon Hennant video.  It's cool if you don't like white people.  It's cool if you like Black Lives Matter.  I don't judge you.  Do your thing.  But as soon as you bring children into any of this, you're lower than dirt, you're lower than pond scum, all of it.  You know, I had a guy message me on Instagram the other day, and he said, man, I really appreciate what you're doing for all the patriots in this country.  That's not what this is about.  Obviously, I care about our current situation in the nation, but what this is about... It's about molding the next generation.  Because right now, every five-year-old kid or any kid who's still in that mindset of, well, the world's so great, they have no idea what's going on.  And once they hit that point where their cognitive ability kicks in and they can start rationalizing stuff, they gotta be prepared for it.  Because right now, parents are teaching them that rainbow masks are cool, and if you get into a fight, smack them with a dildo type of thing.  But that's what this is about.  We need to prepare the next generation of people to handle the crap that's going on in America.  Because the people who are handling it right now in our government and everywhere else, they suck.  No backbone, none of it.  Even Republicans now are turning.  And that's why I think Trump is creating the Patriot Party.  I want to quote something from what this woman said.  So she's got a picture of her two black kids and then I think two white kids with them.  I'm going to quote this.  This is how fucked up this is.  I will never have to worry about my white sons and that makes me happy.  What makes me sad is that every worry I don't have for them will be multiplied for my black sons.  Until this is fixed, we are not the USA we can be.  Justice, fairness, and equality for all.  Hashtag Black Lives Matter.  So she's creating division in her own household.  She's got black kids and she's got white kids, and she's already telling the black kids that you have a tougher time than my two other white kids.  Well, are you treating them differently?  How America is right now, that is a household, that's a family, and they're dividing them.  They're saying, y'all are different.  And I've always said this, but I'm going to say it again.  Your race doesn't matter to me.  Where you're from doesn't matter to me.  What kind of accent you have doesn't matter to me.  How popular you are doesn't matter to me.  Do you have real American honorable values?  But the point of this video, because I know I'm going to get Black Lives Matter in here and Antifa in here and the left, and I'm going to hurt some feelings.  And you know what?  I'm good at doing that, so that's fine.  Stop bringing kids into your delusions.  Leave them out of it.  If you want to be a delusional idiot and talk about Black Lives Matter and how it's such a great movement and how they don't do anything wrong and it's just about helping black people, all of your damn donations went to Biden.  He's a white dude.  They're children.  They don't understand what's going on.  And if you put hands on a child, you don't belong in America.  You don't belong anywhere. ",
