I've got like three or four hours of battery.  A few moments later.  So when they're out here threatening violence on people that haven't hurt anyone else or stolen anyone else's property or damaged anything else, what did I say?  Thank you.  What did I say?  I said it on camera.  I'll say it again.  The truth fears no scrutiny. ",

            "text": "You're the one leaving.  It's common to find the Liberty Lake Police and other Blue Line gang members at this convenience store here in Liberty Lake.  In fact, their cars are parked here enough before and after shifts and on breaks and lunches that I would say it's safe to call it their hideout.  I noticed one of the vehicles the City of Liberty Lake uses for revenue generation parked there and decided I needed to document it and maybe ask the driver if he was doing regular patrols like he's admitted to me in the past.  The reason I ask is even though the car is marked, it doesn't meet the marking requirements of RCW 46.08.65 for local law enforcement vehicles not operating as undercover or as a special investigation unit.  I've also been told by the blue line loving mayor in Liberty Lake that the car was purchased and used as a drunk driving emphasis vehicle.  In their minds, where of course they can do no wrong, this makes it qualify for the RCW under the Special Investigations Exemption.  Even though the car is still being used for traffic enforcement, which is what the law is to prevent for the safety of the people.  I've even caught the driver of this vehicle bragging to his fellow order followers about how many more citations or extortion orders he can write in this ghost car.  Hmm, seems to me like it's being used for revenue generation.  I'll play that short clip of him bragging about it on Bodycam Neck. ",

It appears before she came out that she brags to her little blue line gang friends inside that she'll take care of me.  Karen comes out with the preconceived notions and gets her mind blown by the fact that she can't control me, make me leave, or even put me on blast because of what her and her gang member friends assumed I was here to do.  While you watch, remember to like, reblog, and share on all your social media, subscribe, and leave me a comment with your thoughts on Karen here.  Oh yeah, and if you want to let the store know your thoughts on how they treat the public, I've left some contact information as well as links to my sources in the description below. ",

It's an easement.  If I was doing something wrong, go tell the cops and they'll come talk to me.  You're in view of public.  You're making a big deal about nothing.  When you come into public and your view of public, you have no expectation of privacy.  I don't have a mask on either.  Who said anything about a mask?  I didn't say anything about a mask.  I said you have no expectation of privacy in public.  He'll tell you.  You're out in a public area.  If you wouldn't have come out, you wouldn't have been on film.  I'm here for these guys.  They're the ones breaking laws, not me.  But now you're going to be a YouTube star.  If you think I'm doing something wrong, go tell them.  They'll tell you I'm not.  Turn the camera around so they can see that you're breaking the laws as well.  What law am I breaking?  What law am I breaking?  What law am I breaking?  What law are they breaking?  Well, the guy over there in the Liberty Lake car that has the ghost car, he uses that for traffic patrols, and that's illegal.  Is it?  Yeah, 46.08.65.  It's an RCW.  Whatever.  Nice try.  Glad you defend them.  They're not going to defend you when it comes to it.  They didn't just now.  They don't need to.  I'm not in danger.  It's all right.  You're representing your company well.  I would like you to know that you're 86 from our premises.  Good.  Okay.  If you come in, you will be arrested.  Okay.  Why would I ever come in there again?  This is a publicly accessible sidewalk.  Yeah, so does everyone else that's in a neighborhood over there.  Nope.  I'm on a publicly accessible sidewalk publicly accessible sidewalk.  They knew I wasn't doing anything wrong or they would have come and said something.  They're letting me handle it Because they know that I'm not dating them.  There's nothing they can do.  So what's your other law that would grow from there?  Because that's not in my score.  What are you talking about?  I'm just curious why you're here.  Because I always document the police.  Yeah.  It's a shame for you.  Whatever.  When you're done, you can leave.  I will be here this evening.  Oh, okay.  We can have some fun with this.  I can go live.  We can have all sorts of fun.  I've got like three or four hours of battery.  It's under your footage.  We'll see.  You're not being a very good representative of your store.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm asking you to get off my property.  I'm not on your property.  This is a public easement.  You want me to stand on the street?  Yes, you do.  Nope.  I'm not moving.  Move me.  You don't want me here.  Get me to leave.  I'm not moving.  Go for it.  Publicly accessible sidewalk.  It's called an easement.  Everyone has it.  Like at my house, it goes actually about halfway into my front yard that I have no control.  if someone wants to walk on there.  Look it up.  Think you know the laws so much?  I love that you're shaking.  I hope your footage sucks.  Oh, I have image stabilizers.  I'm shaking because I'm a shaky person.  I have like a condition that makes me do that.  That's cool.  I'm taking care of that condition.  Why would I take care of it?  I'm outside living my life.  I'm outside living my life.  Why do you want to put restrictions on people that aren't hurting anyone else and are in public?  I didn't put any restrictions on anyone.  What?  How is my footage putting a restriction on someone?  I'm documenting the police because they're always like that guy.  Every time he breaks, every time he gets in that car and he's not using it for special investigations, he's breaking the law.  That's why I'm documenting him every single time he gets into it.  So why are you documenting inside the store then?  Because I document everything they do.  They're public servants.  I unwillingly pay their salary. ",
