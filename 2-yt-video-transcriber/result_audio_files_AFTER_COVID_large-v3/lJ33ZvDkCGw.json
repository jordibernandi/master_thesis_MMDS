            "text": "Good evening, friends.  Stephen Benoon here with Israeli News Live.  And we have received some intel this evening about a movement of the Chinese Navy.  Something that was received earlier this afternoon around 3, I don't know, about 3.50  p.m.,  4 o'clock in the afternoon Eastern Time.  And I have been on multiple, multiple calls with different friends from around the world trying to get an idea of what is going on.  What is this Chinese Navy movement?  Where is it happening at?  And, of course, it is... It is a very complex issue that we're dealing with.  I got some extra information in regards to this as well, but still I am not sure as of today, or I should say as of November the 6th, what that movement actually is.  I know that a good friend out of Israel had sent me information, including like this article here, where Japan could face the brunt of the Chinese Navy as Beijing drafts another powerful law over contested waters.  And in the article here, it goes into this year alone The Chinese have been in Japanese waters 285 times.  I was also told about how that the Philippines leader, Duterte, is claiming he's going to drill oil in the South China Sea in violation of what China considers their sovereign waters, something that could bring about war.  in that region of the world.  We have Rick Wiles of True News who had also spoke about the issues being on the brink of war with China right now.  And so there's a lot of talk been out there about the issue with China.  And then I get information in today, very credible information about the Chinese Navy is moving their ships around, something that could not be discussed in detail.  In reaching out to another friend, they also were in communication with military personnel that is claiming that the U.S.  military has moved troops to our southern border as well as our northern border here in the United States, along with Canada and with Mexico.  And that we were told that the Chinese have been working with the drug cartels out of Mexico.  And they're concerned about a possible invasion of the United States.  Now, I don't think from what I've seen thus far, that the Chinese naval movement is directed at the mainland U.S From what it appears, it may be more so South China Sea, something like that.  But we're already in a quagmire over this election.  And no doubt the election is something that is... could end up turning into a major chaos as it is.  And then to top it off with possible war, things like that.  at this time, it's just not good.  we're trying to get more information though before i really go into this i was on earlier tonight with uh brock knight uh dr june knight's son speaking about the sabbath and so i haven't had a chance really to sit down and go deeply into this and to go back and corroborate some of this information.  I have had other intel sources claiming that they are aware that there is a movement of the Chinese Navy, that it is a threat to our own national security, but still waiting to get some confirmation as they're doing a little deeper digging as well.  So in the morning, hopefully I can get some more information for you guys and share that with you.  As of right now, unfortunately, I don't want to say too much about this because I want to have very good information before I do.  This here is... Satellite photos also.  that appeared just a couple of days ago.  No, it was the day before yesterday.  Again, it was showing the Chinese Navy's amphibious assault ships, the Type 075 in the South China Sea.  It seems it is going to leave for a return is what it says on there.  But still, we just don't know what's going on as of yet.  But there are a lot of tensions, and a lot of the intel people that have responded back to me are saying, They're going to dig a little deeper as well, but they have already heard that there are some major issues going on with China that could affect the United States.  I'm Stephen Benoon.  We'll update you tomorrow. ",
