            "text": "Did David Wilkerson prophesy about the coronavirus back in 1986?  If you had heard Pastor Dave in the late 70s, early 80s, he was speaking a lot about coming judgment.  Years after that, he continued to speak about those things.  That was a major theme of his life and ministry, calling for repentance.  In his book, The Vision, he did talk about calamitous times and some of the specific things he's spoken of have come to pass.  But did he bring a specific word back in 1986 about this?  Well, this has been a topic of major conversation since Mike Evans preached a very strong message, felt that this is a word from the Lord, and called for repentance.  in America, said God is judging our idols.  God is going to bring a great awakening, but we need to humble ourselves and repent.  I really resonate with so much of what Mike said in the message.  And As he is declaring this message, he said that he grabbed an old Bible off his shelf, and to his shock, a note fell out from the Bible, and it was a personal note.  He had scrawled out some words after meeting with David Wilkerson in 1986.  Well, here's what he says Pastor Dave said back then.  Quote, \"...I see a plague coming on the world and the bars.  Churches and government will shut down.  The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it's never been shaken.  The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles.  And repentance will be the cry from the man of God in the pulpit.  And out of it will come a third great awakening that will sweep America and the  world.\".  Now, that absolutely sounds like something David Wilkerson could have said.  But the problem was no one close to him ever heard him say that.  Now, because I spoke at Times Square Church for David and Don Wilkerson many, many times, between 40 and 50 times in the early 90s up to 1995, I was brought in on this.  And others that had been on his pastoral team were brought in on this.  And Don Wilkerson, who was about 80 years old, Don himself called me, and we talked about this.  None of us can verify him saying this.  Carter Conlon, who served with him and became the senior pastor and was there for years, he could not verify it.  No one else on his pastoral team could verify it.  None of them had ever heard him say this.  It sounds like something he could have said, but did he?  So I reached out to Mike Evans.  Mike and I have known each other over the years, spent some time together over the years.  We're friends, but many years will go by without us seeing each other.  So I reached out to him, and I do not personally believe that he would manufacture this, that he would make this up.  And his message stands and falls completely apart from this prophetic word allegedly from David Wilkerson.  All right?  So... I personally don't think that Mike would write something on a piece of paper and claim this was that.  Now, did he remember wrong?  Was he exaggerating?  So those are fair questions to ask, right?  You're talking about someone else's words.  They're not here to say yes or no to them.  So I asked him, I said, hey, from my eyes only, and just to let the Wilkerson family know, would you take a picture of that piece of paper?  Now, you could still say that he wrote it out himself, right?  You could still make that claim, but then that's really going far.  And like I said, the message itself stands or falls without this.  So he did it for me.  He was willing to do it.  Now, I don't have liberty to release it publicly.  Now, I can't prove it hasn't been forensically analyzed to go back to 1986.  And if someone wants to spend the money to do that and gets Mike Evans permission to do it, perhaps I'll let you do it.  All right.  And get the thing forensically analyzed.  But it's not every word there, okay?  It's not every word.  It is rather kind of cliff notes, all right?  So in other words, that main message is what he sent me, but in a handwritten scroll and cliff notes of it.  So I would say if you're going to manufacture it, just personal opinion.  If you are going to manufacture it, then you're going to write it out word for word rather than a scrawled Cliff Notes version.  But the substance of it is absolutely what Mike has published.  And perhaps when he went back and found that, the little details of it just, he remembered it then.  You say, but why a situation like this?  Well, perhaps for such a time as this.  You see, Mike was also struck by the fact that David Wilkerson had warned about the fall of PTL back then and said within 12 months what was going to happen.  And basically 12 months to the day, what he said happened.  It was striking.  It was scary.  It was intense.  And Brother Dave spoke to me about some major ministries he had warned years ago.  He didn't just go around saying this all the time, but he talked to me about it and what the root sin was and why these things came down.  And it produced the fear of the Lord in you.  So here's what I believe, although we cannot verify this.  I do not believe Mike Evans created this out of thin air.  I do not personally believe, knowing Mike, that he actually forged this letter and claims that it's from David.  I don't believe that personally, all right?  And I believe it could be that for such a time as this, The word was hidden and now released.  Perhaps it will get many that don't know David Wilkerson to go back and listen to his stirring wake-up call messages.  Go online and just type in David Wilkerson, call to anguish, and you will hear the heart of the man of God that I deeply, deeply respected and worked with closely for a period of four years.  It could be that God is getting our attention to say, yes, I'm shaking everything, but be believing me for a great awakening.  Let the repentance go deeper.  Is it possible that Mike, in filling in the words, does not have every syllable right?  That's possible.  But I would just say, look at this seriously.  I can't prove it.  I'm just giving you my personal opinion.  But as someone who worked with David Wilkerson, who's been in touch with the family, who knows Mike Evans and was in direct contact with him and was sent a picture of his scrawled handwritten note.  I personally believe this could well be accurate.  Let me read it again.  I see a plague coming on the world and the bars.  Churches and government will shut down.  The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it's ever been shaken.  The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles.  And repentance will be the cry from the man of God on the pulpit.  And out of it will come a third great awakening that will sweep America and the world.  I'll just say this last thing.  If that is a true word, then things go much deeper still in terms of repentance, in terms of crying out, in terms of a proper response.  Because to the degree of our hunger, to the degree of our repentance, to that degree will awakening come.  May the will of God be done.  May he awaken us.  May he turn us to repentance and holiness.  May he turn us to fresh faith and encounter with Jesus.  May we within the church experience revival.  May it spread to the society as a great awakening. ",
