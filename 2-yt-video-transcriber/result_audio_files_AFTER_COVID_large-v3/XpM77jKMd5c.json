            "text": "Okay, good.  Had some technical issues.  Anyway, so this is a timeline of year zero, what remains to us.  Here we are at this point starting.  So that's June 8th.  And we'll actually say that here is the end of the year.  And this is January of 2021.  So it's January of 2021.  A lot of this stuff is going to be... resolved, or if not resolved, waning, or if not waning, dampened off, or if not dampened off, then frustrated, which is to say, barriered or constrained, but not active.  And that's going to be relative to the emotional wave that we're all living through at the moment.  So let's do that.  Let's draw this as a big wave from space.  And a big wave of energy is from space.  It's moving through our time and pushing that way.  And the wave contains any number of elements in that wave that we have to deal with.  All of which have giant emotional components which were maybe... and I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that will dispute it, picked up by our processing years ago, only attributed to the years 2017.  So we were off by a few years, okay?  The long range data always was 19 months and its error rate is 19 months.  So we had a range of 38 months that the data sets could be shifted within.  And so in that sense, a lot of the stuff does appear to be happening in the first half of this year with possible projected platforms or potentials for the remainder of it happening in the latter half of this year, if that is the case.  So let's say if.  So if that's the case, then the projection for the future history is that by the time we're in January, we should be able to look back at some significantly key events that had been forecast in those previous reports.  And the significantly key events, yeah, there's going to be all of the cryptos and the the economic issues as we run into this kondratif forecast economic winter of capitalism, debt winter.  and the resulting impacts.  There's going to be impacts because of the debt hitting resource limitations, not because the resources have gone.  The earth is still as plentiful and as bountiful as ever.  It's just that the way we had gone about obtaining them and distributing them was all based on debt, which is crumbling.  So we have an unsure mental footing for continuing.  And you know, basically things are going a little pear-shaped everywhere and we're all sliding sideways.  A lot of it has to do with a slippery layer of debt that we're trying to work out within our system.  And as these emotional waves roll through us, or through time this year, dragging us or pushing us, whichever way you want to think about it, the various different things that we have to be concerned about will, at various different times, come to the fore.  So right at the moment, we're coming out through the... And so at the moment, the disease is not a pushing part of the bow wave.  It's sort of being subsumed by the current bow wave, which at the moment is, let's just say, cultural revolution.  And so it's not racism per se that's going on.  It's a cultural revolution that's being promulgated.  And that wave is expected, along with all of these, to be subsumed by other waves that will come on in that will have slightly different shapes, variations and pushes forward and so on as we go through the various events that all of these things are interconnected with.  so for instance we've got back here we've got this initial economic wave and the economic wave will come out again and maybe it'll be going way out like that.  emotionally.  this is this is a a timeline here.  so we have time and flowing that way and this range here is our emotional range right and the impacts of all of these things.  And so here we have, this is the economic.  And then we're gonna have, as a direct result of the cultural revolution ripple within these waves, we'll have a social disruption wave.  that will ripple through and maybe we'll end up calling it uh you know the collapse of law.  and so so maybe law collapses here in the west right and we've uh still got our our covid disease wave.  and so as we get further out into time here we'll have more of these COVID waves that will each in their turn take their impact on and push the society further and further and further through our year here.  and so the economic waves can be expected to do the same and some of them might be very sharp and some of them might be huge and pushing involving lots and lots and lots of people and some of them may be broken And some of them may just simply run out.  And these are, again, like I say, the emotional waves that are going around.  And we have the disease wave, and so as a result of the will have a have a crashing of disease and the social conditions as the hospitals and so forth actually are impacted by the collapse of the rule of law.  and no no economic support and this sort of thing and so we'll start seeing extreme disruptions fall along with the disease wave as we go forward through the year.  And so each wave of the disease will bring significantly more dead people in it, not because of the disease becoming more virulent or anything.  It'll be actually more a condition of people going into... So here's June.  Here we are at the end of January.  And so we've got December in here.  And so we'll just say... So here's our equinox.  And so from there, our vitamin D levels are dropping.  And that means that the rate of the impact of the disease will be rising as we go from this point into here.  And this is for us here in the Northern Hemisphere.  Mostly I'm discussing the United States, but of course a lot of this stuff will apply to Europe, Russia, et cetera, et cetera.  As we get into this, the Southern Hemisphere will be rising with fewer deaths, fewer disruptions, and so on from the disease simply because the vitamin D levels will be rising as well.  There we go.  And that's our future history for year zero.  Now, there's a couple of interesting things that have been forecast.  Some of them include sometime in summer here.  So in this band in here.  we were going to get a surprise from officialdom, which seemed to be driven by desperation.  And the desperation may just be all of this mass right here that gets them.  But during this period of time, we were going to get this release of... of secret tech, right?  Now, we don't know how it'll come out.  We don't know how the release will come out.  There was language for riots that spilled over.  Now, at the time that the language was written down, it was described as food riots, but the cause of the riot and the descriptions were independent.  So, it was just a supposition.  it was food riots at the time.  primarily because of all the language about, you know, the global warming and we're all doomed, et cetera, et cetera.  But anyway, those riots were also in this period of time, although they were more towards into fall.  And those right there, the riots were also indicated to bust into places in, you know, secret bases.  Let's just put it that way.  Secret bases... and they were going to end up liberating information.  These two are temporally interrelated, but they're not causative of each other, and the absence of one doesn't affect the appearance of the other.  They just showed up in the same data sets.  But the release of tech was very interesting because it was going to be presumably a lot of the space alien kind of stuff that's been hidden.  And it was going to be used to basically change the future of social unrest and discord.  It was interpreted as being an act, well, the data set said that it was an act of desperation.  Now it's interpreted, at the time that I wrote the report, as being an act of desperation within the power structure to overcome all of this right here relative to mob action and so on, right?  But I don't know.  It's very difficult to say.  We are on an interesting course.  I'm going to keep examining these data sets and see what kind of other information we can tease out of the old data set because the description is accurate, although the timing was always wonky anyway.  But the timing was really screwed by the... collision with the spew coming out of the Cosmic Disclosure Program.  So I can't count on the timing, but our descriptions are really matching up with current events, and that gives me some level of interest in digging through them.  while I'm sorting through all of these other messes I'm working on and trying to get some other things going.  So Basically, that's it.  I'll make a series of these videos relative to the future history as I get deeper into the data sets.  We still are within this range here where the release of tech and whatever the cause riots that get into the secret base are within the realm of current probability.  Now, we also need to note that this includes the attack on the Vatican and the Vatican Library.  all of that stuff was together in language.  And if ever there was a conditional time when there could be simultaneously or near-simultaneously language, spillover riots into, you know, secret NSA bases and secret space alien rebuild bases in the U.S.  and the Vatican Library, it would seem to be these days.  So we're in a very interesting time, and the data sets seem to be lining up.  A lot of the sets appear to be accurate, although, as I say, the timing components are off.  But I'm not examining the data that we have relative to timing at the moment, only to accuracy in correlation with not only developing reality in the language being expressed, but with other potential forecasts that could be teased out of that language.  And I had a very specific purpose.  I'm not getting into the cryptos or any of that kind of stuff.  Such information as I make it out of this, I'll make little videos as I go along, I'm going to try and keep them short.  I just don't have a whole lot of time.  I've got to try and get a bunch of crap done again.  And the universe is not particularly cooperative at the moment.  Although I do expect that as we get into this period here, so if this is June, let's just say that we're going to get into July like right there.  Okay, so this was going to be our hot couple of months here.  And as we get towards the end of July, perhaps things will ease up a bit relative to some of these other projects that I want to get moving.  I've had some tremendous epiphanies as a result of Boscovich and his work, and I'm now on to part three of that book.  as we get into the application of the theory to physics, which in that sense, in the way in which Boscovich uses that word, is also the application of the theory to the science of what we would think of as materials and material design.  And it's really quite fascinating.  So 17 minutes.  Okay, so that's it for this one.  Much to do.  And, you know, many people still pissed at me, still fighting Twitter and stuff.  So always check the website, halfpasthuman.com.  You can find the link there to buy the Pure Sleep stuff.  That helps support us and keep us going.  We don't have any surety that Twitter will let me post from one minute to the next.  Same thing with YouTube.  So I'm keeping a somewhat low profile and trying not to trigger any of their language.  And I'll see everybody.  Thanks. ",
