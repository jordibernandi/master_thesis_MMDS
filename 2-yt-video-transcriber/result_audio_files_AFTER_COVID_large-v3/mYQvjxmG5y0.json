            "text": "Good rising, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praise to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawah Shai.  Prayer to the Most High blesses this lesson this evening.  Gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past in order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth.  So we get a much better understanding of things that are assumed to come on the earth.  We're going to just take a look at a few verses from Deuteronomy 28, and we're going to prove that these curses were definitely worldwide, but they had their origination here in the Americas.  You're going to see how Scripture has been fulfilled over here in the Americas in the fourth part, as well as these curses, you know, had their beginning here in the fourth part as well.  And the curse is now being switched from the most highest chosen people to the other nations.  See, now you should understand why it was talking about how it's going to be like the days of Noah, because the vast majority of the world is looking to the other half of the world for the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.  And it's not fitting.  As hard as they try to keep on bringing up Russia, bringing up Iran, bringing up all these Arab nations, as far as being fulfillment of prophecy, it's not fitting.  It's like a whole charade over there.  And they keep on saying, oh, they're going to attack.  They're about to do this.  They're about to do that.  But then nothing ever happens.  And it doesn't fit what the scriptures say.  we talked about, we're going to be talking a little bit about the plagues.  And we know that when the Europeans came, the plagues hit our people over here.  The plagues came, you know, and of course they explained it away as they already had these antibodies and they've already been exposed to all these things and, but the natives never had.  So there's, That's why their disease is just killed.  They do it on purpose.  It was just happened to just work out that way.  Even though the Most High talked about in Deuteronomy 28, which we're going to be reading a little bit, how the plagues were going to be sticking to the people who are cursed.  And that's exactly what happened.  The plagues stuck to our people because we didn't follow the ways of the Most High.  And the Most High said he was going to bring people over here.  And they knew this.  They were well aware that if they were allowed to come over. ",
