            "text": "How's the royal family?  I pray that everyone is doing well.  Well, my royal family, y'all know over here on the true royal family and true royal, y'all don't know what I'm going to put up.  Well, I feel like singing again, my royal family.  I'm in that mood, mode or mood or whatever you want to call it.  And so, um, I'm going to sing Miss Silly Blues.  I'm going to sing parts of it.  So I'm just featured in, you know, you know, I'm going to put my spin on it and I'm going to dedicate this to my royal granddaughter, Nadia.  Oh yes, yes, yes.  So what I'm going to do, my royal family, I'm going to sing this three times because I love to keep my vocals, um, And that is my first love, music.  That would be probably the only thing that could possibly pull me away from YouTube.  If I could, I think I could make a great background singer.  I don't think I would be the greatest up front.  You know, I'm just being real about it.  But this is my first love, music.  And anybody that wanna know anything about me, I can play the violin and the clarinet.  I've been writing songs since the age of nine.  And sometimes I get a little bit sad that I didn't fully pursue my music.  I can write songs off the top of my head.  Y'all know when I do those videos, the cave and the coons, the way I do those videos, I speak strictly from emotions.  So anyway, my royal family, I'm going to make this attempt three times.  And y'all tell me, was number one vocal good?  Number two or number three?  Or were they just all bad?  And I need to, you know, find another occupation.  I can laugh at myself, my royal family.  But truly, music is healing to the soul.  And I thank our Father Yah for blessing us.  The royal family with the gift of music, all of the atrocious things that we deal with.  So sometimes I will invoke humor on this channel as much as possible because there are so many serious things that we have to deal with here in this world.  being treated the way that we continue to be treated knowing that we are a sacred people and come from a royal priesthood.  so that's how i get down over here.  if anybody's new to the true royal family and true royal you just don't know what you're gonna get over here.  all right my royal family.  so i'm gonna do my best my very best rendition.  Oh, Sister, you've been on my mind.  Oh, sister, we're two of a kind.
