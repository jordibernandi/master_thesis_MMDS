Okay, maybe some of you stopped watching now, but please do us a favor, keep watching, because next up is the mission work, and it's carried out by our team in Pakistan, and it's all funded by the viewers.  So turn up the volume, the music's really, really good, and take a look.  People, this is amazing.  You know, we're advancing.  The doors are opening up for us.  The people want to be our teams.  And also the people really, really want to receive a Bible as well.  So that's so encouraging.  And while the door is open, you know, we will push because we want to break new ground.  You know, our mission really is breaking ground.  And it's just really, really exciting.  And, you know, And this is not just us sort of pushing.  This is you pushing also, people, because this is a team effort.  And just really want to underline that your encouragement and your prayers really does help advance this mission and really does help put a Bible into the hand of people.  So thank you all for that.  And the foundation of this mission is based on love.  And that's the love for the Lord Jesus.  And also it's the hunger to share that love with others.  So, and why Pakistan, the Holy Spirit has opened up the door to Pakistan.  That's certainly not our choice.  That was his choice.  And so we're just following his lead at the moment.  That's why Pakistan.  So it's just going all so well, people.  Okay, right.  We mentioned about the Bibles.  So we want to just show you this.  So we have been offered these bibles and it's 1400 bibles and to be honest people we want to take the lot.  so we've had some money left over from the last bible purchase.  so thank you all so much.  who have been supporting this?  you know who you are?  so out of the 1400 we only need to raise money for 950 bibles which is super cool.  and um.  and on top of it for some reason the bible prices have gone down slightly and the exchange rate is pretty good.  So it's $4.31 a Bible.  That's a big drop off, isn't it, Chris?  We've had a big drop in the cost of Bibles.  A box of 20 is gonna be only $86.20.  So it all comes to, for everything, it's $4,094.50.  So that's the cost to buy the whole lot.  So we're really excited about this.  And I wanna underline, people, If you can't afford to give, then don't do that.  Please don't.  We're not asking everyone to give.  It's just a gift on your heart.  And just if you like Bible mission, then that's great.  If you don't want to give, then that's totally cool.  But we've pinned a comment to the top if you want to support.  And we use PayPal.  And it's the only... way that we can take donations for this particular particular mission and you just yeah you can choose a debit card or credit card or whatever but you can't send us any checks.  we're based in England.  we just can't do that.  so sorry people it's just it's just PayPal.  so but yeah if you can support the mission that'd be.  that'd be amazing.
