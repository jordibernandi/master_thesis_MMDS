            "text": "They would like to order quite a few F-35s.  It's the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by far.  Stealth.  Totally stealth.  You can't see it.  Makes it very difficult.  I was asking a pilot, what do you think is better, this one, this one, that one?  He said, well, the advantage we have is you can't see it.  So when we're fighting, they can't see us.  These pilots that I meet, they look better than Tom Cruise, and they're definitely tougher.  And he's a nice guy.  We have some of our great business leaders and leaders, period, right behind me.  I may ask Marilyn Lockheed, the leading woman's business executive in this country, according to many.  And we buy Billions and billions of dollars worth of that beautiful F-35.  It's stealth.  You cannot see it.  Is that correct?  Better be correct, right?  With the Air Force warning a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is, you know, almost like an invisible fighter.  Hi.  I was asking the Air Force guys, I said, how good is this plane?  They said, well, sir, you can't see it.  I said, yeah, but in a fight, you know, a fight like I watch on the movies, a fight, they're fighting.  How good is it?  They say, well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it.  Even if it's right next to it, it can't see it.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  But I mean, we have equipment that nobody has the equipment.  Nobody has the equipment.  So amazing that we're ordering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new airplanes, especially the F-35.  Do you like the F-35?  I said, how does it do it in fights?  And how do they do in fights with the F-35?  Said we do very well.  You can't see it.  You literally you can't see it.  So it's hard to fight a plane that you can't see, right?  But that's an expensive plane that you can't see.  That's an expensive plane that you can't see.  Hello?  The F-35 aircraft, that's the most sophisticated aircraft in the world, jet fighters.  Total stealth.  They're hard to find.  They're hard to see.  Therefore, they're hard to beat.  It's very tough to beat a plane when you can't see it.  Marilyn Lockheed.  Thank you, Marilyn.  You've done a fantastic job.  Thank you, Marilyn.  Hey, Fred.  She makes a plane you can't see.  It's stealth.  F-35.  I hope you can't see it, at least, right?  Great job.  Thank you very much. ",
