            "text": "Okay, so I've been seeing tons of videos on red flags that men exude, but I haven't seen any on the ones that females exude.  But since equality is about accepting equal responsibility, gentlemen, here are 10 toxic traits that you should look out for in women.  Number one, the one that is the most overlooked, but probably the most commonly said, I don't want to talk about my past.  Why the fuck don't you want to talk about your past?  What did you do?  Kill a bunch of puppies?  Are you guys freshly dating and has she already love?  bombed you?  Fucking run.  People who say that they love you, like right off the bat, way too soon, before you guys even have built a connection, are nine times out of ten just trying to manipulate you.  It's a huge red flag.  Next is she's often saying things like, every guy I've dated has just been an asshole.  Now, relationships are a part of life and relationships are a two way street, which means nine times out of 10, there's always things that we can be contributing.  And sometimes we get in relationships with just really shitty people.  But to say that every single person that you've picked has been shitty.  Well, if you believe her, what does that say about you?  If you are seeing a girl that recently got out of a relationship, back off, leave, just go because you're most likely a rebound.  And if you're not a rebound, they haven't had enough time to work through the feelings and the emotions and the loss of losing that relationship.  You're most likely going to get hurt.  Next is, is she unreliable and has a shitty work record?  Huge red flag for like... dependency on you, you need an independent woman, okay?  You need one that can handle their shit, get up and do the shit they need to do in a day so that it doesn't all fall back on you.  Next is, have you noticed her asking you about your vulnerabilities?  And then when you tell her what they are, she starts making fun of them and just saying, oh, it's a joke, but really she's demeaning you.  Yeah, well, she did that on purpose.  And that's just, it's a huge red flag for emotional abuse.  Last but not least, gentlemen, the biggest red flag is that she doesn't like your friends, your family.  It doesn't matter.  She's trying to convince you that every person in your life is just trying to hurt you, manipulate you.  They don't know what's best for you.  She is grooming you to abuse you.  So what she's doing is trying to isolate you because she knows that those people around you are going to be the ones that point out that she ain't shit.  Thank you. ",
