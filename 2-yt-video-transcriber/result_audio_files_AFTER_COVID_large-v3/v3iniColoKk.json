            "text": "It's been coming for a long time, folks.  It's been coming for a long time, and what a perfect title for this video.  It's the death of Sasha Daygame.  It's one of those things that we really avoid, don't we?  We really avoid the death thing in our Western culture.  Nobody talks about it.  Just don't talk about it.  It'll be fine.  In my experience, on the journey of being a human, every single one of us is going to be dying over and over and over again.  Actually, every single time you have a major shift in your life, the old you has died.  And it's one of those constants.  Everybody is changing all the time.  Are you the same person that you were 10 years ago, five years ago, one year ago?  I'm not the same person I was like six weeks ago, bro.  Even last week's dude is like not this, not this dude.  Great dude, like him, not this dude.  You know what I'm saying?  And even the people who are not doing the personal work, they're not really interested in, you know, waking up, all that stuff, and you might look at some of these, and I have friends like this, you look at them and you go, man, that's pretty much the same guy as he was in high school.  Still, they're changing.  Maybe not as fast, you know, maybe in their own way, but everybody's changing and evolving.  With me, it's been a bit of a, it's been a big journey.  Boy, there's been a lot of dying.  Holy shit.  I know what you're thinking.  But we can see you.  You're right there.  Sasha's right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm right here.  But Sasha Daygame, he's not here.  Now, where this name came from is actually interesting because my real name, my actual birth name, it's a nice name.  I like the name, Alexander Lazarev.  It's a good name.  And Sasha, if you don't know, in Russian is actually short for Alexander.  So just like in English, if your name is, you know, Richard, everyone calls you Dick.  Doesn't make any sense, but that's what, that's how it is.  So same thing.  So my name is actually Sasha.  So it's not weird.  You don't have to, you don't have to call, you can still call me Sasha.  It's still okay.  But the day game has gone out the window.  So where did that name come from?  It's interesting.  So back in the day when I got into the whole pickup subculture movement, I was obsessed.  I was obsessed with getting me a girlfriend, lots of girlfriends, getting me some poon poon.  It was the greatest, most exciting journey ever.  It was fantastic.  It was great.  I wouldn't change it.  But I had to use another name.  I was a professional comedian at the time.  So I'm like, I need another alter ego.  And I didn't want to pick a name.  that was like really strange.  I didn't want to be hanging like in a club or something talking to this beautiful lady.  And some dude is there.  He comes in, chats to me.  He leaves.  And the woman turns to me.  He's like, why did that guy call you Red Dragon?  No, I didn't want that.  So I'm just like, well, I'll go with Sasha because it's my Russian name anyway.  And then just have a day game just happened, right?  That's the art of meeting and connecting with women in the daytime.  That was my whole thing.  I kind of popularized it.  I, I, this guy.  And so it just sort of boom, it just sort of happened.  And it was awesome, and it took off, and videos were going viral.  I was making money.  It was great.  It was a great time.  I had a great time.  But it came to 2015.  There was this moment, and this was a big death for me, where I knew Sasha Degin was dead, that I wasn't ready to face it yet.  I was literally teaching this course.  We have these amazing, I mean, for years, this is literally my job for years.  I was listening to men, you know, flirt with women.  I got a microphone on and sometimes it'd be great, sometimes not so great.  And this was one painful interaction.  I'm just listening to the guy and he's making the same mistakes as every other guy.  And I'm just there like, oh God, you know, it's just, it's just, it's being needy and weird.  He's not really listening to her.  He's not connecting authentically.  He's not showing who he is.  He's not showing his passion.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, did you hear anything I just said?  And there's some part of me that just died in that moment.  I just knew it was a, it was a. no, you know, when sometimes you just know, you just, you don't have to think, you just know, bam, something happens and you're like, boom, like ending a relationship or having to switch your, you know, drop your job or something where you just like, boom, major life thing.  In that moment, I just knew, I'm just like, fuck, I can't teach pickup anymore.  It's over.  And I knew it, and I went with it.  I actually said to my team, hey, you guys teach the courses.  I'm going to show you all the stuff.  It's great.  You can do it.  Keep the legend going.  It's beautiful.  Social freedom and day game.  It's awesome.  But the name, the name was still there.  The name was still there.  It's like a brand, not a big brand.  It's a small brand.  But it's still a brand.  It's a thing.  Sasha Dagan.  People know that.  Oh, yeah, Sasha Dagan.  I've seen some of his videos.  It's out there.  And I'm like, okay, that's fine.  And I just kept, you know, I just kept living my life, doing my thing.  I started my spiritual podcast and it's great.  I was still doing some stand-up comedy here and there, but not really.  And then many things happened.  As you know, I went down the spiritual rabbit hole.  Super hardcore.  And then what I discovered is not only are we dying, like, as a human being, you know, dying to, like, what we used to be on every level, right?  Like, all of our beliefs about who we are supposed to be, what, like... All of it.  Like, can you imagine how many people out there are like living lives that are just like, they're not really, they're not really them.  So that level of dying as a human being and that, and that just, that's natural.  It's just like, you know, what you want to be doing, what you want to be expressing, what you're trying to accomplish, what you're trying to change within yourself.  Like it, you know, it's literally, it's a forever process just on the human level of our evolution.  It's, it's never ending.  And there's, and that's a lot of dying, right?  But then you get on a spiritual awakening path and it's literally, it's like the ego itself, like this entire being that is literally like you identify with.  Like I'm a man and I'm like funny and like I have a business and like people like me.  You know, like the entire, like all of it, that entire structure, that dies too.  Like really.  And not just once.  People think it just happens once.  No, no, no.  It's like layers of dying and dying and dying and dying.  Like literally, again, those of you that listen to Woke as Fuck podcast, at one point, literally knowing that I'm dying, passing out, accepting death, you know you're going to the other side, you're waiting for the light.  You're like, okay, we're going there.  And you literally go to source, hang out there as just pure consciousness, indescribable, come back into the body and you wake up in it and you're like, whoa.  that's a trip so that literally like things like that happening multiple that was the most intense one but multiple levels of that time and after those experiences man you don't even identify as a person.  you're just like oh cool I'm infinite consciousness.  I'm in a body.  that's great.  this is not me though.  this is not who I am.  no fucking way.  there's no way you can limit what I am into this little guy here.  no Like the guy, it's not me though.  And a lot more people are having these type of experiences and can kind of relate.  Anybody who's taken a really big dose of magic mushrooms or had a near-death experience or actually died and came back or had a major samadhi, spiritual awakening, you guys know what I'm talking about.  And if you don't, it's coming for you.  So not only is it absurd to even at this point identify this as me, ridiculous, if I'm going to pick a name to go with, because you need to have some ego.  You need to have a name.  You can't be walking around and people ask you shit and you're like, are you talking to this person?  Are you talking to infinite consciousness?  I'm just infinite consciousness, please.  You can refer to me as consciousness.  You got to have a name.  Don't be a dick.  So if you're going to go with a name, I'll just go with the one I was born with.  It's a good one.  I like it.  Sasha Daygame.  Listen, I'm not running around flirting with 97 women of fucking afternoon anymore.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I want to get some poon poon.  I've done enough healing and discovering of myself where that's really not where things are at.  So as much as it was amazing, Sasha Daygame was dead.  And I knew it.  the other day I actually went and I, you know, I switched my Instagram name from a Sasha day game to Alex, the comic.  Cause I, cause I had the domain name and I thought, you know, nobody knows how to spell Lazarev.  Don't try and tell people you're Lazarev.  You're all going to spell it wrong.  Alex, the comic is easy.  And it happened.  I was like, yeah, it was just this sense of just relief.  Like, oh yeah, that's, that's what I want to be doing.  That's me.  It took about 10 years actually from going really hardcore down that rabbit hole of awakening and healing and chasing all that kind of stuff in this huge circle, massive crazy journey to get back to just like, actually, I just want to tell jokes and make people laugh and bring in the healing and the awareness and some of that juicy.  love slash oneness slash joy.  higher level vibrations, higher level truths into what I'm doing, now I can do it through the comedy.  Now I'm ready to be the comedian that I wanted to be then, but I just hadn't done the personal work.  Very similar actually to wanting to attract and have an amazing partner in your life, right?  But if you haven't done the work, you can't.  And it doesn't matter how many lines you memorize or how fancy your clothes are or anything that you do in your life, unless you were really ready to attract that amazing partner in your life, it's not going to happen.  Right?  So it's the same thing.  It's the same thing with becoming who you are.  It's like you've got to do what you've got to do.  You've got to heal what you've got to heal.  You've got to let go of whatever you've got to let go of to come into alignment and fully be who you are and shine your light into this world.  And I've been teaching it for a really long time.  And again, like every other human being on the planet, I'm in a constant process of dying and being reborn.  We all are.  So what does that mean?  Well, it means I'm still me.  I'm still rocking it.  This here channel you're watching this video on will continue to have great content on it about social freedom, authentic self-expression, going out there and being you.  It's all good.  It's all good.  And yet, when it comes to me being a comedian, that's going to be elsewhere.  And my spiritual awakening and interviewing other people, that's all going to be happening on the Woke as Fuck podcast like it has been.  But Sasha Dane Game is gone.  i gotta admit too i didn't want to let go.  i didn't want to let go of sasha.  people were following sasha.  he had fans.  he's making good money.  people liked him a lot.  you don't want to let go of that.  you you want to be that i'm like.  i like being that guy.  he's a great guy.  that's the ego right.  that's the ego.  grabbing on and being like.  i'm this guy.  this guy this is me.  this gives me some sense of reality.  purpose.  it's important.  i'm somebody important and how many people out there again in this world are grabbing onto some kind of label?  you know whether it's i'm I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a doctor, I'm rich, I'm from this family, I have this many subscribers, whatever it is.  What happens when you drop that?  What happens when you lose that thing you're holding on to so desperately?  Might be attached to it.  Why not just let go and just be the presence, be simply what you are without all the labels?  And that's the process of letting go.  Example of a character, almost a character within a character, that I was playing.  I did this hour-long comedy show called Chuck Manslack at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival.  It was this dating coach character who was like yelling at men, you know, like, we used to fight bears, stop being a pussy, go over there and talk to that girl.  It was a great show.  It was amazing.  But even when I was doing the show and it was so much fun and I was so much into it, I knew one day I'm not going to be doing that show.  Those jokes aren't going to be what I'm passionate about anymore.  I'm just going to evolve past it, you know, and we're all evolving past it.  We're all shifting out of it, whatever that we believe we are today.  So be conscious.  Just accept you're shifting, you're changing.  What do you want to drop?  What do you need to drop to become who you really want to be who you who really who really represents the truth of who you are of why you're really here in this body because we're all doing it.  so do it consciously.  take the death of sasha day game as a little example that you can die too and you can get through.  It's good to be dying.  It's good to be being reborn.  It's a process.  So don't get too caught up into where you are in life right now.  If it's not quite right, if there's something, you know, there's something more coming.  It is coming.  It is coming.  All you have to do is be here now and drop what's not truly serving you.  Allow the death.  Don't be afraid of death.  Welcome death.  Because when we welcome death, that allows, that opens up the space for rebirth.  right sasha day game wasn't willing to die.  alex lazarev could not go out there and be the most woke as fuck comedian on planet earth.  that's right jp sears.  i'm coming for you broski sasha.  this has been so much fun i've had.  yeah i've had so much fun talking today with you.  you're a gentleman and a wallet scholar so infinite man is there.  it's growing.  it's getting even better.  we're still here for you.  we're still.  we haven't gone anywhere through there.  no panic only sasha day game has left the building but i'm still here.  i'm still here I'm doing a little happy dance because I feel free.  Because I feel free!  Woo!  Just an encouragement to all the brothers and sisters out there.  This thing called life, it's a constant evolution.  It's a constant letting go of what doesn't serve anymore, what doesn't feel in our hearts is not truly us anymore.  You can make... so much of a difference in this world if you really start letting go of all the shit that's not you and start living your passion your joy your excitement and allow that true that true inner excitement that joy that true you to shine through.  don't be afraid of death.  there is no death.  that's what i've discovered on my spiritual journey with a lot of crazy experiences.  there there's no death.  the ego can die.  your idea what you are can die but the truth of what you really are can never die.  none of us.  we are all eternal consciousness just in infinite forms exploring itself in this reality and who knows how many realities forever and ever and ever.  and it's exciting and it's unending and that is our nature.  so don't get caught up into these these ideas of who you are what you have to do.  you have to be you.  You know, I realized I have way more to say on this topic.  I have a funny feeling.  we're going to go deeper on this on this Sunday's sermon on the Woke as Fuck channel, 10 a.m.  Pacific, baby, 1 o'clock Eastern.  The link is below.  Hopefully, I'll see you there.  God bless all of you.  I'm super excited, and I'll see you guys on the flip side.  Much love.  Peace. ",
