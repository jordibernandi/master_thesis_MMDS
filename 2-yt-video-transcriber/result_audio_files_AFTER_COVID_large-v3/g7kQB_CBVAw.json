            "text": "Hello, Lew Engel here.  Today I'd like to share a few of my thoughts on the election, on President Trump and should he pursue going to the courts?  Should he let the election process just take place and we have a new president?  I want you to turn with me, if you would, and look at this passage in 2 Samuel 12, verse 15.  Then Nathan departed to his house, and the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it became ill.  David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.  So the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the ground.  But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.  And then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died.  And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice.  How can we tell him that the child is dead?  He may do some  harm.\".  And when David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead.  Therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead?  And they said, He's dead.  So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and he went into the house of the Lord and worshipped.  Then he went to his own house, and when he requested, they set fire.  Then his servants said to him, Why should I fast?  Can I bring him back again?  I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.  I'd like to compare this passage to the elections.  You say, how are you going to compare, Lou, this passage, David fasting and praying that the child would live and compare it to the elections that have just taken place?  This is my thoughts.  I believe it is a very clear, clear comparison.  In fact, the one has to do with one child.  The other has to do with the death of tens of thousands of children.  It's interesting how David pursued God with fasting and prayer with the hopes that the child would live.  I think this is the way our hearts should be concerning this election.  All of you know that Joe Biden basically has said that he supports abortion up to nine months in the womb up to birth.  Brothers and sisters, probably one of the first things that Joe Biden will do if he becomes president will be to reverse the Mexico ruling and finances.  millions of dollars will go to the funding of abortions worldwide.  I am absolutely surprised how men and women of God will actually resign themselves right now to the political process when there's clearly a lot of dispute about the fraud, the legality of these elections, and they would resign so quickly to the process.  i'm wondering if they're considering the millions of babies or the ten thousands of them at least why would they resign?  david doesn't resign it's his child.  i'm even thinking that if that those people that are resigning if their child was in a life and death situation don't you think do you think they would resign?  absolutely not.  I'm appalled at the church and its resignation to this issue of the unborn and the killing of babies.  Brothers and sisters, this is not a side issue.  For me, I am an intercessor for the unborn.  16 years ago, God laid a hold on me on this issue.  And I cannot compromise.  I must lay hold of this divine purpose issue.  in my life and in the life of this nation.  can i say it is time for the church not to resign but to give themselves to fasting and praying crying out for the exposure of of voter fraud even if there is just one little chance that they could save the babies.  The other thing I want to say is I believe there needs to be thousands of men and women beginning to pray for the Supreme Court.  The Lord spoke to me the other day, pray, secure the court.  John Roberts has been compromised.  We need to pray for that man.  But there are five judges and we can't assume how they will vote if this actually comes to a court case.  And literally the courts could actually bring forth the next president of the United States.  Just one little chance, if it was my baby, I would never stop until they tell me the child is dead.  Listen, Joe Biden is not my president.  I must pray for him.  I pray for him.  I pray that God would bless him.  But he is not in authority.  The Bible says pray for those in authority.  Until Inauguration Day, my authority in this nation is President Trump, my senators, those that are local officials.  Those are the ones I'm commanded to pray for.  Until then, I do not have an obligation to pray for President Trump.  past vice president, Joseph Biden, my calling is to pray for the president of the United States and his cabinet.  Brothers and sisters, it's not angry, it's not mean, it's simply Bible.  Until the government or the courts have declared and the electoral college has declared that Joe Biden is the president, I refuse to stop crying out. ",
