No such thing in the land of Israel of one location towering over a valley A trade route and a meeting point of five tribes of Israel.  And that's what makes Mount Carmel such an important place.  This is the part of the country that was known as the breadbasket of the country.  This is where they used to grow all their crops.  And it was so good that the enemies of Israel invaded into that valley during the harvest time.  in order to take spoil and to plunder and to steal all the crops during the harvest time.  Mount Carmel, the name Carmel is consisted of two Hebrew words.  Keren El, the vineyard of God.  And it wasn't necessarily about vineyard per se.  It's about prosperity, tranquility, and fertility.  This is why Solomon, in the Songs of Solomon, would say your neck and your head is like Mount Carmel.  So Carmel, by its name and its nature, is something prosperous, beautiful, lush, and green.  And you can imagine how much of a crisis it was for people in the country to go through a phase of three and a half years of not even a single drop of rain.

And the God that sends fire is the real God.  It was a very hot day.  And he was afraid that the people will think, oh, maybe, I don't know, a dry piece or a stick caught on fire.  So what Elijah did, he soaked the wood with water.  And he dug a trench all around and filled it with water.  So there was no doubt if fire comes and consumed the wood, it has to be from him.  And that fire came and consumed the water and the wood and the bull that they had to cut as an offering.  And, of course, took the stones, took everything, took a mini hurricane.

And it's a king that basically imported into the land, Ariel, the worship of Baal and Asherah, and the prophets of Baal and Asherah, from his wife's place of origin.  And therefore, there's a great relationship between them and her.  I mean, they sat around her table.  That's a re-education program that she brought to the nation of Israel.  And she has a spirit that is up until today known as the spirit of Jezebel, spirit of control, a spirit of deception, a spirit of seduction.  She will seduce her husband to do what she wants.  And she wants to deceive a whole nation that the God that brought them into this land is not really the true God.  Oh yeah, do you see down below over there?  There was a vineyard there.  It's a beautiful lush land.  There's a vineyard that belonged to a man called Naboth, Naboth in Hebrew.  He had a vineyard that belongs to his family for many years.  In those days, the people of Israel did not sell the land.  By the way, by the law of Moses, it was forbidden to sell the land.  If the land belongs to God, you don't sell it.  And Ahab comes to Naboth and says, hey, I like your vineyard.  It's right below my palace.  It's right below my city.  I want to get it from you.  I want to buy it from you.  And Naboth says, this is my family's vineyard.  I cannot sell it to you.  I cannot sell it to you because it's not just against my own will.  It's against the Word of God.  Well, guess what?  He was very angry.  He goes back to his palace.  He lies down in bed and he's angry.  And Jezebel comes with her seductive, deceptive, and very controlling spirit.  And she says, what happened to you, darling?  And he says, well, I wanted that vineyard and the guy will not sell it to me.  And she says, what are you, a wimp?  Get up.  You're the king of Israel.  Stand up.  I'll make sure it will come to your hands.  You know what she does, spirit of deception?  She writes letters on behalf of the king to the elders of the city to bring Naboth before them and to accuse him for blaspheming God.  And of course, suddenly she is interested in the punishment thereof, which is stoning someone to death.  And guess who is coming?  To tell Ahab the truth right to his face. ",

There is a reason why Elijah brought all the way to the Kishon Creek, those 850.  In the ancient culture, they believed that there is a god called Baal, and a goddess, his mistress, that is called Asherah.  It's always been that there is a male and a female gods.  God and the goddess of fertility.  The locals were super religious and super perverted.  They used to bring their firstborns and kill them right by the water, right by the river.  Now comes the children of Israel.  And they're about to enter into the land of Israel.  And God is literally warning them.  I want you to understand something.  First of all, I do not want you to sacrifice children to me.  Second, he said, I hate any detested action, namely sexual perversion.  The culture of the people who lived here when it comes to children were so perverted.  They used to bring them through fire, through fire.  They used to burn babies.  Deuteronomy 12, 31 says the following thing.  You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way for every abomination to the Lord, which he hates, they have done to their gods.  For they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.  Also in chapter 18, it says the following thing in verses 9 and 10.  He says, When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abomination of those nations.  And just to make it clear, these are the prophets.  They are the leaders.  They would conduct the ceremonies for the nation to kill their race.  These people have more blood on their hands than anyone you can imagine.  And I can't imagine that by killing 850 here, Elijah saved the lives of thousands and thousands of babies that were no longer killed by these 850.  God basically said, look, you need to drive them out because it starts with tolerance, then acceptance, and then promoting it.  You could see that not only in the people, it started with the leadership.  It started with a king that goes and marries a woman that has such a terrible spirit, and she kills the prophets of God, and she promotes the prophets of Baal and Asherah.  The Bible says that they were sitting at her table in the palace.  You know, when you host certain people in the palace, That means these are the people you want everybody to know that they're yours.  You're sending a message.  These are mine.  I promote them.  I like them.  I want them.  Learn from them.  And eventually having leadership that prohibits any other form of worship but that pagan worship.  And that is exactly what we see today in our world today. ",

Just like the people of Israel in Elijah's story, we find ourselves just as indecisive, insecure, and hesitating to love God and be committed to Him.
