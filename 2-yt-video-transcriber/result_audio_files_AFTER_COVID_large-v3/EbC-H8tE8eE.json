            "text": "This is so aggressively unfunny.  It's almost impressive.  So a few months ago, I embarked on a mission that I knew from the beginning would be difficult, but has proven far more challenging than I ever anticipated.  It's the sort of mission that tries your soul, shows you who you are, what you're made of, tests your mettle.  The mission is to laugh at a joke told by a feminist comedian.  Are you serious?  Now, to be clear here, just to be just to be just so we can get all the technicalities clear.  The goal is is is not to laugh at a feminist comedian because we can all do that.  That's very easy to do.  You can easily laugh at them.  The goal is to laugh with them, to laugh at their material, to laugh when it seems like they want you to laugh.  and in the way they want you to laugh.  So far, I've tried to laugh at jokes from Samantha Bee and Hannah Gadsby.  If you watch those videos, you know that I tried my hardest.  I did.  I dedicated myself to the task and just came up empty.  I found myself not only not laughing, but in fact, nearly weeping as I stared into the bleak abyss where laughter and joy and humor dies.  It was a deeply chilling and unsettling experience.  But now we're going to try it again.  I'm going to give this one more try, this time with Chelsea Handler.  Now, Chelsea Handler is an interesting case because she reminds me a little bit of like your eccentric childless aunt who always smells vaguely of cat litter and Chardonnay. ",

This analogy is maybe getting a little bit too specific.  I don't know.  The point is Chelsea Handler is weird and sort of sad, but not often funny.  At least that's how she comes across.  And, you know, I say this admittedly as someone who watched Chelsea Handler one time for four minutes 15 years ago when she was on the what was it, the E!  Entertainment channel.  And I had her on TV because I was looking under the couch for the remote so I could change it.  And in that time, that's like the only time I've ever really been exposed to her comedy.  So I made a lot of judgments based on that experience.  Maybe they were unfair judgments.  And so now we're going to give this a try.  Let's let's try to laugh.  Let's go.  And we'll start here with, I think this is one of her more recent routines.  And let's just, let's see if we can get a chuckle out of this. ",

It's like, where's Waldo?  The challenge is just to figure out where the joke is.  I mean, forget about actually laughing.  I don't even know where I'm supposed to laugh.  The audience, on the other hand, they just laugh at everything.  I mean, this woman busts out a Stevie Wonder joke in the year 2020, and the audience acts like it's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Maybe next she can make a joke about telemarketers, something really topical.  Hey, what's the deal with telemarketers, huh?  You ever heard of these people telemarketers?  So annoying.  The audience would love that.  That would kill this audience.  And then, of course, at the end of the bit, the punchline, I guess, is that Chelsea Handler is a horrible person, which I'm perfectly willing to believe.  She's screaming at her friend in a restaurant.  So what we've learned is that Handler is depressed, miserable, suicidal, and on top of it, a terrible friend.  These are all excellent things to say to your therapist.  It's just not fit for a comedy stage.  That's my only point, but we'll keep going. ",

She basically took the content of any random Marco Polo that she sent to one of her middle-aged female friends and decided to run with it as a comedy bit, which fine, okay, but really, if you're gonna do that, you should inject a couple of jokes here and there.  That's my, I'm not a standup comedian.  You know, don't take it from me, but I feel like if I was going to do a comedy bit, I would want to have really probably a lot of jokes, right?  You probably want at least a couple, but even really a lot of jokes.  Everything you say should be a joke or should be leading to a joke.  I definitely wouldn't have no jokes.  That's my point.  No joke seems like a bad strategy as a comedian, yet it's one that all feminist comedians seem to go with.  So let's try a different clip.  We're going to give up on that one.

I thought it couldn't get more depressing and pitiful than her screaming about her soul for 20 minutes.  But now we have her bragging about killing her baby.  See, this is what you always get from feminist comedians.  First of all, for the most part, they're terrible people.  So that's that's.  that's the first problem.  Second, they think that being edgy means simply saying inappropriate things.  Forget about punchline, just say something inappropriate.  And of course, mix in, every time she uses the F-bomb, you can tell she's very impressed with herself.  That's not edgy.  It's certainly not interesting or funny.  This is the edginess of a 14-year-old boy who scribbles the word sex or something on the bathroom stall.  And in fact, Chelsea Handler has, it would seem, I'm guessing, been inside many men's bathroom stalls.  And that's clearly where she gets her inspiration.  Now, I haven't laughed so far to say the least.  I actually am concerned I may never laugh again after watching this.  But I know that the criticism I'll get, and I got with the other two videos, is that I cherry picked the bad material.  You know, I was biased in the clips that I chose, which fair enough.  It's possible that there are hours and hours of hilarious Chelsea Handler material out there, which I discarded in favor of her rambling about assholes and abortion.  I mean, it's possible, right?  Maybe.  So let's watch.  This is what we'll conclude with.  We'll watch the promo for Handler's latest stand-up special on, I think, on HBO.  And now here, the people marketing the special have chosen the best material.  This is dressed up to make her look as good as possible and to make her material look as funny as possible.  So we'll conclude with this.  This is our best chance for a chuckle.  And I'm not looking for a laugh anymore.  I'm looking for a chuckle.  I've downgraded to a chuckle.  I'll take even like a... Even that, that's what I'm going for now.  If we can get one of those, then we're golden.  And so let's watch this. ",

I figured it was time to go to a real therapist.  He said, I think you lack empathy.  Like a Republican?  Thing is, I like older men, which brings me to the strong and deep sexual feelings that I have developed for Andrew Cuomo.  I want him to flatten my curve, and then I want to flatten his curve, and then I want us to apex together.  Spirituality is fine with me as a component of your lifestyle.  I feel spiritual when I'm on mushrooms.  I've done every drug.  Unless there's a new drug that came out this morning, I tried it.  I took my SATs tripping on acid.  I didn't get into college, but I had a great time taking that test.  I'm growing.  They're called baby steps. ",

You see, I didn't cherry pick the bad ones.  If anything, I played the good ones.  It's only downhill from there.  This is so aggressively unfunny.  It's almost impressive.  How could someone be a professional comedian for decades and never managed to say anything funny ever.  It goes back to what I said, especially when you watch that clip about Handler being the weird aunt sort of figure, because here she is bragging about doing drugs, trying to impress your cousins.  And, you know, it's it's.  it's maybe enough to make you laugh at her.  But this for me, because of my incredible empathy, I just feel bad for this miserable woman.  bitter, lonely woman who is falling apart on stage and telling us about the color of her anus.  I do not laugh at that.  The mission fails again, but we will carry on and try again next time. ",
