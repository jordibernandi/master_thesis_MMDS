            "text": "And the horses are like, who the heck is this?  They have, my neighbor's horses, they have no, I don't know if they've ever met a pig.  Yep, and there's Chris animating the whole thing.  Noble, would you like to come meet them?  He's like, I don't know.  I tried to go near two deer and they ran away from me.  Noble's interested because there's tall grass here.  See, there's tall, delicious grass.  I know.  The two of you are trying to figure out what he is.  Look at him.  He's like, oh my gosh.  He's looking at this meatloaf over here.  He's like, can you share that grass with me?  Can you get me some?  I'll pay you.  He wants some grass.  He wants some grass.  Okay, I'll give you two a little bit of grass and clover.  Just to appease you right now, Remy.  Good spirit.  Like, I don't know what this is.  This is the closest he's ever went.  I don't want him crawling through there, Chris.  Well, I'm just saying.  I think he knows there's a fence there and not to go up.  We're getting closer.  I don't know how this is going to go.  They're very friendly horses.  Look at them.  They are.  What are you?  He's like, I don't know who this, Remy, do you know who this is?  He puffed at him and he's gone.  Did you just puff at him a little bit?  He's like, yeah, I don't know what he is.  Melville's like, I'm going to try again.  I'm going back in.  Are you going to continue negotiations with these two?  Oh, my gosh.  Don't nip.  Don't you nip.  Oh, Chris, they're going to think you have grapes for them and they can't have grapes.  Oh, he's trying to bring Noble closer.  I don't know how good of an idea this is.  I have to say they're good with all types of animals.  I have to say they're two pretty tolerant horses.  But then again, they've never seen a pig.  He's unamused.  He's looking away from him.  He's like, I'm totally unamused.  They think you have something for them.  Oh, my gosh.  Look at him.  It's okay, Noble.  They're very friendly.  I know, but they got big head.  Big heads.  Very friendly.  Big heads.  Oh, look at him.  He's like, oh, the negotiations are exhausting.  Are these negotiations exhausting?  Oh, my gosh.  I'm exhausted already.  Oh, you are amusing these two.  Like nobody's business, Noble.  You really are.  It's like they're TV.  Oh, he's running away.  He's like, nope.  Are you done with negotiations now, Noble?  Yeah.  Look at these two.  They're like, I've never seen anything like this ever.  Look at them.  They are so curious.  Your ears are forward.  Oh, this is great.  I'm going to send this video to my neighbor.  They'll be very pleased.  Look, I told you.  Negotiating, guys, is exhausting.  See, oh my gosh.  Total negotiations.  See, I deserve a grape for this.  Did anyone have a grape?  Oh, or a biscuit.  Okay.  Or a biscuit.  Are you sniffing?  Say he smells funny.  Does Noble smell funny?  Yep.  Our friend here is just laser focused.  Laser focused.  He's like, don't lick your lips at him.  You eat hay.  Oh, you're going to give him some grass?  Yeah, I just gave him a carrot.  And there goes Noble.  He's like, negotiations are done for today.  Bye, everyone. ",
