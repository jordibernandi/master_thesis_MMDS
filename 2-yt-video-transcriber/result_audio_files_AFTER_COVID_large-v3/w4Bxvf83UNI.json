            "text": "He doesn't say, I'm just like you.  You get to call yourself sons of God too.  He's saying, he doesn't so many to tell you that there are other sons of God who are more than men.  Now there's a little bit more here, the day of the Lord.  I think spiritual warfare always comes up, you know, in this discussion, because you've got these entities over the nations and whatnot.  And so people bring up the term spiritual warfare.  And what spiritual warfare really is, there's an already element to it and there's a not yet.  You know, the not yet is an eschatological judgment that Psalm 82 describes.  So what Psalm 82 describes is actually echoed in other passages.  Remember, I said you're gods, all of you, but you're going to die like men.  And then the psalmist says, rise up, O Lord, and take back the nations.  You know, judge those gods and take back the nations.  Okay.  We've got here Isaiah 34, 1 through 4.  Let's go to that and then we'll go to the other one.  So Isaiah 34, this is the judgment of the nations.  Draw near, O nations, to hear and give attention, O peoples.  Let the earth hear and all that fills it, the world and all that comes from it.  For the Lord is enraged against all the nations and furious against their host.  He has devoted them to destruction, which is the word, the conquest word, Kerem.  He has given them over for slaughter.  Their slain shall be cast out.  The stench of their corpses shall rise.  The mountains shall flow with their blood.  All the host of heaven shall rot away and the skies roll up like a scroll.  All their host shall fall as leaves fall from the vine, like leaves falling from the fig tree.  Now I'm not going to run the search here, but you see the phrase, their host.  in verse 4, and their host in verse 2.  Every time in the Hebrew Bible where tzavah is suffixed with the third plural suffix, their host, it refers to supernatural beings.  It never refers to humans.  which is kind of an interesting observation.  Again, it's just sort of a trivia point here.  But the point of Isaiah 34.1-4 is that both the earthly nations and the heavenly host behind them are judged at the day of the Lord, both of them.  And that would make sense because they're intertwined together in Old Testament thought.  Isaiah 24.21, On that day, which is a stock description for the day of the Lord.  Again, you could look that up and see that.  On that day, the Lord will punish the host of heaven in heaven, the spiritual beings in the spiritual world, and the kings of the earth on the earth.  They will be gathered together as prisoners in a pit.  They'll be shut up in a prison.  After many days, they will be punished.  Then the moon shall be confounded, the sun ashamed.  The Lord of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders.  Did you know that Yahweh has elders?  Who might they be?  Again, they're the sons of God, the ones that are loyal.  It's the council.  The council approving of the day of the Lord.  Again, these ideas are interrelated, but I want to show you something in the New Testament that picks up on this language.  This is the not yet judgment of the gods.  This is Paul's discussion of the resurrection and the resurrection body.  And in verse 24, he's talking about the things that are going to unfold at the end, the end of days.  Then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule, every authority, and every power.  Now, if we actually looked at this terminology, rule is archaic.  It's the same word for the rulers elsewhere.  Authority, exousia, same rule.  that's in other passages, the principalities and powers, the rulers and authorities, and their power, principalities and powers, the same word.  All three of these terms are the same terms that Paul uses in passages that describe the judgment of supernatural beings.  Passages like Let's go to Ephesians 1.20.  We'll just riff on this a little bit.  Okay, so Paul again talking about the work of Christ.  According to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion.  Why does Paul connect the resurrection the resurrection with the defeat of the rulers, the authorities, and the powers?  Just hold that question in your head.  Colossians 2.13, You who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands.  This He set aside, nailing it to the cross, and He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame.  by triumphing over them in  Him.\".  See, in the now part of the fulfillment of Psalm 82, the authority, the legitimacy of the rule of the principalities and powers, these spiritual powers of darkness over the nations, that has been withdrawn and nullified.  The Most High was the one that set this up.  Yes, there was a rebellion.  Yes, it goes bad.  But He's the one that, I mean, this was His judgment back at Babel.  So, you know, there it is.  And God's saying, look, You know, I wanted Israel to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.  And I promised Abraham that one of their seed, someone from the seed of Abraham would come and it would be through his seed that all the nations of the earth would be blessed.  Well, Paul in Galatians 3 and Galatians 6 tells us that that seed was Christ.  And so this is the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant in the now.  that it's through the resurrection, through the work of Jesus, that the legal demands, again, the authority of the rulers and the authorities, again, over the nations has been nullified and withdrawn.  They have every right to turn from their gods and come back home.  1.  Peter 3 says the same thing.  Again, it connects it with baptism and the resurrection and all this stuff.  I mean, there are half a dozen places where Paul connects the work of Christ with the demise of the authority of the gods over the nations.  So we have an already judgment and that works its way out in the Gospel.  And we have a not yet judgment, that's the eschatology, Isaiah 34, Isaiah 24.  These passages, you know, like 1 Corinthians 15 says, just go back there because it plays off those Isaiah passages.  Then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every ruler, every authority, and every power.  He's actually the agent of destruction, which makes great sense because when Jesus does quote Psalm 82 in John 10, he has two points to make.  He says, look, fellows, I've said I and my Father are one.  Doesn't your own scripture say, doesn't it mention that there are other sons of God who are more than mortal?  That's his point.  He doesn't say, I'm just like you.  You get to call yourself sons of God too.  He's saying, he doesn't?  Psalm 82 tell you that there are other sons of God who are more than men.  And that's point number one.  So I can take this title and claim that I'm more than a man.  But just so that we're clear exactly what my status is in the council, verses 37, 38, the Father is in me and I am in the Father.  Are we clear now?  I am Lord of the council.  Jesus is the one who, essentially, He is the one who acts out.  the judgment that God renders in Psalm 82 over the principalities and powers, both now in His death and resurrection, and then when the end shall come, the day of the Lord.  Again, this is the book of Revelation, you know, the Armageddon image, you know, all this kind of stuff.  I mean, it's consistent.  These passages are consistent.  They are not disparate. ",
