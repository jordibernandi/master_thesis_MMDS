All these deathless either want me in prison or dead.  I pulled up at the crib.  MAGA hat still on my head.  Price and grade did nothing wrong.  I'm going Roger Stone.  They probably going to tap my cribs.  They'll probably tap my phone.  And people send me death threats.  Better leave me alone.  Because I just bought another gun and it's legally on.  Rappers dissin' on my name, hopin' they help they status.  Rookies hatin' on the vet, get in the gym and practice.  And they said I'm a terrorist with semi-automatics.
