            "text": "In a letter sent to Nightline yesterday, Tom Cruise's attorney called the actor a man of spirit, intelligence, and independence.  He said Mr.  Cruise is aware of the claims made against Mr.  Miscavige by former members of the Church of Scientology.  He does not believe them.  We'll be right back, but first, here's Jimmy Key.  Time now for tonight's closing argument.  Over two days, we've examined allegations against the leader of the Scientology Church, the relationship between the church and its celebrity members, and a belief system many critics consider bizarre.  The church vehemently denies any wrongdoing and defends itself as a religion.  So tonight we ask you, should Scientology continue to enjoy tax-exempt status as an organized religion, or should the U.S.  follow those nations which do not recognize Scientology as a religion?  Tell us what you think by clicking on the Nightline page at abcnews.com or on the Nightline Twitter page.  But that's our report for tonight.  For Terry Moran, Cynthia McFadden, and all of us at ABC News. ",
