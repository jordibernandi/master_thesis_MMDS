            "text": "Well, I've got something that I'm going to read to you.  It's a very disturbing report, but it's something that I'm not unfamiliar with.  This is something that I have been talking to you about.  I have mentioned this to you in terms of Taiwan.  but it looks like the parameters are much bigger than Taiwan.  And I have a source inside the government, and he has great connections into military intel, and some of the stuff I've passed along before has come out to be absolutely true.  And a lot of people give me too much credit.  They go, oh, Dave Hodges, he knows a lot of stuff about what's going to happen.  No, I know a lot of people who know a lot of stuff about what's going to happen.  Don't give me the credit.  I've got great messengers.  Obviously, messages like this, though, have to be offered on the anonymous side.  But knowing that this person has a great track record record.  We need to establish this as a beachhead, pun intended.  Here we go.  I'm going to read to you excerpts of what I was sent, and I've been able to cross-confirm this with other sources, but I also knew this was being an emphasis in training as well.  American military training is changing.  We're moving away from desert warfare, how to survive in the desert, where to get water, how to repair your tank or your mechanized vehicle in a breakdown in a hot environment.  That's all changing.  They're moving to amphibious.  Listen to this.  We're getting ready for China.  No kidding.  Now, I don't know if Russia is going to jump in as an afterthought.  Perhaps that's a discussion for another time.  But listen to this.  Engagements coming in Africa.  Yes, we know that we have forces in Africa.  We call it the AFRICOM, right?  Like NORTHCOM, SOUTHCOM, AFRICOM.  And we also know that the Chinese are using Belt and Road technology to indebt African nations and then take control of them.  And as Pastor Aubrey Brocken, and you know him, he had to leave South Africa in fear of his life, and he moved to New Zealand.  He sent me all kinds of African news media that you'll never see here in America.  And they were talking about the Chinese coming in, establishing missile batteries and building military bases.  And we even know they built a military base in Afghanistan.  And they're aligned now tightly with Pakistan, both nuclear powers.  So anyway, engagements in Africa, the Pacific.  Now this should not be a surprise, but just to review, if you're someone that was not around when we covered this, but the South China Sea has been a source of consternation.  The Chinese only have one aircraft carrier.  So the way that they tried to compensate was build these artificial islands in strategic locations in the South China Sea as a way to confront Americans coming into the area when they lay down their intended naval blockade and block trade in the region, which is an act of war.  And they've already said the South China Sea is ours.  And even the UN has said, we're not so sure that doesn't violate freedom of the seas.  So the South China Sea is a hotspot.  So Pacific Islands.  Now, I said this just because I think I know my history.  China is boxed in.  They got food problems.  They've announced that earlier in the week.  And they have natural resource problems.  Well, isn't this just like Japan, 1929, 1930, 1931?  So they started to invade their fellow Asian neighbors to get the resources they needed for industrialization.  And the U.S.  pushed them into a position by saying, oh, no, we're going to punish you every time you do it.  And they left Japan, I should say, with really no recourse, that thought, but to attack Pearl Harbor.  Well, we have multiple Pearl Harbors, I've said before, that could be exposed and perhaps the Chinese will lay siege to it to keep us from having an advanced operating base.  But it's not one base.  We have Guam.  We're opening Subic Bay again in the Philippines.  And we have Diego Garcia where there is a known nuclear fleet of B-52 bombers, long range.  That means striking within China.  That could be the first target.  That would be my guess.  If I were a military planner, that's who I would attack first.  But we could have three Pearl Harbors At the same time, at the same moment.  Now, would it be a missile attack, aerial attack, amphibious?  I don't know what form it's going to take.  This is now kind of still in the planning stages, but this is a concern.  Here's where this gets really concerning and tells us that we're on the right track with this thinking.  Marines now are going back to island hopping training.  That's World War II Pacific.  That's not something you'll do in Europe.  It's not something you're going to do in Afghanistan or Iraq.  This is specific to the South Pacific.  And the military is going away from counterinsurgency operations.  And, you know, that's like fine wine, strike forces behind the scenes, sending in Navy SEALs, teams of six, teams of eight.  They cut power, do whatever it is, kidnap a key official.  That's what we mean by counterinsurgency operations.  And winning the hearts and minds of indigenous people by giving supplies or killing a despot warlord in far off places.  And the people say, thank you.  And we kind of win people over to our side.  We're moving away from that.  And here's what this message says.  And this is scary.  We are moving back to direct assault-style warfare against actual military units.  So what this is really saying is we're moving away from asynchronous military intervention with behind-the-scenes targets that change things or fix elections.  Oh, there we are.  Yes, we fix elections in foreign countries.  We've been doing it since the 50s.  And we're going to actual... Hard targets.  But I will tell you, the hard targets, when you have a military force of a million and a half men, you don't have enough men to do a lot of hard targets.  You've got to hope your AI, your automated forces, and this is why the Space Force, I'm sure, was brought back in by Donald Trump.  They were already existent.  They were secret.  Now, that Space Force now is public so they could get more funding, right?  And we're putting everything up there we can.  And we have militarized space.  Space has been militarized since the 60s.  Make no mistake about it.  But we are putting an emphasis on that now.  And we're attempting to gain the high ground.  The Chinese are up there with their Chinese killer satellites.  So there will be battles in space.  And I'm of the opinion that who wins up there is probably going to control like the king of the hill down here.  Let's talk about where I think the first target is going to be.  Can you guess?  Where do you think the first target is going to be?  Looking over here on the board.  Yeah, someone here mentioned Diego Garcia.  That's like I said, yes.  And I do think it could be the site of a strike like the Japanese did to Pearl Harbor in 1941.  But in terms of hard military assets with direct style fighting, I think it's Taiwan.  Taiwan represents 6% of our trading budget.  We cannot turn our back on them.  And also the world's watching.  If we want to maintain allies, we've got to be true to our alliances.  And we are obligated to protect Taiwan from a China mainland invasion.  So that's where I think it's going to start.  If China came in and started slaughtering people in Hong Kong, we'd call it out.  But I don't think we'd militarily invade because we don't really have an economic card in the deck and money is the big mover.  But Taiwan is where I think this is going to happen.  I also think the Philippines could be in danger.  And I think that Duterte, their president, is thinking the same thing.  Remember, first he wanted to be friends with Trump.  And then he said Trump can't control the deep state.  Man, was he ever right.  And he pivoted towards China.  And then China stabbed him in the back.  And now he's back trying to say to Trump, oh, I want to be your friend.  This is why he's allowing us to open Subic Bay in the Philippines.  But I also think the Chinese could invade there as well, too.  And the Chinese, I think, will first seek to have control in two primary regions of the world, Africa and the South Pacific, number one.  And also, too, don't forget about Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela.  By the way, China just was announced in South American media that China just militarized the ships.  uh venezuela the naval ships by putting uh uh ship to ship missile batteries on them as if the united states is going to invade there someday.  that's kind of what i think the chinese might be thinking.  so they're getting ready.  we're getting ready and no report could be completely free without at least mentioning the russians a little bit.  on their southern underbelly border they have moved large forces and we have moved nuclear bombers.  So it's kind of like check and checkmate.  And I'm not sure what this means right now, but it makes people very nervous.  when you move forces to the border.  And the way a lot of wars start, it's a mock drill.  You pretend you're drilling and you turn that into your military operation.  That happens all the time.  The other thing that nations like to do is to sign peace treaties and then attack.  Let's see, that would be Hitler, Genghis Khan, Stalin, Mao with his forces that were opposing him in the country when he took over China.  Yeah, that's a popular tactic, too.  So we're going to keep our ear to the ground on this.  But does this tell you why the troops from Afghanistan are being brought home?  And Trump says by Christmas.  So I think we could be seeing war in our second term.  Now, let me just share this with you, too.  I have a military source.  And I've had this source for many, many, many years.  He's the guy that helped me break the Benghazi coup story.  And he let me talk to two separate people at the Pentagon at two different times back in the month of May.  And I've talked about those conversations.  And do you remember what was said?  If Trump plays ball with the military-industrial complex and gives them their war with China, he will be the president.  Both people, I don't know if they knew each other.  I suspect they didn't.  Both talking to me on conditions of anonymity with my source on the line, both said that.  Now, you're saying, Dave, I've heard that from other people too.  Okay, so let's take that to the bank and realize war with China is coming.  And I think we just identified why the military training has altered inside the United States.  And, well, I'll tell you, I'd like to be a little fly on the wall in Pearl Harbor right now, wouldn't you? ",
