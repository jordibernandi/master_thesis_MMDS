            "text": "In this.  first in a series of short-form commentaries, I'm going to talk for just a second about the recent assault on the Capitol by domestic terrorists, many of them waving Jesus signs and Confederate flags in the name of Donald Trump.  And one of the conversations happening right now revolves around social media bans and free speech.  And the argument goes like this.  Yeah, sure, Trump is a frothing, bigoted, delusional, self-obsessed, tissue-skinned, lie-vomiting, tantrum-tweeting, anti-American gasbag.  But he has a constitutional right to be, and we sure don't want to slide down that slippery slope toward censorship.  Besides, this is a new chapter.  We need to be talking about unity and not division.  Well, first of all, Donald Trump is not a free speech martyr.  He incited his cult into holy war against its own country.  It's just stupid to declare that he's being persecuted because he could not abide by Twitter's terms of service.  Think of it like this, okay?  A man taps into the water main to his own house, and he constructs a high-pressure water cannon.  And then he blasts people in every direction, knocking them to the ground.  He is warned multiple times, do not do this, until the utility company finally cuts off the feed in the name of public safety.  Then the man protests that he is being denied water.  By the way, this guy also happens to live 20 feet from Lake Superior.  Remember that Trump's social media feeds might be dark, but he still has this.  Television, radio, internet access.  Yes, he still has the internet.  He has access to the entire planet.  People are acting like free speech didn't exist before Twitter was invented back in 2006.  Donald Trump still has the largest stage in the world and he has access 24-7.  Next, there's this concern that social media bans are going to further radicalize the zealots.  What do you call them if not already radicalized?  Derek Thompson over at The Atlantic said it perfectly.  He said, A debate about big tech's power and the rights of posters is overdue in  D.C.,  and tech firms identifying ideologies for cancellation is a dangerous path.  But let's be clear about what's happening here, a widespread private sector blackout of an insurrectionist conspiracy monger.  Thompson also had a great phrase for what's happening.  He called it a private sector impeachment.  A president reportedly delighted at an attempted coup is now finally living in a world with at least a few consequences.  Finally, let's talk about this notion that the heavily armed, Bible-waving mob does not represent true Christianity.  Beyond the Capitol, tens of millions of Americans have promoted, and many continue to promote, or at least allow, wild conspiracies about these satanic forces who have mobilized against their Savior and this country against a backdrop of apocalyptic destruction.  A staggering amount of American Christians, many of them white Christian nationalists, caused all of this.  And now they want to shrug and say, hey, can we get a pass?  Yeah, we've helped to propagate this irredeemably stupid apocalypse narrative that those devil Democrats and seculars are coming for our churches, our children, our jobs, our guns, our safety, our future.  But, you know, God is love.  Let's all hold hands together and sing kumbaya in unity.  Unity in this context is code.  It means now that we are facing the consequences of insurrection, we would like to dodge the shit that we threw at the fan.  You know, unity is a great idea.  It's a noble idea in the right context.  But unity doesn't mean that there's no accountability.  And I don't want unity with bigots and conspiracists and white Christian nationalists and domestic terrorists.  Now, here's the good news.  Some people are genuinely waking up.  Some people out there are genuinely, finally, legitimately realizing the dangers and the damage of Trump cult.  And I think we should be there for them.  and encourage them and help them out.  I mean, many of us were brainwashed at one time in our lives, and we needed help to find our way to better ideas.  I don't want to give up on those people.  But those people who have not operated in good faith right now, they're just scrambling to try to salvage what is left of their ruined reputations.  Those people who fueled and maybe continue to fuel the fires of insurrection, They don't get the luxury of martyrdom or popular amnesia or a future without consequences.  There is, right now, a cultural course correction taking place.  So if their Twitter feeds go dark, good.  If their hate groups on Parler go dark, good.  If they're scrambling like rats on the sinking ship, good.  These people are not victims.  They are not First Amendment martyrs.  They went to war with their fellow Americans, with the Constitution, the rule of law, and basic human decency.  Pull the plug, Twitter.  Enough is enough.  It is obvious.  To anybody who is honestly looking at Donald Trump's personal and professional life, the whole of his life, his business dealings and his cons and scams, his decades of sociopathic, predatory, toxic behavior, he has long been in violation of our society's terms of service.  Those terms put in place by the law, the Constitution, and all moral people.  There comes a time when truly dangerous voices do need to be shut down by the culture they are working to destroy.  Show him the door.  Lock him out.  And then throw away the key. ",
