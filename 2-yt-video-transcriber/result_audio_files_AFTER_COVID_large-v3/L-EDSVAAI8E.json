            "text": "Philip Garcia was taken to a California jail on a Wednesday morning in March of 2017.  By Friday, he was dead.  Riverside County withheld information about Garcia's death from his family, journalists, and federal monitors.  But using public records laws, ProPublica obtained 17 hours of video and thousands of pages of records that shed light on Garcia's treatment in custody.  We found that jail staff failed to address Garcia's urgent medical and mental health needs even after determining he was in a psychiatric crisis.  The videos show that deputies used violent force against Garcia and then lied about their treatment of him in reports.  His death was ruled a homicide, but it didn't lead to any charges or discipline for anyone involved in his custody or care.  The records provide an unusually thorough account of a recurrent tragedy, a person in mental crisis dying in law enforcement custody.  It began when police responded to a call that Garcia was behaving bizarrely and out of character, throwing things at his neighbor's house.  The 51-year-old repairman and father, shown here years earlier, was then arrested for allegedly assaulting his roommate.  The police department declined our request for footage of his arrest and transport to the jail, but their reports make clear that Garcia was experiencing a mental health crisis.  They say that Garcia was repeatedly banging his head against the barrier in the patrol car and yelling incoherently.  We don't know everything about Garcia's health history or the treatment he received in jail.  Much of his medical information was redacted and his family declined our request for interviews.  But we do know that Garcia's wife told law enforcement at least twice that he suffered from a seizure disorder.  Video of Garcia starts as officers lead him into the jail.  During the booking process, Garcia appears unable to follow directions.  We showed this footage to a mental health specialist who used to work at the jail. ",

Video from the cell's camera appears to malfunction, showing only fragments of live action and then freezing on a single frame for long stretches of time.  In the unfrozen moments, Garcia is behaving erratically.  He claws at the light on the ceiling, jumps at the security camera, and wraps toilet paper around his body.  By 6 the next morning, there's no evidence that mental health staff have seen Garcia or that he has slept or eaten for the last 18 hours.  A sergeant decides to forcibly remove Garcia from the cell because he's damaging the ceiling light and could harm himself.

Two minutes later, he forces the shield down on Garcia again.

A short while later, Garcia is sweating profusely.  Records show that earlier that day, the emergency department diagnosed him with a life-threatening condition brought on by overexertion.  It causes the body's muscles to break down and can lead to kidney failure.  Struggling against the restraints for so many hours is causing Garcia to destroy muscle tissue, pouring toxins into his bloodstream.  By 1047, Garcia has been restrained for 16 hours.  Then the video ends while three deputies and a state correctional officer are restraining him.  It's the last image we have of Philip Garcia alive.  He survives for three more hours, but the sheriff's department did not release footage from that time.  Shortly after 2  a.m.,  Garcia stops breathing.  Staff perform CPR, but it's too late.  We know from the autopsy report that struggling against the restraints contributed to his death.  The sheriff ruled that Garcia died at the hands of other people, making his death a homicide.  The Sheriff's Department conducted an internal review of Garcia's death and did not discipline any deputies.  Garcia's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Riverside County.  Their case could have exposed what happened to Garcia, but it never went to trial.  The county denied the allegations and admitted no wrongdoing.  It settled the suit by paying the Garcia family almost a million dollars, with the condition that the family not speak to the media about the case.  When Garcia died, Riverside County was already on notice.  The year before, a federal court ruled that the health care at county jails was woefully inadequate and ordered them to improve treatment of inmates.  But court records and expert reports show that inmates there are still at serious risk of harm because of a lack of adequate medical and mental health care. ",
