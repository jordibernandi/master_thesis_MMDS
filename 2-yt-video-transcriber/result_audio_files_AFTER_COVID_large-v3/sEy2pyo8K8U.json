They actually acquired explosive devices, IEDs that they then wrapped in shrapnel and they tested them because they wanted to make sure they would do maximum human damage.  When you have the president of this all started, Steph, let's remember on April 17th of this year, When Donald Trump tweeted out his command, his directive in all caps, liberate Michigan, what did we see days later?  We saw these weak, pathetic, armed gunmen.  If you're strong, if you're confident, you don't need to carry long guns around.  They packed the Michigan State Courthouse with their automatic weapons and their assault rifles.  They acted on Donald Trump's command.  We learned last \u2013 go ahead. ",

And they were plotting to kidnap and put on trial the governor of Michigan.  They were plotting to kill Michigan state troopers.  And Donald Trump, let me tell you, Steph, I've investigated a lot of conspiracy cases, including RICO conspiracy cases.  Donald Trump is the de facto leader of this conspiracy by tweeting out commands to liberate Michigan and then chastising the governor for saying, hey, these are good people.  These people are angry.  You need to give a little.  I mean, you know, this is a new kind of insanity.  But I'm so encouraged.  I'm so encouraged, Steph, by what you said a few minutes ago.  Pence canceled all travel.

He may have, but I'm not listening to Dr.  Feelgood, Dr.  Connolly, who stood up in front of the hospital and said, I was lying.  I'm paraphrasing.  I was misleading you all because I didn't want to steer the course of the illness in another direction.  And I said, hey, Doc, guess what?  The illness doesn't care what you say.  Whatever you say is not going to steer the illness in one direction or another.  The illness is going to do what the illness is going to do.  So how about you just tell us the truth?  He may be sick.  He may not be sick.  When I heard him hacking and coughing and wheezing on Hannity, I'm starting to believe he is sick.  You know, we're going to find out real quick here. ",

Pence's lies are transparent and so galling.  Well, not only packing the court with completely unqualified, according to the ABA, unqualified judges.  This isn't packing the court.  So while we're voting, trying to put someone on the Supreme Court when you wouldn't get Barack Obama a year before the election, his Supreme Court pick, that's not court packing? ",
