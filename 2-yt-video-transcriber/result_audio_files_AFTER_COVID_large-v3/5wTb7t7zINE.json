            "text": "um Hello there, I'm Lloyd Evans and you're watching the John Cedars Channel, not from the bunker as you can plainly see, but from an undisclosed location somewhere on the Croatian coast.  Yes, I am on my holidays due to go back tomorrow.  I swore I wouldn't make any videos while I was on holiday.  I've really needed to unwind after a very long and stressful convention season of doing the convention rebuttals.  But I did receive a really interesting voicemail.  I think it was yesterday.  And I thought, I can't not do a reply to that.  So here is said voicemail. ",

            "text": "I'm very thankful for all the information you show on your videos.  well the thing is that i've been raised as a jehovah witnesses since the very first time i was born.  i guess tomorrow will be four years.  i've been baptized and i've been hesitating the last year and as you said in many of your videos i just don't want to to to be true the things you said.  i mean i really like this life.  I like most of the things on the organization but as I've been watching you as I've been watching all your videos I realized that you're right and I don't want you to be right.  and the question I have is what this organization what does.  the governing body gets earns gains from all of this because i'm pretty sure my dad is an elder and he doesn't get a coin for all the work he has done and i'm pretty sure they didn't.  they don't profit with all of this.  they don't have this money benefits of doing this.  why if this is not real?  because well as as i saw on your videos Many of these things are not real.  But what do they get from it?  Why to do all of this?  Why to make such an effort to try this to be real if they don't get anything?  I'm pretty sure that the brothers, the government body in the USA have a better life than us in South America and many other brothers in the rest of the world.  I don't think that the organization has something to do with that.  Well, that's my question.  What do they get of doing all of this such a big deal?  Well, that's it.  Thank you for listening.  And again, I want to be anonymous on your video.  Don't show my name.  It's really good to have this chance to, I don't know, ask you something or to be in contact with you.  Okay, that's it, I guess.  Goodbye. ",

            "text": "Okay, so thank you.  Again, I won't be sharing your name on my channel.  I fully understand the situation that you and many others are in, namely of waking up and being in a situation where you're surrounded by believing friends and family and you can't make known your feelings about the organisation.  And I very much relate... to what you were saying about not wanting it to be true, listening to people online.  In my own case, it was reading JW Facts and thinking, right, my faith is going to turn out to be true after I've subjected it to scrutiny.  I'm going to be vindicated.  My faith is going to end up being rock solid and I'm going to be able to forge ahead in Jehovah's organization and not give apostasy a second thought ever again.  But when you do start going online and seeing what myself and others have to say, it just makes sense, doesn't it?  You don't want it to be true.  But it's true.  So I do relate to that.  As to your question, so you seem to be asking essentially what's in it for them, what's in it for the governing body.  They don't seem to be like some televangelists.  I'm thinking of people like Kenneth Copeland.  it doesn't seem that they are overtly enriching themselves due to their position.  There are some who would argue with that, I know.  Some who would say, ah yes, but you see them wearing fancy watches or you see them with pinky rings and they're flaunting their wealth.  i don't buy into that too much.  yes they do seem to enjoy the finer things in life.  we know that they travel first class when they're on assignments around the world and look it's difficult to imagine that the governing body members don't live incredibly comfortable lives as a result of their position.  If you think about it, particularly these days when there's so much uncertainty, there's a huge incentive there to not have to worry about anything at all financially.  I mean, these guys are looked after 24-7.  They are doted over.  They don't need to go grocery shopping.  They don't need to worry about paying the bills.  Everything gets paid for them.  And they live comfortable lives.  Now, is that the reason why they perpetuate this organisation and why they insist on so many fawning over them and giving them all of this power and all of this adulation, I don't think that's the main reason.  I don't think it has to be the main reason.  There are other reasons than money as to why cult leaders proliferate.  And for me, the main reason why you have cult leaders, why you have people who... wish to generate a following, wish to generate a mass of followers who are totally devoted to them.  It's power.  It's just power.  Power can be intoxicating.  Power is all that you really need to explain why the likes of Tony Morris, Stephen Lett, David Splane, Samuel Hurd, It's all you need to explain why they do what they do.  Now, the extent to which they are deluded versus the extent to which they are cynical, in other words, the extent to which they are knowingly perpetuating a scam is open to some debate.  But if your argument is, well, it can't be all that bad, and I know this isn't what you're arguing, you're just putting forward the standard Jehovah's Witness defence of, well, they can't be perpetuating a scam because there's nothing in it for them.  Not so.  Not true.  All you need is the power.  It could be that to some degree these men are knowingly scamming people.  They don't believe it themselves.  They just have realized that they're onto a good thing and they're gonna keep it going as long as possible.  I personally believe that while there's an element of that, it's far more nuanced.  I think that they, to a degree, ",
