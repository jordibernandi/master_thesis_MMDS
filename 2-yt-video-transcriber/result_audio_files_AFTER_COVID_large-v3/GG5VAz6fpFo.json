            "text": "hey guys in this video i wanted to update you on where i currently stand on what i think are the top 10 potential senate flips that we could see heading towards the general election which is less than half a year away from where we currently stand.  there's been some more polls coming out for these senate matchups over the past handful of weeks and they've actually been really positive for the democrats as a whole.  that doesn't necessarily mean that trend will hold going all the way to the general election.  that's just the snapshot that we have At this point in time, we even had a poll come out today where even in a state like Kentucky, the Democrats are showing very competitive in the most recent poll that came out of that state.  And that's one that I don't even have in my top 10.  So I actually want to start out.  with some of my honorable mentions for the top 10, and then basically going from least to most likely of Senate flips.  So at the back end of this top 10, it's gonna be less than a 50% chance for the flip to occur.  And then we're gonna kind of trend towards those Senate seats that are kind of in that 50-50 range.  And then towards the top of this list, their Senate seats that I expect to flip to the other party.  Now, starting off with those honorable mentions, just right on the top of the list here, we had a poll come out in the state of Kentucky, and it was Amy McGrath, the Democrat in that instance.  And she's potentially going to have a tougher primary than people thought that she was going to have originally going against Booker in that matchup.  We'll see who ends up going on and being the top of the ticket there for the Democrats in Kentucky.  But McGrath in that poll today against McConnell was basically a statistical tie.  I actually think that Booker could present an even bigger challenge potentially to McConnell if people actually learn more about him.  McGrath has had some gaffes along the way.  I'm skeptical that she'd be able to win a statewide race in Kentucky, but at least the poll that we got out today showed that she might be able to be competitive.  And then also Kentucky.  in the 2019 governor's race, the Democrat was able to show that he could win a statewide against a very unpopular incumbent Republican.  Maybe we get a replay of that in the state in 2020, but The difference here in 2020 is Trump is on the top of the ticket, so he's likely to help carry Republican is running in that Senate seat down ballot.  So that could be a difference maker.  And even if it is competitive, that the Trump factor here is probably going to push.  the Republicans over the line in that instance.  I'm not going to spend this much time on the rest of the honorable mentions here so I can get into the top 10.  Some of these other ones would be states like Michigan with John James running against Gary Peters.  James a little bit more competitive in 2018 than I thought he was going to be against Debbie Stabenow, but still losing by, I think it was around six or seven percentage points somewhere in that range.  And the polling has been really good for Gary Peters lately.  So I think that Michigan is probably still more so in the hands of the in that instance.  South Carolina, we've seen the occasional poll from time to time that's been competitive with the incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham in that one, but not in my top 10.  Also, Alaska, it typically goes statewide to the Republicans, but it's not a huge voter base, and things can be interesting from time to time in the state of Alaska, but still likely to go over to the Republicans.  And then also Georgia's Senate race that isn't the special election.  They have the incumbency advantage with Purdue, who has a decent approval number.  So that one, it could be competitive, but not in my top 10 at this point in time.  So those are some of the seats that could potentially maybe be in the realm of being competitive, but didn't make my top 10 list.  So starting off at number 10 here, the state of Texas.  Now, In 2018, there was a very competitive Senate race between Ted Cruz, the incumbent Republican, and Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger.  Now, this time around, I think that John Cornyn, his incumbency advantage, he's not quite as well known as Ted Cruz, which makes the incumbency advantage not mean quite as much.  But he also is sitting on better approval numbers than Cruz was back in 2018.  So that's a net benefit to him.  And then also, I don't think the Democratic challenger in 2020 is going to be quite as strong of a contender as what we saw from beto o'rourke with what he was able to do with record fundraising in that 2018 senate bid.  but then also on the flip side of that we could see a very competitive presidential race between biden and trump and if biden was able to make the surprise and win the statewide election and then also you have to consider texas.  it's trending in a more competitive direction.  it's two years separated from where we were in 2018 with that competitive race.  So maybe the demographics continuing to shift here are making a bit more of a difference.  And like I said, if Biden is able to surprise and win Texas, maybe that has a down ballot impact and a surprise Senate flip there.  But I'd still give the advantage to the Republicans to continue to claim the state of Texas in an area that's becoming more and more competitive over time.  At number nine here, I have the special election in Georgia.  Georgia is also a state that's kind of been trending a bit more to being very competitive.  We saw this in the 2018 governor's race, extremely close.  Clinton lost to Trump in Georgia by about five or so percentage points.  And out of all of these southeastern states, Georgia is actually one with the statewide races where they can actually be a bit more competitive, especially with the population center in and around the Atlanta and the suburbs of Atlanta have been trending towards the Democrats, which is making things a bit more competitive.  Biden has a potential shot at picking up the statewide race in Georgia, and that can have a down ballot positive impact here on this special election.  And the Republican in this instance, isn't going to have the incumbency advantage that Purdue is going to have in the other Georgia Senate race.  But at this point in time, I'm still giving the lean over to the Republicans to pick that one up at number eight.  I have the state of Kansas.  If Chris Kobach wins the Republican primary, then I think the Democrats have actually a decent shot at potentially picking this one up.  We've seen this in the polls that we've been getting out of the state of Kansas, where when Kobach is head to head against Bollier, the Democrat, then things have been really close and competitive.  But where Bollier has gone against Marshall, for instance, it's been a little bit more positive for the Republicans in that instance.  So it's just going to kind of depend on what the matchup ends up being at this point in time.  still giving that one as a lean over to the republicans but one to keep an eye on.  so then going to number seven on this list we have the state of iowa and we now know what this senate matchup is going to be.  it's going to be the democrat greenfield against the incumbent republican joni ernst.  we just got a poll out very recently and greenfield was ahead of ernst by three percentage points.  the poll prior to that she was up on Ernst by two percentage points.  So some positive news there for the Democrats that this matchup is showing that they can potentially pick this one up.  I think this is right on about a 50-50 at this point in time, extremely close and competitive.  But this is where I start to see things flipping over to the other side.  So since this is number seven on the list, that means the next six races I also have as flips going to the opposing party.  So then next that we have here, number six is the state of Montana.  Also, recent polling coming out that's been bullish for the Democrats' chances at picking this one up against the incumbent Republican Steve Daines, the Democratic governor.  He was the best case scenario for the Democrats to run in this head-to-head matchup.  And Bullock, he was ahead by seven percentage points in the last poll that we got out from the Montana State University poll.  We also saw a Democrat could win here statewide in the 2018 midterms with Jon Tester continuing to hold that seat.  And I think it's going to be extremely close.  But at this point in time, I actually think the popular Democratic governor there in the state is going to have a decent shot at picking that one up against the incumbent Republican.  Moving on, we have the state.  of North Carolina.  And we know this matchup as well.  It's going to be the incumbent Republican Tom Tillis against the Democratic challenger Cunningham.  And Cunningham, again, in the prior polls that we've been getting out over the past few weeks, he's been very close and competitive, but with a slight lead over Tillis.  Tillis is one of the least known senators in his home state.  So that incumbency advantage doesn't mean quite as much.  And also he's been underwater with those approval numbers.  Another one that's likely to be extremely close and competitive is If Biden's able to pick this one up statewide in his matchup against Trump, then it probably means that Cunningham would also have a decent shot at going on and defeating Tillis in that instance.  So then in number four, I have the state of Maine, Susan Collins, the voters in the state of Maine.  have really soured on her over the past year plus.  Collins has become one of the most disapproved of senators out of all 100 in the US Senate.  That's not a great look.  And then also the polling that we've been getting has been showing the Democratic challengers, particularly Gideon, a strong head-to-head in those polls against Collins.  As we move into the top three of this list, these are all Senate seats that I'm pretty confident are going to be flipping to the opposing party.  Starting off at number three, the state of Arizona.  Really early on, I was saying that this is a Senate seat that the Democrats have a great shot at picking up because Mark Kelly is name recognition.  He has the clout of being an astronaut, very respected individual.  His wife is a political hero in the state, Gabby Giffords.  He's been able to fundraise very well.  And early on, I was saying that Mark Kelly was going to be an even tougher opponent in 2020 for Martha McSally than even Sinema was for her back in 2018, the midterm that she lost in that head-to-head matchup against Sinema.  So that's one that I feel is Pretty strong at this point to go likely over to the Democrats.  And then number two on this list, I have the state of Alabama.  And the only reason I don't have Alabama number one on this list is because the now incumbent Democratic senator.  So they have the incumbency advantage.  But in general, his approval numbers have been above water, which is saying something in and of itself for a Democrat representing Alabama.  the state of Alabama.  When you have a lot of these Republicans that I've been talking about as incumbents with their approval numbers below water, and those are in states that aren't as heavily partisan as what the state of Alabama is towards the Republicans.  But at the end of the day, with Trump at the top of the ticket, he's so popular in the state of Alabama, he's probably going to be carrying the Republicans across the line to pick up that Senate seat in one of the deepest red states in the country.  And then that leaves us with Colorado.  That's a state that's been trending a towards the Democrats over the past decade plus.  And the polling has been pretty awful for Gardner in his hypothetical against the former Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper.  And even if it's the more progressive Senate candidate Romanoff running against Gardner, I still think the Democrats would have a really good shot at picking that one up in the state.  So those are the top 10 Senate seats that I think could potentially flip here heading towards the general election a little less than half a year away.  from where we currently stand.  And this landscape is probably going to continue to change over the course of time.  It's looking really good for the Democrats right now.  I have it at 52 seats for the Democrats to 48 for the Republicans.  It is possible that it could be even a starker contrast than this.  if the Democrats are able to pick up You know, a Senate seat like Kansas, especially if it's Kobach in that instance, potentially picking up this special election in the state of Georgia, maybe picking up Texas, maybe also picking up the other Georgia Senate seat, especially if there's a down ballot positive impact.  If Biden's able to go on and win the state of Georgia, we just saw a poll today that the state of Kentucky.  Very competitive in that instance against McConnell.  We'll see how that race shapes up.  So you can get a situation where you start climbing into the upper 50s with the Democrats.  But some of these seats are obviously in more of a dream scenario for the Democrats than what is potentially going to happen.  But it's something we're going to have to continue to keep our eyes on, especially if the polls are continuing to trend like we have been seeing them over the past few weeks, which have been really positive overall for the Democrats.
