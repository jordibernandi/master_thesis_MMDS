            "text": "This is a 10 by 20 safe cellar that we just set.  It's on the concrete foundation.  This will come up under the house here.  You'll just walk into it like a regular staircase under the house.  Now this one here has a vault door on it, so it's got a real pretty vault door.  Then the inside will be built out like a wine cellar or a gun room or whatever you want.  This particular one's gonna be built out like a wine cellar.  Like I said, it's 10 feet wide, 20 feet long with eight foot ceilings.  And then going back out the stairs, there's the door, it's got emergency release on it.  Going back out the stairs.  And then you go ahead and just build your house on top of this now.  That's it.  Thank you.  Guys, welcome back to another episode of Atlas Survival Shelters.  I hope everyone is having a beautiful and fantastic day.  Guys, if you've never seen my channel before, I talk about bomb shelters, survival supplies, gears, and basically preparing for when things go really, really south.  But recently, The New York Times just did a story which was on the front page of the housing part and the story was are doomsday bunkers going to become the new normal?  Well ironically two years ago when I printed my catalog as you can see right here.  it says welcome to the new normal.  So the answer is yes and the reason being is My idea when I first came up with the idea that maybe everyone should start thinking about having a safe room in the house was for tornadoes, hurricanes, and in case there's ever some kind of anarchy in this country or a civil war or a world war.  Fast forward two years and everything I feared is looking like it's going to come true.  The experts put the odds at like 60%.  the USA will end up into a civil war.  As a matter of fact, I saw one report that if you are born today, there's about a 90% guaranteed chance that you will see World War III and a civil war in the United States of America.  So the future doesn't look too bright for a lot of us, okay?  So you're a family, you have children and you want to protect them, you want to look after their best needs.  So what can you do?  Guys, what I have is this thing that's called the safe cellar and all it is is a pre-manufactured drop-in basement type looking device that you put under your house that you have a place to retreat in case It's a dark night and there's tornadoes everywhere and you want to go down there and spend the night in the bunkers.  It's really not much more than having a basement except my bunker is airtight, it's watertight, it has an NBC air filtration system and it has the air pipes that you need to bring the air in.  Plus it has either a bulletproof vault door or a gas tight door or both in most cases with my bunkers.  So is it a smart move to do this?  Yes, because it is not.  The prices on them have come down so much.  The average price used to be like $100,000.  It's been cut in half at least.  The average bunker I do now is somewhere between the $30,000 and $50,000 range.  So if you are building a new house, and you think it would be fun, practical, or smart to have a safe room in your house, a safe cellar would be right for you.  Matter of fact, I would say at least 99% of the people that are building new homes that I'm showing them to that are kind of the high-end homes are saying, yeah, let's do one last minute.  They're like holding up everything.  So the key thing is we got to come into your house or the builder who's building your house typically does this, he's got to dig down about an extra 12, 13 feet, 14 feet, depends on the depth of the bunker.  And he has to dig a hole under the foundation of the house and he has to put in a pre-slab.  Then once the pre-slab has been poured, he comes in and he drops the shelter right on top of the pad, we anchor it down and then basically you just go ahead and do what you normally would do in a house.  So when you pour the foundation on the house, basically, It's just anchored into the concrete.  So it's not very hard to do it.  So you have to be proactive, guys.  You've got to think ahead.  But the places that we can put these bunkers is too numerous to count.  If you're building a barn, Okay, especially if you're building a new barn and you're living in an existing house.  Guys, don't miss the opportunity to put a shelter in a barn.  If all you have is five acres or you have a ranch somewhere and you're not going to be building a house, you can put the shelter under a shed in the backyard.  You can put it under a shipping container out on that ranch.  You can put these shelters under new apartment buildings.  Heck, you can put them under a new burger shack if you want, guys.  But when they build houses, there's what's called the big three.  These high-end houses.  They do swimming pools, they do movie theaters, and they do a wine cellar.  My shelter works in collaboration with all three.  Believe it or not, you can actually put a shelter under the pool before you build the pool.  As you can see in this illustration here, all they have to do is dig a little deeper, put in the shelter, then build the pool.  If you're building a wine cellar, same thing.  You can put the shelter in, the shelter will double as the wine cellar.  And if you want to have a gun room, Same thing, put in the shelter, use it as your gum room or your gun vault, and then just go ahead and build the house on top of it.  And as far as passages, guys, you can do secret passages, you can do entrances where the floor opens up, you can do entrances where you literally go through a sliding kitchen counter as shown here.  There's just too many ways to do it.  You can hide the entrance under a bed, you can hide the entrance in a closet, you can just put it anywhere you want.  As a matter of fact, you can even have these secret passages where the wall opens up, you walk into a room and you enter down into your bunker.  Guys, your imagination is the only limit.  But having a safe cellar and a safe room in these times is going to be smart.  It's very sad to see the United States of America so decisive But a house divided cannot stand, and we are a country divided.  So people, a lot of people are worried about the future and their children, so they are preparing for the absolute worst.  Worst case scenario, God, I hope you never need the shelter what it's intended for.  I hope you only have to enjoy it as that wine cellar or that gun room.  But in your heart, you will know that it's there for you and your family in case you ever need it.  And guys, that is what's called having a plan B, okay?  Plan B is what are you going to do when a disaster hits?  You're going to go to the safe cellar.  A lot of people up north already have basements, so that's their plan B. We're going to go down to the basement.  The problem is a basement is not going to protect you from biological, chemical, nuclear fallout or any of those things.  That's why the safe cellar is a practical choice.  I've got them starting at under $20,000 now.  Soon in the United States of America you will be able to buy your shelter from a local dealer.  I've had over 1,300 people apply worldwide now to be a dealer for the Atlas Safe Cellars.  There will be about 200 dealers coming to the United States so very soon you will be able to call someone in your area.  They will be able to quote it to you, give you a price installed and all Atlas will be doing in the future is manufacturing shelters and distributing them to dealers nationwide.  And of course, we will have a plant over in Europe for the European dealers.  Okay, that's already been arranged.  It's set up.  Matter of fact, the factory is already there.  I just can't get into Poland right now with the COVID virus.  What other bunkers do I do, just in case a safe seller is not for you?  Guys, Atlas Survival Shelters does round bunkers, we do square bunkers, we do silo bunkers, we do monolithic dome bunkers, we do poured in place concretes like the one, the shelter you're seeing right here in this video.  If we can't get a bunker delivered to your property, What we do is we come out, we dig a hole, we pour a foundation and we do what's called a poured in place concrete shelter.  And that's the way they pretty much do all the bunkers over there in Switzerland and Israel.  They just build them in into the body of the house.  Matter of fact, Several countries have mandated that every time you build a house or a business that you've got to have a 10 foot by 10 foot safe cellar or safe room or a fallout shelter.  And those countries are Israel, Finland, Singapore, and Switzerland.  Okay, those four countries are Switzerland, Singapore, Finland, and Israel.  And I don't know if there's others, but those are the four that are always on the tip of my tongue.  So guys, I hope you... We'll consider this on your next house.  It's a great opportunity.  You will be sorry afterwards if you don't do it because it's just a good opportunity to get it in before the slab.  And guys, if you already got the house built, remember what I said, you can always add it to the backyard.  If you're doing a room addition or you're going to add a second garage, guys, don't miss out on the opportunity to have that little safe cellar underneath your house.  That way, for generations and for the next hundred years, your family does have a place to go for anything including tornadoes, hurricanes, civil unrest, or just a place to go down and watch TV and hang out if you're a kid and turn it into your little personal fort.  So guys, I hope you enjoy this video and an introduction to the safe cellar and all the different ways and places that you can put the shelter in.
