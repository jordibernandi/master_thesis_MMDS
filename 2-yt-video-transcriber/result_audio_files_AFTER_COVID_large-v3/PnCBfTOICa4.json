Filling yourself up with life force, with chi, with prana energy, with this beautiful breath that is so abundant.  Deep breath in.  And exhale.  And on the third one, we're gonna exhale with a sigh as loud as you can.  Take a deep breath in.  And let it out.  So I'm going to read this.  Just follow with your mind's eye.  Keep your eyes closed.  and let this vibrate in every cell of your being and let this affirmation completely be embedded in your DNA.  In the name of truth, I hereby cancel any permission I might have given for imposed hypnotism and control of my being.  I reject and remove out of my system all kinds of controlling techniques that have been used to control or harvest my energy and my awareness.  I now let go of any remaining fear that is still vibrating in my being.  If ever I have used any controlling technique towards another, consciously or unconsciously, I hereby cancel it completely.  I am awake and I can breathe.  I am now out of the spider's web of control.  I am free.  All my senses are being naturally restored.  I am enlightened.  I am regaining my true power.  I can breathe.  I can breathe.  I am sovereign.  I can breathe.  I am divinity.  I am freedom.  I am unity.  I am forgiveness.  I am love.  So be it.  And so it is. ",
