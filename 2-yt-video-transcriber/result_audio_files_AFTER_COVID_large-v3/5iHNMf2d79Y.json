            "text": "Okay, so I guess I have to explain to some people why Kyle Rittenhouse is not to be celebrated.  I guess that's a thing I can't take for granted here in 2020.  I'm sorry if my tone comes across a little frustrated in this video, because I know the overwhelming majority of my audience understands what I'm about to say.  But enough people have been stinking up my Twitter feed with Rittenhouse apologia that I'm compelled to go over this.  Just look at this tweet from Destiny.  Or what about this tweet from Destiny?  I know, I'd love to do another silly video, have my little jokes and goofs, see what Grumbletum is up to, but no.  We have to talk about the alleged... Spree-killing coffee spokesperson, who half of my Twitter feed has decided is apparently innocent of any wrongdoing when he deliberately went to an act of protest with a semi-automatic weapon that he had no legal right to hold, got into a fight, and shot three people, killing two.  And let me just state this right off the top.  If Rittenhouse was anything but a white guy, we would not need to have this conversation.  People don't bend themselves backwards to justify any other killers.  Yes, he was just 17, but Brandon Bernard was only 18 in 1999 when he was sentenced to the death penalty for his role in a botched robbery based on shaky testimony that he may have been partially responsible for one person's death.  His execution is scheduled for today.  And as of yet, his requests for clemency have been denied by the Trump administration, which is desperate to get as many executions done as it can before anti-death penalty president-elect Joe Biden takes over.  The same Trump administration that's publicly defending Rittenhouse before the investigation into his killings is even complete.  Cool.  Rittenhouse, meanwhile, is taking sponsorship deals while the blood of his victims is still warm. ",

Number one, did we sponsor Kyle Rittenhouse?  The answer is no.  The reason for that, the reason why I think it's important, is that we're not in the business of profiting from tragedy.  We're not in the business of profiting from this event.  We have zero interest in collecting one dollar from any of this. ",

            "text": "If indeed we are meant to accept the premise that he was innocently acting in self-defense, as he claims, a normal person forced into a situation of having to kill two people in self-defense doesn't leverage that for brand appeal.  Piece of PR advice, Kyle.  You might wanna wait a couple years before doing the crocodile-tiered talk show circuit.  Even if he were innocent, which no reasonable person could conclude that he is, that would be ghoulish.  So let's go through a loose timeline of events here.  August 23rd, a white police officer shoots Jacob Blake, potentially paralyzing him for life.  In response, the Kenosha Black Lives Matter movement protests.  You might remember that this summer was kind of a flashpoint for protesting the murders of black men at the hands of the police.  Because people were already mad about how the American government left black communities to die in the COVID-19 pandemic.  So the constant direct murders were kind of the straws that broke the camel's back vis-a-vis the state killing black people.  In response, on August 25th, the leader of an anti-protest militia, the Kenosha Guard, former Kenosha alderman Kevin Mathewson, puts out a call on Facebook saying, Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend Out City from the evil thugs?  Non-doubt, they are currently planning on the next part of the city to burn tonight!  Mathewson is currently being sued by the partner of Anthony Huber, one of the men killed by Rittenhouse.  Kenosha News reports, The suit uses Reconstruction-era federal law inspired by the rise of the Ku Klux Klan that bars people from conspiring for the purpose of depriving people of equal protection under the law.  Most recently, the federal law was used in a lawsuit against organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.  The client in the Unite the Right rally, that's some esteemed company, Kevin.  The Kenosha lawsuit alleges Mathewson and militia members conspired to deprive people of their constitutional rights with the help of Facebook through the Kenosha Guard's call for militia members to come to the city during protests.  The suit includes screenshots of comments on the Kenosha Militia page like, Another commenter on the page states, Another stated, And I'll just leave it to you to work out who them is in that sentence.  These social media posts from the Kenosha Guard are well publicized and get national attention when they appear on InfoWars.  Mathewson has said in interviews after the shootings that he stands by his decision to put out a call for militia members.  He has said he did not know Rittenhouse and that he had not interacted with him that night.  Facebook claimed there was no direct links between his accounts and the Kenosha Guard page.  However, The lawsuit states, So here's Rittenhouse, a supporter of the Blue Lives Matter movement, who participated in police cadet programs, a guy who likes the police and probably wouldn't like if people protested the actions of the police.  He sees this and decides he needs to join up with these guys.  These guys are on the level.  So on August 25th, he meets up with Dominic Black, who either lends him an AR-15 or buys one in his name.  It's all a bit dodgy.  That part's still being worked out.  They decide to go to CarSource, a local business that has been targeted by protesters and suffered millions of dollars in damages from arson due to its proximity to the Kenosha courthouse.  It's worth noting that N. Mulkindry, the owner of CarSource, maintains that he did not ask for or endorse anyone coming to protect his business.  According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, The co-owner of CarSource said Thursday he didn't hire the men, ask for their help, or endorse it.  Why would I?  Amnal Kindri said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  I'm already burned out.  There was nothing left to protect.  Also worth noting that these guys who were there to uphold law and order were violating a curfew that police had ordered over the city that night.  Back the blue!  Unless they tell you to do something you don't feel like you should have to do.  In which case, stick around and make the situation more dangerous.  Rittenhouse, at some point, meets up with a group of people, including Ryan Balch, and just... This part... We're about to take a brief detour from tragedy into comedy.  See, Bulch has a habit of posting support for far-right groups on Twitter and Facebook.  The Southern Poverty Law Center reports, on Facebook and on Twitter, Bulch referenced the far-right Boogaloo movement.  I pause here to mention the Boogaloo movement are a far-right militia movement who believe a second Civil War is imminent, hence the name.  It's like Civil War II, Electric Boogaloo, because everything is like this now.  Even our hate groups are irony poisoned.  That's just the world, and it's exhausting.  None of that is the funny part!  To be clear, the funny part is that when Hatewatch asked Balch about this, he claimed that he was, get this, infiltrating the far right for some reason.  His evidence of this?  An ableist Nazi mocking webpage on Facebook that there's no evidence he could provide he was in any way involved with.  That's why he had to make fun of mass shooting victims and harass a rabbi.  with anti-Semitic slang for the memes.  Hatewatch asked him why he used his real name in these accounts, and Balch claims it was because at the time, Twitter had a policy against using pseudonyms, which I don't think I have to tell you has never been true, and even if it were, how would Twitter know whether or not you're using your real name?  This is simply incredible.  This absolute genius spent most of the day with Rittenhouse, but at some point, they were separated before the shootings began, which brings us neatly back to tragedy.  Around 11.45 that night, Rittenhouse got into a verbal confrontation with 36-year-old protester Joseph Rosenbaum.  Rosenbaum was incensed at Rittenhouse trying to put out a fire in a dumpster with a fire extinguisher, and potentially may also have confused him with a security guard he'd had some other conflict with earlier that night.  This confrontation escalated quickly.  Rosenbaum threw something, probably a plastic bag.  Rittenhouse begins to run until someone, it's unclear who, but almost definitely a protester, fired a gun two times.  It's unclear towards whom or why.  Shortly after this, a protester named Joshua Zaminski fires a warning shot from a pistol into the air.  a profoundly foolish and dangerous act.  Rittenhouse, presumably thinking he's being shot at, and maybe being shot at, I don't know, then turns towards the people pursuing him and aims his gun.  Rosenbaum tries to disarm Rittenhouse, who then opens fire, shooting him four times and fatally wounding him.  Rittenhouse runs away and can be heard on a call on his cell phone saying, I just killed somebody.  So at this point, protesters are yelling, go get that guy, beat him up, stuff like that.  And an unidentified guy tries to hit Rittenhouse.  It knocks his hat off, but doesn't make contact.  Rittenhouse falls down and is approached by Anthony Huber.  Huber strikes Rittenhouse with a skateboard and attempts to disarm him and is shot and killed.  Gage Grosskreutz has been pursuing and he has a handgun on him.  When Huber is killed, Grosskreutz puts his hands up.  Rittenhouse fires anyway, taking out a big chunk of Grosskreutz's right bicep.  At this point, Rittenhouse gets up, puts his hands up, with his gun still strapped to his chest, and approaches a police car to hand himself in.  The police car, frustratingly, just keeps on driving, even while the protesters are shouting to arrest him.  Rittenhouse meets back up with Dominic Black, who drives him home, once again crossing state lines shortly after committing what is potentially a felony.  The next day, Rittenhouse turns himself in to police in Illinois.  These are the events as they happen, to the best of my knowledge.  If I've made some mistake along the way, I hope you'll understand that it wasn't out of some bad faith attempt to paint a narrative, but because there's a lot to research in this case.  I'm not going to show any video footage, because I don't want to show footage of people being shot and killed on my YouTube channel, but these events were recorded by bystanders who covered it from multiple angles.  If you think I'm misrepresenting events, or lying in some way, I invite you to do your own research.  Rittenhouse's defenders, including his attorney, point to the fact that he was attacked by protesters and attempted to flee.  That he heard gunshots and believed he was under fire.  He may in fact have been under fire, it's unclear, but not unreasonable to suggest that one or more of the 16 unidentified shots that went off during this exchange was aimed in his direction.  I'm not going to dispute any of that.  I'll even grant you that Rittenhouse probably did think his life was in danger when he started shooting.  And I don't think Rittenhouse is the only person with blood on his hands that night.  I think Joshua Zaminski and whoever fired the first shots have a lot to answer for as well.  You don't just pull out a gun in a situation like that and fire warning shots.  That's reckless and is, to say the least, a needless escalation of this conflict.  If history began the second that Rittenhouse was confronted by Rosenbaum, the evidence would seem exculpatory.  But when you place the events in context, they're a little harder to wave away as self-defense.  This guy goes to join up with militias that have deep connections to far-right hate groups, crosses state lines with an illegally obtained semi-automatic weapon that he obtains specifically for this purpose, spends the majority of his day with an avowed member of the far-right Boogaloo movement who sure posts in support of Hitler a lot, for dubious reasons, ostensibly to protect a business whose owner did not want or ask for their help, to support police in defiance of a curfew police had put in effect, sought out a confrontation, and killed two people, injuring a third.  Then, after one half-hearted attempt at handing himself over to the police, crossed state lines again, turning himself in the next day.  And I'm not a lawyer.  I would never claim that I was, or that I could be.  I'd never pass the LSATs.  I mean, how arrogant would you have to be to think that you could just do something like that without years of study?  I don't think that Rittenhouse will be found guilty of murder in court.  I don't think the charges will stick, aside from maybe the possession of an illegal firearms charge.  That one seems pretty difficult to deny.  The evidence against him is highly circumstantial.  I don't think it's enough to win a court case, but it's evidence nonetheless.  The presumption of innocence, until proven guilty, does not apply in the court of public opinion.  And I think it's a bit insulting to the intelligence of anyone who hears this story to suggest that Rittenhouse was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He sought this out.  He brought a semi-automatic weapon into a dangerous situation and then shot it, killing people.  One could imagine some happenstance where all of the far-right militias he just found himself working with were just coincidentally there, that he had no ideological common ground with the people whose stated intent was to provoke a violent confrontation, kill a bunch of people, and maybe, if they were very, very lucky, start a second civil war.  Through no fault of his own, he just bumbled his way into a group of Nazis looking to shoot people.  So eager was he to protect a business that neither asked for or approved of this protection.  It's possible to imagine a situation where a peaceful kid brings an illegal semi-automatic firearm to a protest against a group he has pledged to support for, not to intimidate people or to commit violence, but simply out of an abundance of caution for his own safety.  so moved was he against the violence done by protesters against a small business to protest something as trivial as violence done against black human beings that he couldn't help but be compelled to act to diffuse the situation by adding more guns to the situation.  Hypothetically possible, I suppose, but is it credible?  Is it likely?  And if you still want to give this kid the benefit of the doubt after hearing all of this, let me ask you a question.  It's a genuine question, and I'd like you to really think about it.  If you heard all of the details of this story, but instead of being a militia member or Blue Lives Matter type, Rittenhouse was Antifa or he was Muslim, would you still give him the benefit of the doubt?  Would you still approach this situation with the same sense of neutrality?  Just think about that.  Everybody, no eyeballs on this week.  I don't have the emotional energy after making this video.  I'm a bit bummed out.  I also don't really want to do my calls to action, if I'm being honest.  You know all of this stuff.  I always say the same stuff.  Instead of doing any of that, I'd like to point you towards the Innocence Project at innocenceproject.org.  They exonerate wrongly convicted people through DNA testing, and that gets innocent people off of death row.  If you're truly concerned about people who are being unfairly targeted by the justice system, I think that's a better use of your time than Kyle Rittenhouse.  Stay safe out there. ",
