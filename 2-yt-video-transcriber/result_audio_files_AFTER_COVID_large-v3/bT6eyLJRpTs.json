            "text": "Well, it came through the evening before, the usual evening O-group, you know, prepare to move, timings and that sort of stuff.  We were yomping.  We didn't think we'd have to yomp very far because, unawares at the time that a ship called the Atlantic Conveyor had been sunk, she contained all the Chinooks except for one.  One had managed to get off previously and that was the only sort of, you know, heavy helo lift capability that the brigade had.  And that included when 5th Brigade turned up, you know, our logistic regiment was actually supplying two brigades when it was only designed to supply one.  But the air support was woefully inadequate because we lost those Chinooks when the Atlantic conveyor was sunk.  So... But we weren't aware of that at the time.  I mean, information trickles down to the trenches very, very slowly.  The one moment of that week before we move on, I just want to mention part of that process of changing from peace to war mentality.  I think it was about D plus four.  And by that time, we'd lost HMS Coventry, HMS Ardent, HMS Plymouth had been hit, HMS Brilliance had been hit.  You know, the ships were going down one a day.  It was really having a serious effect on us.  We were thinking, shit, you know, these aren't just warships.  These are our taxes to get us home.  So the reality was rapidly sort of, you know, changing our views.  But we just stood down.  It was dark.  And I'd just been given great news by the company commander that Corporal Harry Siddle, one of the three section commanders in five troop, my troop, had just had a baby girl born, his first daughter.  So I went up to him and I said, and this is where the formality, of course, incidentally, going back to that theme, didn't seem important anymore.  And I just shook him by the hand.  I said, congratulations, Harry, you've just had a baby girl born.  And almost as I said that, HMS Antelope blew up right in front of us.  And that's one of those iconic photographs.  And I hate using that word because it's so much of a cliche now, but it truly was an iconical photograph of the ship blowing up.  And we've been aware that something wasn't right because we've seen a thin column of smoke coming out during the day, you know, rising from it, knowing that doesn't look right.  But we weren't prepared for that.  And that changed the whole tenor.  I don't think anybody turned in that night.  We just stood there and watched the ship burn.  And we were unaware that they'd already got the crew off.  But unfortunately, the EOD guy was killed.  And I think his oppo lost his arms.  Staffs aren't Prescott, if I remember rightly.  But we didn't know that.  We just assumed that the whole crew had gone up with it.  I wouldn't say morale ever got to rock bottom.  But we certainly got to a couple of points where it was about as bad as it can ever get, which we'll come on to. ",

            "text": "Well, actually, the anti-mine training was pretty scant.  You know, it was the DMS boot and the putty, mate, and good luck.  But we yonked off the landing craft and straight up a hill a place called Port San Carlos.  And that's where the reality sunk.  You know, the Bergens were a massive.  It was just a very slow breathing out your backside sort of plot up the hill.  My order was to go to a building called New House.  I can't remember the precise distance now.  but I would say less than 10 miles away.  But over that country, there were no roads, no tracks, nothing.  It was just rough country.  It was very, very hard going.  The navigation wasn't difficult because although there are no features worthy and certain sections of the map were just blank with the words cloud obscured written on them.  So there were no features whatsoever, no contours or anything.  what there was with the fences.  And there are no trees in the Falklands outside of Stanley, Port Stanley, the capital.  But there are the fences, and that you can rely on them.  So that was the one aid which confirmed where you were.  Otherwise, it was bearing and paces.  And as we'd just been doing that for three months in the jungle, that wasn't a problem.  um that first day was a real eye-opener.  we kept going through until last light.  we stopped for a scram.  i remember us all leaning against the fence and the fence went twang and we all fell over backwards.  we were like dead ants.  we couldn't get up.  it's the only time i've actually seen people having to lift each other up.  you know you couldn't put this bergen on and get up and you certainly couldn't stand up and put it on.  you had to lie on your back roll over and somebody had to help you up.  and the other taboo which we broke was never never lean on your weapon.  well it was impossible not to do that you know and guys were using these as a kind of crutch really.  Um, we stopped for Scran and then the order came carry on.  And so we did, and we found this, we never actually saw the building.  I stopped at three o'clock in the morning where I thought we were supposed to be.  It was a huge swag.  It wasn't, I mean, I was navigating obviously, but, um, there was no way of confirming it.  And it wasn't until the following few hours later when light came up that I saw the building.  I thought, oh, pretty good, sure, not bad.  But that first night we were drained, utterly, totally drained.  So much so that we just went into a huge circle.  So you have 650 blokes in a massive circle.  How accurate?  I have no idea because it was dark.  And didn't even bother putting a bivvy up.  Of course, bivvies need trees.  That was one thing we'd overlooked.  So the bivvies are pretty amateurish.  but didn't even bother with that.  And of course, predictably, it rained.  And so the sleeping bags got soaking wet, which meant they now weighed three times what they weighed before.  It was an admin disaster.  And at a stand-to the following morning, there was that sort of bleary-eyed reality, you know, oh my giddy aunt, where's the Chinooks?  There aren't any Chinooks, carry on.  That's how it began.  On the second night, as we were approaching a place called Douglas, recce troop, who were well ahead of us, obviously, doing their job, had pinged an enemy position on a hill on the far side of the river and suddenly we went into an assault.  so we weren't carrying the bergens for that kit was ditched at the previous place.  we went straight in.  so we did a river crossing which was about.
