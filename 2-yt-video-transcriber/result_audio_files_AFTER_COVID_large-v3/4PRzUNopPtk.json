You know, coming out of 2008, what happened was Wall Street took an enormous amount of risk and they left retail as the bag holder.  And a lot of these kids were in grade school and high school when that happened.  They lost their homes.  Their parents lost their jobs.  And they've always wondered, like, why did those folks get bailed out for taking enormous amounts of risks and nobody helped and showed up to help my family?  Instead of having idea dinners or, you know, quiet, whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons, these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum.  And I'm not saying all of it is perfect by any means, but I think it takes an enormous amount of faith in the system to be that transparent to talk about things and then for each individual to make their own mind up and to do things.  it's better than a bank investing your assets for our profits in the safety and security of the stock market.

This, of course, is leaving many people just absolutely dumbfounded, being like, wait, the damage is done here, and all you're going to do is scrutinize them?  Reminding you again what we've been saying on this independent media broadcast for 15 years.  Don't expect government to help you.  Welcome back, beautiful and amazing human beings.  This is Rokodowski of WeAreChange.org.  A lot of upside-down reality absurdity in this world happening right now as NBC News is now recommending four masks.  There's also new concerns about the Chinese government stealing your DNA.  So, of course, we're going to talk about that plus a lot more as well as Black Lives Matter just being nominated.  I'm not joking.  This is not satire.  This is not the onion or the Babylon Bee.  Black Lives Matter was just nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.  So yeah yeah there's a lot of a manipulation of our reality happening right now but of course predominantly we're going to be focusing on the larger stonks issue unfolding right now where of course this Twitter user puts it very correctly.  a bunch of Reddit users woke up this morning and decided to make their own stimulus check.  decided to play the stock market.  they played their ... game and essentially outsmarted them at it and at ... the same time made a little bit of money which of course ... sent everyone in an uproar rigging the game against them to ... make sure the billionaires gets to keep some of their ... money so they could afford their third or fourth yacht ... some individuals like Bill Gross have decided to ... describe what's happening right now as a populist ... political uprising and with the way that the establishment ...
