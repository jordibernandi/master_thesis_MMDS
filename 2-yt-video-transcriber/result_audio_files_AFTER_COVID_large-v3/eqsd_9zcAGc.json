            "text": "I'm mixing in these jumping shoes.  Let me tell you, I've never owned a pair of Jordans, but I got the coolest shoes in town.  These are jumping shoes.  I love these shoes because I have foot, ankle, and knee problems.  Regular running, it really hurts.  Even a little bit of brisk walking hurts.  And over the past couple months, I've gained a little bit of weight, but because I've been driving across country, but I wish I ordered these before I started my drive, because I could just throw these in the car, and I could just jump at the rest stops and get some exercise in, get that heart rate up.  And these jumping shoes, they help you, they, you know, replace jumping rope, jump on a trampoline, like jumping jacks.  And also when you're running or walking or dancing, like, you know, Zumba, it gives you support where you're not coming down on your joints.  I found out that no matter what type of shoes I buy, like my preferred gym shoe is Asics, but no matter what shoe I get, just with each impact with each steps everything hurts.  so shout out to my instagram friend miss chanel one year till 50 who first had these i saw and i was just intrigued at the energy she had.  she was having so much fun with her jumping shoes.  so i'm like i just have to have some.  so how do you put these on?  uh jumping shoes.  they will come in a box and at first glance it will look like a pair of rollerblades.  Uh, assembly is super easy.  It comes with an Allen wrench and two screws.  And all you would do is take this bottom part and attach it in the grooves right here.  You kind of bend it a little bit, get in the grooves.  And then you will use the Allen wrench that comes with it and just secure these screws.  And then I put them on as I put on a pair of rollerblades.  You put your foot in, snap them closed.  Boom.  That's it.  And you are ready to jump.  So thank you so much for watching.  I hope you order your pair of jumping shoes.  Link will be in the description.  And tag me when you get up on Instagram, okay?  And I'll see you on the next video. ",
