            "text": "The WNBA is back in the news, and like always, it's not for their basketball skill.  Andre Godalla, small forward for the Heat, was watching a WNBA game the other night.  He decided to tweet out some support.  He tweeted, is nice, you know, just showing some support.  After the game, this number 23, Ariel Powers, tweets back at him and says, put some respect on my name or keep this tweet to yourself.  Kind of an odd way to tweet at somebody who was showing you some respect.  I mean, maybe it is more common to use the name of a player, but I see it all the time where players refer to another player by their number.  This is not the first time that this has happened.  She then sends another tweet saying, Andre's tweet was disrespectful because he could have looked up her name and the commentator said it and he could have easily addressed her by name in the tweet.  Well, here's the thing.  When you're on the court, you're identified by two things.  Your name and your number.  And he identified her by her number.  Happens all the time.  Should be a normal thing.  And she knows how wrong she was in all this because she had to deflect the entire situation by calling out Andre Godala.  For something that he said long ago.  And that had nothing to do with the current situation.  And of course Andre just tweets no manners.  He just has no response for these WNBA females.  Why do they find disrespect in every little thing possible?  I mean I can't believe that this was taken as disrespect.  And she even followed it up by retweeting another tweet.  Just acknowledge and accept when you're wrong.  Then everyone can move on.  And she responds, simple.  Oh my goodness.  The joke is on her.  It is official.  Of course, the first response is, okay, number 23.  I mean, not many people are falling for this crap.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.  The WNBA gets so much support from the NBA, both financially and just publicly speaking.  With players speaking out, you know, in support of their league.  And they do nothing but disrespect them back.  You have stuff like this.  You have players saying that they can beat current NBA players.  And you have others that call out contracts of NBA players that are pretty rightfully owned.  for the most part, compared to their contracts.  I don't understand it.  I don't get it at all.  The NBA does nothing but support these women, but nothing is enough for them.  Apparently, they don't know who to blame anymore.  They're not going to blame themselves for their low ratings, so they're going to blame Andre Iguodala for why nobody actually cares about their league.  Their talent is not good.  It just doesn't make any sense.  I just don't know why they wouldn't have more respect for the NBA players showing support like that.  And then, of course, one night later, KD is tweeting, number 14 is a different breed.  Once again, referring to a WNBA player showing support and throwing shade at Aerial Powers at the same time.  Well, Aerial Powers, congratulations.  People have now heard of you.  They know who you are.  I can't guarantee that they like you, but that's kind of on you. ",
