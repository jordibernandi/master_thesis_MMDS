Foreign Office suspected that Maxwell was a secret agent of a foreign government, possibly a double or triple agent, and a thoroughly bad character, almost certainly financed by Russia.  Maxwell had known links to the British Secret Intelligence Service, the Soviet KGB, and to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.  Six serving former heads of Israeli intelligence services attended Maxwell's funeral in Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir eulogized him and stated he has done more for Israel than can today be told.  Okay?  So this guy was a triple agent working with the British intelligence agency MI6, the KGB.  And Mossad.  He also owned the Mirror, and he owned Macmillan Presses.  He eventually had to sell a whole bunch of his stuff, because it turns out that he built $400 million out of his employees' pension fund. ",

News is a flirty business and it seems like current epidemic of sexual harassment allegations may be criminalizing courtship and conflating it with predation.  Hmm.  Sexual harassment allegations should require, one, made in a timely fashion, like you know, within five years.  Two, some contemporaneous corroboration, like witnesses.  Settlements in multi-millions might slight chance exist.  Some victims are motivated by more than justice.  I've known Roger Ailes for 40 years.  He's about as flirty as a grizzly in The Revenant.

Oh, look, he went back to the well again, claiming another time that sexual harassment suits can only be, should only be able to be filed within five years.  Um, Why are so many who profess to be outraged and repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by Donald Trump unmoved by similar allegations versus Bill Clinton?  So he spends years talking about how maybe people shouldn't call other people perverts and molesters.  And then once he has no more room to back up, he goes, oh, why are you talking about him being a molester?  What about that guy being a molester?  It really seems like Geraldo wants you to look at every other sexual predator and sexual molester other than himself.  Uh, look, he, he went in all of them.  It doesn't matter.  Al Franken, um, Charlie Rose, uh, the head of Pixar, literally every last person in a position of power, who's a man who's been accused of sexual harassment.
