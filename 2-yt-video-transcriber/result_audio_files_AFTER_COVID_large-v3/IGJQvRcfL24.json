            "text": "What's up guys?  I wanted to make a quick video.  I know I've been posting a lot recently but I wanted to show off my sneaker collection.  It's not much but I know we got some sneaker head fans out there and my collection is like, it's really important to me that I keep it clean and organized and like minimal.  but crispy, you know what I mean?  I'm OCD, I don't let there be one speck of dirt on my sneakers and I make sure that they're showcased nicely.  Anyway, I wanted to make a video real quick because I got a message from a kid saying that they started smoking weed because of my videos and that's not a joke.  I have never once smoked weed.  I've never been high.  And that's not a lie.  That's a God's swear to God.  Okay, right hand to God, left hand to God, fucking two hands to God, hand holding a cigarette to God.  That's the truth.  And I've never met anybody who long term um, had a, that where weed was a longterm positive force, positive thing in their life.  Okay.  And that's dead.  This is a deadly serious topic, by the way, everybody I've talked to everybody, everybody I've interacted with who is, uh, into weed at all has, um, it eventually morphed Into a source of stress.  A thing that makes you mentally unbalanced.  A thing that gets out of control.  And I just... Someone posted a picture of the coronavirus shirt with a holding a joint.  And I don't look down on anyone for smoking weed.  But... It's... In my opinion, it's a bad idea.  Long term, it's a bad idea.  I don't think it goes anywhere good, man.  Like... The thing that people keep saying is that weed helps me get a grip.  Weed helps me feel whatever.  It does something positive short term.  Yeah, well, if we're being totally honest here, eating McDonald's makes me feel like I have a grip.  Eating French fries makes me feel good.  Okay.  Whacking off the porn makes me feel amazing.  All right.  So if you believe that, if you believe that that's in my longterm mental health, uh, benefits checklist, then keep smoking weed, man.  Puff, puff it, puff up, dude, puff it up.  Um, and the other thing people point to, people point to like, um, rich people, uh, and Joe Rogan as having, um, Joe Rogan's got a handle on it, right?  Joe Rogan smokes weed.  He's got it together.  He's got it together enough to do a podcast.  That's a lot of work.  Joe Rogan's all put together.  Joe Rogan has fucking $100 million, okay?  Joe Rogan in his off time, he's not busting ass.  He's not scrambling to make money.  He's in his backyard shooting a bow and arrow.  That's how he spends his time.  Sure, if you have enough money to go to Germany to get your blood swapped out, to get your blood purified at some experimental clinic and do a salt bath, fucking crystalline salt, and fucking be in a sauna all day, then yeah, you probably won't notice the detrimental effects of weed that much.  But if you're not in that economic bracket, it's probably bad.  It's probably a bad idea.  It's not going to help you make money.  God.  Yeah, it's no good.  And it's expensive.  What the fuck are you doing?  Even I don't burn through money that recklessly. ",
