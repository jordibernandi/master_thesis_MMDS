So that's out there for everyone to see.  And when Trump got a question about his administration's handling of the virus, he went straight from that playbook.  He said, talk to China, blame China.  The fact that it was a Chinese American reporter just serves to further the distraction.  What we have to do is keep attention focused on what Americans care about, which is our health, our communities, our economic recovery, and not let Trump distract us all from the real issues. ",

Now, as you say, the playbook has been written, and that's what the president is following in trying to make this as much as possible, you know, something that they did rather than the failures of his administration, the missing month of February where he was hanging out with Diamond and Silk and talking about miracles happening and this disappearing by April.

There are very few narratives that he can present that don't call attention to the fact that his administration has mishandled this pandemic in unprecedented ways, unthinkable ways, and we're all paying the price.  But one of the few ways that he can frame it is saying that this is China's fault, this is a foreign effort, and it's us against them.  Instead of saying, well, we're dealing with this pandemic that experts have warned about for years, And we've dropped the ball.  He can't win saying that we've dropped the ball.  We're seeing Great Depression era levels of unemployment, 30 million plus jobs lost.  That is not a winning case for an incumbent.  And he knows it.  So this is one of the few things he can draw on that might distract enough voters to give him a path to victory.  I don't think it's going to work.

When in fact, it's very interesting when you see that mentality play out because you heard him last week Suggesting that, you know, more testing means his numbers go up, meaning, you know, the numbers of people who are actually infected goes up.  And that reflects poorly, he believes, on his administration, on the United States.  It's such an odd way of looking at.  at this.

So presenting it as the zero-sum game, to me, it is something that they've written out as one of their few recourses in this situation.
