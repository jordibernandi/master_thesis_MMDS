I want to firstly talk about one reason why people did not like President Trump running for office and when he was in office.  They would say that because he wasn't a prior politician, he did not have experience in DC, he was not fit for the position.  So when you would hear a celebrity or someone on the news saying, oh he's just not fit for the position, it's just assumed it's because he doesn't have experience in DC.  He never lived and worked in DC and he does not know what it is like to wake up there every single day.  What is it like?  What is it like to live and work in DC as a politician?  In order to understand what was expected of President Trump and how he should have behaved, Let's take a look at the Senate Democrats.  They have a better hold on the DC life.  We are going to go behind the scenes, firsthand, and learn from them what it's like. ",

Only in the movie, they used Republicans as the housemates.  But CNN confirms that it is in fact a Democrat-led house and it's real.  We previously had thought that congressmen had a little innocent gay fun every once in a while.  But new sources are confirming, however, that what looked like a trap house actually was a literal one.  A former member of the Department of Homeland Security whistle-blew on part of their operations.  He said that DEA agent Joseph Rosati, in conjunction with Alan Borshak and the current mayor of  D.C.,  Mayor Bowser, conspired on the murder of the DNC employee, Seth Rich. ",

Alan Borshak supplied the firearms.  Joseph Rosati supplied the MS-13 gang members.  They compromised Greg Utz from the Baltimore County Police.  They needed money for their dirty things and they didn't want to have to ask Congress for the money.  Doing that would expose the operation, require them to disclose a paper trail, and get the potential rejection because of the illegality of it.  Although much of these operations are hidden from public view, one easy way that we can see how they are all connected is through the sources they are being funded from.  George Soros being one example.  They all take money from him.  which means they are all influenced to push his desired agenda.  now where do all of the funds from their illegal operations reside?  where do they collect it all?  let's hear from sergeant robert horton from the united states army and special operations on what they are doing with all of these funds from their largest drug and money laundering system that they have created.
