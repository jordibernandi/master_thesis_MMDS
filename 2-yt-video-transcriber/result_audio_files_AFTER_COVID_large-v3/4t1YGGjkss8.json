            "text": "Hey, yo, what it do, my Melanated Ones?  Y'all know who it is, drop down.  Hey, check it out, family.  Don't go around quote me on this because I'm not 110% sure, but I've been getting a lot of, I mean, information and people have been sending me a lot of information.  And at the end of the day, if you go do your Googles, first thing pop up, they say, man, Grandmaster J been booked by the feds.  I mean, he been, the feds took him, man, according to multiple sources, because if you do your Googles, that's what it's going to say, according to multiple sources.  Grandmaster J was taken in by the feds today.  Talking about he was allegedly pulling a gun at a federal agent.  I mean, in Louisville.  I mean, I heard nothing about that.  I'm pretty sure y'all knew nothing about that.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know how true it is.  That's why I don't want y'all going around.  Don't quote me on this one.  But go do your Googles first.  I mean, go do your Googles.  Because if you do your Googles, man, Google going to tell you the same thing I just said.  Now, how true is that?  Don't nobody know.  I mean, at the end of the day, I tell you, like I tell everybody that was sending me that information, man, I don't know.  Only thing we can do is wait and see.  If there's no major news, I mean, outlet break it.  I mean, we got to wait on here and wait and see if you're going to hear facts over feelings or morning mental or midday moves or something.  At the end of the day, that's all we can do.  But what I did want to do, man, while I was out here ripping and running, that's why I wasn't going to make this video long.  I did want to let y'all know, y'all might want to go do your Googles, man.  Go do your research.  I don't know how true this is, but it is.  The word is being put out there, and I've been hearing it on more than one level.  I mean, and I only wish the best for this brother, man.  But you know the topic and the climate we live in right now and the topics of what he touch on.  Them topics he touching on ain't pushed out here these days, man.  That's something that they don't want to talk about.  So you know they would rather hush you up than really promote what some people really need to hear.  So at the end of the day, you know he was heavily targeted.  Because I'm saying if this happened then, why wait until now to come scooping?  I mean, why wait until now?  Y'all don't have to build no case if he pointed it at an agent.  And this is what I'm reading.  That's something y'all could have got rid of.  that situation right then.  But then y'all want to wait months later and then come scooping more.  I mean, at the end of the day, who knows?  I don't know.  But like always, man, drop here to give y'all.  The best information I can.  And I'm only giving it to y'all how I received it.  Because, I mean, at the end of the day, I was doing my little ripping and running when I was getting these emails and all that.  And it was not making sense.  But when it started coming in so heavily, I said, wait a minute, man.  Let me sit down and do my Googles.  And then when I sat down and Googled this shit, guess what came back?  That's what I'm telling y'all.  I mean, it's not like I'm pushing this agenda that he got locked up because I don't know.  I really didn't want to put that picture up with him looking like he was locked up because Photoshop these days is a... Y'all know.  If y'all be on this internet enough to know, man, y'all know, man, you could pretty much turn anybody into anything on the internet.  So was it an official picture of him being booked and processed?  I have no idea.  Do it look like a picture of you being booked and processed?  Hell yeah, it do.  I've been booked and processed, but that's neither here nor there.  But at the end of the day, family, the only thing we can do is stay positive about this situation.  I mean, you know at the end of the day, he knew it, we knew it.  I mean, when people like him and your time come where they will silence you, I mean, they will try to find a way to silence you one way or another.  They're going to take you off these streets or they're going to put you in the dirt.  But when you got a valuable message that need to get out, man, they don't want that.  They don't want it to get out.  They've been kept hitting for over a thousand damn years.  Why would they want it to leak out now?  So they know his voice was powerful.  That man was making a change.  So you know he was targeted.  I mean, we all knew that.  We just didn't know how long it was going to take before they start reacting.  And as you see, it didn't take them long.  It didn't take them long.  And like I'm saying, family, I'm not saying this shit is true.  I hope it's not true.  I just want y'all to do what God gave y'all.  Man, he gave you a brain to go.  do your own research.  Don't take my word on it.  What y'all do, y'all go do y'all own little research and come back and be like, well, drop, I feel the same way.  Or drop, nah, you bugging.  You believe in what the internet saying.  I mean, and it's only Google.  That's what people do.  People, if you want to know what's going on, you Google it.  And when I Google it, that's what came back.  And if you do your voice Google, the little chick will read it out to you.  She'll read it out to you.  Y'all been doing Googles long enough.  Y'all know how that shit work.  She will sit and tell y'all the same thing.  I just said and said.  Yo, he was picked up by the FBI.  But like I said, I don't know.  I don't know how true this is.  I would rather have that man explain the situation.  You want to know why?  Because at the end of the day, he's going through the situation.  I just wanted to keep y'all on heads up.  Just so y'all won't be thanking people not dropping these videos, man.  If he's not giving it to us for us to drop, we can't produce them for you.  You understand what I'm saying?  And I hope the best for this dude, man.  Outside of the fact, man, he out here doing something positive for black people, man.  I don't want to see no black man in jail.  You understand what I'm saying?  I don't care if he wasn't doing anything positive for the black people.  But as long as he wasn't doing nothing negative, man, I don't want to see him in jail.  So, I mean, I'm praying for the brother, man.  And at the end of the day, I'm like, man, I hope we run across more than mental effects over failures.  Man, I ain't even got to be the one to give it to you.  But at the end of the day, if y'all run across and y'all be like, yo, Jay got a Spotify or he done did some shit over here and y'all don't know nothing about it, let me know.  I mean, keep me informed.  Y'all know how I feel, man.  I'm pushing anything when it's come to uplifting us.  As long as it's uplifting us, I'm pushing it and I'm promoting it.  I mean, that's why it's a sad day out here, man, when you take this dude off the street, if that's the case.  You understand what I'm saying?  And I feel like this is the climate we in right now.  Who says all this information is true?  Because we living in a wicked climate right now.  I mean, racism is at an all-time high.  I mean, so who knows, man?  Man, who knows?  I just know we living in a dangerous time, family.  So don't take none of this shit lightly.  I mean, I want the man to be up early in the morning doing the morning mental drinking water.  I mean, like everybody else do.  I mean, that's why I push this dude so heavy, man.  Because like I've always said from day one, you ain't got to agree with everything Grandmaster J stands for.  I don't.  I'm a human.  But do I understand where he coming from and what the outlook?  I see his vision.  I mean, I'm just sad.  most of y'all don't.  But I see that man's vision.  Do his vision be big?  Sometimes, yeah.  But who don't have big dreams, man?  It's sad that y'all mind is so small.  Y'all just can't think outside that little bubble you live in.  But at the end of the day, I see this dude's vision.  Do I think his vision is big?  Hell yeah, you got a big vision.  But damn it, man, if you don't have a big vision, you ain't got nothing.  If you can't get to the big vision, at least get to something that's more than where we at right now.  And that's what y'all fail to realize.  I mean, I'm not even going to hold y'all.  Because I'm sitting here sounding crazy, sucking on candy, sounding all ridiculous on this camera.  But at the end of the day, man, I did want to deliver this message.  Like always, man, go do y'all Googles.  Just don't listen to drop.  Don't listen to nobody just on YouTube.  Just cause man, go do your own research.  But from what I'm saying, it just don't look good, man.  And once I find out more, you know, I'm going to give y'all more.  I mean, you just got to give it time to settle.  And lo and behold, I hope by the time I upload this, he drop a video and it make all his videos a lot.  I hope everything I'm saying is just a bunch of bullshit right now.  I mean, To me, I'm just thinking, and to otherwise post it, we got to go on what we know, family.  And this is what we know.  But I got things to do, man.  Like I said, I weren't going to hold y'all.  I just wanted to drop y'all this video off, man.  So if y'all found out something, let me know.  Let me know.  I'll let y'all know.  Just like I let y'all know, man, y'all find something, I'll let me know.  Just drop y'all.  I love y'all.  I'm out. ",
