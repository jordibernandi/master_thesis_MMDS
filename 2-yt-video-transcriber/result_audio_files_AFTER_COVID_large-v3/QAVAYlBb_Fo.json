            "text": "Hey Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  A couple of weeks ago when I reviewed Wishmaster 2, Evil Never Dies, some people took issue with the tone of my review.  They didn't want me to descend into the same kind of B-movie bashing that passes for criticism here on YouTube.  They thought I was taking potshots at an easy target, and I certainly don't want to do that, and I can see that criticism being valid.  I do want to stress, though, I loved these movies the first time I saw them.  Not in any sort of ironic way, but genuinely, on their own terms, I thought they did what they were trying to do.  I remember thinking Wishmaster 2 was the best of the series.  I was genuinely looking forward to watching it.  Turns out, it did suck pretty bad.  So you can imagine my trepidation with Wishmaster 3.  I have no such positive memories of Wishmaster 3 beyond the gates of hell.  I was kind of dreading having to waste an hour and a half of my precious time watching a movie I would probably hate.  And indeed I did not like it.  Wishmaster 3 is so lazy that I don't think it even makes sense to try and make fun of it, because ultimately, the joke is on me.  I'm the one who watched this movie twice now.  They tricked me into thinking it would be a real movie because it's the sequel to a largely unrelated movie.  that was pretty good.  And I don't want to just be negative here.  I think there are interesting things to talk about with Wishmaster 3.  But one thing that I definitely have to complain about is the movie's woeful Devoff deficiency.  I get why Andrew Devoff didn't want to be in this movie.  He thought it lacked an appropriate budget to do the kind of effects that this kind of fantasy story demands.  And he was very much right about that.  He had written his own spec script for Wishmaster 3 about the Wishmaster being on a submarine and just... Think about the world we could live in, where we got that.  How?  How does the djinn end up on a submarine?  I would donate every penny I own to GoFundMe to produce this film.  Devoff, get at me.  But we don't get the submarine movie, and what's worse, we don't get another scene devouring from Andrew Devoff.  Instead, we get this wet noodle.  Behold, the true face of fear, the thing which gazes back from the abyss, evil itself made manifest.  Make your wish.  Make your wish!  Look, no offense to Jason Connery... No.  No, this nothing of a performance?  This tepid fart?  This is Sean Connery's son?  Does charisma skip a generation?  Or is he normally a good actor, but he just didn't give a shit in this movie?  Because I probably wouldn't either.  I don't blame him for that.  Wishmaster 3 Beyond the Gates of Hell is also titled incorrectly.  At no point do we see, let alone go beyond, the gates of hell in this movie.  A more accurate title.  A title that would have gotten a little more heat.  would be Wishmaster 3, Wishmaster Goes to College, borrowing from the highly successful Ghoulies series of feature films.  That's what this one's about, this time Wishmaster's on a college campus.  And you hear that, and you think, well, that makes sense.  In today's economy, you gotta diversify your skill set.  Granting wishes is all well and good as a hobby, but the average person no longer imagines things getting better, and thus, have no ideas for wishes.  You'd think that Jin would be learning plumbing or small appliance repair or something like that, but no, he just becomes a professor.  New protagonist Diana has a dream about a time when her parents died in a car crash because she was distracting them or something.  The surprisingly decent looking car crash tricks you into thinking that this movie has a budget.  Her dad pulls her out of the burning car, goes back to save her mom, but gets blowed up.  Diana, wracked with guilt, considers killing herself.  But then her boyfriend, who looks like if Elon Musk and Matthew Broderick got into the teleporter from the fly, comes out to find her.  He tells her that she has to go to therapy and she says no.  And it's, he's just so bad at acting.  The dream, I take it.  The dream.  I'm worried about you.  Join the club.  Maybe it's time to see somebody.  Diana is a TA for their, uh, for a professor of... ancient studies.  In most scenes, he's talking about the Iliad, so you'd think he's a classics professor or something, but he also knows a lot about gin, so you think, okay, he's a folklore professor.  But in this scene, he's managing a campus... museum full of artifacts from Iran, like, for example, an Egyptian sarcophagus.  Diana is waiting around for the prof to show up and decides to go through a mysterious package delivered to him and fiddle with the stuff inside.  She finds this puzzle box, you know, like how the djinn in these movies comes from a puzzle box?  Like that's... like how he does that and that's not a separate series of movies?  Anyway, the puzzle box has the Eye of God on it, not the traditional Eye of Providence, but just an eye.  And it's not Ohura Mazda's eye, but the Abrahamic God.  So she pokes that with a mechanical pencil, and then there's a gem inside.  You know what that means.  It's gin time, baby.  Then Professor Barash finally shows up, and he tries to pressure Diana into going on a date with him in a very creepy way.  The editing in this scene, though, and in the scene before with her boyfriend, seems to imply that we should be sympathetic to Professor Barash.  Her boyfriend, Greg, the same name as the boyfriend from Part 2, good stuff, really well thought out, pesters her and they frame her constantly with distance between them, or with her literally facing away from him, making a different facial expression than he is.  There's clearly conflict in their relationship.  Diana's major character arc is her learning to let down her walls and let people in.  So they show her being cold and indifferent towards Greg.  And Greg, for his part, is really needy.  Just blow him off.  It's my job.  I don't ask you to blow off things you love.  The only thing I love is you.  Do you love me?  Actually, that's what I came to ask you.  I really need you to hear me right now.  I do hear you, Ty.  But I need you to hear me too.  You didn't answer my question.  He's always complaining, always demanding more and more emotional support.  So I thought the movie was saying that he was not a good boyfriend.  There's even a scene where I thought the movie was implying he was cheating on Diana.  You know, now you should be careful.  Hey, speak of the devil.  We were just talking about you.  Robbie!  You're Robbie!  Then comes the Professor.  When he hits on Diana, he opens with a genuine expression of admiration.  The professor knows she's brilliant and seems to genuinely respect her for it.  Greg possessively resents the time Diana spends with the professor and by extension her choice of career out of insecurity.  The professor, for his part, seems to be interested in Diana in part, at least, because she's supposedly a brilliant academic.  He asks her to go to dinner to learn more about her, rather than making any sort of overt sexual advance.  He's also very shy and stammering over his words, not the behavior that reads on film, like a boss using his power over an employee coercively.  When she says no, he looks genuinely wounded, and they play sad music.  In any case, I don't think my boyfriend would understand.  Now look, in real life, I would never ever sympathize with this character in this situation.  What he is doing is unethical, potentially even predatory.  I didn't sympathize him within the movie either, but to me, it really seemed like the movie was attempting to paint him as the romantic lead.  Like, doesn't it seem like the arc of the movie would be that Diana has to learn to let go of Greg, who's trying to hold back her growth in her chosen field and be with someone who appreciates her best qualities.  But then Diana leaves and in comes the crappy new Jyn.  Much beefier than the old Jyn.  We're gonna call him Beefeater Jyn.  Beefeater Jyn demands that Barash make a wish.  But Barash knows about Jyns, which makes him the smartest person in the franchise so far.  Another point the movie seems to be making in his favor.  Content warning for sexual assault coming up.  The djinn then reveals that Barash sexually assaulted one of his students, and threatens to reveal him unless he makes a wish.  And for a moment it seems like there's more to the story, because Barash says, no that's not what happened, and the djinn says, who are they going to believe?  Which, fuck man, to say that any accusation of sexual misconduct will immediately ruin someone's career even if they're innocent because everyone will believe it unconditionally is so wildly out of sync with reality.  That's a fucked up and irresponsible thing to say in your movie, Wishmaster 3.  Especially since, when he does make a wish, he makes a horny wish.  Turns out, he was a horny creep the whole time.  He wishes that the two most beautiful women in the world would show up and be really into him.  Clever stuff, Barash.  Good luck.  twisting his words on that one, Wishmaster.  How you gonna make that one kill him?  I'd like to see you try.  So then, so get this, this is brilliant.  This is what, this is how the Wishmaster turns that around on him, is what happens is, the two ladies show up, and they take their shirts off, and then they claw him a bit, and he dies.  Anyway, Jyn takes Barash's face and now he's the horny professor.  Diana knows all about it because she's got the Jyn and Lady connection.  that happens in all these movies, you get it.  She tries to tell her awful boyfriend and her awful friends and I just want to highlight how awful one of her friends is.  His name is Billy and he's literally introduced in the movie slapping Diana and her best friend on the butt and saying, hey bimbos.  Hey bimbos.  Diana comes to her friends with this crazy story about a murderous demon giving her visions.  And her boyfriend is like, yo, I'm really worried about her mental health.  Can you guys please stay with me?  And Billy's girlfriend, Katie, is like, yeah, of course.  That's the normal thing that a friend would do.  And then Billy's like, nah, fuck that.  I'm gonna go do something else.  So you think he's a villain, right?  You think this guy is gonna get a real good death from that old wishmaster?  that really shows what a piece of shit he is, right?  Stay tuned.  The djinn is looking to find Diana.  He goes to the college's records room, and the lady who keeps the records is like, oh, hey, creepy prof who fucks his coeds, you want the file on one of your coeds?  I'm not gonna give you the file on one of your coeds because you fuck your coeds, you creep.  And he's like, okay.  Why don't you make a wish?  And she's like, yeah, sure, I'll make a wish, whatever, that makes sense.  I wish all the records would go up in flames so I could go home.  And for a moment, I thought this was going to be a clever scene, because she's making a wish that would inconvenience the Wishmaster, right?  And, like, then he wouldn't be able to just immediately find Diana, because all the records are gone.  But instead, see, the way that this happens is the lady catches on fire and the records do not.  Wisho then leaves without looking over the records for some reason, even though they did not burn in the fire, clearly.  Blah blah blah, Wisho chases them around and spooks Greg.  Greg drags Diana to a church where Wisho is waiting.  Content warning for an extremely insensitive joke at the expense of people with eating disorders coming up.  He makes one of Diana's friends start vomiting uncontrollably because she's, in his words, anorexic.  Just fuck you, Wishmaster 3.  You couldn't even insult the right eating disorder, you fucking imbeciles.  So Diana wishes for her friend's pain to stop and Wisho just fucking kills her.  Fucking obviously.  You gotta think through your fucking wishes, Diana.  Don't worry, though.  She does what anyone would do if the Wishmaster was going around killing people with bad wishes.  She does the most straightforward and logical wish, something that will easily kill Wisho, something you've probably been screaming at someone to do at the Wishmaster for this whole time.  It's actually... I can't believe it took three movies to get to this.  But what she does is, obviously, she wishes for the spirit of Michael the Archangel to his sister, and so with the Djinn, how he grants that wish is he tries to give her Michael powers, but then Greg jumps in the way, and now Greg is Michael the Archangel, leader of the host of angels destined to defeat Satan's armies in the Book of Revelation.  In this movie, they interpret that to mean a guy with a squiggly sword that does pro-wrestling moves on the Djinn and gets his ass kicked.  Hey, remember earlier when I pointed out that the Eye of God was the Abrahamic God and not Ahura Mazda?  This movie makes it explicit that despite the presence of folklore monsters from another religion, who could only be defeated by the intervention of that religion's god in the previous movies, nah, Christianity is the one true faith.  All other gods are just djinn in disguise, tricking people.  The Greeks may have worshipped them as Zeus, Bacchus, Hera, Aphrodite, but they were djinn all the same.  So then the djinn starts killing Diana's friends and some of her enemies for some reason to lure her out.  There's a lot of running around to weird techno music that belongs in a porno.  There's one cool kill where the girl I thought was sleeping with.  Greg tries to seduce the Wishmaster, and he manipulates her into wishing that he would break her heart.  And then, not only does her heart start beating out of her chest, we also get a practical effects shot of the inside of her chest, and her heart fucking explodes.  That rules.  Credit where credit is due.  The djinn approaches Billy, the hey bimbos guy, that guy, remember him?  Hey bimbos.  He's like, yo, where's Diana?  And then Billy refuses to give her up.  Even when the djinn reveals himself and threatens to kill him, he doesn't give her up.  The djinn demands that he make a wish, and defiantly, Billy says, blow me.  So the djinn blows him backwards into a trophy mounted on the wall of a horned animal of some kind.  Billy, the guy who is introduced into the movie, groping his girlfriend and her best friend and calling them both bimbos... dies a hero.  Meanwhile, Diana tries to get Michael's sword, the thing that she needs to use to kill the Djinn.  But she's just not ready because of the script, and it burns her hand up.  Michael uses his magic healing powers to save her.  More running, more techno, the Djinn catches Katie.  She says, I wish I was anywhere else.  So what the Djinn does with that wish, you see, is he pushes her head into a cage full of mice, who eat her eyes and lips and then he moves her like a few feet like how she like like what she wished for.  Michael does not use his his healing powers for this one.  there's nothing he can do for reasons that are Not explained.  More running, more techno.  Diana flips her car and smooshes the gin a little bit.  She relives her childhood trauma, pulling the Archangel Michael out of the wreck, like she failed to do with her mother.  The gin reforms with a lot of squishing noises.  They run up a rooftop where Diana tries to jump off the roof again, this time wanting to heroically commit suicide rather than tragically commit suicide.  The djinn catches her.  Game over.  Time to make your third and final wish, Diana.  What else can you do if the djinn has got you?  Not make a wish?  So Diana, we've set up that you're a brilliant academic with a once-in-a-lifetime mind.  How are you going to outsmart the djinn like the previous protagonist did?  And she does this clever maneuver where she stabs him with a magic sword and kills him instantly.  Satisfying stuff.  Then the Archangel Michael returns Greg's body.  Diana, who just fell off a fucking building, goes back up the building to comfort him and says, I love you.  Finally her walls came down.  What a happy ending.  Yup, that's what concludes her story arc.  Not reliving her childhood trauma and this time facing the danger head on.  Not wanting to die and then finding a reason to live and being willing to throw that away just to save other people.  No.  No, it's nothing to do with her wants or desires or any kind of agency of her own.  It's saying I love you.  to her cloying, needy drip of a boyfriend.  Now look, the previous movies in this franchise weren't exactly woke.  The romantic lead of The First Wishmaster was a sex pest.  The second Wishmaster seems to imply that in order for women to be pure of heart, they have to dress conservatively.  But this one just, this one straight up fucking hates women.  And that's paired with like a lot more nudity.  And you know, I'm not a prude, but when your movie is about how women have to sacrifice their own wants and desires so that they can be more emotionally available to their boyfriends, it makes the nudity like less fun to watch.  I would love to tell you that this is a good-bad movie because it makes a lot of baffling choices that are pretty funny, but it's really mean-spirited and genuinely hateful, and also, like, just real boring.  Just so fucking boring.  At this point, I just wish I could be done with the franchise.  As you wish.  Oh, no, I've made three wishes.  The prophecy is fulfilled.  That reminds me, next time let's talk about Wishmaster 4, the prophecy fulfilled.  Fuck this movie, fuck everything.  I hope you liked my YouTube video about the movie Wishmaster 3, Beyond the Gates of Hell.  If you're now saying, hey, why did you have to make this political?  Thank you for watching.  You're probably not going to like this channel.  It's perhaps for the best that we part ways now. ",
