            "text": "Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well.  I'm sure that most of you probably have Twitter accounts.  Personally, I used to use my Twitter extremely often through 2016, 2018 or so maybe, but I rarely use it anymore because I just became far too disillusioned with scrolling through post after post after post of orange man bad, of drag queen story hours, of cringe virtue signaling, of anti-racist leftists acting far more racist than any of the other people they accuse of being racist, and of course, man-hating.  Not only of men in general, but very often straight white men.  There's a couple of different tweets and articles that I want to cover in this video, but one of the main tweets that inspired it is from a Total Sweetie, as she calls herself in her Twitter bio.  With a tweet that ended up garnering over 190,000 likes, the Total Sweetie wrote, hating men isn't a meme for me.  It's not an online persona.  It's a commitment.  It's a way of life.  Naturally, her tweet received a healthy amount of backlash, but some of the top comments actually did agree with her.  I hate men and I have a man.  Hating men is a lifestyle.  I literally hate having to interact with most men during my day.  Absolutely awful.  This tweet is but one among thousands that play into the same old tired yet fashionable trend of man-hating.  We want equality, the feminists say, even though they already have it.  And in the same breath, they go on to say that men are useless and inferior.  Of course, had a man with some kind of online following published such a tweet, instead saying that he hated women instead of men, Twitter would have banned his account within minutes.  At most, a few hours.  And then after that, you would have had a slew of mainstream media articles denouncing the man and using his tweet as some kind of evidence that yes, yes, in fact, misogyny, it's alive and well.  The double standard is both exhausting and infuriating, but it continues nevertheless on a daily basis.  Just in the past week or so, you had Jonah Hill come out and say that real change in Hollywood will happen when white men relinquish their power.  The 21 Jump Street star also does not feel that the change is happening fast enough.  And Jonah Hill has a solution to this problem.  Rid the industry of white men.  Real change, Hill told Adidas, is going to happen when everyone running the studios and running all these streaming companies are women.  and people who haven't had the voice that white men have gotten throughout that time.  Apparently, diversity is no longer progressive enough for Jonah Hill.  Not content with all of the diversity quotas that we have, he seems to want to take it to the next level, purging the entire industry of white men as if that's somehow gonna magically fix all of Hollywood's problems.  Because as everybody knows, if you're a woman, or if you're a person of a non-white ethnicity, then you're a saint.  You can do no wrong, and you're a shining beacon, a shining example for the entire rest of the world.  This week, you also had CNN rear its ugly head, lamenting the fact that the coronavirus task force is another example of the Trump administration's lack of diversity.  Who are these experts, CNN asks?  They're largely the same sorts of white men and a couple of women on the sidelines who've dominated the Trump administration from the very beginning.  In other words, if you happen to be a man and if, God forbid, you're also white, then your medical expertise just isn't welcome, according to CNN.  It really doesn't matter if you might possess the ability to create some kind of vaccine for the deadly virus currently spreading across the world.  Sorry, but you're just too male and you're just too white to be allowed to try and save lives.  Over the course of my time on YouTube, I've made a few videos here and there about man-hating and male-related struggles, and every now and again I get comments asking me why I care so much about this topic.  I certainly do care about the general state of men in our society, but I also have three brothers, a father, two nephews, and a husband.  Which means I'm likely going to either have a son or multiple sons in the future.  And this isn't the type of society that I want them or any of the other men that I care about to have to exist in.  A society where they're constantly degraded for being male or white by a corrupt media and a far-left activist mob who claim to be for love, unity, and equality.  when in reality they only care about personal gain.  Because that is what this is truly about.  Promote the fashionable and popular narratives and you just might be rewarded with mainstream acceptance, a nice job, a large social media following with users who all have pronouns in their bios, and maybe even you might get a flattering Wikipedia page.  Who cares if your promotion of such a narrative is further contributing to the deterioration of goodwill between men and women?  Who cares that there's more single women in the workforce than ever before?  That the fertility rate has collapsed?  That men are the new minority in college?  That men face more discrimination than women?  That men in the US, in their overall disillusionment, are 3.5 times more likely than women to commit suicide?  Because hey, at least you got 190,000 likes on your tweet.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next video. ",
