            "text": "The WNBA was able to complete their season and crown a champion all thanks to the NBA-funded bubble.  Some of the players were shocked when nobody realized that they crowned a champion, so they decided it was time to make some controversial statements, get themselves back in the news, and then maybe more people would watch their league.  But instead of using their go-to card and taking shots at NBA players, they decided to attack other women's sports.  WNBA superstar Sue Bird is now taking shots at women's soccer.  Sue Bird is upset that women's soccer tends to include a lot of cute little white girls and she's mad that the NBA doesn't have a lot of cute little white girls.  Sue Bird's partner is of course Megan Rapinoe but shockingly this video is not even about her.  It seems that her ability to blabber has passed over to Sue.  Sue Bird has recently turned 40 and just claimed another WNBA title.  Of course, her girlfriend was in the bubble with her from start to finish and was there to celebrate their championship win.  Both of them acknowledged that in one important area, public perception and support for their respective sport, they are deeply unequal partners.  This was a really hot topic inside the bubble.  Even though we're female athletes playing at a high level, our worlds, you know, the soccer world and the basketball world are just totally different.  Let's just understand that she just answered all of her future questions.  There are differences in these sports worlds.  So to compare the support they get is kind of foolish, but she's going to continue to do that.  And to be blunt, it's the demographic of who's playing.  Women's soccer players are generally cute little white girls, while WNBA players, we are all shapes and sizes.  A lot of black, gay, tall women.  There is maybe an intimidation factor, and people are quick to judge it and put it down.  Although there are probably some people out there that only watch women's soccer because of how the girls look, That is definitely not most of the fans.  If somebody's gonna watch women's soccer, it's because they like soccer.  If somebody's gonna watch women's basketball, I don't know what they're into.  But like you mentioned before, it's all about the sports worlds.  If somebody likes women's soccer, it's because they like soccer in general.  They like to watch soccer.  They like that sport.  If somebody likes basketball, they're going to watch the NBA.  And they can also watch the WNBA because they're a basketball fan.  The reason WNBA doesn't get support from basketball fans is because their product is not very good and people will just watch the NBA or college basketball.  Sue Bird continues to say there's a deep issue with the treatment of minorities in the United States, and she blames the poor support and media attention on this, basically stating that the women's team for soccer gets more attention because it's a bunch of cute white girls.  Sue Bird continues to ask, where's that same energy for the best women's basketball players on the planet?  Where's that energy for the women's sport that instead of scanning cute and white and straight, scan tall and black and queer?  Like I said already, there's a difference in the sports worlds.  Soccer fans are probably going to enjoy women's soccer more because it's kind of close to the men's game.  They're probably not as good, but the level of play... is similar in certain aspects.  for basketball it is completely different.  the NBA is so much better than the WNBA that it's not even close and it shows in the ratings.  a lot of people watch the NBA.  nobody watches the WNBA.  it's because the product they put out just not good.  basketball fans are not attracted to it.  regular people or just a sports fan in general who isn't specifically a basketball fan is not going to tune into the WNBA just because they're women people who don't watch sports are not going to watch the WNBA.  the only fan base that the WNBA has a shot at is NBA fans and they continue to alienate NBA fans every time they talk about the poor support they get from them when it's really just the product.  that's the issue.  okay yes maybe the US doesn't treat minorities well but that's not the fan base.  that's not the target audience.  their target audience is basketball fans people that watch NBA.  so for her to say that people that watch the NBA are racist and homophobic is a really big stretch.  Once again, the whole world is not gonna sit down and watch the WNBA just because you're women.  Only basketball fans are going to watch your sport.  And if you keep alienating them, they will never ever come through.  bird continues on and says you have to be true to who you are and be authentic and people are drawn especially in today's world when you're authentic.  i think people are drawn to that and right now we're a league that is being authentic to who we are and how's that working out for you?  if you guys are truly being authentic and making good statements then people will be drawn to you but yet nobody is drawn to you.  And look at the NBA.  Their ratings dropped tremendously after trying to be true to themselves and standing for something they believed in, and their ratings still went down.  Yeah, people like it when you try to be authentic.  They like it when you're real, but they don't appreciate it when you try to shove your opinion down their throat.  It's interesting how she says today's world and society basically sucks, and then continues to say that, oh, in today's world, you know, being real and authentic, that's what gets you things.  How is that working out for you?  did anything that they stand for actually help them get fans?  Does complaining to the media about how little coverage you get from the media help you get more coverage from the media?  Does complaining about an entire population that doesn't watch you help you get them to watch you?  Or maybe, just maybe, if you improved what was going on on the court and improved your game, more people will be drawn to it.  I hate to break it to you, but you're in the entertainment industry.  your job is to entertain and not with your mouth.  nobody wants to hear what you have to say.  you play a sport.  you played on a court.  people show up and watch you play that sport.  they don't want to hear you talk about anything.  so for WNBA players to continue to pull up and complain about fan bases not watching them instead of just improving their game themselves and making changes to it.  they sit around They hop on social media and they start sharing their opinion.  They beg for support from the NBA and when they get it from guys like Luka Doncic and Andre Godala, they get a bunch of backlash for it.  And when they realize bashing the NBA was doing nothing, they now flip it over to another women's sport.  Yeah, women's soccer is more successful than women's basketball.  Soccer is a worldwide sport.  So for starters, that's probably it.  But there's a lot of other factors to it.  The women's soccer game is behind the men's, but it's still solid.  It's fun to watch.  It's entertaining.  It's like women's tennis.  their game is not as good as the men's but they still put out a solid product.  they still play the game at a high level.  the WNBA just doesn't do that and these players just don't get it.  I wonder how many players are in the league right now and they see exactly what everyone is talking about But they just continue to let the speakers of the WNBA blab their mouth and complain about all this stuff.  that has nothing to do with why nobody watches them.  They think that just because they're women and just because they're minorities that people should pull up and support what they do.  Not everybody likes basketball.  Not everybody likes your type of entertainment.  They're not going to pull up for you.  And that's just how it is.  That's going to be it for this video.  Hope you guys enjoyed.
