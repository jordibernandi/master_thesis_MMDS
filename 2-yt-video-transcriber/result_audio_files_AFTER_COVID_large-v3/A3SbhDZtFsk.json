One of the things I've been learning is that if you look at their education system, they're very oriented towards technology.  Their STEM degrees, which is what, science, technology, engineering, and math, they're awarding $1.3 million every year, and we're at like $300,000.  They're very much saying if you want to go to college, you've got to learn something, a hard science. ",

And this is how the Communist Party legitimizes its role.  The people, including party people, worry about corruption.  They don't like it.  But as long as they're living better and everybody's living better, they give the party a lease on life, and they think the party has earned the right to continue to govern.  But now, with Xi, you have... clamping down maybe because they're afraid that the freedom has permitted people to go in directions that are not fully under party control and in their mind that's akin to chaos.  and if you have a country of a billion three hundred maybe four hundred million people To have things out of order is frightening, especially for those that remember the anarchical days of the Cultural Revolution, which was a nightmare for anybody who went through it.  You know, if you go to the best engineering programs in the  U.S.,  you have a disproportionate number of very bright Chinese.  And the shift I see coming over the next 10, 20 years is the Chinese now are establishing their own higher ed in technology and they are going to create absolutely world-class engineering programs and the number of patents I predict that are taken worldwide by China is going to increase in percent.  If we don't do better with educating people in engineering here and mathematics and hard science, it's a long-term problem for us.  There was a study some years ago by Morris Rossaby, I think it was at Columbia, talking about how China defeated its enemy at the time, the Mongols, through a trade war.  They have a millennia of history of dealing with these problems, and to the extent that they're able to use geopolitical means to influence trade, they will do it.  It's worked for them in the past and they will have confidence it will work in the future. ",
