I wanted to talk to you guys about something that has truly shocked me, I guess.  I've only watched this video once, so I wanted to watch it a second time with you guys and get a reaction from me and also get your guys' reaction.

There is no part of me that can see myself being this bold, being this disrespectful.  Now I know every black person in the audience is going to understand where I'm coming from with this.  But like, to me, I look at Gail and Gail is like my mom.  Okay.  And you would never, Ooh, don't you ever raise your hand to your mother like that.  Don't you ever raise your hand to your mother like that.  Every older black woman that I see, even if we're not related, there's familiarity there for me.  And I'm like, that's like my mom or my aunt or somebody older than me who I have respect for, right?  And there's just something really wild to me about feeling so comfortable doing that.  Here's the thing, I agree with her on a couple of things, right?  First and foremost, if I was traveling and I lost my phone, I would freak out.  You guys know I used to travel a lot for work.  I have been definitely in a similar position where something messes up with my phone and I freak out.  I understand that emotion of being alone in a city.  with yourself relying entirely on your phone and not really knowing how to emotionally handle it.  I have been there.  I empathize with that.  I also agree with her when she says that you're not defined by the one mistake you make.  Absolutely.  But what blows my mind, what literally blows my mind is how All of this happened, right?  All of this is true.  And it's like, she doesn't even want to sort of even try to put on a show to counteract that image, right?  And what's wild to me was this was the interview that she could have taken and she could have presented herself differently.  She could have been kinder, nicer, and less of the exact person we saw of her on camera.  And she might have, you know, gotten some sympathy from some people, probably misguided people, but she would have gotten some sympathy, right?  I understand and respect that there are some people who we have all these conversations about respectability politics, and I get it.  I'm not going to come here and act like respectability politics are not unhelpful in so many ways, but she could have tried.  She's going to try.  Like if I went, if I was going on trial for something, I would not show up to court like this.  Let's just get that straight.  I would not show up to court like this.  I wouldn't even show up to court showing this much shoulder.  You know, we can criticize all of the reasons why in society as holding those things up is unhealthy and wrong and patriarchal.  And I hear you on that.  I really, truly do.  But to me, there's a time and a place.  And this interview where you're trying to, encourage people to see you in a slightly different light, this interview that is giving you an opportunity to speak up for yourself, that's really not the time to wear a daddy hat and to be brazen.  Sometimes when I see people like this, it's like, we just live in totally different worlds and we just have, I hate to say it, totally different upbringings.  Personally, For me, what I'm stuck with is the fact that she cared so little about this, that this is how she decided to present herself. ",

            "text": "Now, I know that there are some people who watch my channel for some strange reason and they want to debate with me about stuff like racial profiling.  We're genuinely not gonna have that conversation.  I have been in stores and been followed through the store because the people who worked at the store assumed that I didn't have money to actually patronize the store.  I go to a grocery store pretty close to me, actually, and I remember walking down you know, one aisle, and then there would be an employee who just happened to go down that aisle.  Every aisle I went, he followed me the whole way up to the point where I got to the register, like I was gonna steal something from this grocery store, which is in my neighborhood that I patronize every other day.  Right?  It was insulting.  And this is just part of being black.  Being racially profiled, it's part of it.  And I don't think that you're some sort of victim or something for acknowledging that.  That's part of being black, is people are going to project really shitty racist stuff on you, right?  And she took that and then translated that into assaulting a child.  I know that there are some people who watch my channel who are 14.  I love you, baby.  But to me, you're a child.  You are a child.  And a 14 year old is a child.  And she, and she was like, I'm 22.  I'm 22.  Like her assaulting somebody who is, I'm not great at math, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, seven years, eight years.  eight years younger than you see a girl.  I'm an artist.  Like I'm not getting around, but like you assaulting somebody who's eight years younger than you is like, Like that's like, I'm sorry, you're much older than him.  You're much older than him.  You're almost 10 years older than him.  Why are you making it seem like, and this is what bothered me the most.  Why are you making it seem like you're just this delicate flower who, you know, does know, isn't capable of doing harm.  Something else I wanted to talk about was apparently Maya Ponseto is Puerto Rican.  I think that people need to understand that Anti-Blackness and racial profiling Black people does not only happen at a white person's behest.  A lot of times people of all races have internalized white supremacy, anti-blackness, et cetera, in a way where them profiling a black person, them expressing similar racist ideals towards a black person is just encouraged.  They're encouraged to do so so that they feel a closer proximity to whiteness.  And that's something that, I mean, a lot of cultures is very, very prevalent.  Anti-blackness is not something that is only practiced by white people.  I don't know what to say.  To me, there's something about our culture that got her here.  And that's something that I wanted to bring up.  There's something about the way that she... got here.  that like is really hard for me to process.  Cause I mean, listen, I'm, I'm 30.  Okay.  I'm 30.  And I just, I don't know.  I don't know me.  Like, is it the internet?  Is the internet making people just be like, Oh, whatever.  You know, I'm like, there's, it's like fashionable to be disrespectful.  Like, Oh fuck.  I mean, I understand.  Fuck authority.  I get all that, you know, totally there with you.  But like, There's just a general indecent treatment of other people that I have a really hard time wrapping my mind around.  Like I would never go out of my way to be mean to another person.  I would never go out of my way to ruin somebody's day and be unpleasant towards them.  And I have such a hard time understanding how she could do that and then walk away from it and then feel good about herself.  There's something inside me that really just genuinely struggles with that.  How could she do that and then feel like people are upset with her for no reason?  Yes, I agree with her that not everyone should be defined by the one mistake that they make.  I totally 100% agree.  But... There's not being defined by your mistake and then there's not owning up to your mistake and that process of you not owning up to your mistake, making the mistake even worse because it truly does.  I, again, fully identify with the emotion of being in a different city with a phone that you rely on and that phone disappearing or not working, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  I get that.  That's a real valid emotion that I have no problem saying.  is valid, right?  But you don't take your shit and then make somebody else's day terrible because of it.  You just don't.  You just don't.  You know, and that even goes to just how you treat staff.  Like you don't treat people like that.  And it makes me sad that our culture has shifted in a way where treating people like that is seen as like badass.  You know, it's like badass to like put your hand up in front of a news presenter and say, okay, Gail, stop.  As she's trying to help you, as she's giving you a platform for you to speak for yourself and defend yourself against all the people online.  Like, it blows my mind.  Anyway, on that note, I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.  If you made it through this entire video, please put this emoji in the comment box below.

I don't like to say that out loud, but we're talking one-on-one, so we can say that.  But if you put the emoji in the comment section, I'm not saying everybody else is inferior.  I'm just saying that you are better than them.  So do with that what you will.  Anyway, I'll talk to you guys next time.  Bye.  Thank you. ",
