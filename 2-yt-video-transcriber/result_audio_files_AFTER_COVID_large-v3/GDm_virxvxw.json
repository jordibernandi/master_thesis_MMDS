            "text": "What's up, y'all?  I just wanted to hop on here for a minute and just say something about how disappointed I am in Nancy Pelosi.  Yeah, just the level of disrespect that she showed by Ripping up the president's speech at the State of the Union like that is just, it's, I mean, it's nowhere near disrespectful enough, y'all.  You can spit in his face, punch him in the titty, do something.  This most disrespectful motherfucker on planet Earth.  This dude makes fun of disabled people and calls war heroes pussies to their face.  You can't just rip up some words that he definitely didn't write and probably can't read because they ain't written in Sharpie.  Like, you got... You bringing a ripped-up paper knife to a shit-on-the-Constitution gunfight dealing with it, this is not disrespectful enough, y'all.  I'm telling you, we gotta start disrespecting these people more.  All right?  It's time.  I'll kick this off.  If you're a man who still support Trump, then you're a tiny-dick fuckfeller who's afraid of things you don't understand,  i.e.,  most of this beautiful gay earth.  And if you're a woman who still supports Trump, then you're a fucking doormat.  A doormat.  You'd probably vote for a Camaro if a man told you to.  Fuck them.  Y'all... There is no amount of disrespect that we could ever show these people.  that would actually be commensurate with how much they're about to disrespect all of us and every American who came before us by acquitting this dude while simultaneously admitting that he is guilty.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Okay look, now to be serious for a minute, of course it hit for me when Pelosi ripped that up.  It was built to hit for me.  Now the first reason is because it shows that Democrats are finally moving past this whole play nice, reach across the aisle, bipartisanship bullshit.  That is about as effective at dealing with these assholes as a sandalwood candle is at dealing with the measles.  Which is to say, not at all.  It makes us all look stupid for thinking it might work and we're all gonna die if we don't stop.  So I'm glad to see that we're finally moving past that philosophy.  And the second reason it hits for me so much is because of how much it's pissed off shitty white people.  Oh my God.  Anybody that's been following me for a minute knows that anything that gets in this route up is just sweet ambrosia.  Just inject it into my veins.  Plug me in, hook me up, lead me, baby.  I love it.  I love it.  So yes, shout out to Nancy P for kicking off the disrespect train.  Hashtag fuck the bullshit 2020.  Let's go.  Love y'all.  Shit. ",
