            "text": "Hello there.  Italy is aiming its boot at Germany's Jaxi.  Firstly, as ever, please give my YouTube channel a boost by giving this video a big fat like.  And I'm always uploading new content so please do check my YouTube channel daily.  Now just a quick observation, I had a quick trawl through the press this morning and I couldn't find any of the normal April the 1st gotchas.  Nothing about spaghetti trees, baked bean mines, or Meghan Markle to stand against Donald Trump in the autumn presidential election.  You know the sort of thing.  So one assumes that events are a bit too serious at the moment for such frivolity.  And that's backed up by Google deciding not to release its hoax features today.  But according to reports, the Australians, bless them, did partake, a little, including a special new beer for our canine friends and a betting company offering to take odds on replays of old sports matches.  Anyway, Italy is so miffed at the EU that it has put out a four-page ad in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allemagne Zeitung asking for help with its dire plight while it seems giving the Netherlands a roasting, reports the Telegraph.  But further, Italy basically says the whole EU project could be over when it says in the ad, Today the EU does not have the means to respond to the crisis in a united front.  If it does not prove that it exists, it will cease to exist.  And this all revolves around the inability of the EU27 to cohesively deal with the current global health crisis.  This full-page ad was taken out by politicians of all colours from across Italy, and it asks the Germans to hark back to 1945 when they were bailed out by the rest of the world, and I'll add in, despite their misdemeanours.  But at the moment, there appears to be no appetite for issuing central euro bonds to raise the money for the embattled southern nations to help them deal with this crisis.  Because the likes of Germany and the Netherlands know it will be them that eventually picks up the tab.  And according to the Telegraph, the former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who is also very Europhile, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that... And he also told the Dutch newspaper, Volkskrant... I do indeed think that the European Union is at great risk, deadly risk in fact.  And also that the image that Italians have of the Netherlands has been drastically polluted in just a few days.  But it's not just the Italians.  The Irish Times reports that the Portuguese Prime Minister, Antonio Costa, is also upset that the Dutch Finance Minister, Wopke Hoekstra, has also dismissed the use of Eurobonds during this healthcare crisis.  The Dutch Finance Minister said that Brussels should be looking into why some economies did not have the economic wherewithal to stave off any downturn and deal with their own problems.  to which the Portuguese PM gave the riposte.  That statement is repugnant in the framework of the European Union, and that's exactly the right expression for it, repugnant.  No one has any more time to hear Dutch finance ministers as we heard in 2008, 2009, 2010 and so forth.  Now there are nine countries in the Eurozone who want these Eurobonds issued, so that the money raised can be targeted where it is most needed.  But a Eurozone group dubbed the Frugal Four, that's Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland, all reject the idea.  And the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on this, It would mean that you would cross the line of the Rubicon into a Eurozone which is more of a transfer union than was envisioned by its creators.  I cannot foresee any circumstances in which we would change that position.  And the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, said, Europe is on the line.  It cannot fail on this, because even the most pro-European countries and governments like Spain need proof of a real commitment.  It's Europe's move.  And I keep reading claims that everything is sweetness and light in the Eurozone and the wider European Union.  Now to take that message away from what's actually happening must take the thickest of blue and gold star tinted spectacle lenses.  I also get told by some that they've heard all the claims that the Eurozone or the European Union is going to collapse before.  Not going to happen, they say.  But the claims were being made by Brexiteers as a warning prior to the EU referendum in 2016.  The warnings today are coming from inside the European Union and inside the Eurozone and from its politicians.  And that proves that Brexiteers were right all along.  Now the French President Emmanuel Macron... Stop hissing and booing out there.  As I was saying, Emmanuel Macron is still harping on about more EU and more Eurozone to fix the problems.  He wants all member states to cede their economic controls to Brussels.  He wants huge EU departments to control the money and how it's spent, as well as taxes and the like.  That way, he says, a fully Brussels-controlled response could take place, with centrally issued euro bonds sold to raise the money to pay for it.  But I do have to say that on a personal basis, I wouldn't be looking to put euro bonds in any portfolio of investments that I had money in, central control or no central control.  Would you?  And I wonder who would buy those euro bonds?  China, maybe?  Anyway, ceding such control would mean the likes of Greece, Italy and Portugal having to hand the keys to their respective treasuries over to the Eurocrats, together with tax-raising powers etc.  And do you really think those governments would trust anyone in Brussels with that power over them right now, if ever?  I don't.  They'd still probably get a rough deal out of it in the end.  those countries hardest hit like italy say this is not their fault and they want to socialize the cost of their problems so that those less affected can then cough up and help to pay while the frugal four might agree to loans, maybe, with of course the associated repayment schedule, interest added, and oodles of austerity imposed to teach, what they see as wastrel nations, a big lesson.  And that is the divide, a blame divide.  It's not our fault.  Oh yes it is.  And that's not something that will get sorted any time soon.  Those Eurozone nations with money and who have not yet been hit by the cyclone of this crisis are going to do their best to defend their positions.  And they may feel that Italy brought this on themselves by selling off so much of their internal industry to China and then importing and using Chinese labour to do the work.  But those frugal nations, as they call themselves, do forget that their Eurozone rules either allowed this to happen or overlooked it, so accepting it on all their behalves.  But the likes of Italy now have a stark choice.  If money from the sale of Euro bonds is not forthcoming, then what do they do?  Try to get a loan and enforced austerity from Eurocrats, something that could decimate their economy for decades anyway?  Or do they take their economy fully in their own hands and ditch the Euro, and ultimately the EU, to deal with their crisis in their own way?  Be in no doubt, neither route will be a pretty one.  But with one of them, they do know that they have full control and are not owned outright by a foreign power.  And I know which of those I would choose.  And either way, the EU will come under intense block-breaking stress.

And if you want to see more of me, buy a mug with my mug on it.  So, what would you do if you were in Italy's shoes?  Go it alone or hand the keys over to Brussels?
