            "text": "President Biden has proposed this $1.9 trillion package.  You already have some Republicans who say, we just passed a stimulus plan.  They're not going to get on board with this.  Mitt Romney, among them, who says, we just passed a program with over $900 billion.  And some people say the price tag is just way too big.  So how does President Biden expect to get this passed with bipartisan support?  And how does that fit into his broader message of bipartisanship, proposing something like this?  that's that big? ",

He wants to work with Democrats and Republicans to address the crises that the American people are facing, whether they live in red states or blue states or Democrats or Republicans.  The package was designed based on recommendations from health experts, from economists.  It's been applauded by everyone from Senator Bernie Sanders to the Chamber of Commerce.  And there are specific pieces in there that are meant to serve as a bridge for the American people, including a large percentage of it.  that's for unemployment insurance.  funding for vaccine distribution, something that is pivotal, as we've already been discussing here today, for reopening of schools.  So part of the discussion we'll be having with members is, what do you want to cut?  And this is a plan that he feels addresses the crisis at the moment. ",

You've already seen him work with Republicans and Democrats and work toward a bipartisan approach to passing packages that will address the crises we're facing, and that certainly is his priority and his preference.  So that's what he'll continue to work on on day two of the administration.  Go ahead, Mike, share. ",

There's this call for unity that the president made in his speech yesterday, but there has so far been almost no fig leaf even to the Republican Party.  You don't have a Republican cabinet member like President Obama and I think President Clinton had.  The executive orders that he's come out the gate have been largely designed at erasing as much of the Trump legacy as you can with executive orders, much of which the Republican Party likes and agrees with.  You've put forth an immigration bill that has a path to citizenship but doesn't do much of a nod towards the border security.  And you've got a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill that has, as folks have said, already drawn all sorts of criticism.  Where is the actual action behind this idea of bipartisanship?  And when are we going to see one of those, you know, sort of substantial outreaches?  that said, this is something that, you know, the Republicans want to do too? ",

But, Mike, is unemployment insurance only an issue that Democrats in the country want?  Do only Democrats want their kids to go back to schools?  Do only Democrats want vaccines to be distributed across the country?  That's \u2013 we feel that that package \u2013 he feels that package is designed for bipartisan support.  I will also say that we have also had some positive developments on our confirmations and our nominees.  Last night, as you all saw, his \u2013 the President's nominee, now confirmed leader \u2013 first female leader of the intelligence community was confirmed with a vote of 85 to 10 \u2013 84 to 10, you can check me on that \u2013 but an overwhelming vote.  We've seen progress today on the nomination and hopeful confirmation of Lloyd Austin.  So there is movement supported by both sides of the aisle and members of both parties.  I think if you talk to Republicans on the Hill, which I know many of you do, they will say they're not looking for something symbolic.  They are looking for engagement.  They're looking to have a conversation.  They're looking to have a dialogue.  And that's exactly what he's going to do.  Go ahead. ",
