            "text": "Thank you, thank you, thank you.  How are you guys?  Good to see everybody.  Praise God.  Thank you for having me.  I'm just going to read a scripture for you real fast.  If you would, just take a moment to pay close attention to this.  Proverbs 24, verse 11.  Here's what it says.  Rescue those who are being taken away to death.  Hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.  If you say, behold, we did not know this, does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?  Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it?  And will he not repay man according to his work?  That's a powerful text of scripture.  And if you heard it, you heard, that's you.  And that's me.  Rescue those who are being led away to the slaughter, being taken away to death.  And the answer from Scripture, from the God of this Scripture, the God that established this nation, is that if you say, we didn't know.  We didn't know.  It says, doesn't he who weighs the hearts know it?  Doesn't he know that we know?  And will he not repay man according to his deeds?  It's a powerful text of scripture.  It's a challenging text of scripture that challenged us.  I'm a pastor of a church in Phoenix.  It challenged us about a decade ago.  Of course, we were Christian.  Of course, we were pro-life.  Of course, we thought the pro-life industry was doing their duty to end abortion in our nation.  And we learned that they're not.  Their focus is regulation, not abolition.  It's regulation and not criminalization.  They have professed themselves that they are not Christian institutions.  They are not standing on scripture.  And we learned very early on that if we are going to end this, we need to end it with courage as Christians first and foremost.  First and foremost.  Have you all noticed, I'm sure you've noticed lately, none of us can deny this now, have you noticed lately that the radical left, those who would be self-professed unbelievers, do not want to compromise on their positions.  They say, this is our position, this is what we're fighting for, this is what we're doing.  And have you noticed that conservatives, those who profess to be followers of Christ even, are the ones who are always compromising, the ones who will not exhibit courage, courage enough to believe this, if you are not with me, you are against me.  Those are the words of Jesus.  If you're not with me, you are against me.  I want to encourage you guys to think about something for a moment.  This man over here, Walt Blackman, he's not just a good man, a strong man, a courageous man.  I want you to know this and you're going to be seeing this a lot in our state over the next couple of months.  This man is the hero of the children in Arizona.  And I want to explain to you why.  Many of you may not even know this.  It hasn't become fully public yet, completely, so that everyone can know about it.  Right now in Arizona, please hear this, this is massive.  It is earth-shattering and it is mind-altering, trust me.  In Arizona, it's never been changed.  AZ statute 13-3603.  AZ statute 13-3603 makes abortion a criminal act in Arizona.  It has never been changed.  This man This man, the hero of the children in Arizona, is going to point to that statute and establish that law so that abortion is not regulated in Arizona.  It is a criminal act.  Abortion is murder.  We are human from conception.  Listen closely.  You win this argument.  There is no way to surmount this argument and outdo it, overcome it.  Number one, biblically speaking, God says that he's the creator of life.  He knits us together in our mother's womb.  We are human beings, image of God from conception.  that cannot be disputed.  Number two, biologically speaking, it is a matter of scientific fact that from the moment of conception, the moment of conception, you are human from that very moment.  The only difference from that moment to where you are now is a difference of degree, size, level of development, environment, and degree of dependence.  all this talk about black lives matter, I wanna know if the black lives in the womb matter.  Because, The black community is the community most in danger from extermination via abortion.  We have about 3,000 human beings exterminated, murdered.  Listen, I know we're trying to have a good time and a good rally here, but I gotta be honest and courageous enough to tell the truth.  Every day in our nation, in our streets, in our neighborhoods, every single day, 3,000, about 3,000 human beings lose their lives.  They have their heads cut off, their arms taken off their bodies, their legs taken off their bodies, and they are disemboweled every single day.  And I want to grant something as a minister of the gospel.  That is not something any of us can fully comprehend.  All we can do is think about it one baby at a time.  So we started going out as a church many years ago with the gospel of Jesus Christ first and foremost to the abortion mills.  We said, number one, mom and dad, please don't murder your child.  Number two, there is hope in Christ, forgiveness in Christ.  And number three, we will help you.  We will pay for everything.  We'll even adopt your child.  Because of that work, we've raised up 500 churches globally doing the same.  And as of today, thousands and thousands and thousands of children are alive today because of that work.  I have a son.  who is eight months old.  He's adopted.  He was going to be exterminated and aborted.  We have children who are at my church.  They show up before the pulpit running around circles in front.  Olivia Grace and Kara, twin girls saved from Tempe's Planned Parenthood because Christians went out with the gospel of Jesus Christ and offered to help and called it what it is.  This is murder and we won't tolerate it anymore.  And so what I want to ask of you is this.  is to consider this.  What's happening in our country is very simply this.  It is a collision of world views.  It is the world and life view of those who stand on this revelation as the truth of the living God.  This is the objective standard and those who deny it.  Did you know that this nation, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the reason that is so meaningful and brought so much peace and freedom and justice is because the principles behind all those things come directly from this book.  This book.  The people who established this nation, the Huguenots, the Pilgrims, the Puritans, the Christians who came over and established this nation, did you know this?  Did you know this?  In the colonies, they named the Triune God of the Holy Scriptures as the God over their state.  When they would make treaties with other nations, they would make that treaty in the name of the Triune God of the Holy Scriptures.  They knew that this book is the standard of all truth.  And did you know that John Jay, the first Supreme Court Justice, when he was creating the case law system of our nation, our first Supreme Court Justice, he would name directly the verses from which he was establishing the law on this nation.  If you want to know where we've gone, you need to look at how far we've departed from this revelation.  And I want to encourage you, if you're someone who professes faith in Jesus Christ, you call this the truth, stand on this truth, be courageous.  And please hear me on this.  Over the next few months, we're going to need you.  We're going to need you because when... Where'd he go?  When the hero of Arizona's children calls abortion what it is, murder, and says it will no longer be tolerated and we're gonna criminalize this, there's gonna be two things coming at waltz.  You need to know what it is.  Number one, the pro-choicers, the pro-aborts, the people who say we should be able to murder our children in the womb.  And, please hear me on this, and please be gracious enough and humble enough to hear me, because I am not the enemy.  The pro-life industry that does not want to criminalize it, does not want to call it murder, that wants to regulate it, they will also come against Walt trying to stop what he's doing.  I've seen it in another state, Oklahoma.  In Oklahoma, there was a senator named Joseph Silk who put a bill in to criminalize abortion immediately.  Do you know who the opposition was?  The pro-life industry.  They stopped it.  So if you want to give money to somebody to help them stop abortion in this state, give it to Walt Blackman.  If you want to give money, Give it to the Christian churches who are ending abortion, not regulating it.  And if you want peace and righteousness and justice and freedom to prevail in this country, it isn't going to be through mere political commitments.  It's only going to be because of what Christians said in the past to establish this nation.  Are you ready for it?  And I'm almost done.  This is, by the way, a miracle you're seeing right now.  It's only had five minutes.  That's only about an hour less than I usually go.  Here's the answer to the hope of this nation.  No king but Christ.  That's the answer.  The gospel is the answer.  The problem we see with the rioting and looting and sin in our streets is just that, sin.  The answer to our problem of sin is peace with God through Jesus Christ.  Jesus is God in the flesh, lived perfectly, died for sinners and rose again from the dead.  The only hope of anybody in this world is through faith in him.  The call of the gospel is to repent and believe the gospel.  Come to Christ for life.  Join us.  as we criminalize the injustice of abortion in this state.  Be courageous.  No compromise.  This is murder, and it's ending in our state.  Thank you. ",
