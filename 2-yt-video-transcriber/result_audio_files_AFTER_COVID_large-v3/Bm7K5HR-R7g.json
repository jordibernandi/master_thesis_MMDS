            "text": "Every single one of us as Americans are guaranteed basic fundamental rights and freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution.  But we cannot take these freedoms for granted.  I've introduced legislation to stand up for and to protect brave whistleblowers who've come forward to expose illegal actions within our own government or egregious abuses of power and to reform the Espionage Act to make sure that if a whistleblower is prosecuted under the Espionage Act, that they will have their fair day in court, something that is currently not allowable under the law as it stands today.  So first I introduced HRES 1162 with my colleague, Congressman Matt Gaetz, that very simply calls on our government to drop all charges against Edward Snowden for the actions that he took in the public interest to expose a mass government surveillance program on all Americans that violates our privacy and civil liberties and that courts deemed illegal more than once.  I also introduced HRES 1175 with my colleague Congressman Tom Massey, which calls for the same action for the government to drop all charges against Julian Assange, who also acted in the public interest as he published information to expose lies and egregious abuses of power in our own government.  Last but not least, I introduced Bill HR 8452 to reform the Espionage Act.  Daniel Ellsberg was the first person prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act for his act of bravery in releasing the Pentagon Papers to the Washington Post to publish classified documents that exposed the lies that were being told to the American people about what was really happening in the Vietnam War.  Now Snowden, Assange and others are being prosecuted under this same Espionage Act.  But as Daniel Ellsberg knows well, under current law, none of them are allowed to speak to the intent of their actions in court.  My bill changes that.  I'm urging my colleagues in Congress to stand up for the American people, to stand up for our freedoms, and pass this critical legislation now. ",
