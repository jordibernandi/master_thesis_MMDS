            "text": "All right, peace.  What's going on, everybody?  This is Ron Chavis.  We're here at the Virginia Union Greenhouse today.  Today, I'm going to show you all how we start fees.  A central component of growing your own food is being able to start your own seed, save money.  A lot of people go buy seedlings, but, you know, Who's got the money to be buying all types of seedlings for everything that you want to do?  It's much cheaper to get you a pack of seeds and start your own seedlings and then rock them there.  So today's demonstration, I'm going to show you some of the essential equipment that you need in order to start the seeds and, you know, I'm going to demonstrate how you do your seed.  depth and also just making sure that everything is identified and labeled so that you know what you're actually planting.  All right, so y'all stay tuned, we're gonna be rocking with y'all, and then we'll probably show you around what's going on in the greenhouse a little later, all right?  Peace.  So, we are about to start seeds today, and what we're starting, we're gonna start some dark green zucchini squash.  and some yellow squash, 49er hybrid.  A lot of people talk about the hybrids versus GMOs.  I want you to explicitly understand that there is a difference between a GMO crop and a hybrid crop.  People have been hybridizing crops since the dawn of time.  It happens naturally in nature when there's two plants of the same species and proximity to one another.  If the pollen from one of those plants gets into the flower of another, it'll generate a crossbreed of the two, right?  So that's not unnatural, right?  So a lot of the crops that we eat today are a result of hybridization.  You know, people can create hybrids to actually select better characteristics of the plants.  For example, making a plant more disease tolerant, making a plant more drought tolerant, also sweetness, taste, flavor, size, color, you know, all these types of things can come from the hybridization of props, but I'm on a tangent.  So we'll do another talk on that at another time.  Today we're talking about starting seeds.  So check it.  All right, essential equipment, of course, your seeds, marker, labels or seed labels, seed tray labels, and a seed tray.  A lot of folks might not have C-Trays, but these are excellent to use.  If you have egg cartons, just poke a hole in the bottom of the egg carton.  If you got toilet paper rolls, do that.  Whatever floats your boat.  But for real, for real, for me, I love C-Trays.  This is three, one, two, three, four, five, six.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.  This is a 72-count tray.  which means that we can plant 72 seedlings in here.  We don't have to start 72 at a time.  You can do as many as you want, but I'm trying to maximize the space.  So we'll see what we've got.  First thing, when you're starting your seeds, yo, read the back of your seed packet.  It tells you everything that you need to know in order to start the seeds, right?  So this one that all plants, all seed packs, just about all seed packs has instruction on the back.  I get frustrated when people ask me, how do I start the seeds?  Or what do I do in order to plant the seed when the seed pack has the instructions on the back?  I'm not trying to be insulting anyone's intelligence when I tell you, hey, you know, People don't read.  But anyway, on the back of this, you know, it says, so in full sign, you know, four to five seeds over 12 inch tall.  It's a few cross hill when six inches tall, then to three per hill control weeds.  And most, this is just easy.  That's just instructions, but also.  What it talks about on the back is.  it tells you what zone and when to plant your plants.  It also tells you about the spacing, how long it takes to germinate, how deep you need to plant the seeds, and how many days from planting to harvest.  So, you know, hey, it's not rocket science, but okay.  So what we're doing today, we just go tear it open.  I'm going to be planting all these seeds.  So first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to write the name of the seeds that I'm growing on the back of my seed label.  So this is squash, dark, zucchini.  And I'm going to put today's date on here.  And let's see, today's the 28th, right?  29th, 329, 20.  This way I know what day I planted, started these seeds.  So if I come back in 10 days, two weeks, and that stuff hasn't germinated, that means that the seeds might be bad or whatever.  So, and then it just gives me a better, keeps me focused on, how long it's gonna take for me to get this stuff into the ground.  So if it takes 10 days for these to germinate, maybe two weeks from now, three weeks from now, we'll be ready to put these in the ground.  All right, so check it.  So we're gonna plant the squash going down on this row and we'll continue until I run out of seeds.  Another good use of your marker is just to poke a little hole.  So you don't have to use your fingers.  These don't need to be no deeper than an inch.  Good tip is that when you plant your seeds, when you look at your seed size, your seed should not have to go any deeper than double its size, right?  So if the seed is... half an inch in size, you shouldn't be planting the seed two inches deep because when the cotyledon or the initial sprout comes out, see the seed has all this genetic information inside of it and when the water hits it and it germinates, it's gonna send a root down and it's gonna send this cotyledon or the tube baby leaves up to the top.  And you don't want the seed to have to go through all this extra work in order to break to the top.  Also, a note about seed mix.  We're using just regular old cotton soil.  You know, got it from Lowe's, Home Depot.  This is really good.  I don't really put a whole lot of energy into what kind of sea starting mix I use.  I mean, some people do pay attention to that.  I mean, we will get some potting mix and then if we want to add some nutrients to it, then we'll put maybe some sea minerals like kelp meal or crab shell meal inside of it or alfalfa meal, just so that when the sealant breaks out of its initial shell, it'll have the nutrients available to it inside of the soil around it, because it's only a small space and the seeds need to get their thing, get the nutrients as soon as they're finished absorbing whatever nutrients are inside of the seed case from the Gidia.  All right, so simple stuff.  Starting seeds is also a great exercise of mindfulness because it does require focused attention on whatever it is you're doing.  You know, you want to get your meditation in or your quiet time, come in here and go in your greenhouse or wherever it is.  you're starting your seeds and get you a pack of seeds and some seed trays and go ham, man.  And just get all the quiet time you want.  Good business.  So, all right.  So, after we've dug it in, You don't need to pack them down or anything like that.  Just gently drop the soil around it so that it's nice and covered.  Oh, reminder, like, yo, or just a heads up, seeds don't need light to germinate.  They can germinate in darkness.  they'll need light as soon as they sprout, they're going to need light to start photosynthesizing.  So, you know, I see a lot of people putting seedlings under grow lights or seeds under grow lights.  It's not necessary.  All you need to do is start from there.  So, yeah, the next thing.  So as you can see, I started, I stopped right here.  So the next seeds that I'm going to do is going to be, uh, the squash 49 hybrid.  So again, on a date.  Right?  And then we just gonna repeat.  Same thing we just did for the dark green zucchini.  So yeah, so basically that's it.  I'm not gonna social intelligence and do this for you another pack.  It's the same deal.  Read the back.  know uh we're starting to squash.  they they're pretty good for storage.  you know zucchini squash.  these are really good crops to have on hand uh because they last a long time.  uh uh they're also very prolific.  once you get them going uh we'll do a whole tutorial on throwing the squash in the ground because there are some pests.  uh squash beetles.  uh also powdery mildew issues that come along with growing squash.  uh but You know, it's an excellent storage crop.  And we'll try to plant a whole bunch of it during this time.  All right.  You just need to give them a nice little saturation when you're watering.  Water deep.  You need to keep the soil moist after you've put the seeds in the germination state.  You can't overwater.  You can overwater.  But we're going to give this a nice saturation.  All right. ",

Don't wanna fall from the clouds to the sea for a place that's promised to me.  My words are true.  I always knew.  I'll get you if you fall.  When the leaves betrayed the trees, the wheel that became complete to me.  Where do I go when I don't know what's ahead of me?  From the stars to the sun From when I fall into love That was never intended to be.  You come running to me.  The night's not easy to see.  The moon shines brighter in the sky To show you the way back to me.  Show you the way back to love Because it's always around.  And when the leaves reach where the trees will be, love becomes something to me.  Do I go when I don't know what's ahead of me? ",
