I've never even come close to getting as many thumbs down as she's gotten in comparison to thumbs up.  and there's a lot of other people that I see on YouTube posting that have never gotten more thumbs down and thumbs up.  and one of the one of my favorite replies on her channel which is pretty funny she is asked for evidence.  over and over again.  she's called out as a liar over and over again but one comment stands out the most And it is this one right here by K.T.  Allen, 2025.  Nefertiti, you are doing your own people a great disservice.  I'm a member of the Houghton Library at Harvard University.  I recently read a $30,000 book called Africa by John Ogilby.  who was the surveyor of king who was the surveyor to king charles ii published in 1669. page 34 of his book details the jews of west africa who were descendants of jerusalem judaians.  this is just one book of many.  the evidence is overwhelming.  please do an extensive research so that your eyes can be open now.  i have no way to verify whether or not this person really um is a member of the houghton library of harvard university.  uh but i am aware of john ogilby's book and this person is 100 right and i even referenced john ogilby in the nephronity exposed video uh where i exposed her and damon richardson.  so if you have not checked that out please go do so all right.  for those of you new to the channel go ask your pastor is a segment on my channel where I attempt to get your pastor to release a diss track about you for asking them questions that they may not have the answers to.  so today we're gonna talk about evidence and it goes.  everything ties hand in hand because once you start getting into the truth everything becomes consistent.  so in episode 10 I covered this information right here from 1890. it was a French translation and I did make a mistake in the translation right here where it says port slave traders gay.  now what I didn't know and people were very fast to correct me.  so thank you for those who did correct me and send me the correct information here.  so the reason it's broken up here it's actually supposed to be Portuguese.  so you'll see this translated on the other video and I mentioned right here it's broken up Portuguese.  right here it's Portuguese.  so when it translated in Google Translate as you can see what I used it broke it up port slave traders gay.  so it's supposed to be Portuguese slave traders.  so that is the correction that I want to put out there for episode 10. if you've already watched that all right.  so today's evidence.  now let me let me um point out that this was uh done.  this was published in 1890 from last episode 1890. today we're going to look at an earlier source that says something similar and that was published here in 1882. so eight years before the french published it we have a um a book called the earth and its inhabitants.  right here we see a contributor is Princeton Theological Seminary library.  that's important because when you run into these pseudo Christians that call themselves urban apologists this cult has been trying to say that we are lying.  and yet we keep coming up with more and more evidence from universities.  and now I'm gonna toss a seminary in there Princeton Theological Seminary Library.  so if this information is false you need to call up Princeton Theological Seminary Library and ask them to remove it from their list of books.  and it's a simple request and for some reason that the so-called Christians this cult that opposes us.  they refuse to call the sources or the publishers of the libraries of the museums to have these this information updated or corrected.  and yet they will call us liars.  they want to debate us.  I'm not debating.  called Princeton Theological Seminary Library.  if you want to debate debate them.  Don't call me and ask me for a debate.  I have nothing to debate until you debunk these universities.  I have no reason to believe that these universities are lying, period.  Debunk the university.  I didn't publish the information.  I'm only sharing it.  so now in the earth and its inhabitants we have here now before we get started I do want to point out one more thing.  I'm only showing you one page a paragraph a section.  this book is over 600 pages long so what you will see later on is a bunch of post or a bunch of videos from these dishonest people who call themselves the urban apologists.  this cult will put out a video saying well Dante didn't show you this or he didn't show you that it's a 600 page book.  I'm telling you right now I'm not showing you all 600 plus pages of this book.  so when you see them say that I didn't show you this or that understand that I'm not gonna ever read an entire book in a video.  it just doesn't make sense.  so just know that when you see them posting so now in this book right here and a link is going to be in the description so you can find it yourself and there's actually a search function.  you can search for this stuff and pull it up.  it says here right under this the section Dahomey.  it says east of the Great Popo begins the Dahomey territory guarded by the important town of Galloway.  and again it looks familiar because the way weh.  you will see that sometimes when people spell yahweh depending on how they transliterate the word the town of glaway known to the europeans this is important.  known to the europeans by the various names of fida hasida widow and weda.  the old writers so remember.  this is published in 1882 and he's referring to the old writers meaning before this.  the old writers called it judah and its inhabitants were said to be Jews while the neighboring River Alala whose real name is Ephra became the Euphrates changes a little bit of geography as we know it too.  during the flourishing days of the slave trade from 16 to 18,000 were annually transported from a Judah and the Portuguese called this place while at the time had a population of 35,000. the tetular deity of Witta is the snake and its famous fetish temple is served by priestesses called mothers or sisters of serpents and recruited by the abduction of young girls on feast days.  Witta belongs by right of conquest to Dahomey since 1725 when he received the name glad way or the farm indicating the part it played in supplying the capital with provisions.  so again we see here the last evidence was from 1890 was a French source saying that the Europeans believed or knew that the Jews were in West Africa.  and now we see a source from 1882 which is eight years prior to the last source that says that the inhabitants were said to be jews.  so there's no mistaking here.  and it said the old writers.  so that means prior to 1882 writers were saying that jews were in west africa.  now what's important here says during the flourishing days of the slave trade from 16 to 18 000 were annually transported from a judah as the portuguese called the place.  so now the urban apologists urban apologetics community have backed Nefertiti.  Nefertiti has claimed that these were European Jews that were deported to West Africa and now we're seeing a source that says that sixteen to eighteen thousand were transported yearly from there.  so we've been asking for a source from the urban apologetics community for weeks.  some people have asked for years.  i've asked for weeks.  um going on it's probably gonna be a couple months.  it'd probably be forever.  um but they have yet to provide a source where all these thousands of white jews as they believe they believe these were white jews.  they have yet to provide a single source that says these jews were white and living in west africa and were being deported by the thousands every single year.  so please be careful who you listen to when it comes down to history.  some of these people are very dishonest and they don't want you to find the truth.  they are being paid.  they're being backed by white money.  for those of you who are people of transatlantic slave descent understand that the urban apologetics community Eric Mason being at the top is being backed by white money.  understand that vocab Malone is a white racist being backed by white money to oppose this and a lot of the house Negroes that you see supporting them.  they are falling in line.  they are not necessarily being paid.  some of them are being paid.  now if you want receipts there's people out there you can contact and you can find receipts.  I've showed you guys some GoFundMe stuff.  I've showed you guys some other stuff.  but understand that is more.  this evidence come out.  what they're gonna do is they're gonna start making more personal attacks.  they're not gonna attack the evidence and they're not gonna provide you any sources.  so if you want to see for yourself what I'm saying is true ask any urban apologists or Christian that opposes this.  ask them for their sources.  they will not give you the sources or they will want to question you first or they will give you the runaround.  they will want you to take their word for it because that's how they operate.  they operate in the spirit of deception.  so anyway make sure you go.  ask your pastor why they have not showed you this evidence.  if they don't know of the evidence that's not a problem.  help them get educated.  if they're willing to educate themselves.  if they do know about it ask them why they haven't shared it with you.  if they are unwilling to share this evidence you should probably find yourself another pastor.  the fact is the information is coming out.  we know what the truth is and people who oppose this truth are doing so simply because they hate black people.  some people are black that hate black people.  they are self-hating.  you guys have seen uncle ruckus on the boondocks.  there are a lot of uncle ruckus is running around right now in the black community that hate the idea that black people were chosen.  they love the idea that white people were chosen.  they love white Jesus.  they want to worship a white man and and that's just simply what it comes down to.  so again make sure you go.  ask your pastor if you've not already grabbed your copy of undeniable full color of evidence of black Israelites in the Bible.  you can do so on amazon.com or Barnes and Noble.  it is mostly full color evidence very little text definitely no scriptural interpretation.  they can't say we took it out of context.  they can't say we're reading history out of context.  it's full color pictures.  it shuts down all arguments.  they they can argue that these are dark-skinned Europeans all they want to but we know that's a lie.  for those who want a historical breakdown with the verses.  check out the black Hebrew awakening the final 400 years as slaves in America.  things are getting interesting.  right after the 20 end of 2019 as I said there would be a pause and then the stuff would start happening.  and that's what exactly what we're seeing right now coming into 2020. we are four months into 2020 and we are seeing all kind of stuff all over the world.  so make sure you check out this book.  don't let the urban apologists lie to you based on the title.  we know they haven't read it so yeah grab your copy of that.  and again if you have not clicked the thumbs up button yet please do so.  please click the subscribe button as well.  and if you've already subscribed make sure you click the notification bell so that you don't miss any future episodes.  and with that said until next time I'm out.
