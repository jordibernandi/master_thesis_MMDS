            "text": "Hello, today is Franklin 5.  It is now Monday, and I'm out for another walk to help my heart pump and my kidneys to get in shape, and I'm taking you with me.  Normally during these times at a Franklin 5, I'll show you my garden or show you my animals, but right now I have my son taking care of these things, and I am going out for little walks to get healthier and stronger.  And so today we're at Minnewaska State Park.  We went for a very short little hike up to the first gazebo.  And that's where we're sitting now.  And it's a beautiful, beautiful place above a glacier lake.  I have my wife here helping me out because I still can't see out of the one eye and it's hard to type and to videotape anymore.  So my wife is really helping me out with putting this all together so that I can share this time with you.  Again, I want to thank you all.  All your prayers and continued encouragement during this time is still unbelievable to me.  Oh, I got a South Africa, an encouragement from South Africa and from Sweden and Belfast.  Just beautiful places all over the world.  And it's just completely amazing to me how God's love is just everywhere.  And it's... Share through people.  And so I just want to share some things back with you, just to show you a couple places, different things that I've got to get done to get back in shape, to get my kidneys working again.  And this is part of the treatment.  He's going for a walk.  So a couple of things I just want to share with you now.  In our experience... through this whole process of what we went through, or I went through, and you came alongside, and my wife came and kept you updated, was not knowing what's ahead in life.  And things that you don't expect will take place, but are you ready for them?  And there's a song that's done by a person, and I'll put it in the link in the description area of the video, From a person who talks about sometimes you've got to go for a hike without a map.  And so in life, these are things that because we don't know what's ahead, it feels like that.  It feels like we have to move forward.  And there have been other people from the scriptures, from the Old Testament especially, who I enjoy reading about.  One is the prophet Elijah.  who found himself in a spot where he felt he was the only prophet left and that he was very discouraged.  And he went to the Lord and he was seeking his will.  And in that, God, I'm going to put that in the description area too.  You can read about it.  But God showed him a mighty wind.  He showed him fire, an earthquake.  But God wasn't in any of those.  God was in the still, small breeze.  And he spoke to Elijah and told him what was coming.  Told him what was coming next.  And I apologize.  I'm still pretty emotional right now going through this, and I don't mind sharing it.  I've lost pretty much all my pride through this process.  And I do want to say thank you to all the nurses The male and female nurses down at Vassar Brothers in Poughkeepsie, New York, you did a fantastic job.  As I was coming out of the coma, I gave everybody a hard time.  Can you imagine?  And they were so nice and gentle and patient with me.  And so this is day 23 coming out, being home, getting stronger.  I want to thank you for being with me.  Thank you for being friends and supporters.  but mainly just friends, brothers and sisters in Christ, being a part of my life, part of my family's life, making things a lot easier for us.  And again, we're going to do a little bit more of these Frankly in Fives than any of the longer videos, only because it's hard for me to even talk for five minutes.  We're going to go back down the path.  It's downhill from here.  But thank you for being with me.  God bless and have a wonderful evening. ",
