But the fact that police are confused about how to enforce coronavirus rules, that he went to forcibly grab her bag and arrest her in front of her children is the fundamental problem we currently face.  I hope every cop watches this video and learns something from it.  People are beginning to resist.  They've had enough and the law is often on their side, not yours.  Do not use coronavirus as a power trip.  And if you see your partner getting it wrong, don't stand by.  Please stop them.  If you support this woman standing up for herself, make sure to like, comment and share to inspire others to do the same.  We need more of that.
