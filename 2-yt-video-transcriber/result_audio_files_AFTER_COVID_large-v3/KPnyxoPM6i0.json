            "text": "If I'm elected next week, I, on my first week in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, will bring forward a private member's bill to bring forward fair pricing legislation based on the minimum wage legislation that would guarantee by law that farmers as the primary producers of quality food products would be entitled to a fair share of the final retail price of food.  Now, Fianna F\u00e1il have this suggestion that they've introduced a food armistice.  The UK have that, it doesn't work.  It's as toothless as the competition authority, we know where that went.  Just in final conclusion, I would also support anti-trust legislation.  We need to break up the stranglehold that Goodman's ABP have over rendering, and we need to ensure, and for example, the competition authority was sick with the Queen when they approved Goodman's ABP taking over, gaining a 51% controlling interest in slating needs, which gives them effectively a stranglehold over the land sector as well.  That's something that has to be challenged.  You need someone to challenge it.  You need someone to be a strong advocate for farmers, who's a full-time farmer, who has an interest in farming, my livelihood is farming, and I will be the best advocate that's offered in Westmead Canal if I'm elected next week.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. ",
