We saw the protesters turn and come this way, and the video we were watching was after the protesters had come by.  We could see that there was some damage.  The windows were broken.  It wasn't until after that that we realized that the building was on fire, and it wasn't just a few minutes after that.  The place was just a complete blaze.  This morning, get up, tried to get some rest.  This morning, get up, come down here, and what I see, I was not prepared for.  I knew it was going to be a disaster, but I didn't know what a disaster looked like until I saw it. ",
