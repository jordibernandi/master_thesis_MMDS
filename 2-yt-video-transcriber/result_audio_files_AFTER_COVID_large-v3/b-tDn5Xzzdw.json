            "text": "Okay, I'm Bob Mears.  I'm out of Lubbock, Texas.  We have people from Kansas and, of course, Oklahoma here.  We've got some from Dallas, Fort Worth area.  We come here to fight air-to-air competition, fight airplanes.  You've got two airplanes that get points for being in the air.  You towed a streamer around, you get points for cutting that streamer.  It's a great amount of fun.  I've done this since I was nine years old.  I do it internationally.  I've been to France and Germany and Italy and Australia and just all over the world because of these model airplanes.  My dad started me.  I got my first tour when I was nine and did it until my father passed.  My brother's still doing it with me.  My nephew does it.  I've got my grandkids started now.  I'm going to get them doing it.  It's just a great amount of fun, especially for the bang for the buck.  Five seconds down.  I've done drag racing, dirt track racing, SCCA racing, car shows, everything in the world, and we always come back to these model airplanes just because it's so much fun.  There's several events of this.  We flew Nostalgia this morning, which is pre-1970 airplanes, which they're a little bit of a pain because old stuff like that doesn't work well.  What we're fixing to fly is a speed limit event, and what it's designed for is to try to get beginners in it because those only run about 75 miles an hour.  What's really great about this over radio control is you don't watch your own airplane.  You fly your airplane by feel.  I feel where my plane's at.  I watch my opponent over here, and he's watching mine.  And I can fly the plane blindfolded.  It makes me no difference.  I don't see it whatsoever.  So that great feel of knowing where that airplane is is just a fun feeling.  And you have to learn engines, know how to start the thing, know how to maintain it, know how to keep the airplanes flying.  And you have to. ",
