            "text": "First Timothy 4, 14.  Neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbytery.  Meditate upon these things.  Give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all.  Take heed unto thyself and unto thy doctrine.  Continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.  Double honors unto the apostles and the elders.  Salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity, risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  to the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth that be like unto the speckled bird, and to the Israelite foreigners, those be the Israelite foreigners, and to the Akwaf, the few Akwaf that are listening and learning.  to you, I say Shalawam.  And this is a message specifically to you, but still to all of Israel.  This is one of those videos that, you know, when I come across videos, certain brothers do certain things, the spirit jumps on me to repost it.  And this one, not only... Am I going to repost it?  But I had to respond to it because this was a conversation that was had last night with one of the brothers, Yasharallah.  We were having a spiritual conversation after leaving class last night and going to get something to eat.  We're both speaking spiritually about our woes with women and that whole sort of thing.  And he was telling me his story.  you know, and I'm like, wow, you know, it's just amazing how the Lord protected us, even when we're in the world, to get us to this point, all right, you know, because he's talked about a situation, you know, with a bruja, a witch, you know, and You know, just different things that we went through.  And I think of all the things that I went through.  And when I saw this video, this story came to mind, which I'm going to share real quick.  Right.  And that was a woman that I that I was.  I don't even know if I could say we were.  we were together.  I think, you know, we would.  we would try.  And I suppose I don't know.  But this was before I came into the truth many, many years ago.  And and her name was Yolanda.  And I won't say her last name or anything like that.  And we were kind of like, you know, little high school sweethearts.  We never really, you know, got together in high school.  But we were kind of sweet on each other.  You know, I was a senior.  She was a junior.  And I was, you know, getting ready to leave.  And she was a captain of the Chile squad.  And... You know, so anyway, you know, we stayed in contact and friendship, you know, the whole first like six months that I went away and then, you know, we were writing letters and all that back and forth.  And then I realized, you know what, we got to be together to be together.  So we agreed that.  You know, we just go our own way and do our own thing.  because she she got accepted to college and she was going off to college.  And, you know, you know what happens to women in college and, you know, they start they get on the carousel.  So many, many years later, we we she runs into my best friend's little brother and she asked about me and he came back to the house and was telling me, guess who I saw?  And he was like, man, she fine as hell, man.  She look even better than she did.  And I was like, for real?  She says, man, all she was doing was talking about you.  She want, she want to get up with you.  So, um, he, you know, and she gave him her information for me to have.  So, you know, so I called and, you know, we, we got together and, you know, we did what we did.  And, um, she had her, she, hey, look, the woman, She did still look very, very good.  She had pretty much taken care of herself.  Um, but she had a couple of things that she did that I didn't like.  And one thing I'm, you know, I, I really try not to deal with women or could never really would deal with women that smoked.  And she was a smoker, although she wasn't a heavy smoker.  She was smoked mostly when she was on her period.  And, um, And when that time of the month would come around, she became unbearable to be around, even to her friends, her closest friends.  And she was still close friends with most of her buddies from high school.  So, you know, I knew them all.  And I was cool with them.  But this girl would get drunk and she would accuse me of banging her friends.  And she would attack them and attack me.  So, you know, it just got to the point where things just got outlandish, man.  Now, granted, her friends were fine as hell.  Under other circumstances, yeah, especially one particular one that I got in mind.  And one of them might have wanted to get with me, you know, when I think about it.  You know, the signs was all there, the things she was doing.  But I never responded to any of that.  And, you know, I just didn't because I was into her.  But, you know, it came out that she was screwing some other dude all along.  And I got mad because I was like, because I, why?  Because I put my trust in her.  And I said, you know what?  We've been doing this like this with no protection.  And you've been with this other dude all along.  And when you think about how nasty that is, man.  You know, it's not until you come into the truth and you begin to understand things and identify biology.  That's why a lot of these women have that horrible stench.  You know, once their juices get to flowing, you know, when that sort of thing is going on.  Or that smell afterwards.  And that's the mixture of all them different samples, all them different DNAs that's attached to her.  That's why they can't get rid of it, no matter how clean they are.  But nevertheless, make a long story short, and then I'm going to play this video.  Because this video tells it all.  And this was an Israelite woman, definitely a Judahite little... Little red bone.  Gorgeous thing.  Very petite, but very, very curvy.  And long story short, she's in a spirit world now.  All right.  Because that drinking got her in trouble.  Because we fell out.  And she, you know, and I, you know, I pretty much cursed her out and never, never, never really messed with her again.  And about maybe six, seven months later, because she fell out with her best friend too, because she accused her best friend and I of hooking up.  And they see that's what happens.  When people do dirt, all of a sudden they don't trust you anymore.  Because I guess what they're expecting is for you to do the same thing, excuse me, that they did.  They're expecting that payback, that recompense.  But, you know, I never touched a friend like that.  Even though physically, you know, she was extremely attractive.  But about six, seven months later, it was around June or July, somewhere around that time.  I ran into her at a party and she was pregnant.  And I'm like, hey, what's up?  You know, you know, how you doing?  And she was, you know, she got up, she hugged me and we talked.  And I asked her, so everything cool?  You make up with your girl, y'all cool?  And she looked at me, and the look that she gave me, she was like, you joking right now?  And I'm like, nah, I mean, I just wanted to know if everything was cool, because I know we all, you know.  And then she kind of got teary-eyed, and she said, and I knew something was wrong, and she said, Well, we never really made up, but I'm at peace with her.  And I was like, and then she said, she's no longer with us.  And I was like, what?  And she was like, yeah, you know.  And then she told me how that drinking, because she would drink until she got sloppy drunk on when she was on her period.  And she, like I said, she would cuss everybody out.  Me, her friends, anybody, you know.  Probably the other dude that she was banging on the side.  Who?  that's probably him.  His head is on that sword.  By the way in this image.  The Lord going to get him.  But.  But it turned out.  She got drunk while she was cooking.  And fell asleep.  And burned up her kitchen.  And the smoke.  Killed her while she was passed out.  Fire never even got to her.  She died from the smoke inhalation.  So with that. ",

I want to give all praises to Yahawa, Bahashem, Yahavshai, Bahashem, Achad, Kordash, forgive me the spirit, to do this lesson.  This lesson is going to you Hebrew Israelite women that say you believe that scream on all the platforms that you believe in is truth, that you want salvation.  Okay, but the reality is most women are not going to make it.  Okay, most Hebrew Israelite women are not going to make it.  And that message to women should scare you, man.  Okay, because it's going to be a select few.  that listen, that get in order, man.  Okay, because one thing you gotta realize, YHWH has reached out to us, man.  Okay, it's bringing us back.  Okay, YHWH has turned its face against us for a long time.  Okay, years on top of years on top of years.  But now, this gospel is being preached. ",

            "text": "Because YHWH is taking us back.  But he's taking us back in order.  Okay?  You have to have order, man.  And one thing most of you Hebrew Israelite women don't understand, you think knowing that you're Israelite is enough for you to get on the chair.  I see y'all on different platforms cursing the man of the Lord out, talking shit, alright, trying to teach the man, you know, like somehow your Ha'abashim Ha'abashah is dealing with you to rise up the nation.  But let me read this again.  1 Corinthians 11 verse 8.  For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.  Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.  Right.  You were created for us to be in order under us, man.  Yahavah Shema HaShah is dealing with us.  So what we say go.  No matter how you feel about it, what we say go.  And the reason why a lot of you Hebrew Israelite women have a problem with that is because you are still connected to Eve.  The ways of Eve, man.  Okay, doing your own thing, man.  Okay, doing your own thing, and you want us to follow you, follow your orders.  No, man, those are the ways of the serpent.  That's how we got in this situation in the first place.  Adam listening to Eve's voice.  Okay, matter of fact, let's go to Genesis chapter 2, starting at verse 16.  And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat.  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.  For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.  And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone.  I will make him a helpmeet for him.  Right, man?  Okay.  So when the Most High gave Adam that warning, When you read verse 18, let's read it again.  And the Lord Yahuwah said, it is not good that the man should be alone.  I will make him a helpmeet for him.  So as soon as she was created, okay, she was supposed to be a helpmeet, okay, and be in order.  Not going by herself, being deceived, okay, trying to do her own thing like you do today, okay, and try to get us to follow you.  Not you follow us, but we follow you, man.  Okay?  But like I read in verse 18, you're supposed to be a helpmate, man.  Okay?  And fall in line.  So now that Yahab HaShem HaRashah is visiting us and rising us up throughout the whole world, it's evident throughout the whole planet, man, this is happening.  He's doing it in order.  So you women that do not want to get in order, the Lord is going to destroy you, man.  He is going to kill you.  If you got children, he's going to kill your children.  That's the truth, man.  Okay?  He is going to destroy you, man.  Especially those who all across the internet scoffing, talking shit, proud.  Okay?  Like the Lord ain't going to do nothing, man, for your evil.  Yeah, how about you, man?  With shy eyes, it's everywhere, man.  They hear everything.  Okay?  And there's a judgment waiting for women like you.  Okay?  That's the truth.  Like I said, most Hebrew Israelite women are not going to make it.  And that is a fact.  Now from there, let's go to Genesis chapter three, starting verse 16.  And to the woman, he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception.  In sorrow, thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee.  Right, man.  You're supposed to be a helpmate and we shall rule over you, man.  Even in this time, right now.  Okay.  Especially you dealing with a man of the Lord.  Okay.  Especially if you're dealing with a man, you got to tread very carefully, man.  Okay. ",

            "text": "And see the issue being that a lot of women want it to be the way they want it to be because what they're doing is they're judging this thing and they're judging their relationships by this current and present world.  All right.  Even though they know and understand the truth, they still want Like we always use the Titanic as an example.  The boat is sinking, but yet they're trying to upgrade to a first-class room.  All right?  You're not going to stop the Titanic from sinking by rearranging the furniture or getting new furniture.  It is not going to happen.  So instead of dealing with the situation at hand and adhering to that man and just being thankful, they want more.  And it's gonna lead to this destruction.  Let me read the scripture again one more time.  1 Timothy 4 and 16, and it reads, take heed unto thyself and into the doctrine, continue in them.  For in doing this, thou shall both save thyself and them that hear thee.  So for the men of the Lord, we're trying to follow what we've learned and follow the words of the most high.  And our women are definitely supposed to follow it because that's their salvation.  You follow your man.  You don't co-lead with him.  You don't give him ultimatums.  If he's helping you, and he's giving you due benevolence, and he helps you financially, You know, what more is there for, you know?  So with that, stark warning, this video was called A Serious Message to Hebrew Israelite Women, all right?  GMS in Rome, lion's fire.  That's the page that it's on, all right?  So with that, I'm going to give all praises going on unto Yahweh, by Hashem, the Abishai, by Hashem, Rekach, B'dash, B'ba, B'ba, B'ba, Shalom. ",
