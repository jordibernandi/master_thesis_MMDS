But it turns out that that's not actually the case.  In both the U.S.  and in places like South Korea, they're using pretty much the same system, a thing called polymerase chain reaction, which is a really common technology that basically any laboratory that does any work with genetics is going to have on hand.  So the problem is not a technology problem.  The problem is a logistics problem and a supply problem.  And what experts are telling me is that it's a logistics problem in terms of the fact that the CDC was originally trying to have lot of quality control over how these tests were run and so wanted to do them in a centralized way out of their laboratory and then was ",

MERS hit South Korea and it did not have a huge outbreak.  I think it was less than 200 people that contracted the illness, but it taught them a lot about what they needed to be doing to make sure they were prepared for the next virus.

So one of the experts I spoke to was telling me about one of the many tests that have been developed in recent weeks and kind of approved by the FDA last week.  And that test is not based on PCR, but it still needs these reagent chemicals.  So now you have a situation where you have a test that relies on a proprietary system that is much, much less available to laboratories.  And you have this big company that's buying up all of the reagent that is available that then can't be used by the places that do have the more widely available machinery.  It just kind of becomes this mess of competing interests and it doesn't necessarily solve the problem of getting more throughput of these tests being done faster. ",
