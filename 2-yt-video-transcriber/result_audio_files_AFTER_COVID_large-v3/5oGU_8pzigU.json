Can Vice President Mike Pence overturn the presidential election?  The short answer is no.  But the longer answer is, uh, no?  I don't think so.  But then again, 2020 has dropped one gigantic weird bomb after another.  If 2020 has taught me anything, it's that anything is possible.  And also, anything is possible.  According to Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, a weird bomb is about to explode.  Starting after Christmas, this is really gonna blow up.  Here's what's happening right now.  Despite ongoing allegations of voter fraud, on December 14th, the Electoral College voted in Joe Biden as the next US president.  But aha!  Wait!  Republican electors in seven states cast dueling votes for Trump!  What does that mean?  Well, it's a weird bomb.  Maybe.  As Reuters says, it is theoretically possible for the governor and legislature, each representing a different political party, to submit two different election results, leading to so-called dueling slates of electors.  But that is not what happened here.  These alternate electors that cast votes for Trump were not electors appointed by the state legislatures.  These electors were appointed by the Republican Party in those states.  What does that mean?  It most likely means that they have no legal standing as electors, and won't change a thing.  But there are two lawsuits happening right now that make things a little more complicated.  Because there is a chance, a very slim one, that Congress may actually honor these alternate electors.  And then Vice President Pence may get to call the final shot.  First, there's a lawsuit filed by the election integrity watchdog the Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society.  The Thomas More Society is a conservative public interest law firm.  The lawsuit basically says that state governors have used coronavirus restrictions to prevent their state legislatures from meeting.  The lawsuit says that because of coronavirus restrictions, at present, state legislatures are unable to meet.  This inability to meet has existed from Election Day and continues through various congressionally set deadlines for the appointment of presidential electors and the counting of presidential elector votes.  The state legislatures of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona are unable to review the manner in which the election was conducted.  are prevented from exercising their investigative powers and are unable to vote, debate, or as a body speak to the conduct of the election.  In sum, state legislatures are impotent to respond to what happened in the November 3, 2020  election.\".  So the lawsuit recommends that those laws preventing legislatures from meeting be declared unconstitutional.  It also seeks to ensure that the vice president and Congress do not count presidential elector votes from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  Yep, that's a weird bomb.  But there's a weirder weird bomb coming up next.  Republican lawmakers are suing Vice President Pence.  What?  What is happening?  Well, you see, the Vice President has a very important role to play during an election.  The Electoral Count Act of 1887 requires the Vice President to affirm the winner of the elections.  Vice President Joe Biden had to do that for Trump back in January 2017.  He looks absolutely thrilled.  And just after, you can see Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, who was Speaker of the House, in the back laughing.  But in 2021, it may be Joe Biden who gets the last laugh.  Or possibly President Harris.  Anyway, on January 6, 2021, it will be Vice President Mike Pence in that spot.  And this is where it ties back to the dueling electors.  Would Congress actually treat those Republican electors as legitimate?  I'll get to that after the break.  Welcome back.  The Republican Party in some states has selected an alternate set of electors\u2014electors who would vote for Trump instead of Biden when Congress meets on January 6th.  But would Congress treat them as legitimate?  Well, all it takes is a single person in the House of Representatives and a single member of the Senate to challenge the official electors.  Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has been saying, don't do it!  But dozens of House Republicans have said they will.  And as of this recording, at least one Republican Senator, Josh Hawley, from Missouri, has said he will object as well.  Hawley points out that Democrats have objected to the Electoral College certification before.  Like back in January 2005, after W. Bush was re-elected.  in January 2017 after Trump was elected.  At that time in 2017, members of the House of Representatives objected to the electoral tally in states including Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Mississippi, and the Carolinas.  Some members complained about long lines of polling stations, while others cited concerns over Russian attempts to influence the result in Trump's favor.  But then-Vice President Joe Biden overruled those objections, and at one point said that the election was over.  That's what Paul Ryan and other Republicans were laughing about in this picture.  But one key difference is that in 2005 and 2017, no senators objected.  So that's where it ended.  But now, coming into January 2021, there will probably be objections in both the House and the Senate.  So what happens next?  Well, according to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, both the House and the Senate would separately vote on the objections.  I think we know how the Democrat-led House would go.  And many Republican senators have also said they wouldn't support an elector challenge.  So the Senate might not have enough votes to do anything either.  But the lawsuit from Texas Representative Louie Gohmert says it should be Vice President Mike Pence who decides.  According to the lawsuit, under the 12th Amendment, Defendant Pence alone has the exclusive authority and sole discretion to open and permit the counting of the electoral votes for a given state, and where there are competing slates of electors, or where there is objection to any single slate of electors, to determine which electors' votes or whether none shall be counted.  Yes, the plaintiffs are suing Mike Pence in order to give him the power to decide which votes to count.  I told you it was a weirder weird bomb.  The lawsuit argues the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional, in part because it takes away that power from the vice president.  And FYI, the lawsuit comes before Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee to the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  And if the lawsuit is successful, and Pence gets to make the final call about which electors to approve, who do you think he'd pick?  Well, it's actually not so clear.  It would be a very interesting problem for him.  Would Pence help elect Trump\u2014and by extension himself\u2014for four more years, but risk alienating mainstream politicians and the media?  Or would he facilitate Biden taking office, with hopes that this concession would give him the mainstream support he'd need to run for president himself in a few years, but also risk alienating tens of millions of Trump supporters?  I'm gonna go with, doesn't anyone care about whether there was voter fraud anymore?  Politics are terrible.  Of course, it probably won't come to that.  Because even in conservative circles, most people expect the lawsuit will fail.  But if we've learned anything this year, it's that anything is possible.  And with that, I put an end to the final episode of 2020.  2021 is shaping up to be a whole lot more of the same.  Oh my gosh, I need a vacation.  A time machine and then a vacation.
