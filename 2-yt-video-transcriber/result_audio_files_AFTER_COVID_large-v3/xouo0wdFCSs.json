            "text": "Shalom.  Shalom.  Shalom.  Shalom.  Shalom.  What you're looking at are images of Gadites, Native American Indians, that we've been telling you all along that they're the same people as we are, all right?  All right, that we're all the same people, I being of the lineage of one of the native, so-called native tribes, and that we were referred to as copper-colored people.  In 1681, when the so-called white man labeled himself white for the first time in history, in legal documents.  Because, you know, someone put up some information that they may have quoted the term prior to that.  But the first time legally in documentation, in paperwork, it appeared in 1681 in Virginia.  All right.  In 1681 here in America.  Well, in 1683 in America, the so-called Negro and the so-called Native American were called the same people.  They were both called niggers.  They were called tree niggers.  And they were referred to as copper colored people.  All right.  And that they were of the same lineage, that tawny lineage.  All right.  And by the way, these are video, these images are from, uh, very diligent brother, uh, Cootie Merrill, who, uh, who puts up, you know, these, uh, these historical pieces that go into evidences like this.  You know, he was the one that clarified the, the, the Huguenot history for me, uh, You know, because I had seen that word, read it, but I never knew that the Huguenots were, you know, were the Israelites, were the Moriscos, the Morenos, and the secret Jews, the Sephetic Jews that they're left out of, out of, well, I can't say it right now.  Portugal and Spain at the fall of when the Moors fell, you know, and then the secret Jews went into captivity.  But nevertheless, I'm saying it all is to say this, that Esau Edom, the so-called white man, is a complete and total liar and cannot be trusted, all right?  No one knows where Nurse Dover is, Tiffany Dover is right now, all right?  Millions of people by now have probably seen the images that Nurse Mitchell put up from Tennessee of how one side of her face, the left side of her face went completely and totally numb.  All right.  And from from taking the, you know, that jab.  And the other woman collapsed and then they came up with all these excuses as to, you know.  And so, you know, there's a whole big question marks behind it, but they're saying that, you know, this particular thing is safe, but the evidence is showing otherwise.  And then they'll show officials, you know, take it and, but for all we know, they're getting a shot of vitamin B12.  There's no way to confirm that, you know.  But you can confirm this, now that all these images have surfaced and color of these natives, all right?  Of these so-called natives, okay?  And they indeed were dark flesh.  Now the ones you see now are the remnant of the mixture and or Edomites posing.  Because what you have to understand that a lot of these eagles, You know, they went and paid money.  That's where you get that $5 Indian nickel head from.  They paid $5 to get on the list for benefits and came up with the whole blood quantum thing.  And, you know, and they claim their lineage through their mothers.  All right.  and they claim to be part this and part that and that made them available for different loans and school and properties and checks and payments, you know, that whole sort of thing.  But we keep telling you that these people are liars and be found to be liars and basically I did all that.  Let me grab a scripture, man.  I believe it's Deuteronomy 32 and 29, if I'm not mistaken.  It's become one of my favorite scriptures.  I believe it's 32 and 29.  Nope, that's not it.  Let's find it.  It's 33 and 29, so lock you, all right?  And it reads, happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee.  And you're looking at Israelites right now.  All right?  A lot of you, and just so you know, most of the Gadites and the Reubenites that looked more Negro, more Negro featured, like these ones, especially the chief in the middle.  were reclassified as Negro by the census enumerators.  All right?  So just take this.  So literally millions of so-called Negroes are actually native.  Millions.  Okay?  But anyway, this is Deuteronomy 33 and 29.  Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee, O people saved by Jehovah, the shield of thy help.  who is the sword of thy excellency.  So just saw an image before I turned this on of a Jake getting that Q-tip jammed up his nose, running to Egypt for help, not trusting in the Lord.  It says right here, O people saved by Yehowah, the shield of thy help.  You have to trust in Yehowah.  144%, all right?  And even when you're suffering and in pain, you praise his name anyway.  I do.  There's no plan B. That's it.  Plan B is go see plan A. Call on the name of Yahweh while Yahweh's shy.  That's it.  It said, Who is the sword of thy excellency?  And thy enemy shall be found liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places.  And man are we.  And I said all that to say this.  Yesterday during the live show, I'm subscribed to law enforcement today.  And so, you know, I get these alerts, these news alerts.  And I was alerted that in Rockford, Illinois, there was a shooting at a bowling alley where three people were shot and three other people were injured or something like that.  And then it said the male suspect was in custody.  The male suspect.  So I was like, and I looked at it and I kind of, and Yaki was sitting in my right-hand side like usually he does in the live shows.  So I leaned over to Yaki and showed him and then pointed out the male.  And I said, that's an Edomite.  This is an Edomite because you have to understand when it comes to the news and media, the Edomite male has to always be made to look like the upstanding citizen.  No matter what the circumstances.  Now, I guarantee you that they're going to use distraction methods.  There will be another story, another happening.  Something's going to happen in the next two, three days or within the next week.  That's usually all it takes to drown this story out like it never happened.  And they just simply won't talk about it or bring it up again.  All right.  But because his name is.  Is.  What is his name?  Duke Webb.  You can't get more Edomite than that.  Duke Webb charged in Illinois' bullet alley rampage that killed three.  And he's in the military.  So, you know, they have to protect this man to the very last minute.  This is on U.S.  Today.  That's where this story is coming from.  Kevin Haas, Chris Green and John Bacon.  Rockford Register Star, all right, actually.  And then the U.S.  Today is also profiling the story.  You know how it's flashing across the same story.  But it says Rockford, Illinois, an Army sergeant based in Florida, was charged with the murder after shooting rampaged the Bowling Alley complex.  that left three people dead and three wounded, authorities said Sunday.  Duke Webb, 37, was held in Winnebago County Jail without bond on three counts each of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder and Saturday's attack.  His first court appearance was set for Monday.  We believe this was a completely random act.  Of course, Police Chief Dan O'Shea said Sunday there was no prior meeting or any kind of relationship between the subject or any of the victims.  And then, watch how they go to try to cover it up.  The tragedy add to the deadliest year on record for this city of 150,000 people, 90 miles west of Chicago.  all right.  Saturday's killing marked 35 homicides this year and in the most of any year records dating to back back to 1935 and the next highest total was 31 recorded in 1996. all right because Rockford is a is a mixed you know town but it's still probably more Edom.  I said that it is Jake but nevertheless They had to add Chicago in there because they're already trying to drown out the truth, to drown out the story.  Just like they drowned out, you know, because I haven't watched this video with Cootie Merrill yet, but I'm going to.  You know, I usually watch, you know, I watch some of his videos.  be long, but the brother goes into heavy, heavy detail in his videos.  And then you don't really get to the meat of his videos until you did in the middle or to the end of it.  You know, because he comes with that proof, man.  You know, you got to give it to the brother.  The brother is diligent when it comes to, you know, going into the history about Jacob, man.  About the so-called Negro and the so-called natives of the Americas.  All right.  And connecting the two and that they are the same people and that they are indeed Israelites.  He goes into the history very heavily, you know.  But it's just to go to show you, man, that you cannot trust this man.  You can't trust it at all.  I have a Iskarite relative, all right, who's just been diagnosed with, you know, with the Corona stuff, you know.  I messed up and said the word.  I should have said the Crown Royal 19 is more likely because I said Corona stuff.  Actually, I didn't say it.  I guess I'm still good.  but she was diagnosed with the Crown Royal one nine, but she has no symptoms, no whatsoever.  She's not sick, she doesn't feel bad, you know?  So that, you know, like I said, that's a very suspect thing.  Cause if you have the flu, you feel like you have the flu.  So how can you be sick with something and have no symptoms whatsoever?  You know, that's very suspect.  You know, sounds like a bio bio thing to me.  But you know what?  Let me get one more scripture minute and just close this out because everybody's, you know, had it up to.  You know what?  You know what?  Leave the second address.  that I'm looking for.  Selachia.  It's definitely in Ezra's.  Could be the 12th chapter too.  Because I'm in 13.  Could be the 12th chapter that I'm looking for.  Well, you know what?  What I will do is go to the 6th chapter and get that real quick.  Because here we are.  This is 2 Ezra 6 and 27.  And it reads, For evil shall be put out and deceit shall be quenched.  As for faith, it shall flourish.  Corruption shall be overcome.  And the truth... which have been so long without fruit, shall be declared.  So, so many lies, so many trees of lies have bared fruit.  And now, finally, those trees are dying.  That fruit is unsavory, undesired.  And those trees are dying and the fruit is falling to the ground and withering away.  And the truth is manifest.  You finally got the fruit growing.  that's true, man.  And it's very harmful and hateful.  Truth is very hateful to the eagles, man.  But it's bothering me that I can't find this scripture, man, that I'm thinking of.  Kind of pissing me off.  Let me ask you this a lot.  Yep, just found it.  It's an 11.  I was searching for it in 12 and 13.  It's an 11 because I was using my app.  So I had to go actually get the book.  And this is 2nd Ezra 11.  And I'm gonna start at verse 37.  And it reads, and I beheld and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood.  And I saw that he sent out a man's voice unto the eagle and said, Here thou I will talk with thee, and thou higher shall come, and the higher shall come shall say unto thee, Are thou not it that remainest of the four beasts whom I made to reign in the world, that the end of their times might come through them?  And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and have power over the world with great fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression and so long time dwelt he upon earth with deceit, with lies, ruling.  All right, just like he telling you these people right here, that they were not Israelites and then showing you these pale people, you know, that are not the Gadites.  Or all these Negroes, all these Gaddacks that were labeled as Negroes, and then their Gaddack heritage, their so-called native heritage, stripped away from them.  All right?  Because you best believe the ones that run and own those casinos, those are Edomites, man, for the most part, with complete and total sellouts.  Because the ones on the reservation, man, hey, the reservations are worse than the projects.  All right.  Reservations make the projects look like a vacation.  All right.  And so Esau Edom has ruled with deceit, man.  And that's coming to an end.  Matter of fact, let me grab one more thing.  This is a meme.  But it's heavy, man.  And it says, how can you tell the truth is being told?  Well, when Facebook blocks it, Twitter deletes it, Google hides it, YouTube bans it because it violates community guidelines, the media censors it, and your government forbids it.  That's when you know the truth is being told.  Quam Yasharallah. ",
