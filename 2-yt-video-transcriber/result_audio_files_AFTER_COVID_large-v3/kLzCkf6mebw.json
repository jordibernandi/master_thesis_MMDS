It's racist for you to feel the need to come here and say you're not racist.  That's racist.  I'm here in Innisfail today where a protest is planned, a Black Lives Matter protest backed by Antifa as they tend to be across North America.  The community here in Innisfail is anxious, they're concerned and they're worried that one, violence could break out as it tends to do.  In Edmonton they smashed the window of a cop car, left graffiti everywhere.  Some businesses, just on the drive in here, we've seen that their windows are all shuttered.  They have no idea how to respond to this because it's bullying at the end of the day.  These folks are coming in from large cities to tell the people of Innisfil that they are racist.  That's obviously not true.  I've spoken with the minority groups here in Innisfil and they've told me that they love it here.  The people are the nicest people that they've ever met and they've never once experienced racism.  But that's not going to stop.  the radicals with Black Lives Matter to come into this community to intimidate them and try to re-educate them.  So the people here in Innisfil are concerned, one, of violence, but two, the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.  They've done a pretty good job at keeping central Alberta clean from viral infections.  And they're worried that this protest, full of young people who have been mingling at other protests across Alberta, are going to bring it into this community, which is largely senior.  this could impact the lives of the people here in innisfil.  if an old person over the age of 85 got this infection their chance of survival is not near as high as these selfish youth who are protesting for pretty much no reason.  we're going to see if they can actually come up with a reason for why they're protesting if they have an example of actual racism here in innisfil like they say it's just.  it's just riddled with racism here in innisfil.  so we're going to actually go see if they have any examples of that happening.  You're coming to speak at the protest.  Why is it important to have this protest here in Innisfil? ",

And a lot of the time, everybody knows by now.  If you have a contrary opinion to the left wing, then you're silenced.  You're removed from Facebook.  You try to report anybody for their violence on the other side, and nothing gets done about that.  There's a clear worldwide agenda going on here that involves media and governments on left-wing governments all around the world.  Every UN country, it's all the exact same politics that are going on in the world right now.  It's hard to even say what's going on, but things certainly aren't getting better, that's for sure.  I don't think that tribalizing people helps.  The more groups that have been coming out over the last few years, the more problems there's been.
