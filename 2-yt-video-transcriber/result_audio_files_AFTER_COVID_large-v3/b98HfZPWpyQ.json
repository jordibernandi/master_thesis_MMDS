            "text": "For much of Marx's first volume of Capital, we are faced with an analysis of the individual capital.  Marx concerns himself with the singular enterprise, though we learn later on that he does this for ease of demonstration.  He establishes in Volume 2 the necessity of moving past this perspective and treating the individual capital, that is, the sole enterprise, in the context of the total social capital.  In fact, the most notable difference between Volume 1 and Volume 2 is precisely a change in scope.  Marx focuses on capitalism as a mode of production, an entire system that reproduces itself.  This shift in perspective is crucial because it takes us out of the sphere of production and forces us to consider circulation as well.  After spending a considerable amount of time outlining this dialectical relationship, Marx arrives at the question of reproduction.  How does the system as a whole actually reproduce itself, and what implications do the mechanisms of reproduction have on the development of the system?  In this video, we will consider precisely this point.  To begin with, Marx identifies two departments in the capitalist economy.  Department one encompasses those enterprises whose products are means of production.  This department therefore includes businesses that process raw materials, build machinery and tools, and manufacture any other elements of the production process that we would classify as constant capital.  Department 2 includes all the enterprises that produce means of consumption.  These include goods workers and capitalists consume for subsistence, as well as luxury items.  The total annual product in each department can be expressed as such.  This is nothing more than saying that every commodity that is produced contains within it the constant capital and labor needed to produce it.  The value imparted by labor into the commodity, as we already know, consists of variable capital and surplus value.  In short, all the commodities produced in one department in any given year must equal in value to the total constant capital consumed, the total variable capital expended, and the total new value, surplus value, added by the laborers.  if there is no technical change and if the capitalists spend all their surplus value on consumption and merely repeat the previous pattern of production the economy can reproduce itself at the same level of activity what marx calls simple reproduction.  this implies a certain balance between the values produced by the two departments.  If the value of the output of department 1 is C1 plus V1 plus S1, and the sales of means of production is C1 plus C2, we get the following equation.  The left-hand side indicates the total output of department 1, the department that produces means of production.  The right-hand side is the sales department 1 makes, which, for the time being, we assume to be equal in value to the final product.  C2 represents the constant capital of department 2, while C1 represents the constant capital of department 1.  For department 2, similarly, the equality of values of output and values of sales of means of consumption gives... Remember that Department 2 produces means of consumption, which are meant to reproduce labor.  We know that in its application, labor produces both V, variable capital, and S, surplus value.  Since Department 2 produces the means of consumption for all labor, it follows that its sales should amount to all variable capital and surplus value in both departments.  If we look at the equations for both Department 1 and Department 2, we notice that both can actually be reduced to the following expression.  has Marx's famous equation for balance between the two departments in simple reproduction.  Remember that for the department 1 equation, the constant capital of department 1 reproduces its own value and hence is cancelled out when we balance the equation.  Conversely, in department 2, labor reproduces itself since department 2 produces the means of subsistence that labor needs to continue to function, hence why the variable capital and surplus value cancel out on both sides.  Whereas department 1 in effect reproduces its own constant capital, department 2 reproduces its own variable capital via means of consumption.  Either way, we are left with the reduced form of both equations.  This diagram puts the whole interdepartmental cycle into perspective.  There are a few areas worth elaborating on here.  The yellow arrows indicate workers and capitalists buying consumption goods from Department 2.  Remember that in simple reproduction, we assume that all surplus is used by capitalists to buy consumption goods and nothing is left over to expand the enterprise.  The red arrow indicates the total output of Department 2, which we know to be C2 plus V2 plus S2.  We know that the output of Department 2 should, in simple reproduction, equal the wages spent from both of the departments on consumption, as well as the surplus spent by capitalists from both departments on consumption.  The same is seen with the product of Department 1.  The left-hand side of our equation for Department 1 is represented in the red arrow, while the right-hand side is represented in the yellow arrows.  Capitalists from Department 1 and 2 acquire their means of production from the product of Department 1. the product of department 1 is turned into money, which splits into surplus value, constant capital, and variable capital, with the latter two repeating their paths indefinitely.  Another element clearly demonstrated in this diagram is the distinction between production and exchange spheres.  we've already considered the differences in the various circuits of capital.  We can see how production in both departments interrupts the various paths of circulation, but is at the same time necessary for their very existence.  The reverse could be said for circulation, which interrupts production but is a necessary prerequisite for the existence of capitalist production.  Simple reproduction may be conceptually important to wrap our heads around, but capitalist production, in Marx's understanding, cannot be stagnant indefinitely.  Sure, there can be periods of non-growth and even periods of contraction, but capital by its very definition seeks to expand itself.  For this reason, expanded reproduction is the more complete model of the capitalist mode of production.  Marx first notes that expanded reproduction requires what he calls hoards.  Hoards are accumulated and temporarily stagnant capital, which are set aside by a capitalist to be invested at a later point in time.  Marx contends that there is a minimum investment amount that a capitalist needs in order to actually expand the enterprise.  This may be the base cost of a machine and the extra workers needed to utilize it.  Whatever the minimum may be, it often requires the capitalist to set aside some surplus and allow it to build into a hoard before it can be reinvested to expand production.  Hoards almost always manifest themselves in the money form, since it is the most fungible and mobile form of capital.  The necessity of hoard formation requires the withdrawal of money from circulation.  The capitalist needs to form these money hoards in order to continue the enterprise, but this process requires rendering portions of capital temporarily immutable, which in itself creates a precarious situation.  Hoard formation requires what Marx calls repeated unilateral transactions, in which, for example, capitalist A1 sells commodities to capitalist B2 without buying commodities from capitalist B. In past examples, Marx demonstrated how the flow of capital was more or less reciprocated between departments and between individual capitals.  For example, where there was a purchase, there was a reciprocal sale, in such a manner that money capital would eventually flow back to its source.  But in order to form hoards, a capitalist has to disrupt this cyclical flow.  Naturally, this disruption creates ripple effects through the whole system that, when left unaddressed, could cause problems.  In general, these unilateral transactions mean that at least one party involved is missing out on the normal flow of capital.  Individual capitals engaging in hoard formation are necessarily keeping capital out of circulation, and they must do so to reproduce their own enterprises.  Money that capitalist A1 puts away for the hoard is money that won't be spent on commodities from B2, which likewise now remain in a hoard.  This argument is incredibly important as it demonstrates an inherent contradiction in the capitalist mode of production.  Capital needs to expand.  In order to do so, it must disengage, even for the briefest of moments, a portion of itself to accumulate a necessary minimum for reinvestment.  But every moment where this occurs, the balance between two departments is thrown off.  In other words, for expansion to occur, one department must overproduce.  Returning to our equation, expanded reproduction can be expressed as such.  We know that the quantity of the means of production of the next period must exceed the current period.  The next output, by definition, has to be larger than the current output.  As we've already seen, this reduces in the following manner.  What we see in Marx's reproduction models is a system that rests both on balance and continual disequilibrium.  The erratic dynamism of the capitalist mode of production and its natural tendency to overproduce is precisely why the so-called boom-and-bust cycle is an inescapable reality.  Crises are a necessary outcome of the way capital expands.  Despite being an immensely powerful economic system, capitalism is perennially prone to repeated collapse.  It goes without saying that while capital recovers from its crashes, many of the people who are dragged into the freefall do not.  We'll leave our discussion of reproduction here.
