So what we did is we put out a post.  I said to people that we were going to interview you today.  So, I've got some Blacksit questions.  These aren't questions from me, but these are questions from Blacksit subscribers who are championing the cause for you.  Usman Ture.  Usman Ture.  Usman Ture.  Okay?

            "text": "Yeah, thank you very much.  And the issue is that when we look into what is going on in Rwanda, it's actually a miracle and something that is uniquely Rwandese.  In a sense that they came from a genocide back in 1994, the country was at zero.  They were able to set a pattern of development that is today uniquely theirs and everybody in Africa today celebrates Rwanda.  for that wonderful model of development.  So if African countries also want to move, they need to look into things that are uniquely theirs.  Decisions and policies, laws that are well informed by the African reality.  And that is exactly what is going on in Rwanda.  Once we can have this in all over Africa, because you know, what is going on now is what we need.  The Gambia today needs a transformation.  a transformation in which it is going to be well informed by the realities of the Gambian continent, by the Gambia.  So making it possible that we inform our colleges, we inform those in charge of steering our own affairs with the reality of the African continent.  And that is why Rwanda is making it there.  Let me say this, development always have to come from within.  You don't import development.  You don't expect individuals who don't live in Africa, who don't belong to the African continent to bring the development that we desire.  It has to be initiated by us and it has to be developed by us.  And that is what I saw in Rwanda.  And I also want to see the same thing going on in countries like Senegal, going on in countries like the Gambia, in countries like Sierra Leone.  Seeing it in Liberia, in Malawi, everywhere in the continent.  making sure that we can get to the development that we desire, channeling this economic growth that we talk about, channeling the numbers that we talk about in the financial sector, talking about the GDP every now and then.  We want to see this in the human development.  we want to see this in both infrastructure and also making it possible for the individual to realize this seeing that happiness in the african individual.  so to do that we need to understand what really works for us and not to borrow policies that are on eurocentric views.

            "text": "Yes.  Now, why, in fact, if you look at Rwanda, for instance, the Gambia have been taking policies from all over the world and it never worked for them.  The problem is we find it difficult as African countries to try something within.  And that is seeing what works in various African countries and then bringing it out there for other African countries to give a shot.  Many countries around the world today are excelling, they are doing extremely well, and their inspiration is something that they got from the pioneers of the real African pan-Africanism and the real African model.  So if Singapore is doing it out there, if China is doing it out there, back in 1965, they have the same economic growth with countries in Africa.  So what do they got right and what did we get wrong?  Those are some of the fundamental questions that we have to pose.  So it can work in the Gambia of course, because looking at the realities in Rwanda, looking at the status of that particular country, the way in which the transformation was done.  That is exactly what the Gambia needs today.  How do we make sure that we have a development agenda that is well informed by Gambians, going back to look into the agricultural sector in the Gambia?  We can do it.  Studies have shown that in Jahali Pacha and Sapo irrigation alone, from growth, Like from the farming itself to the factory can employ around one million people.  We do not have one million people in need of job today in The Gambia.  So why can't we try things that work for us?  The agricultural sector is there.  Our fishing industry is here.  Why should we just allow it to be in the hands of individuals who doesn't actually are here for the interest of the African continent?  That is exactly what we are saying.  Let us read what work for us.  Let us understand the real African system, and then set a pattern of development that is uniquely ours, as Rwanda did it. ",

I mean, one of the things that I do admire about what Rwanda has done is that it's completely reinvented itself, you know, from the bottom, if you like, up, you know, because they have been ravaged by war.  And to see what they have now become, regardless of all the other side political issues, I have to look at what it is.  And what I see from when Wodamaya went there is absolutely amazing.  I remember seeing a picture of him.  I watched the video when he actually sat in the drain and was eating food.  That's how clean the place was.  So I think, you know, there's lots for us to learn.  And the fact that the individuals, the members of society got involved in the cleaning of their nation, got involved in the decision making of their nation and was involved in For example, repealing some of the colonial laws that existed.  You know, I think that these are all progressive norms that need to be encapsulated within the African conversation and narrative moving forward.  So the next question I've got is, how would you like to see Africa in general and the Gambia portrayed? ",

To understand that we have individuals that live within this continent and have a right to enjoy the dignity of man.  And that is to live, to be recognized, and to be accepted wherever they are.  It doesn't matter whether we have a different color with other sets of human beings or not.  We need to be recognized as a nation.  We need to be recognized as a continent.  And that self-dignity, we need to earn it at the international level, starting with the United Nations itself.  Now, how do we do this?  It has to start from within us.  How do we understand one another?  How do we accept one another?  How does tolerance work within our various societies and  etc.?  Who are those that we accept to move with?  Who are those that are in line with the same agendas?  Who are those in line with the same spirit?  Who are those that hold to the civilization and the culture of the African continent?  That is exactly what we need to see.  And that is the kind of picture that I would want to see the Gambia and Africa being portrayed.  A civilized continent, a continent that is set for growth, a continent that is set for development, and a continent that has all opportunities to be where it is supposed to be so.  but for this to be attained we need to understand that we need to set things at our own hands.  we need to take our own responsibilities.  it doesn't matter whether the people live in africa here or not because to me what matters is not living in africa but africa living in you.  so whether you are in africa or you're living in the diaspora as long as you are an african descent you must look inward.  how do you make sure that you can invest in the continent with the little that you have in the West.  Before you die and then the system takes everything from you.  Why not invest in Africa?  Create a little employment.  You die and then your legacy continues.  But you don't have that.  So these are the kind of values that we need to understand.  They will have to be within a period of two years and then understanding the reality on the ground Learning about the culture on the ground, learning about that society in which we are, etc.  It is going to make it much easier because that is going to enable individuals to come in and invest.  And it is also going to enable individuals to come in and then to understand more about the African value and the African culture.  So once we have this opportunity, it is going to be much more easier for us to call on people to come and invest.  Because that is why we are calling on people.  Because as long as we do not invest in the continent by Africans, it's still going to be another threat.  Because capital flight is a reality and it goes on every day.  So for us to defeat that, we must control the core of our economy.  And to control that, we need individuals to come in and invest.  And those individuals have to be Africans, of course. ",
