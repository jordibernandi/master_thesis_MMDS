            "text": "Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premier source for Second Amendment news.  I hope your Sunday has been fantastic.  Just wanted to bring a little bit of good news to you.  Hopefully it makes the rest of your evening.  I wanted to talk about the ammo shortage and how there, at least in one scenario I'm about to talk about, there's a little bit of good news.  There's some light maybe coming over the horizon.  So first off, I get a lot of people who ask me, hey, Jared, what do you think about the ammo shortage?  Well, this is a multifaceted issue.  First off, you have to factor in COVID-19, right?  It sent a lot of people into panic mode.  And if you follow along with not just my channel, but all the other ones, you'll know that there are in excess of 5 million new gun owners since the pandemic has hit, which is a great thing for gun rights, hopefully, as long as they all vote.  accordingly and stop voting for gun control.  But for each new gun owner, they're going to buy ammo as well, right?  So COVID-19 brought a lot of new gun owners into the fray, which would purchase more ammo.  Also, COVID-19 caused a large shutdown in China and in America in places that handle or manufacture or process raw materials.  A lot of the raw materials in the firearms A lot of the raw materials in the ammunition industry come from overseas.  And they were not able to work on their end and create them.  We stopped stuff from being imported for quite some time.  And then once stuff got here in America, several states were shut down for several months.  And a lot of those included the states where these ammunition companies are.  So you had a complete disruption of the supply chain.  You had an increase in demand with all these new gun owners.  Also, you have to factor in this is an election year.  And every four years, there is a run on guns and ammo because of that factor where people aren't sure which way it's going to swing.  So that had a lot to do with the increase in gun sales as well as ammunition.  The NSSF, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, they're the ones who handle all the gun sale stats and the NYX check stats.  And in the first six months of 2020, they saw a 95% increase in the firearms that were purchased when they looked back at the same year, same period of time in 2019.  So almost double the amount of firearms sold in the first six months compared to last year.  If you look at this year, you take into effect the new purchasers because of COVID, the shutdown, which is the complete interruption in the supply chain, and the election year facet, and also the fact that civil unrest started.  Looting, burning, killings, stuff like that.  People bought even more.  So you put that into the fray.  NSSF says that in the same period, the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019, there was a 139% increase in the amount of ammunition sold.  So as you can see, there is a lot of ammunition being bought up.  You still have the people who buy everything they can just because they think that they need every round of ammunition.  And I am one of those people who want every round that I can have.  And I always want more, just like most people, right?  You see that the way the country's going, especially with the elections coming, you never know if you're going to need ammunition for any reason or if there are going to be complete bans put in by an incoming regime.  Now let's talk about that sign.  I talked about where we could be you know, on the back nine here.  We could be over the crest, over the hump where good things are gonna start happening.  Ammo Incorporated, they're based out of Scottsdale, Arizona.  Now, while this is going to be some good news, they are facing an $80.1 million back order in ammunition sales.  That's a lot.  Now, while that is going to take a while for them to catch up, not just them, but every ammunition company, the good part is that they have announced that they're running 24-7, seven days a week, and they have purchased almost $3 million in new equipment to increase the amount of ammunition they can manufacture.  Now, if you look at it in a business standpoint, for a business, for any company to actually make that sizable investment, then they must feel that they're going to be able to have increased raw materials in this instance, right?  Nobody would spend an extra $3 million in equipment if their ability to make more product is still reduced.  So hopefully this means that the The backlog on raw materials has started to dissipate, and at least one ammunition company that I'm aware of, and there might be more, but I don't know.  I don't get to talk to all of them.  I'm not that cool.  Now, a lot of that is to get their $80.1 million back order set up, because if I'm a major purchaser, say I... insert agency here.  Say I run a company called Jared Water and I need 200 million rounds of ammunition.  and here's my order and it's going to cost 50 million bucks or whatever.  I'm not going to wait forever before you lose that bid and I'm going to go to the next company.  So that's a great part of it.  Let's not throw smoke or anything.  That's a great part of it.  But the fact that they can do that is good news.  So the big issue seems to be now, at least if they have raw materials coming in now, now it just seems to have.  the supply versus demand issue is the only issue, not the actual raw materials, hopefully.  So if the places that make ammunition can ramp up supply, and maybe we have the election go the right way in November, we see that crazy rush on ammo start to dissipate and things can start to get somewhat back to normal.  The conservative guesstimates that I've seen are springtime 2021 before you start to see ammo back on the shelves in a somewhat normal manner.  Some people are even saying summer or later.  I hope not.  I hope not.  But we'll see.  What do you think about this?  I'd love to see your comments down below.  Maybe you have more information.  you'd like to let everybody know.
