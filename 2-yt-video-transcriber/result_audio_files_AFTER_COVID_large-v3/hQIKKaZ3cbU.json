I want everybody to bow your heads because we lost somebody very special in the black community.  That person is T-Dawg from the Walking Dead TV show.  They finally killed T-Dog's ass on The Walking Dead.  Everybody bow your heads.  We gotta pay homage and respect to the world's biggest token nigga.  This was the world's biggest pet nigga.  We knew he was gonna die.  I'm surprised the nigga last that long, especially in a horror film.  This is the longest lasting nigga in a horror film.  He lasts three seasons.  They got his ass finally.  Oh, we're going to miss you, T-Dawg.  Every week we're going to miss you bucking your eyes, running around doing all that nigga shit that you just loved for.  Oh, we're going to miss you walking around not having any lines saying two or three words per episode.  Oh, we're going to miss you, T-Dawg.  Head looks like a big black jelly bean.  You token nigga, we're going to miss you.  Hopefully they don't replace you with no more token niggas.  We don't need no more token niggas.  Shout out to T-Dawg, the only nigga with the world's oldest nickname, T-Dawg.  Sound like some shit from the Sugar Hill Gang.  We gonna miss you, T-Dawg.  Oh, the world cries, T-Dawg.  The world cries for you, nigga.  The world cries.  Anyway, all right.  All right, I digress. ",
