But should religion be more entwined with all aspects of our society?  And is it the role of faith groups to help us recover from the pandemic?  Joining us to discuss the subject are journalist Shaista Aziz, Catholic priest, Father Jed Murphy, Director of the religious think tank, Theos, Elizabeth Oldfield, and President of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, Andrew Copson.  Welcome, all of you.  Thank you for joining us.  So, Elizabeth, do you think that Danny Kruger is right?  Are we faith-phobic?  Are we pushing religion out of public life?  Or are people right to worry about increasing the role of faith groups in our increasingly secular society? ",

You know, churchgoing is no longer the default.  It just makes it more likely that people won't know any religious people.  So they might not understand what they believe.  And they're just receiving media messages, perhaps, rather than actually being able to encounter people in relationships.  And part of the same problem is religious people maybe feel a bit less confident.  They maybe feel like because they're not so mainstream anymore, they don't know how to explain what they believe and all the amazing work they're doing in their communities.  So there just is a bit of fear and a lack of understanding.  What we're seeing up and down the country in up to 100 different case studies that we've been going to in the last few years doing research is actually when people partner together across these differences, which are really normal in a plural society, they're doing amazing work.  So faith communities, working with local councils, working with other charities, working with schools, you know, tackling holiday hunger, tackling debt and joblessness, as well as food banks, which we all know about.  So I just think... more understanding, more willingness to partner that we're already seeing can only be a good thing. ",

I think people are very compassionate and they do want to reach out to their neighbours and to members of their communities.  But my concern about this report is that over the last 10 years, austerity has decimated public services.  And I don't think that the government should expect volunteers, be they people of faith or people of no faith, to step in and plug those gaps.  That's a very different situation to people wanting to extend the hand of friendship and charity to their communities and to the people around them. ",

But I understand the point you're making.  Many service users do like to feel that they are being, that they're the beneficiaries of people's voluntary help.  Equally, many service users, as one of your previous questions pointed out, don't want to feel that they're the receipts of charity and would rather feel that they're in receipt of a service to which they're entitled as a citizen, just like the service provider on the basis of equal dignity.  But the second part of your question in terms of what religious people provide, it's certainly true that religious organizations are an important part of the civil society in this country.  They're not a major part of the voluntary community sector.  Two thirds of our voluntary community sector is secular.  There are organizations where people of different religions, beliefs work together, but they are an important part.  And of course, they provide good services.  And I don't think, however, they should be brought in.  as part of the state to provide those services.  I think that's when the risk of various different harms comes into play.  And this isn't a particularly new question.  Religious organisations have been taking on public service contracts in increasing numbers for the last 15 years.  And when beneficiaries of those services come to us, or employees of those organisations that have been taken over come to us, they're presenting a much darker side of this situation than the positive one that you've heard.  It's about discrimination in employment, people being contracted over to Christian organisations, then losing their jobs because they're not religious enough.  It's about people who are taking welfare-to-work services, turning up, to have the course provided and finding that instead of being provided by the state provider, it's being provided by a religious provider.  They're suffering homophobia.  They're suffering worship that makes them uncomfortable, as we've heard.  So there's a much darker side to that.  It's much better, I think, if the state keeps itself plural and diverse and inclusive in secular public services. ",

They have massive assets.  They have convening power.  do have a really strong volunteer base.  they have often long-term vision where they'll stay in a community for decades centuries even.  apart from the funding cycles that charities sometimes have to wrestle with and that government programs sometimes have to wrestle with but they can't do it on their own.  and so it's exactly right to say we have an amazing society we have an amazing country full of people who want to help.  What structural changes do we need to make to liberate them?

And I completely agree that all moves to help anyone in any situation and for the mutual help that we need for a society to move along together is completely welcome.  But the examples that I gave a moment ago of people who suffer harms when religious organizations have public responsibilities extended to them by the state are not theoretical.  I'm not in a position of Elizabeth's research participants who can't think of real examples.  We get real examples like this all the time.  And so, you know, what more can I say than that?  It is a balance.  I think at the moment the balance is in the right direction.  And I find it really difficult to believe that government or state services is somehow allergic to religion.  when we've had, as I said, a growing involvement over the 15 years of religion in our public services.  And our biggest public service, the education system, a third of our state schools, completely state-funded, are controlled by religious groups, which is the largest proportion in Europe.  So I think that very often this argument, oh, the government is faith-phobic, is actually brought out, as it is in Danny Kruger's report, as a sort of straw man to try and... um uh thank you really shore up the privilege of existing groups rather than do anything new.

            "text": "So I see two issues being conflated here.  As I said in my first answer, we need a functioning welfare state that ensures that people have a safety net.  We don't have that at the moment.  It's been destroyed.  We've got record numbers of people homeless, record numbers of people facing food poverty, including children going to school hungry.  This is simply unacceptable.  And so no number of volunteers, be they people of faith or people of no faith, is going to fix that.  So the government needs to take responsibility about that.  The second point about faith.  Now, I am a woman of faith and I'm proud to be a person of faith.  But I also understand that most faiths are interpreted through a patriarchal lens.  And they do also cause harm because of the interpretation of how religion is put out there in society.  So I think we need to be really aware that any help being offered to people has to be independent and it has to be inclusive and it has to address the bigotry that is sadly flourishing in our society.  So I work for a domestic abuse charity and I know many women in particular are locked out of receiving help from faith groups. ",
