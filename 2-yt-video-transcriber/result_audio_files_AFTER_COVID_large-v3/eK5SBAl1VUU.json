            "text": "hey guys this is jerry so it's been a while.  man wow it's been a while and it almost feels weird to make another video on this channel.  but i thought i just wanted to give you guys a little update as to what's going on.  so we all know it's been a crazy year and last year so 2019 i had a little neck injury and it was just ruining my life.  so the main thing i told myself this year you know there's a lot to complain about but I said I had to make my neck stronger.  so that's basically the main goal of 2020 and I achieved it thank goodness.  so my neck's not injured anymore and it's much stronger.  so um because of that I got back into martial arts and I spar once a week and sometimes twice a week but do some boxing and Muay Thai and it's been great, it's been great and there's a lot to complain about in 2020. but I feel so blessed, feel so thankful that I finally fixed this nerd neck problem because I stopped martial arts in high school and college.  I didn't really do martial arts either so I really had a void in me.  and the other thing is when you're Studying so hard on the computer so much you end up in balancing your neck.  So I really when I got back into jiu-jitsu in 2018.  I really shouldn't have done that.  I should have really Trained my neck for a long time kind of balanced it because if your necks imbalance man the heads imbalance you get hit Or you know you fall or whatever and it just it leads to very very higher likelihood of injury.  so This year, I just, you know, it's hard for anyone to exercise without gyms, right?  At least in places that are locked down.  But I do a lot of exercise on the beach, do a lot of exercise in the park.  And then, of course, I'm always doing neck exercises.  So, yeah, it's been crazy.  You know, the thing is, once I get back into martial arts, which I did this year, it kind of... The passions, everything just kind of changed.  And it was always going to happen.  I mean, most of you know, this channel never was the channel that I even thought would get popular.  So if there was one thing to kind of take a break from, it was this channel.  But that being said, though... Making this video actually makes me want to make more videos on this channel.  So here's what I'm going to do.  So there is something that I never introduced on my channel that many other channels have, which is called channel memberships.  So I'm going to do that because that way you guys don't need Patreon.  You guys just can support the channel directly.  And I think it gives me more incentive to make more videos on this channel.  So I'll introduce channel memberships.  And I will very kind of gradually come back to this channel.  Because, again, I have other stuff to do.  But I'm feeling a little fire, man.  I'm serious.  I'm feeling a little fire.  It's weird.  So... Yeah, let's go from here, man.  Thanks for all of you who've been asking where I've been.  As you can tell, I'm okay.  I mean, you know, there's a lot to complain about this year, but I fixed my neck injury and made my neck stronger.  And on top of that, I had an old knee injury that I fixed.  So it's pretty crazy, man.  It's lots of blessings.  So I know a lot of you probably are going through a lot this year too, but Look to something.  Work on one or two things.  Improve on one or two things.  That's what I said.  this year and thank goodness I achieved those two things.  It's a funny life lesson, right?  A lot of times we try to do too much and I think our school system does that every day.  You have like seven, eight subjects, right, that you have to take classes in.  That's not how the brain works.  That's not how the real world works.  You can't improve on seven or eight, nine if you add extracurriculars, ten, you know, Asian people going to Chinese school, Chinese people going to Chinese school.  So anyways, I'm just rambling at this point, but maybe I'll do my future vlogs here.  This is kind of cool.  Alright guys, this was Jerry.  We will talk very soon. ",
