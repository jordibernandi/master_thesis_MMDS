            "text": "The Irish world is changing swiftly and greatly, and as we have, through our negligence, lost our connection to the divine.  That awareness is somehow a power from which all Christians sprang.  The spiritual deal that was the fuel and heart to our gallantry for decades.  To what God do we worship today?  Who do we admire as our spiritual stable?  To what do we allow rule over our lives from the shadows and with consistent control that cripples us to behave and conform to this new ideal of wealth, power, greed, among other self-destructive emotions?  What stepped in to fill this vacuum of spiritual surrender?  What's become the new incentive for the Irish people and for our nation?  What has captured the apparatus of influence and control?  The answer is money.  All pathways of influence have uniformly made its company.  The obscenely wealthy among us have begun to use their weight to push the narrative of mass immigration and the eradication of our borders as a means of insuring a ceased supply of door-cheap labour and the one-world, one-people assault on our tiny nation is well and truly begun.  Almost as subconscious as the effort to breed, people across this nation began to accept the narrative began to accept that narrative and the nationalist was driven to silence for worry of being marched to the gallows and excommunicated from society.  Instead it was found that a method to support these individuals in struggling regions to feed, close, house, educate and provide lasting solutions for them in the communities they've always called home.  A deeply corrupt union of the press and political elites has begun to craft the narrative that the only way to help these people is to import them and to have them live next door to us.  In our oblivious, albeit well-intentioned, charitable instincts, we have watched as well-funded, non-governmental organisations have introduced droves of immigrants with no investigation or evaluation into Ireland.  It's difficult to visualise, however, Ireland's people's altruistic instincts and our national assets have been seized to aid the never-ending demands of the morally corrupt.  Money, power, fame and an overall pursuit of a pure transcendence, a feeling of a my world, I'm God.  The result so far of this large-scale sociological experiment where scores of people seem arrogant to accept has been the soaring crime rates here and collectively to other Western nations.  Are we inherently vicious or have we merely adopted these new traits?  Most historically, rape and sexual assault have skyrocketed across all Western regions where such an experiment is taking place.  Large sections of nations once deemed safe are now off limits to young women and most of the local population.  We've seen an explosion of gang violence, where factions of youths deem themselves above the law and above the common civility of our nation.  To what deity do they worship?  To who do they answer?  Terrorist events have become normalised to the point that we hardly pay attention, or we do.  Perhaps for a short while, a post on social media, it's all to satisfy the interests of oneself, to promote ourselves in a way that we seem to care, but we don't.  We've seen an increased strain on the welfare system, and in particular housing.  As is with uncapped demand and not enough supply, property prices have naturally soared to unobtainable limits at profound economic and social costs to the Irish people, a fact most seem to want to avoid at all costs.  To simply question this you will be liable.  A sense of relation and commonality with one's neighbour has been replaced with restlessness.  The adoration of one's ancestors has been muddled into distortion.  Suicide and drug overdose rates are soaring.  One's glorious and triumphant cities are now littered with the faces of broken people.  Is this what we are?  A broken people whose principles would die on the altar of self-pleasure?  Is this an epithet even?  A recognition that we've squandered our inheritance, that our ancestors so painstakingly fought and died to preserve and protect, was involuntarily discarded through the hijacking of our good nature?  What if the morally corrupt never pushed this modern practice of shuffling human beings between nations as if peace is on a chessboard and we recognise this practice as destructive to the Persian culture and we understand the need for the Irish nation to remain as it once was, the stronghold of resilient people who throughout the ages have triumphed in the face of great adversity.  What if we recognised and understood a nation trying to represent everything all at once ultimately ends up representing nothing at all.  At the end of the day, policies that the government are implementing, I'm not going to name them, just government, typical politicians, not many of the people, have absolutely no interest for their home nation or their own people.
