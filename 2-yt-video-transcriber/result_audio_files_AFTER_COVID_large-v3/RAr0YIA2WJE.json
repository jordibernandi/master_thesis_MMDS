That's what's actually being manipulated.  You can see that Todd is actually pivoting or shifting the foot of the so-called long leg so that the heels match.  Now he's doing this very slowly over time, but it's painfully obvious when you speed up the clip. ",

There's nothing new under the sun.  I'm just amazed that even after it's been exposed so thoroughly that he continues to do it.  But I'm going to give you, Mr.  White, and you, Mr.  Womack, an opportunity to prove me wrong.  I'm calling you both liars.  I'm calling you both charlatans.  I'm going to give you an opportunity to prove me wrong.  Here's my challenge to you.  Mr.  Womack, you claim that you can go up to sick people, even a group of them, and reach out and touch them.  Not only will you not get sick, the virtue that is in you will be transferred out of your body into the sick person and they'll be healed.  Okay, Todd White, you claim that you can command legs to grow.  So if you can, and other maladies, by the way, not just legs growing, you can command other pains and illnesses to leave as well.  YouTube is full of clips of you doing these things.  Here's my challenge.  You proved me wrong.  Here's how you proved me wrong.  Go to St.  Jude.  Go to St.  Jude Children's Research Hospital.  And you go into those hospital rooms and you go up to those precious children who have cancer, some of them dying, and you go up and you touch them.  You can command legs to grow.  You can surely command cancer cells to die.  Go to it.  That's where you ought to be going.  That's the first place.  I'm appalled that you haven't already been there.  but give you the benefit of the doubt.  Let's just say for some unimaginable reason, it hasn't crossed your mind.  You know, I have the ability to heal people.  Maybe I should go heal some sick kids of cancer.  For some unimaginable reason, that thought has not yet crossed your mind.  Well, it has now, because that's my challenge to you.  And I'll make it easy for you.  I even did a little research for you.  There's eight different St.  Jude Children's Research Hospitals around this country.  Here they are.  You could go to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  You could go to Charlotte, North Carolina.  You could go to Huntsville, Alabama.  They have a really neat space center there.  You'll enjoy that trip.  Go to Johnson City, Tennessee.  How about Peoria, Illinois?  Shreveport, Louisiana.  That's where my parents are originally from.  Go to Springfield, Missouri or Tulsa, Oklahoma.  So a lot of different options here.  And you don't have to travel very far, especially you, Mr.  White, because you're in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  They're in Keller, Texas, aren't you?  So you don't have to go very far.  In fact, going to Shreveport, that's just about a three, three and a half hour drive for you.  If traffic's good, you can make it in about three hours.  So hop to it.  Children have cancer.  Some of them are dying.  Tick tock.  Time's a wasting.  Hey, I'll pay for all your travel expenses.  I'll pay for all your gas.  I'll give you a couple of nights stay in a hotel.  Oh, I'll tell you what, I'll put you up for a week in a hotel.  Your choice.  All expenses paid.  Be sure you take your cameraman that follows you around everywhere as you go and lengthen people's legs because this will make for some really good footage.  Andrew Womack and Todd White aren't going to take me up on that offer.  You know why they won't?  Because they know they cannot do what they claim they can do.  They're liars.  They're frauds.  They're charlatans.  And of the worst kind.  Not only do they prey upon the poor, sick, and desperate people, but they bring reproach on the name of Christ.  And their excuse when people aren't healed, oh, it's just their lack of faith.  Their faith, the sick people, their faith isn't as strong, you see, as their faith is.  You think they don't say that?  Oh, they do. ",
