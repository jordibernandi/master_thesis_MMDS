This is back in 2011, and this was from Neera.  Subject line, should Libya pay us back?  Great fucking subject line for an email.  Here's what Neera wrote.  We have a giant deficit.  They have a lot of oil.  Most Americans would choose not to engage in the world because of that deficit.  If we want to continue to engage in the world, gestures like having oil-rich countries pay us back doesn't seem crazy to me.  I'm sorry, do we prefer cuts to Head Start or WIC or Medicaid?  Because we live in deficit politics, and that's what is happening and will be happening even more.  So what I got to say to that email from Neera is... We're going to build the biggest invasion of Libya.  It's going to be beautiful, a fabulous invasion, and we're going to make the Libyans pay for it.  It's going to be classy.  It's going to be wonderful.  They're going to pay us back. ",

Even the fucking British Empire at the height of their debauchery when they were starving millions of Indians to death and laughing about it.  They didn't call that shit engaging with the fucking world.

And what I have to say to that is, look, if you're a woman online, chances are you have to deal with a lot of shit that guys don't, that is at best annoying and at worst frightening.  So I'm not going to deny that.  But what I will deny, or at least what I will say, is I would take... these arguments from these particular people more serious if they just didn't display the utmost cynicism in how they invoke it.  And by that I mean like, it's not just that they dismiss any criticism of them that comes from people who aren't white men, it's that they don't acknowledge it at all.  They just outright, like they pretend it's not even there when it very clearly is. ",

And on the one end, you have this very cynical group at the top that we've been talking about who are totally just using... this language of oppression to mask the fact that they're defending an essentially reactionary agenda for the ostensibly leftist party in America, and people are not happy about that.  And so they want to confuse the issue and they want to distract from that.  That's their agenda.  And so that's why they're going to push that narrative.  But a lot of people are going to buy it for the simple reason that They don't want to confront, for a number of reasons, the terrifying reality that fucking internet is just a giant shit tornado with just this mass of totally uncontrollable, unknowable people.  You have no idea who anybody is.  They can do whatever the fuck they want.  And this narrative of these directed attacks, where Matt Bruning has like 500 alts and then 600 minions directing attacks at these people, there's something comforting about that.  Because if you can cut the head off of the snake, it'll die, and then maybe you can have peace in the kingdom.  When the sad and terrifying reality is that there's a bunch of broke-brained morons and fucking schizoids online who you have no control over.  And that reality is too scary.  And so people cleave to this narrative of these masterminds that just has no basis in reality. ",

He likes our great allies in Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
