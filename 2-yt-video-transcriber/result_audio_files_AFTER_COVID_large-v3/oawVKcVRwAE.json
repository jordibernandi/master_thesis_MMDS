            "text": "Today we're canceling Zinnia Jones.  He's a transgender activist, self-proclaimed science writer, who recently presented the argument for potentially putting all children on hormone blockers.  Now, just for a little context and background here, Jones runs a YouTube account.  I'll give you a little taste of that, just so you understand who this is coming from.  This is Jones and some other person a couple of years ago reacting to a Tucker Carlson segment, which itself, the segment, was reacting to Jones's statement that straight men are transphobic for not wanting to date trans women.  And this is what Zinnia Jones had to say about that.  Listen. ",

There are a ton of people who would be into us, but they have hang-ups about it because they think, oh, trans women aren't women.  which is false because trans women are women, uh, obviously, if they could get past that, then maybe they'd realize that they could have a really good time with us.  I am trying to help them here.  People who like trans women or might like trans women, but have issues with it because of everything that society says about them... ",

Uh, just, just very quickly, No, there are no straight men who are into you or could be by definition.  I mean, by definition, if you're a straight man, you are attracted to biological females.  If you're attracted to anything but biological females and you're a man, you're not a straight man by definition.  So there you go.  There's Jones.  Jones has declared that.  now this is the new thing.  Jones has declared that children should not be forced to undergo, quote, the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty without first, quote, a professional evaluation.  suggesting that a child's natural process of growth and maturity somehow constitutes a human rights violation.  Jones says that the argument that children cannot give appropriate consent for hormone blockers necessarily leads to the conclusion that we should be, quote, putting every single cis and trans person on puberty blockers until they are able to offer, quote, informed consent to go through puberty.  Jones presents puberty as a choice.  and one that every child should have the right to accept or decline.  And in order to bring about this utopia, apparently children should all be drugged by default.  Now, this is quite insane, of course.  It's hard to know where to begin in explaining why it's insane.  But one crucial point to make is that puberty is just one stage in and facet of human development.  If puberty violates consent, then my bones violated my consent by making me six feet tall.  Actually, six foot one.  At least that's what I say.  Certainly, my metabolism has committed an unspeakable crime against me by slowing down without asking first and ensuring that I can no longer eat at Cinnabon without the evidence showing up around my midsection.  In fact, even as I say these words, my heart is pumping blood without asking permission.  My liver has taken it upon itself to filter blood regardless of my personal preferences.  I must also note with special disappointment that my body has never sprouted wings so that I can fly in spite of my repeated demands to that end.  See, I exist here in this body, on this planet, in this reality, as this person, and almost everything about my body, this planet, and this reality exists independent of how I feel about it.  Our consent cannot be violated by nature because nature is outside the realm of consent.  Looters who destroy your store have committed a crime against you.  But a hurricane that destroys your store has not.  Just like you are not oppressed or victimized by a natural process occurring in or to your body.  Even ones you don't like.  Even death itself.  Because this is all a part of being a human person.  And to say that you, a human person, are a victim of being a human person is incoherent.  Now, on the other hand, you can be a victim of and have your consent violated by artificial substances intentionally introduced into your body in order to halt your natural growth.  If these drugs are given to you as a child when your brain has not yet developed to the point where it's able to properly evaluate all the options and make a truly informed choice, then you are a victim.  Something is being done to you artificially by another conscious agent and you did not really choose it because you are not able to make those sorts of choices.  And this is science we're talking about.  The prefrontal cortex, the region of your brain heavily involved in decision-making, discernment, evaluating choices, and so on, is not completely online until the age of 25.  At the age of 9 or 10 or 12, it's not even close to fully operational.  That's why children cannot be entrusted to make any life-altering decisions for themselves at all.  This is also the whole reason why we say it's rape for adults to have sex with children, no matter what the children say.  The child cannot choose a sexual relationship with an adult because they cannot know what it entails, what the consequences will be, what it all means.  This very same logic clearly means that pubescent children do not take drugs.  They are given drugs.  If an adult having sex with a child is not having sex with him but raping him, then an adult giving hormone pills to a child is not medicating him but poisoning him.  But the one thing I will say for the demented and evil idea presented by Zinnia Jones, I'll say that it's entirely consistent with every other demented and evil item on the radical LGBT agenda.  In fact, it's the logical conclusion of those things.  If sex is assigned at birth by unspecified nefarious forces, then puberty is part of that unfair assignment.  If we must break free from this assigning process by letting children choose their gender, then they should be able to choose when and if they undergo puberty.  Zinnia's point is inescapably correct if you accept the underlying trans narrative.  Many people in our culture do accept it or pretend to accept it because they're too scared to be honest about what they really think.  And that means that compulsory hormone pills for all children is not as far-fetched as it sounds.  We are marching on our way to that destination as we speak.
