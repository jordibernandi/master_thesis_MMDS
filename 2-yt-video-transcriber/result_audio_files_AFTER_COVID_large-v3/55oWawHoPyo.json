            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  I want to talk with us today about preparing for the plunge.  And if you're going to join me for this, you may want to grab a pen, paper, sit down and take notes.  Let's get started.  So friends, right now in the United States, we're seeing an uptick and we're seeing a renewal in certain areas of lockdown approaches, which I spoke about about a month ago.  And I've known that this is coming since really the first lockdown series happened across the country and different municipalities are taking a different approach to it.  So it's going to vary obviously state by state, municipality by municipality.  But there's a few things that I had on my heart to share with y'all and I want to talk about that today.  So the first thing is essentially once a week, try and incorporate into your meals preparedness and long storage shelf life items.  For instance, a meal where you're featuring beans and rice or some sort of legume and rice.  Lentils are my own personal favorite because they, of all the legumes other than split peas, from a dry state, they cook the fastest.  on stovetop.  It's different in a pressure cooker, obviously.  But I want to, as best as possible, decrease that startup, that lack of familiarity with eating foods.  And a lot of this is just how you prepare it.  So experiment with different recipes.  One of the things that I like to do when I'm cooking rice, I actually love to make Mexican rice.  So I'll take the jasmine rice, which cooks the fastest.  And then I'll make a Mexican rice recipe out of it and kind of add more nutritional density rather than just plain rice because that just gets really boring after a while.  And to incorporate things like that.  Another thing that you can do obviously is to just be judicious about your shopping and reverse plan.  So finding things that are on sale like at a grocery outlet, something like that.  And then building your menu backwards.  And I think that that's going to serve you.  But I think it is realistic.  at this point also to I'm anticipating shortages again, actually worse shortages.  As a matter of fact, I just bought a major appliance and the store where I purchased this told me it finally got delivered today, but they told me that their supply in the central warehouses, this is a larger, like a bigger box store.  They told me essentially their product line is doing this because of the supply line disruptions.  So this is a major household good.  These are the goods that really power a lot of the economy, the purchase of these sorts of items, household goods.  And that's already in short supply.  In other places around the country, there's also a shortage in various things, whether it's toilet paper or food staples in some cases.  I anticipate that we're going to see, if you remember what it was like two months ago, With shortages, I think we're going to see a second round of that, maybe not as bad.  But the issue is with this first round of supply depletion, there was wiggle room, right?  And there was a cushion, essentially, because of storehouses and because of continuing productivity.  But now, because we're seeing certain places, food packing plants, food processing areas shut down in this sort of popcorn distribution around the country, different areas are going to be affected differently.  So it behooves us, if you have not really been maintenancing those stores, and I know a lot of people are tight on finances right now, but if you can, I would really try and pad that stock with things before we start going through the second phase.  Because right now, You're seeing the caseload tick up and people are getting a little bit scared about it.  I anticipate that this is only going to be manipulated by the left in this country to essentially sow more division and to get their political agenda across to the American people and get them scared enough to try and vote their way, vote big government in this upcoming election.  I think that this really plays into their hands and they're going to do everything that they can in order to push that fear narrative and really get people into that cycle where that brain is spinning.  And really fear breeds dependency, whereas confidence breeds independence and self-sufficiency.  And if we have confidence in the Lord, Faith moment, y'all.  If we have confidence in the Lord and in his provision and in his protection and his covenant relationship to provide for the people who are his own and who are obedient to him, then we operate from a space and a sphere of confidence.  and subsequently self-sufficiency and independency spring forth from that.  When you push the fear narrative, like the left is doing, and many people on the right, both sides of Congress, both parties are doing this for various reasons, but definitely the left and the Democrat Party are, because they need it.  They need it in order to establish a victimhood status.  When you push fear, and you push God out of the way and you push fear, then the only God that's in the picture is the government, or the big daddy, come take money from other people and give it to me.  And so this meets their needs.  This will help them accomplish their political agenda.  if they keep spreading fear, and that's really what they're trying to do ahead of the election.  And so practically, we obviously don't believe that if you're into preparedness, and definitely if you are preparing out of a space of faith rather than fear, I think that it's going to be easier for us.  And so for that reason, I want to also encourage us to keep a quiet heart.  And that's actually an Elizabeth Elliot book.  But keeping a quiet heart does not mean shutting down your natural intuition and these programmed parts in us that say, I need to eat food and I need a way to clothe myself and I need a way to find water.  All of these things meeting our basic needs.  This obviously should, we should take a judicious and a wise and a prudent approach to it.  But when we let fear start talking, When we let fear start talking, it's like swatting mosquitoes away.  If you're from the south and you're used to like, you know, they come around, they bite you, you know, you're used to splatting them on you every now and then.  So in a way, I kind of take the mosquito narrative.  Like when you hear the little cheepy, the fear, the fear, just like swat, swat, replace with truth.  When we are combating fear and when we're speaking truth into our lives and we're keeping our brains and our minds and our spirits right, Then we take every thought captive, right?  We take every thought captive.  And why is that?  Why is it important that even in the midst of everything going on right now, we take thoughts captive?  because our thoughts become words and our words become actions.  So we preempt bad action or inaction based on paralytic fear through stopping it up here.  And so we have to, and I'm saying this myself, y'all, I really, yesterday was my fasting and prayer day.  I'm fasting and praying on Thursdays as an intercessory point and as a point of worship and as a point of keeping my brain, heart, mind, body right with God in the midst of everything.  Not perfect.  Oh, am I so not perfect.  If you're perfect, send me an email because I need to take notes from you.  But keeping our hearts right in the midst of everything is going to serve us well.  And gratitude as a natural antidepressant, right?  Keeping a positive and appropriate mindset and framework is almost impossible without gratitude.  Right?  And the way that I've tried to adapt this into my own life as a practice is before I go to sleep.  Well, there are many things.  Praying before you go to sleep.  Always a good thing.  But I try and speak aloud.  Thank you, Lord, for this.  Thank you, Lord, for this.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Going right down the list.  And I understand that I have people who follow me here and on into the faith thing.  That's cool.  Gratitude, though, is something that anybody can do.  And it has a protective and shielding effect on your psyche.  So you really stand nothing to gain, or excuse me, you stand nothing to lose and everything to gain by implementing a gratitude practice.  And it's not some namby-pamby weak thing, absolutely not.  Gratitude is not weakness.  Gratitude is shielding yourself and keeping your mental borders well defended and well guarded.  Because it gives you perspective.  Gratitude gives us perspective, even in the midst of challenging times.  And of course, to highlight again, belief that if you are attempting to operate from a place of wisdom and that you're being judicious about preparedness, the Lord's got you, okay?  Like if you're doing the right thing, he's got you.  He does.  And from a faith standpoint, I know that if I am faithful to do what he says, it may not go the way that I think.  I may not have everything, like all my little duckies in a row, but I know that it's gonna work out, right?  I'm saying this, like we're all saying this, like speaking truth, talking to ourself, not listening to ourself, not listening to the little mosquitoes of fear, but talking to ourself.  Helpful thing, keeping us centered.  I hope that was helpful for you today.  If you enjoyed the video, I hope you'll subscribe to me here on YouTube.
