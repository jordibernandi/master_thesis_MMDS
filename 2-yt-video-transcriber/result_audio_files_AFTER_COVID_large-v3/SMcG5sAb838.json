            "text": "Hi guys.  You got DPS over here with a stolen vehicle.  Dobson and Southern.  They called for Mesa to help.  We got the unmarked here.  We've got a stolen vehicle here.  Search the vehicle.  We've got the guy in the car.  We've got three, four units here.  Hey, go stand over there, okay?  I could stand right here.  You're in the middle of a crime scene, sir.  I don't see no fucking tape.  Okay, I'll put some up.  Let me have you back up.  When you put it up, I'll back behind it.  I'm telling you right now to back up.  Back me up.  Okay, thank you.  What's your name and badge number?  C. Martin?  Yeah.  Let me have you back up behind the back bumper of that.  That's perfect.  Thank you.  Now fuck off.  Fucking prick.  Hey, do you know that this has Zoom?  It has Zoom on it, you fucking bull-headed fucking prick.  We've got unit number 1977-1, G-2-1, JG.  We've got... Or DPS units here.  One of them is unmarked.  Get the guy in the car here.  trying to stand in the shade.  I heard this on the scanner.  They called for Mesa PD to help them out.  They got them stopped and now DPS is finishing up.  Where's the fucking tape, Frank?  I don't know if he said his name and that number.  I'll have to rewind it.  The head of DPS always goes on the radio and says our state troopers.  We live for transparency.  I got here on the ass and they already took him out felony style.  Put him in the car.  Now we got one over there questioning him.  You guys don't like transparency?  Frank Milstead loves it.  This started out on Highway 60, and they got off on Country Club.  They came over here to Southern, and they pulled them over here in Thompson.  Southern and Thompson.  They're debating what to do.  The church is the church, isn't it?  getting Cobra out here.  You'll get a good picture of this.  You get the GT, BND 3727.  It's pretty tinted, probably can't see shit.  He's gonna finish searching the vehicle.  All right, guys.  I'm gonna call this one.  Pit and Cobra.  I'm out.  I'm just going for a few minutes.  Always like catching DPS.  Alright guys, I'm out. ",
