            "text": "What I found interesting about this, and of course the left was planning to do this if the election went the way they didn't like.  So we're taking advantage of, we're analyzing a constitutional process here that's available to every candidate, certainly presidential candidate.  Is how unclear the law is, as you point out, and how unprecedented the situation is in the sense there's not much guidance of what happens once these challenges occur.  So the House and the Senate are meeting jointly on this January 6th with Vice President Pence presiding.  And if you object, and other members will be objecting, I presume as well, I'm assuming you'll be objecting to different states, different members.  And then there's a Senator that objects, which is a big.  if, although I think it's becoming clear at least one will come forward Then the two bodies, the House and the Senate, retire to their respective chambers and debate the specific objection for, I guess, a limit of two hours.  Now, the thinking is, and this is where I want to, because you raised this issue separately, I heard you say, the thinking is that that would be a majority vote in the House.  And you raised a question about whether that's legit or not, especially in my view, looking at your thinking there, the 12th Amendment suggests that that process be a state delegation by state delegation vote, not a member by member vote, which means that Pelosi doesn't have the advantage that people say she has.  Am I thinking right there? ",

            "text": "Yes, that is an open question.  And the Senate is quite clear when we're accepting or rejecting electoral college vote submissions The standard is a majority of the 100.  And if there's a 50-50 tie, then it would be Mike Pence that breaks the tie in the Senate.  In the House, there is no clear standard other than a majority.  And the question then becomes a majority of what?  435 congressmen?  or is it a majority of the states which the 12th amendment specifically applies to the election of the president?  and to me this is a part of the election of the president.  so that standard also ought to apply in the house.  but for that standard to apply we'd have to have a knock down drag out fight within the republican members of the house of representatives to ensure that we have in the record what these states votes are.  Now in the House, the breakdown right now is subject to the Democrats stealing any congressional seats that are being contested.  The breakdown is 27 House seats are majority, excuse me, 27 state delegations are majority Republican, 20 states are majority Democrat, and then three states are 50-50.  One state, Iowa, is three to one Republican right now, but it appears that a losing Democrat is going to challenge the election in the House of Representatives.  In which case, if that losing Democrat is supported by the congressional Democrats and on a partisan basis, I think there's a good argument that they're going to do so regardless.  of the will of the citizens of the state of Iowa, then Iowa shifts from a 3-1 Republican state to a 2-2 tie state, in which case it's 26 Republican state delegations, 20 Democrat delegations, and four that are 50-50 toss-up.

            "text": "well for the first when you talk about objections there has to be at least one house member and one senator.  that technically is the objection.  and on the house side we have roughly 30 congressmen now who are so well educated about the voter fraud they are willing to sponsor or co-sponsor the objections to the states that have shown the worst election systems, the most flawed election systems.  After we have a two-hour debate, then we have House and Senate floor votes.  Those floor votes will determine whether we accept or reject any particular state submittal.  But the Senate is a real problem.  They're shaking in their boots and their foxholes waiting for the fight to end.  And then they hope to jump up, I guess, and jump on the winning bandwagon, whatever it may be.  But we really need them to fight for America at this juncture.  And more importantly, to fight for our republic and the underpinning of our republic, which is an honest and accurate election system, which we quite clearly don't have.  So the senators are going to have a choice.  I personally think they're going to duck and cover.  That seems to be their modus operandi right now.  But they're going to have a choice.  They can either vote or otherwise acquiesce to voter fraud, election theft, or they can stand up and fight to protect the underpinnings of our republic, any republic. ",

I don't know where the GOP will be, but if they're smart, if they want to help prevent this kind of election fraud in the future, I submit that they would be wise to make sure that in the congressional record, there is a listing of every single state that voted to reject electoral college votes from those suspect states, that creates a record that can be adjudicated either by Mike Pence or the Supreme Court, depending on who would be the ultimate decision maker.
