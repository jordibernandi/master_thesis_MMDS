And then the bedding surface we're looking at is consistent with that.  We see the orientation or the alignment of fossils, which argues that it wasn't a natural death that killed these organisms.  They didn't fall randomly to the bottom.  Something swept along and moved them, their bodies maybe still in the shells, and they were buried by being smothered here.

Together, these three observations need an excellent and good interpretation.  And that led me to do some very serious reflection, and it challenged me to do my best work.  And the experiment that I had with my son, February 3rd, the year 2000, in the giant sandbox is worth talking about.  Well, the dad and his kid with the sandbox, it started with pouring sand.  And you know, pour sand, it's in friction.  When you pour sand fast, it forms mounds.  Okay, but when you throw sand, it can stream out over a surface like a blanket.  And I was throwing out sand with little leaf fragments in it, thinking about nautiloids, when the idea of a high velocity flow came to my mind.  Rather than thinking about granular friction, you know, the grains as they bounce along, as you throw the grains out, the frictional flow.  I imagined little springs between the sand grains holding them apart.  And if that could happen, the sand could flow almost endlessly.  And my brain entered a domain, I call it no friction land.  I started thinking about high speed, no friction flow of sediment slurries, concentrated sediment slurries over the surface of the Earth on low slopes and that kind of thing.  It led me into a four year thought experiment, if you will, about how sand grains and sand sized particles and large fossils might move.  How did the fossils, the coarse fossils, get in the middle of the bed?  That is the mind-challenging thing.  I could imagine how they could get at the bottom of the bed, just fall out, or I could imagine how they get to the top of the bed, but how could they get in the middle?  That was really interesting.

I'm looking at those leaf fragments, and I'm thinking in the wake of a high-speed flow, there could be a turbulent eddy, and that's how the nautiloids could fall out with the sediment.  Concentrated sediment would fall out first, and then the fossils would be buoyed up, and they would fall out, and then finally the light stuff would.  the finer texture would fall out.  And so it seemed to explain things.  In no-friction land, I can imagine how this occurred.  I worked out the equations in 2D of... of a dynamic pressure and static pressure on a fast moving flow.  You know, when you have your hand out in the car at 60 miles an hour, you feel that really strong current that's flowing past your hand.  That's called dynamic pressure.  And a fast-moving slurry, like a mud slurry with lots of organisms in it, would generate that kind of pressure.  The faster it goes, the more pressure it develops.  When that pressure developed in front is equal to the weight, the submerged weight of the flow, the mud flow, if you will, it causes a property called hydroplane.  And in hydroplane, there is no friction with the surface underneath. ",

And so I gave it to a modeler, a computational fluid dynamicist to model that.  I gave him a couple of months to do the 2D computer simulation.  And I remember getting a phone call one day and I said, how do you do it on that computational fluid dynamics problem of simulating an underwater mud flow?  50% sediment, 50% water moving at a speed of about seven meters per second, 21 feet per second, something like that.  And he said, wow, they fly.  And then he noticed they generated a wing shape.  as these flows moved under the water, over the sediment surface, they generate a wing shape and they essentially fly.  So now we have flying sediment flows on a hydroplane moving over the ocean floor. ",
