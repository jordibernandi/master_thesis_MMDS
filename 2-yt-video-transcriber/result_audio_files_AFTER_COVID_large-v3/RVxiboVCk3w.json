            "text": "An important contribution to Marxist discourse made by Lenin and his successors was the posing of the national question.  Lenin's view of national liberation and the right to self-determination differed considerably from the nationalism that developed concurrently with liberal revolutions.  The objective of the liberal nationalist project, the project that was produced in the death throes of feudalism and challenged the fading status quo, was to establish a national identity that transcended other social relations.  What mattered in this bourgeois nationalism was that the individual belonged to the nation, not to their genetic lineage or some membership in a clan.  Consequently, bourgeois nationalism also places the national identity above class.  Bourgeois nationalism is a bourgeois class outlook that preaches to the people of a nation or national group that regardless of class, they have more in common with one another than they do with the people of other nations.  Nationalism helps bind the working class to the bourgeoisie of its nation.  So, when Leninists speak of a movement for national liberation, what do they mean?  Left-wing nationalism advocates for the oppressed colonial nations to rise up against imperialist or national control.  National liberation is anti-imperialist and demands the right of the nation to self-determination.  How do Leninists define the nation?  Stalin offers us a lucid and functional definition of a nation.  It is therefore clear that there is in fact no single distinguishing characteristic of a nation.  There is only a sum of total characteristics, of which, when nations are compared, sometimes one characteristic, national character, sometimes another, language, or sometimes a third, territory, economic conditions, stands out in sharper relief.  A nation constitutes the combination of all these characteristics taken together.  This definition is crucial as it demonstrates the fluidity of a nation, and ensures the right to self-determination even for peoples who may not share a common land or even a common language.  The right of a nation to self-determination states that a nation has the right to its own destiny, that it may not be agitated by another nation, that it may be autonomous, that it has the right to enter into relations with other nations and secede from those same relations.  The aim of self-determination is to put an end to the system of national oppression perpetuated by imperialism, to render it impossible and to unite the class-conscious proletariat under its own banner and not one of the national bourgeoisie.  For Lenin, self-determination was not only a right of nation, but a requisite condition for the victory of socialism.  Lenin also stressed that national self-determination was incomplete within the frameworks of capitalism.  it is not enough for a colony to reform away colonial rule.  If a country continues to be controlled by finance capital, it has not truly achieved self-determination.  This was and continues to be the case in many African states, where formal political secession still allowed foreign capital to dominate both the political arena and the economic sphere.  Even today, many underdeveloped countries have not been totally liberated, living at the command of foreign capital and external institutions such as the IMF.  This observation did not mean that national liberation could only occur outside capitalist frameworks.  The aim of socialism is not only to abolish the present division of mankind into small states and all national isolation, not only to bring the nations closer to each other, but also to merge them.  And in order to achieve this aim, we must, on the one hand, explain to the masses the reactionary nature of the ideas of Renner and Otto Bauer concerning the so-called cultural national autonomy, and on the other hand demand the liberation of oppressed nations, not only in general, nebulous phrases, not in empty declamations, not by postponing the question until socialism is established, but in a clearly and precisely formulated political program which shall particularly take into account the hypocrisy and cowardice of the socialists in the oppressing nations.  just as mankind can achieve the abolition of classes only by passing through the transition period of the dictatorship of the oppressed classes.  so mankind can achieve the inevitable merging of nations only by passing through the transition period of complete liberation of all the oppressed nations i e their freedom to secede.  The solutions of each nation to the national question vary based on unique political, economic, and cultural conditions.  In this way, the national question for Marxists does not assign a correct, static, and unchanging answer to the problem of the national oppression, but rather offers a dynamic and over-determined explanation for each case.  To sum up, the bourgeois and proletarian resolutions to the national question are very different.  The former dissolves class boundaries, rallying the workers under the banner of the local bourgeoisie.  The latter rallies the proletariat under its own banner.  It is an anti-imperialist struggle for democratic liberation.  It should be said, however, that both bourgeois and proletarian national liberation are not truly end goals in themselves.  Capital, for example, oversteps national boundaries and moves tendentially towards a global economy, towards globalization.  We see this today with multinational corporations leading the advance of capital against national identities.  Left-wing movements for self-determination are similarly transitionary.  The end goal for proletarian national revolutions is the establishment of an international socialist unity, a dissolution of national boundaries, and the unification of the working peoples across the world.  Thus, the difference between bourgeois nationalism and proletarian nationalism is simply that the former wants globalization under the control of capital, while the latter hopes to establish internationalism under the control of the people.  That's where we will end the video for today.  We have left one aspect of this discussion completely unanswered.  How did all of these things play out in the Soviet Union?  To answer this question, we have to delve into Soviet history, which expands the topic of discussion considerably.  For now, we will leave the question here.
