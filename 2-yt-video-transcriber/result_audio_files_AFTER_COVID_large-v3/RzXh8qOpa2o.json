Produced by Canoga Park, developer Mystique, a subsidiary of an adult movie company, the game cast the player as horny General Custer with a pixelated boner who had to walk across the screen through a hail of arrows to pork a Native American woman tied to a pole.  Classy stuff, right?  When the game was released, it sparked a moral panic with anti-sex feminist Andrea Dworkin claiming it had, quote, generated many gang rapes of Native American women.  Okay.  No empirical data backs this up, but several cities floated laws to prove the game's sale.  Only one did, Oklahoma City, which fucked them.  Oklahoma actually passed a measure making sales of Custer's Revenge illegal within city limits.  some pearl clutching bullshit i've ever heard it.  because this game as we'll see in a little bit it's not much of a game if we're just being plainly honest.
