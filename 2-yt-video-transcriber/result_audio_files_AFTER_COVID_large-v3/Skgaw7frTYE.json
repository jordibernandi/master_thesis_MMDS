She may be resigned to her fate.  And Scientology's attorneys keep telling the press that she's okay.  And so people always ask me, well, hasn't she just been killed or something?  And I said, no, their attorneys wouldn't say that, that she's alive if she's not.  Scientology's been very effective at keeping Shelley Miscavige out of sight.  But hiding that she died, I don't think Scientology could do that.  And that's why I think she's still alive.  Scientology is dying in Australia.  And one of the things Australia has that we don't in the United States is an accurate census.  And I think the last census there were like 2,000 Scientologists in the entire country.  You know, Australia was once a real stronghold of Scientology.  Hubbard went to Melbourne in the 50s and it really, you know, he left behind a thriving organization.  It's not thriving today, but they need to keep up the appearance with these buildings and facilities.  I bet they never have more than 15 or 20 people there.  And so in order to look busy, they need to bring people in from other countries.  And I heard somebody refer to it as a megachurch.  It's as far from a megachurch as you can imagine. ",

As a Scientologist, you are encouraged to come and study Scientology for two and a half hours a day, five days of the week.  Now let's say you've been in Scientology for three years.  That's a hell of a lot of indoctrination.  That's not just a couple times.  you're going and reading a book.  I can tell you it's one of the more insidious traps that you can get into.  And as a matter of fact, I would say most of the people that I knew in Scientology were pretty smart.  But the way it's worked out is this.  When you first get in Scientology, there are basic courses that you do, such as the communication course, which quite honestly, when you get through with that course and start practicing those basics of communication in life, you are more capable.  Now, because of that, that gives you a feeling of confidence that, hey, this is good stuff.  So then maybe the next course would be how you could run a business.  And you learn the basics of that.  So you think, man, this is good stuff.  So now you're gaining confidence.  And maybe there's just several more.  that gains a little more confidence.  Now, you may be introduced to some fact that you think, man, I don't know if I agree with this.  Yeah, but everything so far has been good.  I'll just accept it.  You're trapped.  Now you're starting to build up a series of beliefs that aren't true, but you're holding them to be true, and you're literally building up a small prison in your own mind. ",
