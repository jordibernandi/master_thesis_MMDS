            "text": "okay this huge ship has already exited on this screen.  so we're going to watch the um the progress of it as it went across once it entered the airspace near the sun which was march the 13th.  i should be able to stop this so we can show that as soon as it entered in you can see the front of it right here.  this is what we're focusing on.  um so we're just going to drag this a little bit.  you'll see immediately.  you have this ship up here at the top.  okay here's our little docking station.  let's see if we can get through here without it blinking on us.  blinkity blinky.  yeah look at the uh flashes that are occurring.  i run.  i wonder what that is down there.  uh that made that big bright flash.  of course we can't see because they've got it hidden.  Okay, so here we have all of these right here.  And what's interesting about this is as this ship made its way all the way over here, these appeared again, but they were in mass numbers.  I mean, they literally cover this completely up and we're going to see that.  But so it entered in at 313 and here it is 314.  You see them.  Okay, they're there.  Okay, and it's making its way across.  we're just gonna do this.  look there's another little ship right here.  I hope it doesn't blink on me.  well then we got another one right here.  boom yeah so here we go.  it's making its way just like this.  great that's wonderful.  so here we have it um at 3 14. let's see if we can get it to do it.  let's see if we can get that flash back.  Gina you went a little bit too far.  oh my goodness now I've got it flashing on us.  boom so this is a good spot to stop because these were all over the place once this entered the space.  so I'm going to pause this right now because uh when we get to the end of the video you'll see more of these.  I mean literally like boom.  it like takes up that whole entire screen.  uh so yeah let me pause this.  okay we're going to pick back up where it was because once it enters the sun it stays in there for a few days and we don't see it again for quite some time.  um so yeah let's look at that it's went in there we're not seeing it.  um um Yeah, see, it doesn't even look like a ship anymore.  But notice these right here.  This is what I noticed.  1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.  They're in twos, okay?  And when it gets over here, they're in twos again also.  So I don't know what these are, but it's really neat.  Look, there's 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.  So yeah, so let's pause this right here, and we're going to catch it as it's coming out of the sun now.  Okay, here we go.  We're waiting for it to come out of the sun.  Okay, here it's coming out of the sun.  It's on the 20th is when it exits the sun.  Okay, let's watch this.  This is pretty interesting.  Whoa, look at all that blinkety blink that happened.  My goodness, what is going on with that?  Let's see if we can catch these.  I'll slow this down.  Actually, let me play it so you can see what it looks like before we pause it and show the activity.  So it's on the 20th.  And I am going like 300 frames per back and 20 frames per second.  so let's see this.  so let's pause it.  see if i can get this before it blinks again on us.  okay so we've got one large one right here the sun the ship is still inside the area around the sun.  i don't know what it's doing.  it probably went.  who knows what see it's coming out right now.  so it starts coming out on 319.  So it's coming out.  Okay, there we got some ships right here.  Let's see if we can make it.  Can we make it?  We can make it.  Boom.  So look, we even got these.  They're going like this.  Okay.  So we've got those.  Look at this large ship coming out right here.  It's not a solar flare.  It is literally some kind of a ship.  It's got a perfect like boom like that with a ridge on it.  Like a yeah.  Oh no, why you want to blink on me?  Okay, so we've got a little ship up here.  Not little.  There's three of these together.  I'm sorry about that blinking.  I really am.  I don't mean to make it blink.  okay so we've got these right here.  boom boom boom boom boom boom all right.  so that's on 321. okay here we go.  we're going to still go across this screen and if they have tampered with it that's okay because i got a screenshot of it and i think they have.  i think they have.  um they've cut the screen down.  uh, to where, to where?  we can't see everything, but we are in luck.  Maybe, uh, but maybe, uh, maybe it's going to go again.  Let me pause this.  I can't remember exactly where a whole bunch of them show up again also.  So again, we've got, um, we got them like that too, right here.  This ain't very many at all.  Okay.  So let's pause this.  okay so so we're going to watch it go.  we're going to see the screen that's going to be covered with all those ufo ships.  look at that.  look at that.  is that not remarkable?  and it goes on its merry way and as you can see as it enters away from the airspace it takes its normal ship form.  look at that boom.  so let's watch it again goes like that and then um see it's very interesting because it's the same thing they did uh when it came in over here.  but that was even more.  so we are literally going to pause this.  you can see the shape.  it's um yeah so it leaves the airspace at march the 23rd.  it entered the airspace around the sun on march the 13th.  so that is 10 days.  so we're going to look at these as it goes across.  let's hope it doesn't blink on us too much.  so we have the first round.  look at that.  boom what do you think about that?  i am telling you is that not a massive battle or what?  That is a massive battle taking place in these skies.  Okay, these things are all over the place.  I don't know what they're doing.  I have no idea what they're doing.  It's not satellites.  Okay, it's not satellites.  These are fleets and fleets of ships up there.  And I'm thinking, oh my gosh, let's look at this.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Look at that.  And see how this one stays there in the center.  Look at that.  like what is going on in the sky and you know they had our sky so um covered that we couldn't even see anything that was up there.  look at this.  let's do this boom let's blink it like this boom boom because this helps us to see which ones are still there the longest.  so we can see that is there too boom it's very interesting isn't it?  you may say Gina would you please quit that blinking?  well I like it I love it I really do love it yeah.  so oh my gosh I've not seen so many of these at once I really haven't.  so that's what happened.  uh they made a show of four spoon and off it went.  so let's uh pause this right here.  so um Look at that, and I am going to do a screenshot, and we're going to have a side-by-side of when it first entered the airspace.  And then, well, you can't see the date down here, but it is, let's see if I can get this date.  It is the 22nd, March the 22nd.  And then, boom, it enters, it leaves the airspace March 23rd.  One day soon. ",
