            "text": "Hi there.  Do you like D&D?  Are you feeling sad about the soy state of British discourse surrounding trans people?  Or do you simply hate Graham Linehan?  If you answered yes to any of those three questions, then haven't I got the stream for you.  On both the 6th and the 7th of March at 7.30pm Coordinated Universal Time, I'll be DMing a couple of one-shot sessions to try and raise money via Twitch.  Money for what, you ask?  while to act as a legal defence fund against Graham Linehan.  You see, the once-comedy writer has threatened to file a slap suit against me and numerous others for accurately reporting on this ongoing harassment of the trans community, and rather than lay down and take it, I've decided to stand up and set a legal precedent.  Down with this sort of thing, as the actually funny writer for that old show might have written.  So I'd like to personally invite you to tune into our antics on Friday the 6th as the party tries to survive Monstrous Park, the biological preserve founded and run by gazillionaire dwarf John Hammond.  Then, on Saturday the 7th, join in as our party sets out to uncover the secrets of the Seamot Orphanage in the Terror of Gragom, fighting to free it from the clutches of a truly foul creature.  But that's not all we have to offer.  On Saturday the 8th, we intend to host a series of interviews with various trans people, covering a wide range of topics and experiences.  And if you'd like to be a part of that, then please, do contact me via either Facebook, Twitter, or the email given below so we can set a time.  You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay up to date on our guest appearances.  Now, I need to be clear.  I need some practice.  So I'll be doing a series of spontaneous streams in the weeks leading up to the main events.  It's my first time streaming, so it should be very interesting to see me learn how to swim by throwing me into the pool.  So don't forget to subscribe on Twitch as well.  Now, our initial goal is to raise the \u00a36,000, or US$7,800, to cover travel expenses and initial legal fees, though we'll be trying to raise more in case Graham attempts to drag this out.  which, yes, I know is a lot of money, but that's how slapsuits work.  Any money not used to fight Graham in this case will go to a public trans defence fund to fight any future slapsuits targeted at human rights activists and feminists by people such as Graham.  Activists and feminists like the many wonderful creators helping out on this project, such as The Serfs, Vadim from Creationist Cat, Objectively Subjective, So that about sums it up.  Though, do be aware, if you'd like to know more about the situation as a whole as well as the breakdown of legal costs, I've gone ahead and produced a slightly more detailed video covering all that information, and there'll be links below in the description and the pinned comment.  So hopefully, we'll see you there, and from myself and Edita, take care now. ",
