            "text": "What it was like being a drug addict?  What is life as a drug addict like?  Well I suppose there are many many varieties of drug addicts and all of us have different stories.  My addiction was straight out of a government pamphlet or these days I suppose a sort of in school video to tell you the perils of drugs.  I remember I didn't start using drugs at five years old.  Like a lot of people, if you hang out with drug addicts and alcoholics a lot, you hear people go, I was drinking or taking drugs when I was seven or eight years old.  I started at a normal, respectable time, adolescence.  When you're transitioning from childhood into adulthood, there's an influx of hormones.  Reality alters your perspective and requirements, and if you're not guided over this threshold by an elder, if you don't have instruction and ritual to transition into adulthood, you are likely to become lost, particularly, and I believe this to be true of all drug addicts, you are looking for a spiritual dimension to your life.  By spiritual, I mean a strong emotional connection, a sense of awareness, purpose, and connection, rather than your life is just defined by what other people see, of you and what you are achieving in rational, measurable terms.  A kind of sense that you are dealing with the unknowable and with, certainly unknowable in terms of the limitations of human consciousness, mystery, the mystery.  So what happened to me is like all of us, most of us, started to smoke, draw as it was called then, Dope, weed, the slang changes so quickly.  I'm embarrassed that I might be using the slang of yesteryear.  But for me, it was clear that I had a problem.  Every single thing I picked up, drinking, drugs, it was problematic from the beginning.  First time I got stoned, there was an investigation at our school.  There's a problem with drugs because I had my top off and was hanging out in the canteen.  all weird.  I'd seen the doors by Oliver Stone quite recently around that time.  I thought taking the top off and wearing a sheepskin jacket was basically all that was required to changing the world.  I've become a lot more sophisticated then.  There'd be no sheepskin.  That's very cruel.  I'm a vegan.  And that escalated quite quickly because the drugs in my life were fulfilling an emotional and, as I've already indicated, spiritual need.  So every time I took a new drug, that became like a solution for me, even if it was things that were apparently recreational, like LSD or ecstasy.  amphetamines, cocaine, and then ultimately heroin, all those drugs.  I remember the process was always, I'm going to do this all the time.  Every time I took a new drug, I'm going to do this all the time.  I'm doing that all the time now.  With alcohol, I started to drink before I'm an actor, aren't I?  And I used to go for auditions and things like that for commercials.  I went once for an advert for the Predator football boots.  You can work out when that happened.  And I was 18, I guess, then.  And, like, I was so nervous about doing something like that.  So I smoked a bunch of pipes, just weed, and, like, drank, like, older drugs, super strength lagers, like, that you can get in the UK, tenants, 9%, 10% type alcohol drinks.  And, like, this Predator football boot, I had to juggle a football.  And they said, where's your football kit?  They were meant to arrive in a football kit.  And a lot of the other people auditioning were from youth teams in London-based football clubs, kids from Charlton and West Ham and stuff.  And they went, oh, don't worry.  If you've not got your football kit, you can do it in your pants.  So I was wearing, I remember, a Tasmanian Devil tartan boxer shorts with a very sort of open fly.  doing real bad, like, I'm not good at keepy-ups.  Can you do keepy-ups, Jen?  I can't do keepy-ups to this day, as a matter of fact.  So, like, the ball was just dribbling off to the side of the room, like a man, or a young man, a boy, really, in boxer shorts, and perhaps he... Perhaps even a pixie boot doing keepy-ups in a studio, humiliating stuff.  Because I recognised, actually, I'm always a bit nervous and anxious.  I start to drink all the time, smoke weed all the time.  Now, when it escalates into sort of what are commonly understood to be sort of serious drugs, though I think addiction can be pretty serious no matter what drug you're taking, because it's the emotional state, the dependency, the need that's important, which is why I can see that tech addiction is going to become, you know, a pandemic as absorbing as coronavirus, perhaps with effects as... notable, ultimately.  When I got into crack and heroin, those things accelerate your decline.  It becomes quite quickly something you want to do all the time.  I didn't wait for heroin, which obviously physically addicting and you experience withdrawal if you don't take it.  i didn't ever experience withdrawal.  i just started taking it all the time.  i'd taken it first when i was about 19 smoking it.  i liked it but i didn't do it all the time then i like i don't know i just i was a student.  i was at a drama school then but then i took it a couple of years later when i was i think by this time doing stand-up comedy working at mtv and i just thought, I'm going to do this always.  I was living in Camden in North London.  I started getting it all the time, taking it all the time every day.  And the type of addiction I have, it accelerated very quickly.  So I was doing it all the time, doing it in conjunction with crack.  Because if you take a lot of heroin, you're knackered the whole time.  You're gouging out and delirious.  And a little bit of crack can make you a bit more sociable, particularly if you've got to, for example, be a VJ on an MTV show.  created links between videos.  so i started doing like crack and heroin consistently and the deterioration was pretty fast.  i'm not sure how long that.  well i reckon i was about 24 when i started becoming dependent on heroin and i got clean thank you god at 27. so there was only a sort of three year period.  that was the sort of peak although the preceding years where it was alcohol and recreational drugs were also pretty ugly.  you can mess yourself up pretty bad on weed and amphetamines and alcohol.  you can get into terrible situations.  you know this from your own life.  The last three years, though, with the crack and the heroin were probably the worst.  It involved the most times getting arrested, the most time physical injury, because I guess I was, this kind of emotional chaos that's always been in me from childhood was brought to the fore, and I had less inhibition and fear, which were, I suppose, to a degree, prohibitive.  I was only able, so to give you a clear description of what life's like as a drug addict, is bloody terrifying.  I suppose what it is, is it's a strategy for survival.  You find something that works, in my case, for managing my emotional state, and then you keep doing it because, of course, it's physically addictive, but because, to a degree, the strategy's working.  By the time you've realised that the consequences of your drug use are worse than the consequences of a life where you don't have an anaesthetic or distractions or pleasure stimulation and the things that crack and heroin in particular can provide for you, by that time you're physically dependent and the idea of change, you don't feel like you have any hope.  You don't feel like there's any way of stopping.  Why would I stop?  How would I stop?  This is my life now.  It becomes your life.  It becomes your religion.  It becomes the thing that gets you.  It becomes your belief system.  That's why it's ridiculous to tell a drug addict just to stop.  There's quite a lot of data on this, you know, and a wonderful anecdotal, although true, and a good opportunity for understanding the nature of addiction was the Vietnam vets that returned.  There was a high percentage of them were addicted to opiates because they were being widely distributed.  among the combat vets or combatants in vietnam majority of them 90 without assistance came off drugs but there was a five to ten percent group that just couldn't get off drugs.  we think that that mirrors the amount of people that have a tendency or an inclination towards addiction that find it hard to let go even though the context has changed.  we many people like addiction.  I can have them to anyone, anywhere.  There's no doubt that conditions of deprivation, obviously economic deprivation, but emotional deprivation and other kinds of negligence and isolation can exacerbate the tendency towards addiction.  you will see that in impoverished communities addiction is worse and that's not a coincidence.  environment molds and creates addiction the latest data suggests also.  Also though, this is relevant with new forms of addiction, behavioural addictions, such as the obvious and current Zeitgeist fave, tech addiction, because our environment is being created before our very eyes, we're being stimulated to become addicted.  So life as a drug addict is actually quite hard work.  In the end, it becomes so difficult that you're willing to countenance the idea of radical change.  In my case, abstinence-based recovery, where one day at a time, I don't drink, I don't take drugs, and I now, after many years, one day at a time, clean and sober, work on the behaviours that replaced abstinence.  addiction, behaviours around food and sexuality, I have a work programme around them.  And also the behaviours that led me to be a drug addict in the first place, various forms of self-obsession, despair, disconnection, low self-esteem.  So what it's like to be a drug addict is to live in the problem of your psyche, to live in the problem of your emotions.  What it's like to be in recovery is to face those problems head on and look for solutions beyond drugs because drugs, as we all know, don't work ultimately anyway.  for some people of course drugs represent a lot of fun and escape and all that kind of thing and but if you're an addict.  that's a very short period and a small part of the story of being a drug addict.
