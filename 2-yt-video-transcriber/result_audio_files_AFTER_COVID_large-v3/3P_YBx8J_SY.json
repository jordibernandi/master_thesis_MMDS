            "text": "Hey folks, Twisha Christian Julius here.  I kind of want to put out like this Dinar alert.  And it's only because of the season that we're in and just going back over some of Kim Clement's prophecies and seeing, you know, a climax to where we're at in several different things.  And there's still some things I think we still need to see before we see a revaluation.  But it could happen at any time and it could come at in any way, shape or form.  And so that's what we're trying to do.  We're trying to figure this out, trying to figure this out prophetically.  And one of the reasons why I'm doing this so that I can take advantage and try to know the time in the season so that I can prepare myself.  And if if I have the opportunity that I will purchase more.  Because eventually, as we all know, a lot of us are invested in other currencies, too.  But we're going to at least what I'm going to do is take my dinar and buy some other currencies and invest in other things immediately after the dinar revaluation.  Now, I had somebody point this out to me about Kim Clement, Stephen Wright, about this Christmas prophecy.  I'm just going to read it really quick and I'm going to go over another one.  All right, so this is September 10th, 2006, and he says here, I just got a glimpse of one of the greatest Christmases that we are ever to have.  I just heard some of the bells.  I just heard some of the Christmas songs, and I said, what is this all about?  I'm bringing a season upon the people that would believe it.  that will end this year with an explosion of multiplication, multiplication of vision, multiplication of finance, multiplication of faith, multiplication of grace, and I want you to know that the Jesus I serve in this building.
