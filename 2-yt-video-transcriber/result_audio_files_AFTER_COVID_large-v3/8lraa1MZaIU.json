            "text": "Over 100,000 Britons are dead.  The economy's in turmoil and we are trapped in what seems like a never-ending lockdown.  And one of the chief architects of this national catastrophe is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Senak.  Now, Rishi Sunak has been lauded by national newspapers.  He's even been portrayed as Superman by the BBC.  And according to the polling, he's the most popular politician in the country.  You can kind of see why people like him.  With his Instagram snaps of him in hoodies compared to a cabinet of duds and lightweights, he at least seems normal.  He's got telegenic looks.  And you can also see another reason why he's popular.  He's more associated than anyone else with the economic measures that were desperately needed, a lifeline even, for millions, like the furlough scheme.  Though it has to be pointed out that those measures were less generous than other European nations.  But here is the key point.  More than anyone else in the British government, Rishi Sunak drove a fatally misguided strategy of prioritizing the economy over human lives.  On its own terms, that was a catastrophic mistake.  All the evidence from around the world shows that if you don't get on top of your public health crisis, then you will suffer a worse economic crisis.  And indeed, Britain has suffered the worst of all worlds.  One of the worst death tolls on the face of the earth, but also one of the worst economic hits.  Sunak is the man who introduced Eat Out to Help Out.  It cost 849 million quid, but according to the British Chambers of Commerce, failed to improve the finances of UK hospitality and catering.  And yet up to a sixth of COVID clusters were linked to that scheme, encouraging the public to congregate indoors during a deadly pandemic.  Then the statutory sick pay.  In Britain, one of the lowest in the industrialized world.  Just 98 pounds, 85 quid, it's a quarter of the minimum wage for a full-time worker over 25, and millions of workers don't even qualify for that.  With many workers unable to look after their families to feed their kids to pay the rent or the mortgage they feel that they have no choice but to continue working if they're ill.  such is the low level of statutory sick pay driving the infections ever higher.  that's why rishi sunak was urged last november to increase statutory sick pay but he refused.  This is the man who told home workers to go on a spending spree when the pandemic was over and imposed a real terms pay cut on many public sector workers, the same key workers that Rishi Sunak applauded during the first lockdown.  that Sunak lives in a different world from those key workers who he's punishing.  He's the richest MP in Parliament, with a family fortune estimated to be greater than that of the Queen, undeclared on the Parliamentary Register, with a \u00a37 million mansion in Kensington, a \u00a31.5 million mansion back in his constituency, and flats in California and the old Brompton Road.  And yet this is the man who fought to stop the 20 quid a week uplift of universal credit be made permanent, which is going to drive an estimated 200,000 kids in this country into poverty, punishing many of those who have suffered in this pandemic the most.  According to the Financial Times, he was determined to stop it, reminding Tory MPs that such a policy would mean painful tax rises, with one ally warning it was the equivalent of 1p on income tax or 5p on a litre of fuel poverty.  hopefully they said this will help focus minds among conservative colleagues on what we value most.  in other words sunak prioritized the affluent over those struggling just to get by the cost of that uplift.  one and a half billion pounds a year less than a third of the income tax cuts since 2010, which have overwhelmingly gone to those who need it the least.  Compare that to the 22 billion pounds that's gone to the catastrophe of Test and Trace, led of course by the conservative peer, Dido Harding, who Rishi Sunak himself has gone out and defended.  But most disastrously of all, it was Rishi Sunak who desperately fought against the very measures that were needed in order to suppress the virus, to save lives and to shorten the nightmare that all of us have been trapped in.  Back last August, he was urging workers to go back to the office for the sake of the economy.  The front page of the Telegraph reflected the views of his allies, warning people to go back to work or risk losing their jobs.  According to the Sunday Times, last September, when Sage urged a circuit breaker lockdown to prevent catastrophe, it was Rishi Sunak who fought back the hardest.  He brought in lockdown sceptics like Professor Sunetra Gupta, who claimed last March that around half the UK population could already have been affected by COVID-19.  that COVID-19 was on its way out last May and that the infection fatality rate could be as low as 0.01%, which would mean 6,650 people dying if the whole population was infected.  He brought in people like her, completely discredited, and Sunak won.  and we must learn to live with it and live without fear.  A lockdown wasn't imposed.  Infections spiraled out of control.  More and more people died.  And the more infections, the more likely of a dangerous mutation.  And that, of course, is exactly what happened.  Sunac fought tooth and nail against demands to extend the furlough scheme, contributing to hundreds and thousands of job losses.  Only you turning at the very last minute on the 31st of October as the lockdown beckoned.  By then, too late for so many.  Sunak's ideological desire to place the economy above human life catastrophically failed on every measure.  the deaths, the infections, the overwhelming of the National Health Service and crucially on its own terms, the economy.  And yet Sunak is now briefing Conservative MPs that there is no magic money tree, that spending cuts, tax rises are to come to help solve the disaster that he himself is jointly responsible for.  Look at the state we're in.  Think about what you've had to go through and what you're going to suffer in the weeks and months ahead.  This national catastrophe is the collective responsibility of Boris Johnson and the Conservatives.  But Rishi Sunak made those pivotal decisions.  Look at the consequences of not acting sooner, of dithering, the economic turmoil.  The loss of so much human life.  Rishi Sunak made those decisions.  And now all of us are going to pay. ",
