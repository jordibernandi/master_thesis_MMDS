It's another car vlog.  It's going to be another toned down car vlog because I've got someone sleeping in the back because they, yet again, were not behaving all that rationally earlier today.  So I just watched this segment of Dan Crenshaw on Bill Maher.  And for those of you who don't know, Bill Maher is still doing his show, except it's not in a studio in front of an audience.  It seems to be at his house or in his backyard with no audience, which really changes the dynamic of the show.  Dan Crenshaw, for those of you who may not know, is a former U.S.  Navy SEAL.  He is currently a U.S.  House Representative for Texas.  You probably know him.  He is the guy with the eye patch who Pete Davidson made fun of on Saturday Night Live. ",

            "text": "Crenshaw was recently on Bill Maher's show, and a portion of that interview went viral because of how Crenshaw wrecked Bill Maher in the context of that interview.  A six-minute portion of the interview made its rounds on social media, but the interview itself was actually a little bit over 14 minutes long, and I've got to tell you, there was a lot more to that interview than the six-minute clip that went viral.  The interview is in fact fascinating because it perfectly illustrates fundamentally flawed reasoning and basically high school level debate techniques.  Now I'm gonna break down and analyze what I feel to be the highlights of this interview, but before I do that, for full disclosure, I should tell you how I feel about these two particular parties because it might influence how you perceive my video.  Generally speaking, I don't really like Bill Maher, even if I do at times agree with his opinion.  And when I say I don't like Bill Maher, I'm not talking about him as a person, I don't know him as a person, I'm talking about him as a personality.  I don't like Bill Maher's public personality because I find him to be too mean-spirited too often, I find his reasoning to be too superficial, and I find him to be too intolerant of opposing views.  Notwithstanding the fact that I don't necessarily like his public personality, I do at times agree with the substance of what he has to say.  Flip side, when it comes to Dan Crenshaw, I do think I tend to like his public personality in as much as I know him from the news outlets where I get my information about him.  He seems reasonable, he seems thoughtful in his discussion, he seems tolerant of opposing ideologies, as can be evidenced from his interview with Bill Maher.  That being said, even though I think I like what I think of know of Dan Crenshaw in as well as I can know him from social media, I do at times tend to disagree with what he says on the substance of it.  Two concrete examples, I tend to agree with Bill Maher that there is nothing inherently offensive in referring to a virus or giving it a name that identifies the country from which it originated.  And I think I disagree with some of Dan Crenshaw's positions vis-a-vis background checks that might preclude people from lending their weapons to other people.  Whatever positions I have on gun ownership in general, I tend to think that people should not necessarily be allowed to lend their firearms to other people.  But whatever, this is just one big parenthesis for full disclosure so that you can dismiss my opinion if you think I suffer from bias, and so that I can explain to you that I can like people and disagree with them, and I can dislike people and still agree with them.  Now let's dissect and analyze this interview. ",

            "text": "How beautiful a concept is this?  It's a beautiful concept in more ways than one, and I think it's a beautiful concept in a deeper manner than Dan Crenshaw even means it here.  It's an old debate tactic, and we will get into it in the context of this video, but in general, people try to vilify their ideological adversaries, and the way they do that is to make it look as though their ideological adversaries are vilifying them.  And the way to make that happen is to operate on the basis that your ideological adversary is always trying to insult you so that you should be looking to be insulted.  But it's not just a deliberate debate tactic, it's actually a subconscious psychological phenomenon.  In adversarial discourse, people tend to reflexively take everything their ideological adversary is saying as an insult.  And this is one of those situations where I say everybody should have to practice law for at least one year to get used to the idea that you have to deal with things that your ideological adversaries are saying when they are not necessarily insults.  There is a fundamental difference between someone saying, you are wrong, versus someone saying, you are wrong.  And that difference is how one perceives the you in the sentence, you are wrong.  As a lawyer, when someone says it, they say you are wrong on a given subject.  But in real life, when people hear it, they say you are wrong as a person.  And there is a crucial distinction between the two that most people lose in the heat of battle, especially on social media.  When one learns how to make the spiritual and psychological distinction between you are wrong on an issue and you are wrong as a person, then true conversation can happen.  But in order for that to happen, people have to abandon the perspective that when someone says you are wrong on an issue, they mean you are wrong as a person.  You wanna go back inside and go watch a movie?  What?  All right.  Okay.  And above and beyond employing it as a debate tactic, you should abandon it as a psychological reflex.  From an inter-human perspective, I have found that I'm a lot happier giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they are not trying to insult me until incontrovertible proof to the contrary.  I make YouTube videos.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of comments on each video that I make.  Some are undeniable insults.  There's no question about it.  Other comments can be read as insults or attacks when read through those psychological blinders, but they might not necessarily be insults or attacks.  And when it comes to reading and responding to those comments, I think the important thing is to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were not trying to insult you.  If everyone did this in all aspects of life, from politics to social media, I think people would probably tend to get along a lot better.  But appreciating that this appears to be one of Dan Crenshaw's core beliefs, it will offer some insight into how he reasons and how he argues, as we will see in the rest of this video. ",

Load a question with a bunch of those as though they are facts, and then proceed to ask the question.  It's the shock and awe of debating in that you're basically just dropping a cluster bomb of highly disputed facts, then proceeding to ask a question on the basis that those facts are in fact undisputed.  Someone who does nothing but pass the buck, lie, finger point.  Shirk responsibility.  These are the disputed facts that Bill Maher just infused into his cluster bomb of a question to ask Dan Crenshaw.  And in the same question, Bill Maher goes from the shock and awe cluster bomb question to the personalizing the debate question.  Tell me how someone like you, with your background, can support someone like that who is guilty of all of the things I said as though they were fact.  How can you, someone who is as smart and brave and as accomplished as you, support someone like that?  Translation, if you support someone like that, you are not just wrong, you are wrong.  It is textbook high school debate personalizing the debate so you can demonize your adversary as opposed to actually trying to understand your adversary.  And incidentally, it's somewhat surreal to hear Bill Maher make such a statement without automatically hearing the audience cheer in support of the affirmation.  And this is another thing we're going to notice throughout the video is that positions seem a lot less powerful, a lot less dogmatic when you don't have the power of the audience behind you.  So within the first two minutes, Bill Maher has gone with the shock and awe, drop a cluster bomb of disputed facts, loaded question, then straight to the personalizing the debate, how dare you.

But because we live in this world with this perspective that if you are wrong on a subject, you are wrong as a person, we tend to think in this false dichotomy.  We live in a world where people tend to think that if you don't like someone, you have to take issue with everything they say.  And if you espouse certain beliefs of certain people, it necessarily means that you espouse all their beliefs, or that you like those people.  There is a fundamental distinction between you are wrong versus you are wrong.  And there is a fundamental distinction between I disagree with you versus I disagree with you.

If you did not illustrate what was wrong with what Dan Crenshaw was saying in those 15 minutes, you failed.  And again, personalizing the entire debate, reducing Dan Crenshaw's 15 minutes of thoughtful answers to a press spokesman for that cause.  And I may be projecting, but I think I see a moment in Dan Crenshaw's face when he realizes that this was a disingenuous conversation from the beginning.  With that one statement, Bill Maher effectively confirmed that there was nothing Crenshaw could have done but agree with Bill Maher in order for that conversation to be fruitful.  How insulting is that?  Crenshaw, former US Navy SEAL, served in Fallujah, doesn't have a mind of his own.  If he disagrees with Bill Maher, he is merely a press spokesman for a cause.  And that is why I say I do not like Bill Maher's public personality, because he is not about the free exchange of ideas, he is not about understanding the opposing ideas.  He is about pushing his own belief system, and if anyone dares to disagree with it, he writes them off as mere objects.  He writes them off as mere mouthpieces who are incapable of thinking for themselves.  And that is not how one engages in meaningful and sincere exchanges of ideas.
