            "text": "I'm at the Black Lives Matter protests on June 1st, 2020.  We're here in honor of George Floyd and against the police brutality that caused his senseless death.  When you come to a protest like this, it makes sense to bring a camera with you, to bring a phone with you, to make sure you can record it, you can get the message out.  The message is super important.  But those same phones, those same cameras can cause problems if the data gets into the hands of people who you're against.  And that includes the police, like these guys over here.  So make sure when you come to a protest, make sure that you've got a few things covered.  Make sure you've encrypted your device.  Make sure that your device has a strong password.  A strong password means not just four digits, it means the entire thing.  Six digits, a full textual password if you need to do that.  The stronger the password, the harder it is for somebody to guess and get into your phone.  Make sure that your phone is in airplane mode when you don't need to communicate.  That reduces the amount of signals that come off the phone.  The radio signals can be used to keep track of your device and keep track of where you are.  The police use those radio signals to keep track of protesters, and they could use them against you in the future.  So you want to make sure you don't do that.  Sometimes you need to communicate, turn it on.  But when you don't need it on, you can turn it off.  You have a right to record the police.  Make sure you record the police if they're doing something wrong.  You absolutely have that right, and it's important.  It's one of the checks that we have against police brutality and against police abuse.  The facial recognition systems can keep track of who you are, and we don't know how the police will use those pictures in the future.  If you have a mask, your face is hidden.  You're going to be in a better position from that.  If the cops do take you, make sure your phone is off.  If you can turn it off as they take you, that's good.  If you can just make sure that it's locked, don't leave it so that it can be unlocked with your thumbprint.  Don't leave it so it can be unlocked with your face.  Those are things that the police can use to unlock your phone for you.  And if they unlock your phone, it reveals lots of information that's in there about you and information that's about your friends and the people that you care about.  You don't want to turn that information over.  So make sure that it needs to be unlocked with a password.  If they do catch you, some of the cops may decide to offer you a drink, a soda, a water, a juice, or they might offer you a cigarette.  Don't take it.  Cops have been known to use those tricks as ways to gather your DNA.  If they can gather your DNA, they can then use that information later on.  It puts your DNA into a database, and that's a whole separate set of problems.  Those databases are biased against people of color.  Those databases are used to over-police the same communities that are downtrodden by the police every day.  So get out here, exercise your right to protest, stay as safe as you can, speak truth to power, tell people what matters.  Black lives matter. ",
