            "text": "Hello, this is Dara Hoffman Fox, and I'm here to continue reading to you from my book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  We are currently in chapter three, which is called Feeling the Fear and Doing It Anyway.  So this is now the second part of chapter three, which continues to explore different things you can do to help acknowledge and manage your fears during your gender identity journey.  This next suggestion is called setting appointment times with your fears.  If you find yourself constantly interrupted by your fear list, which was two videos ago, then this exercise is for you.  Fears often come up without any warning in the middle of your workday while you're hanging out with your partner, kids, or pets, or in the middle of a test at school.  They can also slowly seep into your mind when you are more relaxed and therefore more vulnerable when you're driving, showering, doing yoga, or when you're trying to sleep.  This exercise will help you create a plan for keeping your fears from overwhelming you and interrupting your life.  You'll learn to do this by setting appointment times with your fears.  By doing so, you gain control of your fears instead of letting them control you.  When you set boundaries with your fears, you're saying to them, I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of something right now.  You'll have to make an appointment and I'll get back to you then.  Go ahead, give this a try.  Step one, so get your paper and pen out.  There's gonna be several things to write down here.  When do they arrive?  Think about a typical day.  Are there certain times of day when your fears come up?  Are there certain situations that trigger them?  Step two, where can you meet them?  Now, imagine places where you can spend time with these fears.  This could be your car, a room in your home, somewhere out in nature, at a cafe, the gym, and so on.  Step three, how long will you meet with them?  Decide on a period of time you're going to set aside for these appointments with your fears.  Start with a small number such as five or 10 minutes and increase from there as you get the hang of this.  So here I have where you would write down number of minutes.  Step four, how many times per day?  How many times a day will you set these appointments?  Eventually you may even be able to change this to how many times per week.  So now you write down how many times per day.  Step five, where will you keep track of your appointments?  What is your favorite method of keeping track of things?  This could be a notebook or on your phone or your computer.  So write that down.  Step six, scheduling your appointments.  During your day, whenever a fear comes up, if it is not during one of your designated appointment times to spend with your fears, jot it down in the log you identified in step five, which is where are you going to keep track of your appointments?  Give yourself permission to let be meeting with it later.  Step seven, self-care before the appointment.  When your next year appointment arrives, go to one of the places you listed under step two, choose an activity from your self-care worksheet to do at the beginning of the appointment.  Do the same activity each time as this will create a comforting and grounding ritual.  Which self-care activity did you choose?  Step eight, start the clock.  Set a timer such as a watch, a phone, or something on your computer for how many minutes you have scheduled the appointment for.  Step nine, let the appointment begin.  Take a deep breath and say out loud or silently, so fear what brings you in today.  Then totally immerse yourself in the dialogue.  During the meeting, you can dialogue out loud, journal, scream, stomp around, punch the air, dance, laugh in fear's face, video or audio.  record yourself, draw, sing about it, immerse yourself into the experience.  Don't stop until your timer goes off.  Take another deep breath and say, well, thanks for coming, fear.  See you at our next appointment.  Step 10, self-care after your appointment.  Choose a post-appointment self-care activity.  This can be the same or different from the one at the beginning.  Again, do the same one every time so as to signify to yourself that this appointment is over and you can return to your life.  Which self-care activity did you choose?  Start paying attention to when your fears make themselves known, get into the habit of keeping track of them to tend to later, and create a ritual for when you will be spending quality time with these fears.  This will reduce the amount of distraction they create in your life and put you in the driver's seat as to when they will be addressed.  So that's it for that exercise.  In the next video, we're going to talk more about how you can take a positive approach.  I'll see you then. ",
