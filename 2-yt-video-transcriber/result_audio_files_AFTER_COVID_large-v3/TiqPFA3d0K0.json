            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to New Sex Toy Review.  Today's product is the Zamalia 3-in-1 Male Masturbator's Pocket Pussy with Realistic Mouth, Textured Vagina and Tight Anus Blowjob Stroker Anal Play.  Sex Toy for Men Fleshlight with Water-Based Lubricant by Zamalia.  So this, this is, this is something.  This is like, I don't know, this is, it's, it reminds me of, okay, come on a drink with me.  Like it's, okay, it's got a mouth.  It's got a butt and a vagina, but the butt is on like the wrong side of its body.  So it's almost like little boobs or like little legs.  So it's like a, it's like a sexy little homunculi inchworm.  Like if I were like a wizard, this would be like my, my familiar.  This would be my little animal buddy, my little homunculi, uh, little wizard person.  Anyway, this is a, there's a lot of interesting stuff right here.  Uh, obviously this is like a very weird toy, uh, because it's like a combination of multiple body parts into one toy, but it's less than $20.  So it's really cool.  Alright, so let's talk about this stuff individually.  The mouth is extremely realistic.  And even the teeth.  So usually with these kind of toys, the teeth are plastic.  These teeth aren't plastic.  They're molded, but they're slightly firmer.  They're flexible, but they're less flexible than the TPE that the regular toy is made out of.  So I'm not really sure how they did that.  But the TPE that the... that the teeth are made of is a little bit firmer, but it's set into the mouth perfectly.  It doesn't feel like hard plastic either.  So whatever they did, they did a really good job.  I'm really impressed with that.  Let me get a close up.  So you can see it's got the tongue, it's got the teeth.  So it's a really realistic mouth.  It's got the texture on the upper side of the mouth.  So it's a very realistic mouth.  It feels completely genuine.  On the other side, you have the vagina.  So the vagina hole has like a G-spot.  The texture, again, totally realistic.  However, the vagina, there is kind of a harder... a plastic, or more like a silicone ring in the middle of this toy.  When you pass that ring, the vagina transitions into the mouth.  So the hole goes all the way through.  So if you're using the vagina portion and you go too far in or squish this too far down, your penis will come out of her mouth like some type of some type of hentai, where your penis goes all the way through her body, Vlad the Impaler style, and comes out of her mouth.  So if that's been like a fantasy of yours, to like fuck a chick and have your dick come out of her mouth, then here you go, my dude.  There's a downside to that.  But before we get into that, there's the butthole.  This is the first time, like I've seen a lot of sex toys.  I have reviewed many sex toys in my day.  I have seen toys that are half mouth, half vagina before.  That's nothing new.  This is new, having a third hole.  So this is a $20 pocket pussy.  that has a mouth, a vagina, and a butthole in one pocket pussy.  So, I mean, I've seen pocket pussies that are just a vagina.  I've seen pocket pussies that have a mouth and a vagina.  This is the first time I've seen a pocket pussy that's a mouth, a vagina, and an anus in one toy.  Now, the anus isn't connected to anything.  So the anus only goes down and stops, whereas the vagina connects to the mouth.  Now, here's where that's important.  So, I mean, I'll just demonstrate.  I'll just stick my finger in here.  Hold on.  There we go.  go all the way through.  And as you can see, you can see my finger coming out of her mouth like that.  All right.  So you can see my finger coming out of her mouth.  So the reason why that's important is you have to understand that when you're masturbating with this, uh, when you come, it shoots out.  I mean, maybe not like super hard, but it does shoot out.  And so you have to be careful where you're aiming this because while you're jerking off with it, you could shoot your cum and it can shoot out of her mouth or at least drip out of her mouth.  It can get places.  So I would have liked to see some plug or some cap.  There's been toys that are half vagina, half mouth that have a plastic cover and you can put a cap on the end that you're not using.  I would have preferred that, but those cost a little more.  This is less than $20.  So for the price you're paying, you're getting a lot.  The fact that it doesn't come with a plastic shell with a cap, For what you're paying, it's understandable.  Just be aware that if you're using the vagina or the mouth, you're going to have to plug up the other hole, possibly using your thumb.  You could try squeezing it shut.  I don't know.  Or just stuff a rag in it or something.  Otherwise, you're going to drip, possibly make a mess that will make cleanup a little bit more difficult.  But that's really the only downside to this toy.  If you've ever used a pocket pussy, you pretty much know what to expect.  It's realistic.  I like the silicone ring in the middle.  It does add a little bit.  This is a very good pocket pussy.  If you've never tried a pocket pussy, this is a really good price, $20.  And you get three holes.  You get the mouth, the vagina, and the butt.  so i mean just as a value.  i've never i've never seen a toy offer so much for so little.  so if you've never owned a pocket or you want to find out if it's right for you or you know if all you've ever done is jerk off with your hand and you just want to try something.  20 is nothing and you're getting a lot for that money.  but be aware that these holes are connected now.  that's a good thing.  It makes cleanup extremely easy.  All you do is you go to the sink, basically have her deep throat the faucet, and it will shoot water all the way through.  So just, you know, stick her mouth over the faucet, turn it on, water will come up the other side, and then vice versa, put the vagina over the faucet, and then water will gush out the mouth, washes everything out super easily.  Now the butt, let me show you how deep that goes.  So the butt goes to... about here where my finger is sticking out.  So about here is where the, how far the butt goes.  So the butt does not connect to either the mouth or the vagina.  So if you're looking for something to finish in where you can come and you don't have to worry about it shooting anywhere, then you want to finish in the butt.  if you want to make it easy to clean up.  So I actually like that.  this toy has options.  So if you don't like the concept of coming in one hole and having it drip out the other, you can finish in the anus.  If you want easier cleanup, you can finish in the vagina or the mouth, but just be aware that it might leak out.  So, you know, again, for $20, this is an excellent deal.  Probably the best deal I've seen on a pocket pussy.  I mean, fleshlights go for like $50 and they just have one hole.  This has three.  So if that wasn't good enough, I have a 15% off coupon code.  So not only is it $20 normally, you save an additional 15% off with the coupon code and you can have this pocket pussy, but that's not it.  So it comes with a little thing of lubricant.  So this is Zamalia Relieve Dry water-based lubricant.  It's fine, nothing to write home about.  It's just, it's kind of like Astroglide.  So it's a good lubricant.  It comes with a toy.  So, you know, a little bit of lubricant is probably going to be like $5, $10 anyway if you go to the store.  So this is only $20, has three holes, and comes with basically a $5 to $10 little tube of lubricant anyway.  So you can subtract that from the price as well.  And then you subtract 15% off of that.  This is an amazing deal.  Is this the best toy I've ever used in my life?  No.  But for $20 with free lube and 15% off, basically there's no reason not to get this unless you're just completely... you've met your quota for sex toys and you just don't need anything.  But if you just have never tried a sex toy, this is a very good entry point.  You really can't go wrong for the price.  Now, Zamalia also sent me another thing of lube.  This is in a different package.  And I didn't actually request this.  So they just sent this to me.  Maybe it's a gift.  I'm not sure.  But I'll mention in this video.  So this is natural aloe lube.  So you can see on the thing, it says natural aloe.  It feels just like regular lube.  It does have aloe in it, but I don't really notice a difference at all.  It says not to be used for oral, so it doesn't have a flavor or anything.  So if you like drinking aloe water, that's not what this is for.  I guess this is more for like woo chicks who want things that are natural.  So maybe if you're Into natural stuff and you you don't like these icky chemicals on your lube and you want something with aloe.  Zamalia does make a aloe based Lubricant which works really well.  now aloe isn't the primary ingredient.  It's like the third ingredient so it's not like entirely aloe based and It's basically just lube that has aloe in it.  Works great.  I don't have any issues with it.  More lube is always appreciated.  I run out of this stuff a lot.  So that's all I have to say about this toy.  Again, if you've never tried a sex toy and you're looking to start your collection, $20 is an excellent deal.  You can find the coupon code to save an additional 15%.  And it comes with free lube.  And it has three holes.  And you can finish in any hole you want, depending on how much you want cleanup to be hard or possibility of making a mess.  I like the versatility of this toy.  Thank you, Zomalia, for sponsoring this video.  Again, check out the coupon code.  This is TurdFlingyMonkey.  Thank you for watching.  And take care. ",
