The new house that, let's say, Adrian and Eddie built.  And this is a guest house that we've put on our property.  So, you might have seen us when it first started.  We just had some bricks down here.  Come inside.  So inside now we have... Have you got some working hard stuff here?  Inside, so we have the bedroom and there's a roof on.  So this is the bedroom inside and as you can see it's quite spacious.  This is like our guest room but I brought it really for my daughter when she comes.  I don't know how regularly she's going to be here but There's somewhere for her to stay and have privacy.  So this is there.  This is the shower room for her in there.  Do you want to go in there?  Come inside.  Go inside.  Come inside, you see.  And you've got a nice view over here.  And then here.  It's a shower room.  And then here we've just got just a little area.  we'll probably put a chair.  And so It's a nice little guest house where people come to stay.  And the storeroom is done.  So... Should we open it?  I got it, I got it.  Okay, cool.  So this is the storeroom.  And as you can see, it's already nearly full.  And we've only just built it.  Haha, just wanted to show you this as well.  So whenever you see this, you know where we're going.  That's it.  Automated citizenship for African descendants. ",

And that's the pool after rain season.  We'll start digging it out.  And as you can see, look at our trees.  The rainy season has enabled us our bananas to grow, avocado trees to grow, purple trees to grow, sugar plant trees to grow.  Everything is growing really well.  And also the pineapples that Steph planted.  So I also wanted to show you this up here on top there.  that is the um solar water heater.  that is a solar water heater.  so um i just wanted to show you it because someone was asking me how do we get hot water with our solar system?  so as you can see we've got solar panels up there also on the roof.  that is our water tank and that is where we get our internet from.  that is the receiver.  so I just wanted to give you a quick update and show you around the latest developments on the Blacksit family compound.  So can you imagine this pool house when it's done?  I hope that, you know, we can have a little pool party and a lot of us, especially you that are coming over, can come and enjoy, have some good music, all different genres of music.  And of course, reggae, one of my favourite.  And of course, local Gambian music, my favourite. ",
