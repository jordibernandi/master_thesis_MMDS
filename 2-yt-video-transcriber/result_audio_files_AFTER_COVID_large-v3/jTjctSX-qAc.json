            "text": "the atheist based patreon project presents biblical parables.  why so?  uh i recently did a video which should be posted already uh on metaphor and we did looked at it from the standpoint of star trek and other things.  uh and the whole reason for doing that video to talk about the fact that metaphors by definition are inefficient and inaccurate ways to communicate ideas.  If your goal is clarity in communication, metaphor is not what you should be doing.  As a matter of fact, binary and the strictures of various computer programming languages are going to be far more close to a digitally accurate clarity of, here's my meaning, I want to give it to you.  Now, I'm not saying that metaphor and parables aren't useful.  They absolutely are.  It's just that they're not clear in what they're communicating.  And when it comes to the Bible, there's loads and loads of parables and metaphors and sayings, and people love this.  And I think it's in part because they get to see what they want to see.  Maybe, just maybe, there's another way to look at the parables that you've been reading in your Bible.  So let's see what's there.  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.  What does it mean to say that the Lord is my shepherd?  Well, when I was a Christian, much like the way I understood a Rolling Stone gathers no moss to be a keep moving suggestion.  When I looked at the verse, the Lord is my shepherd, I thought, ah, That's because the shepherd loves the flock and tends to the flock and keeps the flock from danger.  This is what this means.  And I'm not going to claim that it is intended to mean anything else.  What I am going to do is point out that when I look at the passage now, I also have to recognize that there's a reason that a shepherd looks after the flock so that he can shear them so that he can kill them and cook them.  shepherd isn't someone who just loves sheep.  the shepherd is tending to what the shepherd owns.  there are people i'm sure who just love sheep and maybe some of them keep sheep.  you know hey we've got a ranch we're never gonna.  you know we're not gonna share them.  well we're gonna share them because you know that's good for their health or whatever else as if as if nature uh evolutionary process set up this so that sheep need to be sheared?  I don't know.  There may be a symbiotic relationship between domesticated sheep and what we do to them.  But generally speaking, the sheep are the property of the shepherd.  And the reason to looking after them is because that sheep has value to you for food, for clothing, for trade, etc.  That's what it means to be, I am the sheep, you are the shepherd.  And As if that weren't clear, I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still fine with the notion that, hey, the Lord is my shepherd, that's him trying to keep me from harm, except that if that were the only parable in the Bible, I think you could go either way.  If it were the only parable, hey, the Lord is my shepherd, you'd be fine with that.  But it doesn't just say that, and there are other parables.  What if for those other parables, put together, have a consistent message?  that isn't just, man, look how much this shepherd loves me, but hey, why does the shepherd love me?  You are the potter, I am the clay.  There's another... proverbial metaphor of reaching out to God saying that, I am the clay and you are the potter.  Well, the potter doesn't love the clay.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not a potter.  I know that there are people who pot.  As a matter of fact, I have a friend who does pottery.  I'm sure that he loves to do pottery.  I'm not sure that he loves the clay.  I'm not sure that he's a caretaker of the clay.  He's the one who decides what the clay will be.  Here's a lump of mud that I'm going to form into something.  Now that can be beautiful.  I've seen amazing pottery.  But to talk about a human being as if they are something for you to mold into what you want, that's manipulation.  That's indoctrination.  That is psychological torment.  It would be like saying, you're my child, and when you grow up, you're going to be exactly what I want you to be, and I'm going to force feed you this, and I'm going to make sure that you do this, and you're going to be required to do this.  There's nothing about individual freedom or autonomy there, and there's nothing that shows that the potter cares for the clay for anything more than its usefulness to them.  It's not like potters run around the world going, ah, there's some mud over there.  I love that mud.  Don't get me wrong.  It may be useful for their purposes, but it's not like they're genuinely trying to save mud from being something else.  In 1 Corinthians 13, it says, if I speak in the tongues of men and angels... But I do not have love.  I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And it seems to me at first blush that the purpose of this proverb is to basically, along with everything else in 1 Corinthians, talk about the value and need of love.  That if you do this, you may think you're doing good, but if you don't have love, ",
