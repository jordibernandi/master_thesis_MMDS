            "text": "We need to say what the prophets said and do what the prophets did.  I want to be very careful about what I'm about to do, because I want you to understand why.  Say what the prophets said and do what the prophets did.  The rules in my house, you can ask my children, the rules in my house, a foul mouth is punished severely.  My children never grew up in a house with a father with a foul mouth or was loose with his lips.  If I was to curse in front of my children, my children would be shocked.  And I praise God for that because before God saved me, I had a terrible, terrible mouth.  It came from a wicked heart.  It was constant.  And God redeemed me.  And one of the first things He did is He changed the way that I spoke.  You can ask for references from my family or my church body.  But we have to understand that there are different speed limits... in different locations.  for a reason.  One of the things one of my heroes Doug Wilson says is that there's a speed limit for the highway and a speed limit for the sidewalk.  They're not the same.  for a reason.  You have to be more aggressive in the one lane.  Jesus shows us this as well.  We know that Jesus was known as a friend of sinners.  He loved tax collectors and prostitutes.  People knew it.  He hung out with them to the degree that he was slandered.  People were calling him a drunkard and a glutton.  but put Jesus into a fight.  And Jesus, when dealing with spiritually dangerous things, Jesus tells the truth in hard ways.  He uses a serrated edge.  Jesus calls people sons of hell.  Jesus talks about people as whitewashed tombs, people full of dead, rotting corpses.  You are dead, Jesus confronted people and warned them about hell.  Jesus always told the truth.  And when put Jesus into a fight, read Matthew 23, the meek and mild.  Sweet Jesus isn't there.  He is confronting people who are endangering people's souls.  I'll give you another example of how the prophets say things and how they do things.  If you don't know this, I encourage you to get to know it.  I think our Evangelifish culture has lost sight of this.  But this is how Ezekiel speaks about God's harlot wife.  He says... Ezekiel 16, 23.  And after all your wickedness, woe, woe to you, declares the Lord God, you built yourself a vaulted chamber.  This is what he's talking to his people.  and made yourself a lofty place in every square.  At the head of every street, you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring.  You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring.  to provoke me to anger.  Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies.  How sick, God says in verse 30, is your heart, declares the Lord God, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute, building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street and making your lofty place in every square.  Yet you were not like a prostitute because you scorned payment.  Did you catch that?  He says you're different than other whores.  because you didn't even want to get paid.  Adulterous wife who receives strangers instead of her husband.  Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings, so you were different from other women in your whorings.  No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment while no payment was given to you.  Therefore, you were different.  That's powerful.  Serrated Edge, God telling the truth about a bride who goes and offers herself to all the pagan nations, but doesn't even receive a payment back.  She's just multiplying her whorings, going out to all the pagan nations.  So in light of these issues, BLM, LGBT, and the abortion issue, even jellyfish woke pastors You say, homo lust is not a sin.  Even though Jesus said, sin begins in the heart.  You say, we aren't under law, we're under grace.  We don't need God's stipulated standards of justice.  Yet you throw up your Marxist communist fists shouting, no justice, no peace.  You've swallowed the member of the Marxist, denying what God says about our unity and identity in the Messiah, and you teach people that our identity is in our color.  Shame on you.  You deny God's own word, accusing people of guilt for the sinful color of their ancestors.  Thus, you invalidate the word of God for the sake of your woke bullshit.  I could do this, by the way, more Pauline, if you like.  You invalidate it for the sake of your scubala.  Or I think if I want to be faithful and I want to say what the prophets say and do what they did, I need to be more like Ezekiel.  The woke evangelical whore is a slut who lies down in the middle of a burning city, spreading her legs to the rioters and looters, spreading her legs to Marx, Engels, Alinsky, and Soros.  Only she knows the history.  Marxism and communism plunges nations into poverty.  There's no money in this for her, but she wasn't looking for payment anyways.  The evangelical woke slut is a slut whose behavior makes Cardi B's WAP look like performance art for preschoolers.  Pray that God removes these pimps from the pulpit and fills it with prophets who will keep his bride pure and faithful.  Let's pray. ",
