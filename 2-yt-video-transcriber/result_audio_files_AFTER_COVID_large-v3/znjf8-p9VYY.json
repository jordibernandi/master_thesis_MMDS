When I was in the prison, God spoke to me the revelation and what would take place.  And he taught me, because when I, you know, I have my Revelation class right here in front of me.  But it says, the Revelation 6, 7 says, when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast, the living being, say, come and see.  And I looked, and behold, a pale greenish, the color of death, and a corpse, and sickness.  And this horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, Listen to me.  That word death in the Revelation, the fourth horse of the apocalypse, that word death there means plague or pestilence.  And it says death and plague and pestilence and hell followed with him and power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth and To kill and destroy with sword and with hunger.  The sword has already happened.  There's warfare all over.  It's unbelievable.  But then hunger, the starvation, and their warning is now, the information I'm reading is, even if the plague doesn't go as bad as they feel it could, it can cause destruction.  Worldwide starvation.  That's right.  Is that right? ",
