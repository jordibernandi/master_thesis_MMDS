Yesterday, Barr basically made a statement that said, you can lie to the FBI and that's okay.  And there is still a ton of evidence that the investigation was absolutely an appropriate one, that Flynn was absolutely someone who should have been investigated.  And he, at the end of the day, chose to lie about his contacts with foreign countries.  If Bill Barr wants to say that's not a crime, that's a precedent.  I'm not sure either party wants to set Harris. ",

There's a big difference between talking to people colluding and how.  if that's the standard for collusion then how come you're not screaming for accountability for fusion GPS and the DNC and the Clinton campaign for literally meeting with FSB agents from Vladimir Putin for taking disinformation and for using that against the political rival in a presidential election in this country.  and if I mean the message was not.  the message was exactly the opposite to millions of people in this country Not that you can just lie to the FBI and get away with it.  The message was that accountability that so many people in this country have been asking for for so long is finally actually going to happen.  And Bill Barr has never said that his mission is about defending President Trump.  He said it in the CBS interview and he has said it from the beginning.  that his duty is to protect the rule of law in this country to protect the Justice Department and law enforcement and he's doing that by holding them to the standard to which they have sworn to uphold and holding them to the same standard that every single person in this country would be held to if they were facing similar charges.  so what about lying to Congress?  because all these people McCabe and Comey and all of them they've all lied and lied and lied And there's more information to come here that's going to show exactly what really happened with Michael Flynn.

            "text": "So that guy actually got put in jail over that video.  And then that September 12th, 2012, and then literally that same night, September 12th, 2012, when talking to Egyptian prime minister, she said, quote, we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film.  It was a planned attack, not a protest.  Wow, if she's so into quote-unquote lying, well, how come she wasn't bringing that up when Hillary Clinton was running for president in 2016?  Interesting.  And then here is another liar, Barack Obama, as we see here in this great thread that Q just linked.  Jonathan Turley's status here, where he is pointing out a quote from Obama, where I guess Obama coming out saying on Flynn, the quote, there is no president that anyone can find for someone who has been charged with perjury, just getting off scot-free, which, you know what?  His guy's got a lot of nerve.  This dude.  was unchecked for eight years.  I mean, we've said little things here and there, but I mean, for the most part, even we would just forget about politics for six months in a clip sometimes while this guy did whatever he freaking wanted.  And this was something he wanted and he's mad it didn't happen, which this guy points out a great point.  It's a curious statement because first and foremost, Flynn wasn't even charged with perjury.  Second, he continues, we know now that Obama discussed charging Flynn under the Logan Act, which has never been successfully used to convict anyone and is flagrantly unconstitutional.  Well, I'd like to see them use it against John Kerry, to be honest, but I get what this guy's saying 100%.  Third, it reaffirms reports that Obama was personally invested in this effort.  Finally, there is precedent.  This is, ah, this is so great.  He cites a case, I believe this was from 77, where they had such dismissals.  And then, the Justice Department has dismissed cases in the past, including the Stevens case.  That was requested by President Obama's own Attorney General, Eric Holder, for the same reason, misconduct by prosecutors.  It was done by the same judge, no less.  judge sullivan.  so how's that for president.  so these people lie.  they just lie.  and here's the case he's referencing from april 7 2009 so they didn't even waste any time.  it says that u.s attorney general eric holder had asked sullivan last week to dismiss the verdict and the indictment after acknowledging that prosecutors had failed to share with steven's attorney's notes from an interview with the prosecution's key witness that contradicted the witness's trial testimony.  So that's exactly what just happened here.  As you see now, it's coming out that Flynn actually did stated it was possible that he had talked with Kislak on the issue, but if he did, he did not remember doing so, which destroys the whole case, amongst other quite shady stuff that is coming out right now.  So once again, President Obama lying to the American people because he's mad that his little hit job on General Flynn didn't go through.  And if you're wondering why they felt the need to do a hit job on General Flynn in the first place, besides being Donald Trump's national security advisor, which they knew what that meant.  This headline says it all.  August 10, 2015, former DIA Chief Michael Flynn says rise of ISIS was a willful decision of the United States government.  Ain't that the truth?  Where we go one, we go all. ",
