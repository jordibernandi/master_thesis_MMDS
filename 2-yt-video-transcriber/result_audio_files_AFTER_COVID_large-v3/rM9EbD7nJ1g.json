            "text": "Hello everybody, today we are gonna do something a little more classical for my channel.  For those who don't know my channel used to almost exclusively do reply videos.  I took them down because they were lazy content and I didn't like them.  but when I came across this I knew I would have to do something about it.  It's one minute long and I found it on r slash jordan peterson with 2.5 thousand upvotes and it was just so bad that I have to make a reply video.  It's about the not real marxism argument which you have probably never heard.  That's because it's really the not real socialism argument but that distinction doesn't seem important to him.  What I will do is I will show you the entire thing and then I will get into the big argumentative problems and after that I will take cheap shots like when he says plainly wrong stuff.  And before we start I would like to say that I don't necessarily think that the USSR wasn't an attempt at socialism.  I think they did the best they could have done in their position and if you want to call it socialism I won't stop you.  I will point out where many say it wasn't but if you consider it socialism that's alright.  But even in that case the points Peterson makes are still faulty.  and if you too think wasn't, you should still have a look at all the mistakes he makes, either to make better arguments why it was socialism or to be able to refute people who repeat Peterson's faulty points.  But anyway, here goes this video. ",

            "text": "And then when the Marxists say, well that wasn't real Marxism, what it really means, and I've thought about this for a long time, it's the most arrogant possible statement anyone could ever make.  It means, if I would have been in Stalin's position, I would have ushered in the damn utopia instead of the genocidal massacres, because I understand the doctrine of Marxism and everything about me is good.  It's like, well, think again, sunshine.  You don't understand it.  You don't understand it.  And you're not that good.  And if the power was in your hands, assuming you had the competence, which you don't, You wouldn't have done any better, and even if you had, there would have been someone else waiting right behind you to shoot you the first time you actually tried to do anything good.  And that's what happened to all the old guard who ran the damn revolution.  Stalin rounded them all up and shot them, along with their families and millions of other people.  So even if you do happen to be that avatar of moral purity that you claim implicitly, the probability that you'd get to act out.  your goodness in relationship to those possessed by your ideology is zero.
