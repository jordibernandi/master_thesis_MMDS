            "text": "When I was little, my father was famous.  He was the greatest samurai in the empire.  Hey everybody, my name is Jerry Williams, aka Greater Sapien.  Thanks for stopping by.  I have a new microphone, so hopefully this will sound a lot better than my past.  live streams have sounded.  And I've got a whole new video processing setup, so hopefully I'll be able to knock out some unscripted videos fairly quickly on a daily or every other day basis.  Just quick pieces just to keep in contact with folks.  But I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and so I always end up taking more time on the production end.  So what I've done is I've set up some really quick templates so I can just drop videos in, knock them out, export them, and hopefully get them up online within like 30 minutes of having recorded them.  So that's what this is here.  I don't really have much to talk about.  I'm just going to briefly respond to something I saw recently.  It's another example of how whenever someone that seems to be a globe denier or even like a moon landing denier in this case, their arguments always seem to be based in their ignorance of the science or the physics or just outright denial of it altogether.  For example, in this case, a flat earther was doing his live stream and decided to talk about his doubts about the moon landing.  And the doubts he had was due to how the Apollo craft would be able to catch up with the Earth.  And he posed the scenario with some numbers that don't really matter.  They were just kind of made up on the spot, so I'm not going to get on him for that.  But it was something like this.  If the Earth is moving around the sun at something like 67,000 miles an hour, these were just, like I said, random numbers he was giving, And say we have a rocket that can go at top speed of 15,000 miles per hour.  That's not the speed that we have him go.  He knows that.  He was just literally just making this up.  So we have a rocket that can go 15,000 miles per hour.  And so it takes off from the Earth and it and the Earth are going at the 67,000 miles per hour.  And then it leaves orbit of the Earth and then it heads over toward the moon.  OK, and it lands on a moon, does its thing there.  OK, now in his his problem was the idea that the Earth is still moving along.  You know, it's three days later or whatever.  The Earth is still moving along at sixty seven thousand miles per hour.  And this craft is on the moon and now it has to take off and accelerate fast enough to catch up with the Earth.  And so he's saying if that thing's going sixty seven thousand miles per hour and it's been doing it for several days now, There's no way mathematically in his mind for that spacecraft to catch up with the Earth because it just can't go fast enough.  It's already going 67.  You can only go 15.  You can't catch up.  And that's the issue he's having.  Now, this is, again, it's a basic misunderstanding of how physics works.  It's the concept that once it leaves Earth, it's a separate thing.  First off, there's the idea that the moon is like the stationary object, not doing anything.  It's just sitting there, and the Earth just moves away from it.  is part of the picture that I'm seeing in this gentleman's mind.  So the idea is that when the Earth and the rocket are together, once the rocket leaves, it has no motion of its own other than the motion that is gained by the rocket.  And so it goes off toward the moon, and then it takes off and has to use only the motion of the rocket to catch back up.  And that's just a basic misunderstanding of how motion works.  I know most of you know this, but for those who don't, because people keep hitting me up in the chat, they don't understand this.  The Earth and the Moon are all moving together.  They're all going in kind of the same direction.  They're all going around the Sun.  So they're all going on.  They're their own little system.  Now, so there's a rocket that's on the Earth, and it leaves.  So say it's between the Earth and the Moon.  It's still going in the same direction, as the Earth and the Moon at the same, more or less the same speed in that direction.  It's just then added a different vector to move it toward the Moon.  So they're all going this way, and now it's going between the two.  But the whole system is still going that way.  It gets to the Moon.  While it's sitting there on the Moon, the Moon and the Earth are still moving in the same direction.  So the rocket is still with the Earth in that same system.  So all it has to do, since it's already going the same 67,000 miles an hour as the Earth, is add the additional speed in order to catch up.  And for some reason, flat earthers, moon landing deniers, are all kind of in the same bunch when it comes to this.  They're unable to grasp the concept of the whole system moving, and this being an object moving within that system.  Now, you give an example of something like, hey, you're on a train, and you're all sitting on the train, and you have a ball, and you throw it to someone across the train.  The train is moving 75 miles an hour.  take that ball, and the maximum, you have a relatively weak arm, the maximum you can throw the ball is 50 miles an hour.  So you throw the ball over to your friend who's sitting there and he catches it.  Now, you're still on the train, so you've moved ahead, you know, a ways in the few seconds that it's over there.  You're still moving.  You're moving at 70 miles an hour that way.  So how can your friend throw that ball and catch up to you when he can only throw the ball at 50 miles per hour and you're moving 70 miles per hour that way.  Well, your friend is moving 70 miles an hour too.  You're both going that way.  So the ball is already going 70 miles per hour because it's in your friend's hand.  He just adds another 50 miles an hour.  Why you're throwing a ball that fast on the train, I don't know.  But he throws another 50 miles an hour to catch up with you over there.  That's the same thing that's happening.  Now, I don't understand why... globe deniers, moon landing deniers have such a difficult time grasping that type of thing, but they do.  So I just thought I would comment on that.  But mostly this was just a reason to put together a quick video just to try my process out.  Hopefully this sounds better.  I will be putting out videos on a fairly regular basis at least every other day, if not sooner.  They're going to be short like this, probably responding to comments.  So if there's a topic you want me to briefly comment on, let me know and maybe they'll get thrown into the rotation.  All right, everybody.  Thanks very much.  You take care.  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by congratulating the last night victory. ",
