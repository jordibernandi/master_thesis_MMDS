I'd say, Chris, one of the cooler things about working with CloseUp is they brought you all to the table, which are first-time voters.  that are the people that really people need to hear from, not, quite frankly, Chris or I.

And just in general, voting for politicians who will advocate for measures that effectively combat climate change and also acknowledge the scientific evidence we have relating to, like, the need to combat climate change.  So I think that's one of my big issues.  And then also the reality is that the Supreme Court battle and the election are very intertwined this year.  And the fact that Amy Cotton Barrett hasn't actually taken a stance on whether or not she will vote to repeal Roe v. Wade makes, I think, gender equality another big issue in this election.  So even though it might not directly influence it, that is, like, another issue that's definitely driving me to vote this year. ",

And I think for me, one big thing that's making me really excited about voting is how racial equity is popping up on the candidates' positions.  I think that right now we've certainly seen sort of a \u2013 we're starting to really think about it and we're starting to really analyze it.  the inequities within our nation.  And I think that racial equity is so tied in with healthcare and with climate justice and with gender equality.  And there are so many things that racial equity encompasses.  And so that's a really big issue for me when I'm voting.  And I think, especially with COVID-19 and people being unemployed, housing is another big thing.  Seeing how how federal funding is going into housing.  I want to be an urban planner.  That's what I'm going to school for.  And so seeing how candidates want to allocate funding to end sort of these discriminatory housing policies, which we're seeing which are very closely tied in to issues of racial equity and sort of exasperated by COVID-19 and seeing more people unemployed.

A lot of my goals were to.  I want to bring opportunities.  I want to bridge the gaps between inequities that prevent students from finding their passions in education.  That may prevent students from going to a club they really love because they don't have transportation.  Stuff that makes students like.  really want to go to school.  And so stuff like that has been really hit home for me.  Right now in college, I'm currently working in a lab, and one of my favorite projects is we're teaching teachers how to have these difficult conversations with students.  So I think stuff like that, they can understand what maybe their peers are going through.  If we can help teachers address these inequities that may hinder a child's education, That's probably one of the most important things for me.  But everyone has a different experience, and everyone can relate to this in some way, shape, or form.  That's amazing. ",

And then in terms of platforms that have been really useful for specifically learning more about the candidates that are up for election, I know Ballotopedia was a great resource for me when I was filling out my ballot to just like see, okay, like these are the amendments on my ballot.  Like these are the proposed charters.  These are the candidates.
