I decided to run for my seat on Castle Hill City Council because I had the time and the energy to work.  I got a very good response.  I went to more than 500 residents.  They complained bitterly about the city.  and that they could not even get ahold of anyone because the city manager would not return their calls.  Their streets were not being fixed.  They're my neighbors.  We'll see you later.  That's what they talked about.  They were glad to see someone that was gonna finally be able to do something for them.  And I won.  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.  By 53% of the vote.  And of the state, so help me God.  And of the state, so help me God.  Congratulations.  and I only tried to do my job and represent them. ",

The Castle Hills police captain comes over, taps me on the shoulder, and tells me the mayor wants to speak with me.  I go over to the mayor, and he asks me where is the petition that was turned in, and I told him I didn't know where it was.  He proceeded to tell me that he thought it was in my binder, that he could see a little clip.
