            "text": "Well, well, everybody, we've had intriguing twists and turns in our campaign to abolish Australia's campus kangaroo courts.  Regular readers will remember that almost a year ago, Queensland Senator Amanda Stoker did a magnificent job grilling bureaucrats from our university regulator about the unfair treatment of students accused of sexual assault on our campuses.  The university regulator is known as TEQSA, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency.  This is the agency which is there to tell the universities how to behave.  And it's TEQSA which, in effect, instructed our universities to set up the Kangaroo Courts.  So last year, Amanda Stoker had these bureaucrats squirming when she waved in front of them one of their extraordinarily biased documents, all about adjudicating campus rape cases, pointing out that it contained not one word about the rights of the accused.  Well, last night she had another go, speaking in Senate Estimates once again to Nick Saunders, who's the Chief Commissioner of TEXA.  But also present was the new CEO of TEQSA, Alastair McLean, who's only been in the job a month.  We're hoping that McLean might be the new broom.  TEQSA needs to clean up their act after their shameful history of doing the bidding of feminist activists by bullying universities into setting up regulations to usurp criminal law.  The whole aim has been to achieve more rape convictions by lowering the standard proof and denying the accused students their legal rights.  McLean's previous job was CEO of Victoria's Anti-Corruption Commission, IBAC, and he was also once senior advisor to former Prime Minister John Howard.  So this should be a man interested in ensuring regulators do their job properly rather than pushing the universities to promote ideologically different policies.  Yesterday, the group of lawyers who are helping with my campaign. ",
