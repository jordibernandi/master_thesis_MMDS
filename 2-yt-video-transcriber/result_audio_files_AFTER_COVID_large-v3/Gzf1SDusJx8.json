            "text": "Social media.  Celebrities, influencers, and YouTubers.  So much of the time it feels like one worldview, one position is tolerated.  Many of them don't say outright what their politics are.  Many of them do.  None of them need to.  And none of them will say what I'm about to.  I'm a conservative influencer.  Being a conservative woman in today's day and age is not easy.  You'll be told that you have internalized misogyny.  You'll be told that you don't care about other women's well-being.  You'll be told that you aren't a real woman.  But none of that is true.  Conservative women are the backbone of American society.  We prioritize marriage and children, support our husbands, and support ourselves.  We teach our families the strength of women both inside the home and out.  We help our husbands grow, not by obeying their every word, but by bolstering their strengths and tamping down their weaknesses.  We live with values that encourage people to be better.  We fight for what's right, even when the world tells us that everyone should do what they want, regardless of consequences.  We stand hand in hand with men, not against them.  And we shouldn't have to remain silent about our views like I did for years.  You've been forgotten and left behind as magazines and movies decided.  you're outdated.  You've been told that the best way to be a woman is to act more like a man.  You've been told that you don't care about women because you care about a child in her womb.  You've been told that sleeping around is empowering, but waiting till marriage is ridiculous.  You've been told that believing in God is pass\u00e9.  You've been silenced about your views.  But not anymore.  Let's take back the culture so women can be women.  Let's talk about reclaiming your femininity.  Let's talk about dating with purpose.  Let's talk about finding balance in career and home life.  Let's talk about being an awesome, loving wife, but also being the kind of wife who makes your husband a better man.  Let's talk about how to dress fashionably and conservatively.  Let's talk about how to do your makeup for a night at the opera, not a night at the club.  Let's talk about life.  from a conservative perspective.  And let's not be afraid to do it.  Thank you guys so much for watching today's video.
