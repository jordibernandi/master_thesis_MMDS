If you find the word atheist unacceptable to describe this, I don't think your objections are entirely honest.  Let's do this.  Bionic Dances YouTube channel!  Greetings fellow space travelers, Bionic Dance here.  The fight over the definition of atheism rages on, and the problem as I see it is largely down to our reasons for using the word.  Those who insist that atheism is declaring that there is no God seem more interested in a formal debate.  When people claim that atheism is a lack of belief, what they seem to be doing is trying to describe themselves to describe the nature of their non-belief.  The debater's definition doesn't have room for the nuance of people's belief or its lack, and that is why we're having this argument at all. ",
