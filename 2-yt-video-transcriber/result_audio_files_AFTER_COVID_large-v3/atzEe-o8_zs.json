            "text": "Hey there, Galen Druk here.  There are 12 days until Election Day, and one of the big questions heading into November 3rd is when we'll find out the results of the election.  That's a big question this year because so many people are voting by mail, and that's a relatively new thing for so many people to be using mail voting.  Now, different states have different rules when it comes to how they let people vote by mail, when they count their ballots, how late those ballots can come in after the election, even if they've been postmarked by Election Day.  And so different states are going to have different counting times.  Also, some states are just more used to counting mail ballots than other states are.  So in terms of whether or not we find out the results on election night really comes down to what states we know the results from on election night and whether or not those races are too close to call.  So in order to get a better sense of when we might know the results of the election, I'm going to rely on a new interactive that we just published.  So allow me to.  We are interactive right on over.  This is the closest we are getting at 538 to a magic election night wall.  And you can see that we show the probabilities of Joe Biden and President Trump winning the election.  And you can mess around and show the results in different individual states.  And that will change the forecast of the election overall.  So say we know the results of the election in Florida on election night.  If Trump ends up winning Florida, we'll see that the odds of Trump winning go from about 13% to 42%.  Now Biden is still favored in that scenario, but we'd have to find out whether or not states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin voted for Biden before we could really say.  And one of the challenges is that we're not expecting results out of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin the night of the election.  Now, of course, if we find out results from Florida and Joe Biden has won, that's pretty much a wrapped up race right there.  Joe Biden has a better than 99% chance of winning an election in which he's won Florida.  Basically, Donald Trump's path to the presidency, getting 270 electoral college votes, really relies on Florida.  As I mentioned, we may not know the results of the election in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin on election night.  That's in part because they're not used to processing so many mail ballots, also because they don't start processing those ballots until election day or just before.  And also, in some of the Midwestern states, like Ohio and probably Pennsylvania, pending a court case, those states will continue to allow ballots to come in if they're postmarked by Election Day several days after Election Day.  That's important to keep in mind because if Donald Trump, for example, wins Florida, then we'll know that the race is not wrapped up necessarily on election night because we'll still be waiting for results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  But if we give those states to Biden, then we'll see that Biden has a 97% chance of winning the election, even though Trump has won Florida.  So if Trump wins Florida on election night, we could be waiting several days before we get the results in from those upper Midwestern states.  But let's clear all this out and imagine some other scenarios.  Another state that we could get results from on election night is Arizona.  Now, people may remember in 2018 that it actually took weeks for Arizona to count all of its ballots.  Well, it changed its rules, so it's going to start processing those ballots earlier so that we can likely get an answer to who won Arizona on election night.  That's important because it's a pretty key state, potentially, in determining who wins this election.  So results come in on election night, say Biden wins, currently favored there.  Now all of a sudden he has a 98% chance of winning the election.  Conversely, Arizona comes in and Trump has won.  It's definitely not a foregone conclusion.  Biden still has a 66% chance of winning the election, but it certainly improves Trump's odds.  Now, another state we could find out results from is North Carolina.  We're not positive.  we'll get results there.  There could be some hiccups.  But if we know the results in North Carolina and they come in for Trump, Again, we see that he has about a one in three chance of winning an election in which he wins North Carolina.  And again, those results come in, they come in for Biden, and that race is about finished.  Now lastly, let's talk about Texas.  Texas is not allowing all Texans to vote by mail because of COVID-19.  You have to be 65 or older, or you have to have an excuse like you'll be out of the county on the day of the election.  And so a lot of people are going to be voting in person.  And that means they don't really have to revamp their tabulation process because it's more like a normal election in Texas.  So if we find out the results in Texas and Biden were to win Texas on election night, that race is over.  Biden has a greater than 99% chance of winning an election in which he wins Texas.  But remember, right now he has about a one in three shot of winning that state.  And so we shouldn't necessarily expect to be able to figure out the results on election night because he's won Texas.  Again, if Trump wins Texas, his odds don't change all that much.  They go up from around 12 or 13 to 19%.  That's because our model understands that Trump is favored to win Texas, and him winning Texas doesn't change the overall math of the race all that much.  So really, whether or not we know the result of the election on November 3rd depends on how close this race is.  If Biden is winning in some of the states that he's leading in right now, like Florida or Arizona, North Carolina or even Georgia, we might be able to call the winner on election night.  If not, it could be days.  And if the election is so close that the states are canvassing for ballots for weeks, recounting, litigating over which ballots should actually count, then we might not know the result of the election for weeks.  But our forecast says that there's about a 4% chance that the election is close enough that it's in recount territory.  So we should not expect going into election night that it's going to take weeks of litigation in order to find out the winner of the election.  But it's important to keep all of these possibilities in mind heading into election night.  And actually, viewers, you can play around with all of the different scenarios on your own.  Using this interactive on the FiveThirtyEight website, it's called Explore the Ways Trump or Biden Could Win the Election.  You could choose your own path.  Even on election night, you can be your own forecaster.  And once we start seeing projections in particular states, you'll be able to update the odds.  We'll also be doing that over on the FiveThirtyEight YouTube channel, so you should make sure to check us out on the night of the election as well.
