Like Mount Rushmore, I got a face of stone.  So when we go back to the wilderness, and he's preaching to us today, are you saying, because like he's like, we're not going to listen to what some of the folks who might have just been around this, what we've been through.  Are you saying those folks, all the people that you've been through, you think they will?  Or... You mean Zechariah's version?  Can't I put it to the system?  One of the systems may end up like this.  But this is my faith with you, right?  And the world is... The world is a free life, okay?  This is inside.  Please, please, please, please.  No, I know.  Just what the family said.  Like, I didn't take the trash out because my parents didn't.  You just take the trash out.  No.  You either get down or let down.  That's how it is.  So, we just want to establish, what did the Lord leave us?  How is it going to be?  It's the book of Jeremiah chapter... 66 and verse 16.  For by fire and by the sword will the world's high plead with all flesh.  That's how he's going to plead with us in the wilderness.  But hold that in St.  Moriah 13.  We start at verse 8.  And the slaying of the Lord shall be many.  He's going to kill a lot of people.  That's how the Lord pleads with people.  Because remember, we... I'm going to jump to the end.  Please, after I continue to... Thank you. ",
