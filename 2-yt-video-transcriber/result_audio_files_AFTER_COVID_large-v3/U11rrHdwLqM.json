Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Silverfest.  As you can see, we are joined by the great... Dr.  Jim Willey, everybody's favorite.  Dr.  Jim Willey of the Hat Trick Letter joining us here at Silverfest to discuss how high the silver price is actually gonna go.  I try and keep it on the realm and I don't get into too many price targets on the show, although I've seen 50 as a floor, but anyway, Jim, welcome on in.  How are you doing there today, sir? ",

I tell you, this is a period of very high anxiety for a lot of people, including just about everybody I know, except for one guy who's got over $10 million worth of gold.  He's not worried.  Everybody else I know is worried.  I mean, everybody I know is worried sick.  All right, so I'm going to talk about why silver is good, why silver is cool.  It's a whole lot more than just shiny.  It has tremendous characteristics.  Let me just start with something having to do with Maxwell, my great source, who I'm going to get an update with very, very soon.  He informed me that he's got a former colleague from a previous position where he was the in a trading function.  There is an ongoing meeting every week hosted by the Euro Central Bank, and it is basically a financial reset forum.  And they're trying to iron out all the different details having to do with the monetary system that's coming up and the energy and technology system that's about to be introduced, where agreements have been made toward a proposed equilibrium price.  And back in May, that silver equilibrium price was decided as 400.  US dollars per ounce.  And the gold price, I'm gonna focus on silver, but the gold, I'm gonna mention gold because of the gold silver ratio.  At that time versus the 400 silver they had proposed as an equilibrium gold price of 10,000.  And just since May and June and July, with all the extraordinary additional monetary increases, in other words, printing money, distributing it to save the system and prevent a lot of tremendous bankruptcies, they've increased at this forum.  And his friend attends it almost every week.  Maxwell's friend.  The new goal is 700 silver and 15,000 gold.  We're talking about 25 or 22 to 1 in a ratio, which means we're going to see a three times greater relative rise in silver versus the rise in gold.  Now, I like silver for a lot of reasons.  Let me just continue with this energy technology globally managed market that's coming up for silver.  And I don't know how they're going to pull it off and I don't know exactly when.  But silver has a lot of tremendous characteristics.  Most people don't focus on its isotopes.  Most people don't know what an isotope is and how it differs from an isometric exercise.  I happen to know what an isotope is.  It's when an unusual number of electrons and protons, no, not electrons, protons exist in the core and renders it, different and perhaps unstable.  now with uranium if you get u-235 you can make an explosion.  it has a big boom for it.  with silver you've got two popular isotopes and each one so i understand i could be a little off on this.  each one has about a 40 percent uh commonality and that's very unusual.  most.  most of the time if you get say a carbon isotope it might have two percent or one percent for its unusual appearing isotope.  silver has two.  so that they do they do some differentials and and it's like you know Electronic arbitrage.  And they use that fact of common isotopes. ",

            "text": "I wanted to speak your language.  Okay, let me go on.  I've got a number of different items here.  We have an explosion in the delivery contract volume for silver.  It's like five to ten times what it was a year ago.  This is very big.  We have a shutdown of major silver-producing nations.  I'm talking about \u2013 it's going to be a new acronym that you'll see once in a while, maybe not a lot, but it's the CAMP Latinos.  It's Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru.  A lot of their mines were shut down, which meant that their output was limited, and I don't want to get into the \u2013 why and wherefore that this happened, but they shut down and now they're coming back online gradually, but not fast.  We've had a severe annual shortage of silver for years and the voice told me 10 years ago, India is supplying silver in quantity in order to alleviate and prevent a global crisis in silver.  So the British are behind it, absolutely.  China has been actively replenishing their silver stockpile that they created around the year 2000 and I think 2002 or 2003.  They made a gigantic silver stockpile and it's been depleted largely.  I don't know if it's completely out, but it's largely depleted.  And for those who study some older American history, Franklin, no, not Franklin, Teddy Roosevelt established a 6 billion ounce silver stockpile for the United States.  And that ran out about six or eight years ago.  So silver is in trouble.  Here's a funny little factor.  The economic recession has been broad and powerful.  It's all across the globe.  And it really started 13 years ago.  We've never exited the recession since before the Lehman event.  And with this recession, you have lower output of say zinc, tin copper and the byproduct is silver for a lot of that major industrial mining.  so we've got some problems with the byproduct.  um here's something that maxwell pointed out as a last point and i'll make it my last point.  i'm a jittery guy.  i i itch and i you know i i'm just not comfortable sitting down.  um Missiles, military missiles, whether they're defensive or offensive, use a lot of silver.  He said that there is, oh, I don't want to forget the squeeze.  He said that there is a lot of demand for recently for the missiles that, it's not just the Tomahawk cruise missile, that's an antiquated, inaccurate embarrassment to the US military.  We're talking about the S-300, 400, 500, 600, 700 Russian missiles.  And we're talking about the defensive missiles like the Patriot, even though they don't work.  If they're shot, they hit the ground and they vaporize.  So without even hitting the mark, The bad military defensive missiles still consume a lot of silver.  They're not recovered.  Maxwell said something that really stuck with me.  He said JP Morgan had a gigantic lease about a year or two ago with the military contractors, and they're stuck.  They're on the wrong side.  They're being squeezed.  They can't cover.  They're losing a lot of money, and they're appealing for official aid.  to get out of their short positions for silver.  I just love silver.  I think it's a lot more than shiny.  I've actually got a, uh, a Morgan silver dollar set that's from new Orleans, the O series.  And, uh, it's gorgeous because it has these little marbling, um, impurities, you know, I don't know whether they're copper or iron or what, but they're, they're, it's like a streak.  Um, and it's beautiful.  So that's my spiel.  I could talk more, but really silver, silver.  How can I love you?  Let me count the ways. ",

I really don't know.  I mean, you can't say, well, I know how much crime they're going to permit, so here's going to be my forecast.  I do not know how much criminality they're going to permit.  I did not expect this level of naked shorting that has happened in the last six weeks.  I did not expect that.  So you can have all these orders, and what you're doing is you're really getting a lot of churning.  You're getting a lot of people buying at the present price.  I have a feeling something unusual is going on, Chris.  I'm going to put it out there before we move to the chat room, the Q&A session.  I have a feeling that the global reset is happening right under our feet, and part of the requirements are a stable price.  So they're not going to allow a big move in gold and silver for a little while.  And then the doors break down.  And I don't know when that time limit is, but I've been hearing from numerous parties, including The Voice a few months ago, when you're ready for the reset, you'll know it's happening because things get really stable and stuck.
