            "text": "Hey MGTOs, this is Vention.  Just out from my two mile walk.  It was raining a while ago but I figured I'd just borrow the old man's umbrella and hoof it anyway.  My health is more important than staying dry.  So yesterday I made a video about the halvening and hammer hand and a few red pill things and my plans to go Live the mobile lifestyle.  And basically... Oops, hold on.  Had a big line of traffic going by.  Anyway, I was high on Rick Simpson oil for the cancer thing.  And I basically seemed a little bit drunk.  And I was out of it.  And I looked at it and I... Even high on Rick Simpson oil yesterday, I looked at it and I went, nah, I'm not going to post that.  So I'm going to cover it again briefly.  I enjoyed the happening show yesterday.  That was a lot of fun.  And from now on, going forward, the Bitcoin block reward has dropped.  It's been cut in half for the third time.  And it's... And it's pretty cool because that is quantitative hardening, which is something that governments don't do.  Okay, and now going forward, the inflation rate of Bitcoin is now lower than any fiat currency in the world.  And it's even lower than gold now, supposedly.  So yeah, good times.  And now the price is starting to drift upward and already the block reward, the new Bitcoins on the market have been cut in half.  So the only thing that that can do is cause an upward pressure on the price.  Then we've got the, um yeah the whole recession thing and the whole lockdown and all that.  during the 2008 recession gold and silver dropped at first as people were struggling for for cash trying to produce trying to flee out of it and get it get some cash and uh then basically uh.  after that when things like uh when the financial institutions started failing like bear stearns and MF Global and Lehman Brothers when they started collapsing and costing people real money, then people started to get very interested in hard money.  And at that time that was gold and silver because Bitcoin was just an infant at that time.  Pause.  So I am very optimistic about Bitcoin over the next 18 months or so.  Man, it's going to be exciting.  Um, second thing, uh, everybody knows Hammerhand, the big toe monk.  He, uh, he got kicked off of YouTube, but he's still posting on BitChute and his, his, uh, his video, I think it was yesterday or the day before was very good.  Uh, it showed, uh, these real degenerate women demonstrating, uh, sex toys for them and moaning and whatnot on video and talk about lack of class and lack of dignity complete devaluing of whatever.  it was at one time that once made women special.  that's gone man.  so they were sitting there just moaning and uh and it's pretty darn pathetic.  and uh i'm gonna link to the uh.  go ahead and link to that video on BitChute.  And if you don't follow him on BitChute, YouTube has won and we have lost.  But if you make an account on BitChute, then that's a point for us.  Let me pause this.  Man, this wind noise is going to be bad.  I hope I don't have to delete this video too.  But in any case, the way they were demonstrating those devices, I mean, it just really shows that unless it's money or some kind of utility for being a guy, like I'm a mechanic, right?  Unless we are able to be used for some kind of utility, we... We hold no value to them.  Basically, they've got devices that will make them orgasm faster than we ever can.  But they don't bring money, and they don't take the trash out, and they don't fix the roof.  But now, neither do we, unless it's for our own houses.  Yeah, it's unfortunate.  Now, that eternal... Ancient partnership has just been trashed.  Terrible situation.  Wildlife refuge is certainly pretty today.  It's kind of overcast, but it is definitely pretty.  All of the bison must be hiding out in the tree line over there.  Man, the grass in this pasture is so thick.  Any cattleman anywhere or goat herder or anything would be just overjoyed to throw their cows in there just for a few days.  The cows could gain a lot of weight out there.  And over in Saudi Arabia, I was stationed over there during the first Gulf War.  There was like, people would irrigate places like in a firehouse and they had like a lawn and they didn't cut the grass the normal way.  They had a sickle and they went through on their hands and knees and just cut all the grass and then carefully sheaved them up like they were wheat and then stacked them in the back of this Toyota truck.  And basically, And that's it.  I mean, just, it was like, and they would like put them, put the sheaves of grass in there with just such, such incredible value.  You know, it's like in gentleness and well, it's like they were, it's like they were like handling something valuable, like silk or gold or something.  And it was like, wow.  And it, it really did.  It was really striking.  One little spot of green everywhere else was just sand.  Saudi Arabia, definitely not a pretty place.  Heavy concrete houses and whatnot, and just, yeah, not my thing.  So, let's see, back to what I was... Let me pause this.  Oops.  Well, it's the irrigation, you know.  And on days like this, people are actually starting to show up around here and go swimming and go kayaking and paddling around on air mattresses and whatnot.  I don't know how clean that water is, but oh well.  It's a way of getting out of the house, I guess.  Cabin fever can really drive a guy out of the house.  Pretty cool, they've got a little boat launch here.  You can take a small boat on a trailer and back it into the water.  But most people just like have kayaks on the back of their pickup truck or something.  I don't know, maybe I'll get bored enough to do this.  So anyway, I think it's a good idea or I would recommend that You look at the more the video info area and I'll leave a link to to Hammerhand's video that I'm talking about, because it is exceptional.  It's one of his better ones.  And it's a good idea to keep our options open as far as our platforms and where we post our stuff.  I, of course, have a BitChute channel as well, and it automatically mirrors over there.  So, yeah, easily done.  Okay, MGTOs, I'm gonna let you go, and don't get married. ",
