            "text": "All right, ladies and gentlemen, so my name's Justin Bright.  Today I want to try to show you guys how to restore and fix VHS tapes.  This is one that I have already fixed.  I wanted to make sure that this method worked before I made the video, and that's why I did this.  I haven't seen another video on YouTube that shows how to lubricate VHS tapes and do all of the stuff in one video.  I haven't even found one that shows this method for lubricating, but I have found that it works.  Here we go.  Here's a... VHS.  Now not all VHS tapes are the same.  Most of them are, but some of them actually aren't even designed to be open.  Some of them are designed to self-destruct.  Some of them don't have windows here where you can see the reels.  And so this is the most common type.  This is one of the types you can actually work on.  So this is the type we're going to be looking at today, and this is the one that I restored.  Now of course, one trick you need to know is there's a button right here.  Push that down, you can open the top, which exposes the tape.  That will come in handy later.  So you start by unscrewing this.  But make sure, number one, don't try this at home, of course.  And number two, if you are going to try it, make sure you watch the whole video first so that you don't pull the tape apart the wrong way and destroy something.  Listen to everything, you know, in the video, watch other videos, whatever, before you try this.  Just so you don't screw up the tape.  Because it's easy... If you don't know what you're doing, you don't understand tapes to screw them up.  So I want to make sure.  Now the first thing I need to do is find a screwdriver that's going to fit these smaller screws.  And then I'm going to put a handle on here.  I will try to put links in the description of the video to everything you'll need to do this, including screwdriver sets.  people have sent me to review.  This just happened to be a screwdriver set that I had sitting close by, so that's the reason I used it for this.  Anyway, you want to take out all your screws, and you've got to have a place to put your screws so that you don't lose them.  There are five screws in most of these cassette tapes.  A regular standard Phillips screwdriver won't fit these.  It does have to be a smaller one, kind of like an electronic screwdriver or jewelry screwdriver.  Also, these screws, when they go back in, you have to make sure that the cassette is very tight back together because if it's loose at all, if you have a good VCR, it's not even going to take the tape.  It's going to spit it out.  It's got to be very tight and held together because otherwise bad things are going to happen.  These VHS tapes are designed in a very interesting way, and if everything isn't perfect, it will eat your tape or something bad is going to happen.  Something will fall apart.  So you want to make sure everything is perfect before you try to put one of these in a VCR.  Now, the next step, now that you've got the screws out, is to turn the tape over.  Okay, so we're going to turn the tape over.  There we go.  Make sure not to let go of that bottom.  Then we lift up the top part here that I showed you for the tape, and we lift off this top part.  And we've got to get it to cooperate here, so... Usually they just come right apart, but this one is being stubborn for some reason this time.  That's not normal.  Now, the problem that I see in YouTube videos, other YouTube videos about how to do this, is they seem to ignore this top piece.  This is the piece that actually was causing the problem.  So you can take these off and lubricate under them, although in my experience it's not necessary.  In my experience, there's one trouble causer in here.  But before we get into that, I want to explain something really quick.  If you get anything sticky on the tape, that's going to screw you up.  And also, you can get something sticky inside your VCR from the tape.  That's all got to be cleaned off.  If you're going to do it on the head of the VCR, you can use rubbing alcohol.  But if you're going to do it on the tape, the best thing to use is diluted Dawn dish soap on a very soft surface.  soft cloth okay we're not talking paper towels.  they're too coarse.  we're not even talking tissue paper.  you need something that's baby soft downy soft material.  you know.  don't put downy in it i don't think.  but because that'd probably get on your tape.  but then once you wash wipe off your tape you need to rinse it off immediately.  You don't want this tape to be wet.  If it does get wet, you've got to leave it rolled out and let it dry.  So that's the reason you don't want it to get wet.  You want to wash it off wherever the stuff is and immediately dry it, immediately wipe off any moisture.  that's on the tape.  So before we do anything else, I want to show you, you pull this down, you pull these locks down, if necessary, and you remove these reels.  So you just pull them out like this.  And I'll show you why, just for the purposes of how the tapes are made, how to work on them.  So I'm going to set this over here.  Okay, we want to make sure we don't mess with it too much.  We don't want to set the reel on the tape like I just did.  And it's kind of tricky.  You don't want to get your fingers on the tape.  So some people say that these bottoms are where the friction is.  And there is some friction there.  And so I've already lubricated these.  And how I did that... This didn't solve my problem.  Okay, I'll tell you what solved my problem.  But I took this silicone spray, and apparently you can also use silicone grease.  Silicone lubricants are some of the safest to use on these types of things.  And I put some on a Q-tip, and I just put it all around here, and a bunch of black plastic came off.  They'd been worn down.  I also found the same thing was true upon these metal pieces that pushed down on the reels.  They also were black because the top of the reel is black, and that you'd be cleaned off and lubricated as well.  I lubricated pretty much everything that didn't come in direct contact with the tape.  Put it back in.  I still had the squealing, the whining.  The VCR didn't want to play it.  There was too much friction.  I thought, okay, what am I going to do?  There's friction here.  Where's the friction?  This is where the friction was.  And so... There's a couple ways to solve this problem.  One is to lubricate all of this with the silicone spray using your Q-tip.  You know, try not to get it on anything else.  You don't want to get it on this metal piece.  You can remove this metal piece before you start lubricating everything to make sure that the metal piece stays clean so the tape can slide on it.  Because this doesn't move.  The tape just slides on the metal piece.  At least that's the way it's supposed to work.  And so... Once you've lubricated that, you've only done half the battle, okay?  There is a little receptacle in this side that holds this axle that doesn't move, this stationary axle.  It's right there.  This is this little cup.  And you want that cup to stay the same shape, the same thickness.  That's not the issue.  The issue is that it's pushing on this white plastic, in this case it's white plastic, cylinder that spins.  And so around that shaft.  And so what we do is we take some of that silicone spray.  We put it right down in that hole.  And I could do it again while I have it apart because it still was a little bit squeaky when I put it back together.  I had to play it through and rewind it first before the squeaking went away.  But you put a little bit of lubricant into your silicone grease, silicone spray, whatever down in this hole.  You put it back together.  And for me, it solved the problem.  But another way to solve this problem that might be more dangerous would be to slightly sand off the end, one of the ends of this just a little bit so that the tape isn't pushing down the outside of the tape.  This case here isn't pushing down so hard and creating friction on here.  However, thinking about that and knowing from years of experience how Tapes eat up and everything.  The thing is that if this is any shorter than it is, there's a possibility that this tape could find its way into a little crack between this and the case and then just start eating the tape in there and getting in a big tangled mess.  because that's just the way tape works.  It loves to get eaten up.  Everything has to be perfect.  That's how you lubricate this and get it to work again.  And like I said, I did it and it fixed everything.  But a lot of times, you know, you get a VHS tape, it starts whining, it starts making noise, you put it in the player, it jams up, it does something bad, the player spits it back out or it eats it up and you think, I just got to get rid of the tape.  No.  If you can take the tape apart, if you can lubricate it or you get it to a specialist that does this on a regular basis, that's probably the best way to do this.  Before we put this back in the VCR and before we reassemble it, we want to know for sure that we've solved our problem.  We want to know that we can turn the tape without it jamming up and having any issues.  So what we're going to do is, after we've solved our problem of lubricating everything, we're going to go ahead and just put these reels back in.  The tape has to go through the rollers and everything on its way back.  into the case so you can do it with your fingers.  if you want to touch the tape which you know is the thing you're trying to avoid you can do it that way.  we're going to go ahead and pull this down perfect.  okay now we're going to go ahead and put in the other side and if you need to you know you can always take a picture of where the tape went before you started.  i'm going to put this down in here.  Now this tape in this case has to go in between this little flap right here.  This little flap and it keeps some tension on the tape and we need to put it around that and up around this little spindle here.  Again they don't seem to explain this in a lot of the videos I watch.  They just kind of show it you know.  But anyway so what we're going to do is we're going to make sure there's some tension on here and we're going to wind this tape back up.  There we go, okay.  So then we gotta assemble the tape and then we're gonna test everything and make sure it works which obviously I know it already does but I'm gonna show you how to do that.  So I don't need to push the button in because the button's down there.  So we're just gonna set this on here.  We do wanna make sure when we put our tape back together that this top piece here that just came loose does not hit the tape, that's why I was doing what I was doing with it.  there is because we don't want it to hit the tape.  so try to keep it open.  it doesn't like to assemble while it's open but that's the best way to do it so that you're not hitting the tape.  okay now we'll turn it over and we'll push that button in and we'll make sure that the tape is not jammed.  that it's where it's supposed to be.  Because if you put this together, that way it can cause more problems later when you're trying to fix it.  Put the first screw, I'm going to put the center one in first.  So here we go.  And again, it's very important that these screws are very tight.  And you don't want to over tighten them and strip them out, but you want to make sure they're as tight as they can be.  Otherwise the tape will not function correctly.  Now See how the tape's not coming apart.  There's no crack here.  Checking making sure that we got everything tight enough.  That's that that's got a little bit of give to it there.  I don't know why but these if I tighten anything more they're gonna break.  so and we're gonna check our tape once again.  everything's perfect.  so now to test this before we put in the VCR we take our screwdriver or pin or something we push down in here which releases these guys.  and I believe I can turn it this way and you see how it's turning and there's no whining there's no real friction going on there.  well there wasn't.  maybe I rewind it.  let's go the other direction.  I think I rewound the tape But that's the way you want it to be.  You want there to be no, friction when the tape is moving and as long as that's what you've achieved everything should be fine.  yep the tape was rewound and then i played it in a little bit and so now if we put this in our vcr it should work just fine.  so thanks so much for watching the video.  i hope you learned something today.  i hope this helps you out while you're having your coronavirus lockdown or whatever and you want to watch some videos whatever you want to do.  thank you so much for watching the video.  god bless you and your family and all that god has for you to do.
