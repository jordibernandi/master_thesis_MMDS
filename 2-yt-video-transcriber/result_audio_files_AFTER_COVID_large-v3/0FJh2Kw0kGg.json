            "text": "Hey, and welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  This one, as with many of the other episodes, is not controversial at all.  We are gonna talk about some tough questions, hard questions, really for faith healers.  And the reason for that is because now is as good a time as ever to talk about things that matter, and that is truth, and that's the gospel.  So some of the things that are hitting the news, revolve around Bethel Church closing their supernatural school of ministry.  Paula White, who's one of the advisors, the spiritual advisor to President Trump, was on Twitter today telling people to give $9 or I think $91 as well.  So Shai Lin, really great rapper and a wonderful brother in Christ, had posted And he posted this above Paula White's tweet.  For as it is written, the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.  Romans 2.24.  That's really the driver behind an episode like this.  Right now, more than ever, people are watching Christians.  They're watching the church and they are observing our witness.  If our witness is faith healers who claim to be able to eradicate disease, but then they shut down their operation, and spiritual advisors to the White House administration who pilfer certain amounts or dollar amounts and try to convince people to give, what does that say about our witness?  one particular news organization broadcasted the story about Bethel shutting down and quoted them as saying, the good news without power is not good news.  In other words, the gospel is not even anything without signs and wonders.  Paul was glad that his preaching wasn't with persuasive words but demonstration of power.  And one of our goals would be that every student could know how to cast out demons, heal the sick, and preach the gospel.  And Here's the statement from Bethel.  Though we believe in a God who actively heals today, students are not being encouraged to visit healthcare settings at this time, and moreover, are taught that even under normal circumstances, they have to receive permission from both the facility and the individual before engaging in prayer.  So, first of all, we would commend obeying the government.  If you don't have permission to do this, great.  But I want to talk more about what it means to have the gift of healing, and I want you guys to chime in on some really important aspects, because like Romans 2 tells us the name of God is often blasphemed.  when faith healers say, hey, I can get this thing right out of here in no time.  Watch what I can do.  And then they can't.  So, Kyle, first with you, speak to the dangers.  of not saying anything right now because the idea is, hey, this is really unloving.  What are you guys doing?  This is the worst time to talk about it.  How insensitive of you.  What's the danger with letting the foot off the gas, turning a blind eye and saying, you know, let's not touch on that.  You know, people may think we're being a little hard and they might be really upset with us.  What are the dangers with laying off when truth is on the line? ",

You know, we may be told in this day and age that we need to unite together as a country and, you know, have a common mission of protecting the weak and this kind of thing.  And that that is true.  But as Christians, our most important mission is to be heralds of God's truth.  Amen.  And God's truth speaks to this.  And so if we neglect to speak about it, especially when it's pertinent, then we're neglecting to speak God's truth in its entirety.  One of the things we've covenanted to do at Redeemer is to always counsel from the scriptures and the whole counsel of God's word.  So where I'd go is in 2 Peter 2, in the first few verses of 2 Peter 2 say this, it says, but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you.  who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, and we know we've seen those destructive heresies, these ontological, Christological heresies that redefine Jesus, that redefine his mission.  And then it says, bringing upon themselves swift destruction, and many will follow their sensuality, and because of them, the way of truth will be blasphemed, just like we were talking about from Romans.

Not that the Bible needs a news story to back it up, but it's fascinating to me how much this hits the nail on the head.  You talk about having no moral boundaries.  They're greedy.  They are trying to get money.  They're trying to exploit people.  The article goes on to explain, this is a Sacramento News outlet, two Bethel students had approached a woman in the emergency room at Mercy Medical Center in Reading, and they said they're going to pray for people here and put Jesus in their hearts and that this would heal us all and that they didn't need to stay in the ER any longer, that they could go home.  That's an exact quote.  The woman had to file a complaint with the hospital saying that one of the students had touched her five-year-old without her consent, which was probably just trying to lay hands on them.  you can try to look as moral as you can.  You can try to look as rich as you can, look as spiritual as you can.  But in the end, you either can do what you say you can do or you can't. ",

Or maybe you're an enthusiast for this kind of thing.  I would just say during times like these, can we please just define reality?  Can we face it together?  Can we admit that that if you had the gift of healing, and if you were doing things out of a heart of love and wanting to see people saved and set free and seen, wouldn't you just go do it?  Or couldn't you do it if you say you could?  If I say I've got the greatest message on earth and it's the gospel and there's power in it, I already know what to do.  Unleash that and watch as people get saved.  I can guarantee, I don't know if everyone's gonna get saved, I don't know if everyone's gonna respond lovingly or happily, but I can guarantee you, If you spend your life and we spend our days unleashing the power of the gospel, something's going to happen.  And so that is a guarantee.  We need to be able to define reality and not deny it.  And I would also ask that we demand of those who put themselves up on some pedestal or at least put themselves on a platform to be voices of truth and sources of power that they answer the bell when it's time to answer the bell.  If you say you have the solution, if you say you have the cure, then the most hateful thing you could do is withhold that.  The most hateful thing you could do is say you could do something and then not.  If you got it, do it.  That's what we need.  Those are the hard questions we should be asking of self-appointed faith healers.  Now, John, I want to do this because I think it's helpful to see what really somebody logical would say or do if they had the gift.  So let's play a little game.  role play almost, if you had the gift of healing or if I had the gift of healing.  So we'll start that off.  If you had the gift of healing, what would you do? ",

I'm going to demand a meeting with President Trump.  I'm going to heal people right in front of him.  And I'm going to say, put me on that press conference.  I have the real message.  And I'm going to preach.  I'm going to tell the whole world that the gospel is true.  And I'm going to heal people right in front of them.  I'm going to have doctors standing right there.  who are ready to test them before.  Yes, they have COVID-19 and test them right after.  No, they don't.

The fact that logically, the idea that if you give me $10, God will give you $1,000.  that they're not giving all their money away so that they would get 100-fold blessing.  Again, it's just like, logically, it doesn't make sense.  And now we're saying, now is your perfect moment.  An international crisis, pandemic.  Show us that we are wrong.  Show us that we're the Pharisees right now.  Get in front of everybody and say, I'm calling out all the Pharisees like us.  Call us out and show us what you can do.

And unfortunately, we aren't because the Bible's not.  And that's really what backs this.  What really this comes down to is when the pressure is on, what is inside of people comes out.  And when the pressure is on for faith healers and those who propagate a false gospel, all the other times when we don't have COVID-19 making the world go crazy, We don't really notice it.

He has appointed the time, the minute, the hour, the second that you would know the truth.  So realize that he loves you and he's offered you the truth.  Number three, run to a biblical church.  This is fantastic in kind of the worst sense.  potentially weeks and weeks of lockdown, so you don't get to go and worship normally like you would.  We would think that's a terrible thing.  However, it could be providential for some of you watching.  This is the perfect time to seek the Lord, be in His Word, get resourced, experience the true love of God through the truth, and then when everyone's released again from these quarantines and whatnot, and we can go back out again, you run.  to a biblical church.  And we'll have an episode coming, either the next one or the one after that, of how to find a biblical church.  But run to a biblical church.  And number four, remember to reach others.  That's why we do this.  We want to reach others.  You are going to experience a season of frustration, no doubt.  Some of these people in different shows and whatnot and pastors, we can all get sucked into this a little while.  Just sit and throw in stones as though that was the end.  No.  All of this is a means to an end.  It's to reach people.  So now that you've heard the truth, and if the Lord opens your eyes to the truth, reach out to somebody, share the video, ask the hard questions, and just turn to Christ.  It's that simple.
