The Bible says God provided a way for us to be forgiven.  Jesus suffered and died to take the punishment for our sins.  You probably know that, but you may not know this, and this is life-changing.  The Ten Commandments are called the moral law.  You and I broke the law.  Jesus paid the fine.  That's why he said it is finished just before he died.  If you're in court and someone pays your fine, a judge can let you go even though you're guilty.  You can say, ladies, there's a whole stack of speeding fines here.  This is terribly serious, but someone's paid them.  You're free to go.  And he can let you walk even though you're guilty.  And he can do that which is legal and right and just.  Well, God can legally dismiss your case instantly because Jesus paid the fine in his life's blood.  Even though we're guilty, God can let us live forever.  He can take the death sentence off us and grant us everlasting life, not because we're good or because we earn it, but because God is good and he's rich in mercy.  And then Jesus rose from the dead, defeated death, and if you'll simply repent of your sins, say, God, I'm sorry.  And then turn from sin.  Don't play the hypocrite and say, I'm a Christian and lie and steal and fornicate.  That's just deceiving yourself.  You've got to be genuine in your repentance.  And then trust alone in Jesus.  Now at the moment, you're like I was for many years.  You're like a man on the edge of a plane.  He's 10,000 feet up and he's going to jump and this is his plan.  He's going to save himself by flapping his arms.  And I'd say to that person, don't do that.  It's not going to work.  Trust the parachute.  and so don't look on.  your goodness is what's going to save you on the day of judgment?  don't try and save yourself.  it's not going to work.  transfer your trust from yourself to the savior.  the minute you do that you have god's promise.  he'll grant you everlasting life as a free gift because you can't earn eternal life.  the bible says by grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of god not of works.  least any man most says god saves us according to his mercy not by works of righteousness.  Make sure you take heed to his words.  I am the way, the truth, and the life.  Jesus said, no man comes to the Father but by me.  Now tell me, where did I go wrong? ",
