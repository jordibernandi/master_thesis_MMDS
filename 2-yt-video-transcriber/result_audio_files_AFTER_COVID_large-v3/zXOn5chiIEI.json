Are these polls an accurate reflection of how voters feel about their choice in November?  Who knows?  For now, though, let's focus on the polls that Harry Enten is talking about in this segment.  First, there was the Pew Research poll that was conducted from June 16th to the 22nd, where they asked registered voters who would handle certain issues better.  Who would make good decisions about economic policy?  Trump edged out Biden by 3 percentage points.  But when it came to handling law enforcement and criminal justice issues, Biden scored three points higher than Trump.  Which is odd considering that the 1994 crime bill, which Democrats hate and would love to see repealed, was written by then-Senator Joe Biden.  Democrats blamed the bill for the rise of harsher criminal justice policies, including the three strikes law, which contributed to so-called mass incarceration.  Biden also scored three points higher than President Trump on foreign policy.  And we all know how quid pro Joe finesses cooperation from other countries, like Ukraine, for example. ",

            "text": "But the language on the slide doesn't match the wording of the poll question.  The language on the slide implies that they are both somehow handling the health crisis and the voters are more confident that Biden is handling it better.  The actual poll question posed to registered voters was, are you very or somewhat confident that Biden or Trump can handle the public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak?  And Harry Enten doesn't actually explain how Joe Biden can be handling the health crisis better than Trump when Biden doesn't currently hold public office.  Okay, you might be thinking that these results might be a little skewed.  And you might be right.  According to Pew, there were 3,577 registered voters who responded to the poll.  Of those respondents, 1,540 identified as Republican or leaned Republican, while 1,946 identified as Democrats or leaned Democrat, which means that there were 406 more Democrats who took part in the poll than Republicans.  That's 26% more Democrats.  But that's okay, because it's a weighted poll.  Let me explain.  Pew is getting their results from the American Trends Panel, which is made up of randomly selected US adults.  Once invited into the ATP, panelists are asked to participate every time.  Pew conducts one of these polls, which is referred to as a wave.  And that means that Pew is asking the same panelists if they prefer Trump or Biden over and over and over again.  But what about the fact that there are 26% more panelists that identify as Democrat or leaning Democrat?  Well, to make up for the unevenness, Pew uses variables such as gender, age, education, race Hispanic origin, born inside versus outside the US among Asians, country of birth among Hispanics, years lived in the United States, home internet access, region and metropolitan status, volunteerism, voter registration, and party affiliation.  You got all that so far?  Then they analyzed Trump approval among panelists who responded to both this polling wave and waves 59 or 64 also aligned a sample to an additional dimension for Trump approval from the previous wave in order for Trump approval from the current wave to cleanly reflect change in panelists' attitudes over time.  See, it's all very simple.  Just accept the results and give up.  Now let's look at the mammoth poll where Biden is beating Trump by 12 percentage points.  If you look at the poll demographics of the 733 registered voters who participated, 29% self-identified as Republican, 33% identified as Democrat, and 38% identified as Independent.  More people identified as independent?  That can't possibly be an accurate snapshot of the electorate.  But CNN's going to run with it because they want you to believe that this man is crushing President Trump by double digits. ",

Among the entire group, 32% described themselves as Democrats, 25% described themselves as Republicans, and a whopping 44% described themselves as independents or members of another party.  But wait, there's more.  Remember that African Americans were oversampled, so when it comes to the breakdown of registered voters, 362 were black.  In other words, 32% of respondents were African American, despite being 13% of the population.  So while African Americans were oversampled, Asians who make up nearly 6% of the population and Hispanic and Latino voters who make up 18% of the population were wildly underrepresented in the poll.  No matter how you try and spin it, this is a skewed poll.  So much so that the Trump campaign sent CNN a cease and desist letter.  But of course, CNN defended the poll and the results and basically told the Trump campaign to F off.  Just because you present a poll to the public and say that the results are legitimate doesn't mean that they're actually legitimate.  Anyway, let's get back to this 96% Biden to 2% Trump thing. ",

Now, I'm going to mention a few issues, and for each one, please tell me if you think Joe Biden or Donald Trump would better handle that issue if they were elected president.  And when it comes to the response of the health crisis, the results show that Biden scored 55% compared to Trump's 41%.  So when you compare this graphic to the poll results, you might be thinking, gee, this doesn't match up to the poll numbers at all.  And to be fair, I was confused as well, which is why I had to update this video.  Because I have integrity.  So what Enten is saying is that out of the 55% of voters who trust Biden more on coronavirus, 96% of them will vote for Biden.  Which doesn't make a lot of sense.  55% of registered voters trust Biden on coronavirus, whereas 55% of registered voters are voting for Biden.  So where is Enten getting this 96% number?  Wouldn't it be 100%?  I mean, there might be something in the raw data, but Enten isn't showing his math.  But, you know, just trust what he says and don't question it.  And with this graphic, Enten is trying to present these numbers as an indicator of how strong Biden is doing among voters.  But it doesn't mean that Biden is doing better than Trump overall.  It just suggests that Biden voters trust Biden more on coronavirus.  But you could also say the same thing about Trump.  41% of poll respondents trust Trump more than Biden on coronavirus, which is exactly the percentage of poll respondents who are voting for Trump.  So putting up this graphic showing trust among Biden voters and how it supposedly correlates into votes, but not comparing it with a graphic showing trust among Trump voters is not only very confusing, but also very, very deceptive.  and they knew exactly what they were doing.
