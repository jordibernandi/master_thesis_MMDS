            "text": "This is the United Nations General Assembly.  Every year, world leaders from over 190 countries meet together to discuss major global issues, talk face to face, and pass joint resolutions to solve global problems.  Lasting up to nine days, it's one of the greatest tools for peace and unity in the world.  We must do everything we can to close the gap between the world as it is and the world as it should be.  That is the mission of the United Nations.  And yet, it scares some Christians half to death.  Why are some Christians scared at the thought of world peace and unity?  Well, to understand that, we have to take a look at the world of eschatology, or the study of end times events, specifically biblical prophecy.  We need to listen to the prophets.  The biblical books of Daniel, John, Revelation, and others contain words of prophecy which many Christians believe refer to the end of the world or the end times.  Passages stoke fears that one day Christians around the world will be rounded up, tortured, and executed if they don't denounce their faith.  The biblical book of Daniel in chapter 7 talks about a kingdom that will devour the whole earth.  The book of Revelation prophesies that everyone will be marked.  Apparently, world leaders will hand over their power to the beast who will round up and exterminate Christians.  The end times are supposed to be a time of great hardships, trials, and tremendous suffering with natural disasters, wars, and rumors of wars.  And some Christians are terrified that the current peaceful unity we're experiencing is just a sign that all this bad stuff is about to happen. ",

Jesus himself claimed that he would return while some of his disciples were still alive, but also hedged by saying that no one, not even Jesus, knew the exact day or hour of his return, except for God.  That's suspicious.  That's weird.  Add to this the fact that Biblical end times visions usually describe scenes that even the most drugged up LSD junkie would raise an eyebrow or two at, and you start to understand why many Christians are reluctant to embrace them.  They shy away from them in their sermons, and often don't interpret them literally.  Even my missionary parents who believed in faith healing, speaking in tongues, and the resurrection of the dead, angels and demons, and a 6,000 year old earth, rarely talked about the Book of Revelation.  And when they did, they were careful to say that much of it might be symbolic and warned against literal interpretations.  Even for my parents, self-proclaimed end times prophets like Harold Camping and Bible code nuts like Perry Stone were a little too much.  But that said, there is one factor about the end times that most Christians seem to agree on.  The belief that the closer that we get to the end times, the more that Christians will face persecution.  The enemy is after you to shoot a flaming dart in your life.  Today we're going to talk about the arrows of the enemy.  Bible verses warn that there will be wars and rumors of wars, that people will hate Christians because of Christ.  Christians were encouraged in the Bible to embrace persecution because it was a sign that they were doing something right, and were told they would receive blessings in heaven for their persecution on earth.  I must say that we have some very lovely prizes for you.  And yet, with a few notable exceptions, namely China, Communist Russia, and the Muslim world, ever since the conversion of Constantine, the persecution of Christians has been predominantly by other Christians.  Especially in Australia, Western Europe, and the Americas, where Christianity holds a tremendous amount of power and influence.  After all, Christianity is the largest religion on Earth, and Christians make up a third of the world's population.  Over half of all countries on Earth are majority Christian, and in 41 countries Christianity is either the official state religion or is officially favored and receives preferential treatment, which runs contrary to the Christian global persecution narrative.  With a few notable setbacks, freedom has continued to improve around the world for hundreds of years now.  Violence has steadily declined, and even with two world wars and the technology to kill at scale, significantly fewer people per capita died violently in the last hundred years than has been the case in almost any other time in human history.  Once almost universally utilized, torture now has been widely denounced, women, children, gays, and minorities have more rights than ever in history, cooperative policies and international trade have brought the world closer together, and crimes against humanity are met with international intervention.  Sure, there is still a ton of progress to be made, and peace can be precarious, but still, We are, without question, living in the most peaceful time in human history.  That's not wishful thinking or Pollyanna optimism.  That's scientific, data-based, hard, evidential, demonstrable fact.  In the book Better Angels of Our Nature, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker lays out a bulletproof case showing the data behind this claim. ",

If you want a quick summary of either of their books, I'll link to both of their TED Talks below.  So how do Christians square this circle?  How do they simultaneously weigh the reality that things are getting better while clinging to the biblical belief that everything is going to be just terrible and the world is sinful, fallen, and only getting worse?  It's hopeless.  That religious freedoms will be stripped away from them and persecution is unavoidable. ",

            "text": "And there's almost an eagerness for this bleak perspective of the world to be true.  Christians are encouraged to pick up their cross and follow Christ even to their deaths.  They're taught stories of great missionaries and martyrs who are depicted as heroes whose examples should be emulated.  Because Jesus literally said to embrace persecution and rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven.  I grew up as an evangelical missionary kid, and songs like I'm Not Ashamed by the Newsboys and Jesus Freak by DC Talk encouraged me and other Christians to be loud and proud about our faith, even if it resulted in persecution.  Despite how cheesy both of these albums were, both bands are multi-platinum, selling millions of albums, and were both part of a larger narrative.  that persecution was just a sign that we're doing something right.  We were taught to anticipate it, almost crave it, and at the very least, not shy away from it.  Now, I want to make it abundantly clear that I'm not saying that religious persecution doesn't exist.  It absolutely does.  And as a Christian who spent 15 years of my life in the Muslim world, I heard about it and saw it firsthand.  But just as majority Sunni Muslims living in Saudi Arabia aren't likely to be persecuted for their Muslim faith, Christians living in majority Christian countries aren't likely to face much persecution either.  Christians, I don't agree with your beliefs.  I think the Bible sows confusion and discord and is dead wrong about science, history, and basic morality while claiming divine inspiration.  But I will fight to my dying breath for your freedom to believe in it, even if you're wrong.  By the same metric, I think the Quran is barbaric, backwards, and the source of tremendous suffering and oppression.  But I wholeheartedly denounce the imprisonment of over a million Uighur Muslims in Chinese concentration camps, and I advocate for their freedom.  Because despite the Bible and the Quran outright denouncing freedom of religion and freedom of speech and advocating for partial treatment for their adherents and even non-democratic theocracies, without the basic enlightenment values of free speech, free press, and freedom of religion, We wouldn't even be able to freely have a discussion about which beliefs hold water.  And without being able to freely scrutinize ideas and claims, how else are we going to be able to discover what's actually true?  Most atheists you'll talk to, and every humanist you talk to, will similarly support your religious freedom.  They just don't want your views forced on them.  Religious freedom, not religious privilege.  But living in a free, hyper-religious country with a church on every street corner, religious billboards, and evangelical pastors advising the president?  Most Christians in America don't know what persecution looks like.  If public, taxpayer-funded schools are required to remain neutral on religion and not teach the teacher's religion as fact, pastors freak out and call it persecution.  A fight for faith in Louisiana as a principle criticized by atheists for promoting religion.  If public court buildings aren't allowed to play favoritism to Christianity and are required to either have no religious symbols or welcome all religions to the playing field, they melt like frickin' snowflakes, get worked into a tizzy, and scream that the government is coming for their Bibles and forcing other religions on them.  They regularly hold See You at the Pole events in public schools where kids gather outside of class around a flagpole for prayer and worship, but will lose their mind when a picture emerges that looks like kids might be praying the Muslim namaz or salah, even when in actuality, this is a picture of a tornado drill.  If this was a Muslim prayer, half of them wouldn't be facing their ass towards Mecca.  See, they don't want religious equality, they want religious privilege.  Even if it's to the detriment of the religious freedoms of everyone else who doesn't share their beliefs.  But Jesus didn't say that things would get easier.  He said Christians would be mocked and persecuted for their faith.  And because the persecution of Christians is either so rare or so mild in most majority Christian countries, then in order to relate to Jesus' prophecies, they have to interpret religious neutrality or equality as a personal attack on them and their religious beliefs.

Maybe we should boycott Starbucks, I don't know.  As a hardcore religious kid, I had several friends who were atheists who would hang out at my church's youth group because they enjoyed the social atmosphere.  I had a Buddhist friend and dozens of Muslim friends and the weird thing is, none of them made fun of my Christian beliefs.  They accepted them and were super respectful about it, but just didn't really bring it up.  I did, however, get made fun of by other Christians for being an over-the-top super Christian.  The closest thing to religious suppression most Christians are ever going to get is either a raised eyebrow or a little ridicule, usually from other, less extreme Christians.  Left with persecution blue balls, they have to resort to virtue signaling to demonstrate how much they really love Jesus.  That's why my last video showcased Christian kids on TikTok acting out their willingness to die for Jesus, an extremely unlikely-to-come-to-fruition fantasy.  It's a hard pill to swallow for many of them, because they want the heavenly reward they believe persecution brings, and Jesus warned that the world would hate and persecute them.  But as my roommate says at the end of every episode of the Atheist Call-In Show.  Talk Heathen, we don't hate you.  We just think you're wrong.  We don't hate you.  We just think you're wrong.  Last month, I said whoever followed me on Twitter and tweeted out my video on the science of ghost sightings would be entered into a randomly selected book raffle.  And I'm pleased to announce that Joanie at FlutterMonkey is this month's winner.  Congratulations!  I'll be reaching out to you for an address to send it to, so make sure that you check your inbox for that.  And this month's monthly book drawing, proudly sponsored by Anthony Guthrie, is for the book The Believing Brain by Michael Shermer.  It's about how people construct beliefs, even about really wacky stuff, and reinforce them as truths.  I'll include a personal note from me in the book and sign it.  So to enter for a chance to win, simply follow me on Twitter and share out this video with the hashtag ChristiansHaveItEasy.  If you appreciated this video and you want to help me make more like it, you can support my work with an ongoing pledge on patreon.com slash holykoolaid or with a one-time donation on PayPal.  Thank you so much for your ongoing support.  And as always, dare to be curious, but don't drink the Kool-Aid. ",
