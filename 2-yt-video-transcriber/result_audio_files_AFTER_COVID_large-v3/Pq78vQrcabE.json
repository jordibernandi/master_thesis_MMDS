We are just looking at the Biden scandals, one after another after another, that no one wants to report on.  Now, conservative media is reporting on it, and it looks like there's going to be a lot of things coming out over the next few days from not only the... Laptop that was given to the FBI and Rudy Giuliani and the New York Post, but also Peter Schweitzer has a new story out today, an exclusive that Hunter Biden's business partner has flipped on him.  He is in prison.  And it looks like Devon Archer, the other partner of Hunter Biden, is also going to prison.  He's waiting for his sentence.  And Hunter Biden is getting off scot-free, and they're pissed.  And he provided 26,000 emails and is verifying now that the stuff on that hard drive is real.  We have Jason here to give us an update on everything that has been going on.  Hi, Jason. ",

            "text": "Hey, Glenn.  Yeah, this is probably going to be the biggest story probably of the year.  And conservative media is being silenced over at the New York Post now on Twitter is now going five days of being blocked on Twitter.  Five days that they can't put anything out.  That's how scared they are of this.  The other way you can tell they're scared is because they're going to blame Russia.  This is all coming from Adam Schiff.  As you just said, DNI Radcliffe just said, look, there is no evidence that this is coming from Russians.  Rudy Giuliani has talked about, he's got email correspondence from the lawyers of Hunter Biden saying, hey, can we get this thing back?  He also has a signed receipt that Hunter Biden dropped this off and signed for it.  This is not coming from the Russians.  This is absolutely insane.  My biggest regret on all of this really is, is that some of the salacious stuff of the laptop and the hard drive is coming out, like the pictures of Hunter with the crackpot.  I wish that wouldn't even come out because the other way they're going to try to mask the story is to say, and I was getting tweets about this over the weekend, I don't care about Hunter Biden.  I care about Biden.  Let me make this absolutely abundantly clear.  This is not a Hunter Biden story.  He's a part of it.  This is a Joe Biden story.  This is all about what Schweitzer has laid out going all the way back to, I think, his book Secret Empires.  This is the way that politicians get away with amassing fortune via their position in the government is by having family members do it for you.  Now, this is the way it works.  Joe Biden and his wife, they have to report all of their income, all of their money that they get.  That's all reported on, scrutinized, but not their children, not their brothers and sisters, not their aunts and uncles.  This is what we're talking about here.  We've said from the beginning that what Hunter Biden did, if he was running around doing all these deals, technically not illegal. ",
