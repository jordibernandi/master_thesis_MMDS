Proudhon, as we saw in the last video, was not an orderly writer, despite ironically arguing that anarchy is order.  So what does he mean by that, anarchy is order?  Well, there are a few themes, orderly ones, that can be found throughout Proudhon's work.  that began what is now referred to as mutualism, a type of libertarian socialism. ",

And where would that law come from?  For Proudhon, justice, equality, equation, equilibrium, and harmony are all synonymous terms.  They are laws of the universal, laws of humanity.  Morality is part of the universal order of things.  If we work out the correct, the right, the moral way of doing things, then we can achieve a peaceful equilibrium. ",

It's my ability to think logically through the events that might happen after that help me to know that it's probably not a good idea.  The reason then we don't steal, fight and murder is not, mostly at least, to do with the threat of arrest, but because we know through our reason the repercussions that follow from acting immorally.  We'll be ostracised, disliked, met with retribution and so on.  This is a moral law.  We act in an ethical way because we can rationally calculate the consequences.  It's a metaphysical law of order that sort of hangs above us.  I use the same type of reasoning to avoid the impulse of eating too much cake or getting drunk all the time.  Following the moral law, then, means not being a slave to my immediate passions, but following what's rational, logical, reasonable. ",

It's not the actual law, the juridical law, that stops us stealing.  It's the moral law, our own reason.  He says, it's by our reflective and reasoning powers with which we seem to be exclusively endowed that we know that it's injurious first to others and then to ourselves to resist the social instinct which governs us and which we call justice.  It's our reason which teaches us that the selfish man, the robber, the murderer, in a word, the traitor to society, sins against nature, and is guilty with respect to others and himself.  This moral law has had a number of names, the voice of conscience, enlightened self-interest, the innate love of others, but as societies, individuals, cultures, humans progress, we'll become better at understanding what's right and what's wrong, what's going to lead to a social equilibrium overall.  He writes, in living with their reason, man first follows a chief, the father, the patriarch, the elder, the good and the wise.  The more ignorant we are, the more we rely on obedience to receive norms and pass down wisdom.  But as we become more educated, have a better understanding of the world, the more we can rely on our own judgment.  he says if he obeys no longer because the king commands but because the king demonstrates the wisdom of his commands it may be said that henceforth he will recognize no authority and that he has become his own king.  ultimately by means of self-instruction and the acquisition of ideas man finally acquires the idea of science that is of a system of knowledge in harmony with the reality of things and inferred from observation.

Anarchism is the absence of any authority, any master, any sovereign, that a person doesn't choose to follow themselves through their own reason and calculation, their own volition.  Proudhon writes that anarchism will be the sovereignty of reason having been substituted for that of revelation, the notion of contract succeeding to that of compulsion, economic critique revealing that political institutions must now be absorbed into the industrial organism.  We fearlessly conclude that the revolutionary formula can no longer be direct government, or any kind of government, but must be no more government.  Anarchism is moral self-direction.  This is what he means by anarchy is order. ",

Instead, Proudhon wishes to preserve the freedom of individualism, he says man is very willing to obey the law of duty serve his country and oblige his friends but he wishes to labor when he pleases where he pleases and as much as he pleases.  he wishes to dispose of his own time to be governed only by necessity to choose his friendships his recreation and his discipline To act from judgement, not by command.  To sacrifice himself through selfishness, not through servile obligation.  Communism is essentially opposed to the free exercise of our faculties, our noblest desires, to our deepest feelings.
