This is in Chicago.  This is in the 1,000 block of North Hamlin Avenue.  36-year-old woman was shot in the lower back.  A 33-year-old young man was shot.  A 44-year-old man was shot.

They're releasing everything when every individual want it.  If we wanna take back our communities, This is how we do it.  You're gonna watch this guy go in here.  It looks like a female right there.  All right, then we'll put him on the ground and rob him.  And they take some drink with them.  They took money and drank.  Duke got a whole bag full.  He said, fuck it, we might as well drink good.  Alright, so man, if y'all got any tips on that, 312-746-DETECTIVE-BAKER.  His extension is 21480.  You know, man, we got to take back our communities.

Come on, man.  You're a coward if you can't get out in boxes.  Three people, four people, y'all even hit a little female.  Y'all couldn't get out in box?  You mean to tell me you ain't got no hands?  Back in the day, man, you had to put them in a circle, man, and violate every one of these cowards.  You couldn't get out and fight.  And what's going to happen is that, man, if you don't put these cats away, man, what they're going to do is they're going to turn around and kill some little innocent little girl like the 13-year-old baby that just got killed on the west side in Austin and the 3-year-old child that just got killed.  It was four children that got killed this weekend.  Four.  Something don't change, we in deep trouble.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment.
