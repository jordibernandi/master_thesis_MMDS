            "text": "I think it was really the fashion industry that inspired me to do this.  It's all about the clothes.  for me.  Fashion illustration is, it's like a different form of expression than photography.  You have a lot of fashion photography out there, but not a lot of fashion illustration.  So it's just a different expression of the figure, a different expression of the wardrobe, the way the wardrobe moves.  It's different than design.  I'm not designing the clothes.  I'm just taking the photo or taking the person and transforming it into something new.  Before photography, there was only illustrators illustrating these ideas for magazines and then helping designers out as well, illustrating the figure, which was a very important part of like seeing the dress before the design was made.  And then, yeah, you had the illustrators who were working for Vogue or WWD.  There was a guy named Ren\u00e9 Grew, and he was one of my favorite illustrators, and he, you know, kind of dominated that field.  But unfortunately, like, once photography came, it was like a quick way to seize the moment, and it kind of took over illustration at the time.  I think an illustration is more special than a photograph.  I know a lot of talented photographers, but it's very straightforward.  This is the image.  With an illustration, you're taking an idea and recreating it into something new, something more magical.  I really want to express a gesture with my fashion illustrations.  It's more mesmerizing.  It captures color and light and movement.  That's really what I want to capture with my illustrations.  So sometimes I'll take a photo and I'll stylize it more.  Everything is always changed up.  It's never exactly the same as a photograph.  I focus more on the clothing when I do the illustration.  I really like couture gowns.  Couture is like a high design, a way of sewing and intricate patterns.  I like that.  it's telling a story in a way.  And I just like the whole movement of the couture compared to a street style that you might see.  For the mediums that I use, I play around with a lot of different things.  I use colored pencil, ink, watercolor, gouache, acrylic, anything that I can find.  I really like to mix it up and try different techniques.  The type of clothing definitely makes a big impact on what I use for the medium.  If I see a flowy dress, I might want to use watercolor because watercolor is very graceful and elegant.  So I combine a lot of digital and traditional methods together, especially when I'm working for a client for a magazine.  So I'll start the illustration off traditionally.  I'll do like a pencil drawing and I'll do my watercolor and ink.  Then I scan it in and I finish it up in Photoshop.  And I might like do this several times to get the exact essence of what I'm trying to represent.  I've worked for a lot of different companies.  In fashion, I've worked for Roger Vivier.  It's like a couture shoe company in Paris.  I've worked for Elle. ",
