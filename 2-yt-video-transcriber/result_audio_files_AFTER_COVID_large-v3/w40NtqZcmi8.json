            "text": "Hi, my name is Mike and today I've got a very encouraging word to share with everyone.  It's called It All Accumulates Now and it was given to Brother Alan Carrico on the 444 Prophecy News site.  It was posted on August the 7th, 2020. this is the message hello my son.  this is jehovah elohim speaking with you this day.  my precious children if you only knew how close the coming of the son of man is to come and get to you there would be no worries in your lives.  the time of the end has come and this means that soon very soon now you will be with me in heaven forever.  this is the best news of all is it not?  Therefore be not downcast as you see the world crumbling before your eyes, for this has been foretold to happen.  I have the keys and I unlock many mysteries for my chosen ones, those who have denied self for me.  I now download to each of you deeper understanding of my ways and why things are as they are.  As you study my word, it will become illuminated in your hearts.  and you will have an understanding that you have never had before.  Now this is not without a reason, for with this understanding you will be asked to do things.  you have never been able to do before, namely the great harvest of the end.  Be of good cheer, my loves, for this is one of the most incredible times to be alive.  All over the earth I am awakening my loving bride, and she will now do those things ordained in heaven before the foundation of the earth were laid.  You will reap a harvest that surpasses all other harvests.  as in the days of that first Pentecost after my resurrection.  I now indwell my empty vessels to the full with my Holy Spirit, the great Rakesh, and he will empower you in this time.  He will give you the words to speak.  He will lead and guide you in the way that you should go.  Draw near to me and do not resist what I am doing in your lives.  Soon this will come to a close and my word will be fulfilled for this time.  The millennium soon begins with my son, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Lord Jesus Christ, will rule and reign with perfection.  Yes, you will see much strife around you for now, but my Rokesh will protect you, guide you and fulfill that which is written in your books in heaven.  That were written before time began.  It all accumulates now with this great outpouring of my spirit upon you.  I am.  And some scriptures are given there to read.  If you want to have a look at that, I'll leave the link to the article in the comments section.  Also, I'll leave a link to a couple more dreams that the Lord has shared with me over the past years, as I feel now is the time to re-release them, as I believe we're really close to the end now.  Anyway, I'll leave it there, and so anyone out there who hasn't come to the Lord Jesus, please do so in prayer of repentance.  God bless you all.  Bye-bye. ",
