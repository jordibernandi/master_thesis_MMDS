            "text": "It's the book of Colossians chapter 3 and verse 17.  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed.  So whatever you're going to do in your words and your deeds, even if that's coming out to the beach on this filthy day.  Keep going.  So for so long, our people have been lied to about who they are according to the scriptures.  We come out here to teach our people the true wisdom and knowledge and understanding according to these scriptures.  So let's get started with Hosea 5 and 1.  Oh my God.  Hey, how you doing, brother?  King, how you doing?  I can holla at you for a minute.  I got my parking ticket.  You got to go pay your parking ticket.  Where you parking at?  In the garage?  In the garage.  Hey, see, in the garage, it takes a long time.  You don't have to go pay that right now.  We parking in the garage, too.  That's the same.  All people are quick to lie to each other for no reason.  I just want to holla at my people.  Bro, let's see what's going on today.  Why are they out here today out of all days?  You all from work from Monday.  because of what is it?  Labor Day, Memorial Day?  Labor Day.  I can care less what day it is because our people are still in bondage in this land.  Our people need to come out of this bondage.  Read that for me, team.  The book of Hosea, chapter 4 and verse 1.  Read that.  Hear the words of the Most High, ye children of Israel.  Who?  Ye children of Israel.  Oh, boy.  I got to holler at you real quick.  You ain't my brother.  You can't talk to your brother real quick.  Next time.  You don't got no time for God, huh?  You don't love God like that, do you?  No, our people don't love God.  They care about themselves more than they care about God.  Keep reading.  But the most high have a controversy with the inhabitants of the land.  The most high got a controversy with the inhabitants of this land.  They don't care less about what the most high think.  Hey, buddy.  Buddy drinking on Red Bull.  Red shirt.  Our people don't care, man.  Keep reading.  The world is being destroyed.  How you doing today, bro?  Can I ask you a quick question?  What's your nationality?  You don't mind me asking?  Potawatomi Indian.  Huh?  Potawatomi Indian, 200 B.C 200  B.C.,  Potawatomi Indian?  Is that from your father's side or your mother's side?  That's from my mama.  That's your mama's side.  What about your father?  Where does he come from?  Your father.  What was his nationality?  He was black.  But why did you automatically hop to your mama's side versus your daddy's side?  Why did we do that?  Why did we do that?  Why would we do that?  Why is that, though?  Because he's the one that... She's birthday, so who put the seed there?  He did.  But there wouldn't be no life without the man, I don't think.  Cool.  At least we got that understanding.  So now, but automatically, when somebody asks you your nationality, you pretty much say, I, to my dad, I'm rapping with my mom name.  Now, mind you, you're not the only person that do that.  A lot of our people want to rock with that.  Give me Numbers 1 and 18.  If you like the scriptures, though, this is how you know who you come from.  Read that for me.  The book of Numbers, chapter 1 and verse 18.  And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month.  And they declared their pedigrees after their families by the house of their fathers.  By the house of their what?  Fathers.  Fathers.  See that?  So who told us these terms?  Black.  Why?  Hey, check it out.  Before they said African-American, guess what they said?  Afro-American.  Do your hair style make your nationality?  Before that, it was Negro, colored.  Why do.  our nationality constantly keep changing?  Why is that?  Nah, it's the reason why they do that, Psalms 83.  It's the reason why our nationality keep changing.  It's a reason why they keep doing that.  And the main reason is they don't want you to know who you really are.  Everybody else knows who they are.  What's your nationality?  What's your nationality?  That's wild.  Now mind you, even the Puerto Ricans, what do the Puerto Ricans mean?  I don't know.  Oh wait.  The word itself, Puerto Rican.  What does it mean?  You speak Spanish?  I'm going to give you a lesson on Puerto Rico.  Puerto.  Puerto Rican.  That's Puerto.  That's what it means.  Literally, that land is rich.  When you pull down to the port, you can see the richness in that land.  But the people themselves didn't call themselves Puerto Ricans.  It was called something way before this.  The people that was.  originally there was one group of people.  But yet, a group of people came over and conquered it.  Now they speak Spanish.  They weren't speaking Spanish before.  Why is that?  The book of Jeremiah, chapter 17, verse 4.  And thou, even thyself, shall discontinue from thine heritage.  You discontinue from your heritage?  You discontinue from this heritage, right?  What was the original tone y'all spoke before you discontinued this thing?  It was Hebrew, right?  You say that.  Now, I'm just, I'm just guessing.  I'm just guessing.  I'm a Christian, so I believe, you know, when Adam and Eve were created, they spoke Hebrew.  I'm not... My nationality?  I'm American.  I was, yep.  I'm not sure.  I don't know my heritage back that far.  No, sir.  Say that again?  My last name's Stewart, so I would say that was probably Scottish.  Scottish?  Yeah, that would be my best guess.  And then my mom's last name is Lingle, which is, I want to say it's Norwegian.  So, yeah, somewhere in Europe, more than definitely.  Hit this for me.  Before you can read that, Jeremiah 16, 19.  We all know this book.  Why?  Because you are the Jewish.  We ain't out here partying like everybody else.  We just came from Shabbat service.  On Wednesday, I'll be at the Friday class.  On Monday, I'll be at the Friday class.  So you understand that?  You got the Bible, you got the scripture, you got that for me?  The book of Jeremiah chapter 16 and verse 19.  Read that verse.  O Most High, my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction.  The Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth.  They shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lives.  Our fathers have inherited lives.  Nobody really knows where they come from.  He's foreshadowing.  That's the way.  That's the way.  That's the way.  That's the way.  My parents are French and Algerian.  Say again?  French and Algerian.  What's your father?  My father is Algerian.  Your father is French and Algerian?  Yeah.  Now, what his father is.  His father is from Algeria.  Now, as you see, if you look at this sign here, is this the one?  Yeah.  Now, we put this sign together through the prophecies written up in the scriptures.  Now, this is dealing with the 12 tribes of the children of Israel.  So, even though she might not be your saint reflection, but actually, y'all are family.  We may all be brothers and sisters.  Now, mind you, everybody needs a brother and sister.  That's the hard core part about it.  Because going to church, Christianity has been lied to.  But shouldn't we all be brothers and sisters in Christ?  No.  No?  No.  You know why?  Because who did Christ come for?  Christ didn't come for everybody.  Yeah, he didn't.  What scripture says that?  It says that when he dies on the cross, that he died for everyone on earth who sins.  He didn't say it on earth.  He was crucified.  Yeah, but for our sins.  But for one, it never said on earth, it said the world.  But how many worlds are there?  We've got to be one of the worlds.  Right?  Who is one of the world?  I'm saying earth is one of the world.  If you believe in multiple worlds.  Well, the scriptures talk about multiple worlds.  But I believe Jesus died for everybody.  Well, it doesn't say that.  Read that for me.  The book of Matthew chapter 1 and verse 21.  Now, that's the beginning of the New Testament right here.  Read that.  And she shall bring forth a son.  Yep.  And thou shalt call his name Yahushua.  Or Jesus after all.  For he shall save his people.  His people.  His people.  His people, period.  From their sins.  His people is a personal pronoun.  Where was Christ from?  Where was Christ from?  Israel.  He was born in Bethlehem.  But what was his nationality?  He's Hebrew.  But Hebrew is not his nationality.  Hebrew wasn't Jewish either.  Because if you ask ISH, one, you won't find the word Jewish nowhere in the Bible.  You'll find Jew, but not Jewish.  It's a Israelite.  Israelite.  But he was from the seed of David, which is from the tribe of Judah.  That's where he came from, the Judah tribe.  So Judah is what?  The foreborn son of the man named Israel.  So he came from these people.  He didn't come from everybody.  This is the law.  Read that stuff.  The book of Hebrews chapter 7 and verse 14.  For it is evident.  For it is evident.  It's clear.  That our Lord sprang out of Judah.  Out of what?  Judah.  We're talking about what the scripture says.  Not what my personal opinion is.  Not what his and nobody else's.  Even you.  We're talking about what the scripture says today.  And that's the key thing.  Because the whole thing is to get into the scripture.  Read it.  So nobody can lie to you.  So nobody can get in my way.  And keep that from me.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Come on this side now.  That's that something burning.  So when you pray, you folks will have some furnace.  That's why people burn that strange smoke called marijuana cigarettes and all that other stuff.  You can't destroy your temple.  Then turn around and ask God to bless you.  The book of Isaiah chapter 45 and verse 17.  But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation.  He shall not be ashamed nor confounded.  Our world is gonna be without me.  Right now, we don't have rule ship in this kingdom.  That's why we in the hellish state.  That's why we can get shot down in the streets if nobody cares.  We gotta kill the police dog and see what happens.  So why is a dog like more than the so-called black man?  What makes your life more pleasurable than an ant?  Anything in the world that you're not... No, that's them.  If you want to hear this word of mine, it's not for everybody.  That's how when that read out, he rolled off.  It's not for everybody.  Because this is the truth of the body.  Sometimes to hear the real truth is... You son of a motherfucker.  Because at the day, nobody knows.  She's standing there, he's standing there, all these people standing out there, and they hear these words.  So at the end of the day, you can't say, oh, I didn't know.  But most of the time, they'll look at you and say, you know those guys that were standing out there in that car, giving that great stuff to you?  But you always know from the inside, though.  You know from the inside, though.  You always know from the inside.  Some people ain't got no impact.  Some people ain't got no impact.  Some people ain't got no impact.  No soul.  No soul whatsoever.  If I told you... You got to have a son, man.  If I told you I got a vibe, you wouldn't believe me.  I'm sorry?  If I told you a vibe, you wouldn't believe me.  A vibe?  You know what a vibe thing is?  A big-ass serpent that's in the water.  He comes after all the fish.  Scripture says this.  We are the chosen people of God.  We are the chosen people of God.  The so-called blacks, the so-called Hispanics, the so-called Native Americans spread through the four corners of this earth.  through the transatlantic slave trade, through the trans-Saharan slave trade, through the different slave trades that it has.  Mind you, even our people are in China.  They build up the wall in China.  People say, no, look it up.  Look at the first black samurai.  He was a samurai that led everything else.  But they try to hide these things.  So the samurai didn't have black blood.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you can't be a samurai without having black and white.  I don't want to hear this.  OK, I'm sharing.  My great grandmother was full.  But what was your father?  My father, his grandmother.  Father, it goes by the seed of your father.  Father, father, father, father.  Cherokee, Puerto Rican, might be from the seed of Israel.  All I can tell everybody here, if you know you're a child of Israel, ",
