            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Hora, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  Who is the bride according to the Word of God?  If you're born again, if you call on Yeshua, Jesus, as your personal Savior, as God, and you're under the blood, then you are born again and you are called the bride of Yeshua, Jesus.  But you're called the bride according to the Word of God in stage number one.  What is stage number one?  It is the betrothal process.  The engagement.  We find this in the book of Hosea chapter 2 verse 19 and 20.  And I will patrol you to me forever.  I will patrol you to me in righteousness and in justice and in steadfast love and mercy.  And I will patrol you to me in faithfulness and you shall know the Lord.  So God says, I will patrol you unto me forever in righteousness.  The Bible says that all of us have fallen short of the glory, but through him we become righteous.  Through him we become priests.  We become the bride of Jesus Yeshua.  But notice here in verse 20, And thou shalt know the Lord.  In the book of Genesis, chapter 4, verse 1, it said, And Adam knew his wife.  It's speaking about an intimate relationship.  It's not like you know me and I know you.  It's an intimate relationship.  And God says in the book of Hosea, he'll patrol us forever.  But it says, and thou shall know the Lord.  So God wants to have that intimate relationship with us.  What's called the sanctification process.  So we are in stage number one right now.  Stage number one is the patrol process, but we have to run the race, make it to the end in order to consummate the marriage.  Now the question has to be asked if we're patrolled to Yeshua, to Jesus, and we're not yet married, we have not yet consummated the marriage.  How is it that we're called the bride?  Because according to the Bible, according to the biblical Hebrew foundation, when a man patrols a woman, they're legally married, but they're not yet living together.  They have not yet consummated the marriage.  In the same way, we are legally married to Yeshua now, if we're under the blood of Jesus, but we have not yet consummated the marriage.  We are in stage number one.  And we see this with Joseph and Mary.  In Matthew chapter one, verse 19, it says, and her husband, Joseph, being a just man, and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.  How is it that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary?  They weren't married yet.  They were only engaged.  Because according to the Bible, according to the biblical Hebrew foundation, when a man was patrolled to a woman, she was considered his bride.  And therefore, in his mind, he could divorce her.  Okay, so we read in Jeremiah chapter 3, verse 8, I gave... faithless Israel, her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries.  So we can see that God divorced Israel and only through Messiah Yeshua, only through Jesus can that marriage be united together.  Man fell into sin and the only way that man can restore the relationship together with God and be back in the garden, be back in the kingdom together with God in the new Jerusalem, new heavens, new earth through the consummation of the marriage.  and that can only be done through Messiah Yeshua.  now it says that he gave Israel a certificate of divorce.  if you're born again then you are grafted into the olive tree Romans 11 15 to 17 and you become part of spiritually Israel.  what Paul speaks about in Ephesians 2 15 the one new man Jews that have rejected Messiah Yeshua, when they have that Damascus road experience and accept Yeshua, Jesus, as their personal savior.  The Bible says in Romans 11, 23, that they're grafted back into the olive tree.  And this is the biblical concept.  And then the patrol process begins of stage number one, the sanctification process, running the race, making it to the end, having a relationship with the groom.  God is not interested in religion.  God is interested in a relationship.  This is why we always say in our ministry that we don't follow the rabbis.  We don't follow a tradition.  We follow only Yeshua, only Jesus in context, in the word of God.  And this is what he desires.  And he desires to have a relationship with us, as it says in the book of Hosea, and thou shall know the Lord.  So what does it really make a difference?  If you know stage one, stage two, it makes a huge difference because there's a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of chocolate messages out there that are very confusing and actually very dangerous to the body of Yeshua.  because if we're walking around preaching and telling everybody you're the bride and it's all true but it's partly true you are the bride but you're in stage number one if we're telling everybody that they're the bride then they don't need to go through the sanctification process they don't need to get to know the groom because either way they're going to consummate the marriage.  so that's the danger of going around telling people you're the bride you're under grace.  everything is okay.  But if people understand that they're in the patrol process in stage number one, and they have to get to know the groom to have that intimate relationship, to run the race, to make it to the end, this is very, very important because it prepares us for Yeshua's second coming.  And when the Bible says he comes as a thief in the night, but to those of you who are children of the light, to you, you will not come as a thief in the night.  That's what it's speaking about.  If you're prepared, if you're in Messiah Yeshua, if you're in the word of God, if you have relationships, Then when he does come to you, he will not come as a thief in the night.  But if you've been told that you're the bride and that means that you're going to consummate the marriage, no matter what, then there's a danger of not being told about the stages.  Stage number one, the patrol process, sanctification, get to know the groom, make it to the end and consummate the marriage.  So it is important to know the stages in order to prepare us for Yeshua's second coming.  And we see what's happening right now in the world with the COVID-19.  We see what's happening in Europe.  We see what's happening in America.  We see what's happening in Turkey.  The time is near.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that there's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  And this is the time of the sanctification process.  This is the time to get to know the groom in that intimate relationship and prepare ourselves for his second coming.  And if we do that, we'll be able to overcome all the obstacles, all the sicknesses, all the diseases of this world through Messiah Yeshua.  Revelation 14, verse 12.  This calls for patience and endurance on the part of people of God who keep his commandments, his word, and remain faithful to Jesus Yeshua.  This is how we run the race, make it to the end, and consummate the marriage.  That's what it's all about.  It's all about running the end.  This world is passing.  The troubles of this world is passing.  The COVID-19 is passing.  What is not passing is the new heavens, new earth, new Yerushalayim, the consummation of the marriage.  That's what it's all about.  And in the process, we need to preach the gospel, work the harvest together as the one new man.  And one of the beautiful pictures in the Bible is a story of Ruth.  So in Ruth chapter one, verse four, It says, and they married Moabite woman, one named Orpah and the other one named Ruth.  Now, Orpah in Hebrew means to turn the back or to turn the neck.  Ruth in Hebrew, Ruthi, means a friend.  And we know that Ruth was a friend of Israel.  And it's a beautiful picture of the end time church, the end time congregation, that one will turn their back to Israel and the other one will be a friend of Israel, work the harvest together as the one new man and consummate the marriage.  And in Ruth chapter two, verse 23, it says, so Ruth stayed close to the woman of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvest were finished.  So the beautiful picture that we see in Ruth chapter two, verse 23 is working the harvest together, the friend of Israel as the one new man.  That's a beautiful picture of the end times as we continue to stand together as the one new man, make it to the end, consummate the marriage and go home.  And until that time, For Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn.  Her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that that blazing torch is Yeshua.  Because the word for salvation in Hebrew is the word Yeshua.  Her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  And we know.  that he's coming back to take everything that the enemy has stolen as a blazing torch, as a lion of the tribe of Judah, Revelation 5.  And we come to reign back with him as the victorious bride.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Aliyah Yehudah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
