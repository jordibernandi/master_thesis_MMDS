            "text": "Hello everyone.  Well, we got our own surprise this morning because I just ran down to the pen in between broadcasts to do the animals and to make sure they're okay.  And this morning I had an urge, I know it was the Lord, to go look in this little rubber made bin we have here.  We kind of have it here as a toy for the animals.  Yeah, it has a hole in it.  There's a new one coming.  But I looked in it and lo and behold, look what I found in there.  Callie had a baby bunny.  Callie had a baby bunny.  Can you believe it?  Callie is a mama.  Say hi to the world, little one.  It's your first close-up here.  I know he's got wood shavings on him right now.  He's like, hi, everyone.  I've arrived.  And so basically, Callie is a mama.  Where is she?  I know the father is too, and he's getting fixed.  It's amazing she only had one.  I didn't think he was old enough yet because I had taken him for his appointment, his checkup, so he could get fixed.  And basically I had to do it this in portrait.  I'm sorry.  I could not do it in landscape because of the baby bunny and making sure I could properly hold the baby bunny.  And there's the, here he is.  Here's the culprit.  It's a car.  There he is.  Look, he's running away right now.  There he goes.  There he is.  There's the papa.  So he will be getting fixed now, rest assured.  He already got his appointment.  So basically, yeah, he's going to get fixed.  And basically, we have ourselves a beautiful little baby bunny now that is just the most adorable little thing since sliced bread.  Right?  So basically, I wanted to show off the newbie in the pen to all of you.  Right now, it's hanging out in that Rubbermaid container.  But because there's a nest in there, basically.  There's fur and there's wood shavings.  I can feel the bunny.  The bunny's nice and warm.  So I don't want to move her from there yet because it's keeping her nice and warm.  And it's got a lip on it so she can't jump out and then... try to crawl out somewhere.  So it's safe for her right now.  Maybe I'll try to make, I'm going to try to get another Rubbermaid bit and do the same thing with a newer one because we've had that one a while.  And basically, yeah.  So God bless you, little one.  Welcome to the sanctuary.  She does have a on one of her joints.  so basically yeah it's a little bubble.  so i have a call into the vet and uh hopefully the vet will come see her and that's how big she is.  look at my palm.  there she is say hi little one say hi everybody.  this is my first close-up ever.  So just wanted to share the good news, the big news with everybody.  This is the first time this has happened, so nobody panic.  Issachar is getting fixed.  And yes, that's how we're going to approach this.  He already had his checkup with the vet, which he needs before they get fixed.  And we'll go from there.  Excuse me, there's something in my eye here.  So God bless all of you.  Keep the faith.  Little Newbie says bye, and we'll see you later. ",
