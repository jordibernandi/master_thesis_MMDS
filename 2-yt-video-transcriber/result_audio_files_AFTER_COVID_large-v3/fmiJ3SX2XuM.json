We need the elected officials that you helped get elected to tell Nancy Pelosi that you will not vote for her as speaker unless Medicare for all is put on the House floor for a vote.  I think it's a really smart idea.  You know, the worst abuse of power, Crystal, is not using the power you have to fight for people.  Will they?  Time to let AOC know they have no other option because we're watching and we see through their bullshit excuses.  We have to put public pressure on them.  I want to see who's going to vote against health care in the middle of a pandemic.  If you're not going to do it now, you are never going to do it.  You phony.  All the people who filled up your voicemail, they're going to remember whether you did the right thing here.  Which side are they really on?  This is where you force progressive House members to reveal who they answer to.  Do they answer to their constituents or do they answer to the party bosses?  Listen to AOC's own words. ",
