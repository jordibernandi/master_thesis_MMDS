            "text": "I was a challenger down at TCF, and I did experience a lot of things of what people are saying.  There was intimidation.  There was the cock blocking.  On Monday, November 23, 2020, I attended a Stop the Steal U.S.  rally in Lansing, Michigan.  Liberals expect us to respect the vote, as one of their signs said, as certified by corrupt government officials, two Democrats and two Republicans on the Board of Canvassers, 3-0 certified with one abstention, declaring Biden successful in this election.  They should respect the truth.  The truth is Biden and his co-conspirators,  i.e.,  Michigan's executive branch, corrupt politicians, Governor Whitmer, Attorney General Nessel, and Secretary of State Benson, definitely stole this election in 2020, and most likely in 2018, with Dominion ballot machines.  I would also speculate the Democrats did the same in 2008 and 2012 for Obama's reign of destruction in America.  Please, please, please.  Please, sir.  Please, sir.  Please, sir.  Please, sir.  Please, sir.  All right.  So my question, though, is on Wayne County.  Welcome to the Senate Oversight Committee.  You have three minutes.  Thank you, committee.  I am so happy to be here.  Let me put my hat back on because this is my prize right here.  This is the winner who won the election.  Can't get all into this because I probably got a few more seconds.  But let me tell you, it was voter fraud at its finest.  Pure and calculated fraud.  And I wouldn't be surprised if people up here was involved.  But this young man right here, Senator McDaniel, Donald, I got to give you kudos.  I see you're interested in this.  And Senator Theese, I have to give you kudos because I see you're really paying attention.  I wish Senator Lucido was here because I say he's paying attention.  And now I think you will pay attention.  And I plead the blood of Jesus over this fraud and that everybody that was part of it and know about it.  will be convicted.  and they soul and they spirit, they won't sleep, they won't eat until they come right.  Thank you, Jesus.  Amen.  That last part is not relevant to the election.  You're attempting to seek a pardon, so why is this not part of that?  I will ask that he be disciplined for that.  First of all, what he said is untrue.  Second, that is a defamation of my professional character.  Do you allow that?  Do you allow that to happen in your legislature?  As I said, Representative, let's keep it limited to the Germain issue here.  Dr.  Michael Dubiel?  Then on deck is still Braden Giocabasi?  A few things that I saw, right off the bat, I saw table supervisors distinguished with the emblem on the chest, wearing political statements.  I saw Black Lives Matter on masks.  I saw t-shirts, undershirts, wearing Black Lives Matter, which I didn't know was appropriate.  And I did not see anything.  Trump, but I saw a lot of masks that said, BLM, rhinestones.  Don't forget the rhinestones.  Question?  Oh, Senator Santana, please.  Thank you, Chairman.  You mentioned that some of the people had on shirts that said black people.  better, right?  Black lives matter.  Okay.  Did anybody have on a shirt that said vote for this person, vote for that person?  Not that I was aware of.  Okay.  Thank you, Chair.  But distinguished on the face masks.  And it was, I want to make this clear, it was underneath the T-shirt of the table supervisors.  It wasn't outward.  It was underneath the T-shirt that they were wearing.  I understand.  Chairman.  Thank you.  With all due respect, I mean, there's a sign right here that says black votes for Trump.  So, I mean.  I don't believe that, I mean, that there's, I don't believe that there is a statute that prohibits the wearing of non- political candidate shirts.  What I'm holding in my hand are affidavits.  These are sworn under oath.  They have the power of evidence because they're sworn under oath.  These are the things on which you bring indictments.  And they allege massive cheating, particularly on the part of the Democrat Party of Detroit, to the extent of easily five, six, 700,000 illegal votes.  easily five six seven hundred thousand illegal folks.  i had a lot of respect.  i still have a lot of respect for this country and i don't believe in racism.  um as like the mainstream media narrative.  and uh the fact that now as um the other representative said that you can actually show up and vote without an id it's shocking.  how can you allow that to happen?  like A lot of people think all Indians look alike.  I think all Chinese look alike.  So how would you tell?  And I don't believe in racism.  I think all Chinese look alike.  And I don't believe in racism.  I think all Chinese look alike.  And I don't believe in racism.  I think all Chinese look alike.  I struggled to get to, and I said to our attorney, Tim Griffin, I said, Tim, they won't let us challenge anything.  He goes, Chris, you got to get at least something in the poll book that you challenged.  And I said, I'll push it until I get arrested.  Well, lo and behold, I didn't get arrested.  They didn't put cuffs on me, but I was pulled out of there for about 20 minutes by three police officers.  My question, Ms.  Jacobs, is Judge Kenney has ruled that your testimony in court is incorrect and not credible.  So why should we believe anything that you said here today?  So my question for you is, you know, you're making claims here today that there's systematic fraud in what's going on in our elections.  Are the courts also tied up in that fraud?  Let me tell you what I did by accident, okay?  I gave Channel 7 an interview that they tied in to that and made me the witness.  That's uncredible.  Guess what?  If I understand your testimony, you're saying that about 14 days before the election, your supervisor, Carla, told you that people could vote without ID.  And you said that for your peace of mind, you insisted that people provide ID.  Are you aware that people in Michigan can vote without identification?  In fact, I've always voted that way.  You're not aware of that, ma'am?  Members of the audience, please, let's be respectful.  Thank you.  Are you aware of that, ma'am?  Zero to 14 days, that is the restricted registration time.  You have to have the ID and also the proof of residency.  And if you don't have the driver's license, you have to submit an affidavit and also you have to have a passport or something, photo ID.  That's my understanding.  Okay.  You're confused.  Thank you.  I was a challenger down at TCF, and I did experience a lot of things of what people are saying.  There was intimidation.  There was the cock blocking of us being able to see the actual process.  Yeah, what I saw was, it was disturbing, and I could see how people could be... You go in a very large room, it's really hot.  I had a little thermometer with me to check my temperature through the course of the day.  It's 85 degrees in there.  Whatever you want to say about Dominion, read its history.  Read the history of Dominion, and you will get an idea of what a crooked company it is, which maybe is the reason they don't want to show up here.  They really don't want to tell you that the two of them that own it are Venezuelans, and the two Smartmatic owners, they brought the two guys who are Canadians down to meet Chavez just two years ago.  They brought the two guys who are Canadians down to meet Chavez just two years ago.  Representative Camilleri.  Thank you, Mr.  Chair.  Mr.  Giuliani, this committee heard testimony from a bipartisan group of county clerks in Michigan.  One was a Democrat and two were Republicans.  They testified that they found no evidence whatsoever of widespread irregularities in this election, and they lauded the municipal clerks and their teams who run elections in Michigan for their tireless effort and commitment to free, fair, and safe elections.  Your team has now lost 39 court cases in the aftermath of the election with judges ruling that there is inadequate evidence to support the sweeping claims that you are making and repeating here tonight and the unprecedented relief that you are seeking.  Yesterday, we learned that U.S.  Attorney General William Barr has similarly found no evidence whatsoever of widespread irregularities that are worth investigating.  If our local clerks, state and federal judges across the country, and the highest ranking law enforcement official in the United States cannot find any substance to or any merit in any of your arguments, why should we?  Why should we sit here in the show that you are partaking in and taking around the country if no one has found any evidence whatsoever of any of your wrongdoing?  And why should we not believe the reported attempts of you to try to seek a pardon from the president?  What was the last part?  That last part is not relevant to the election.  You're attempting to seek a pardon, so why is this not part of that?  I will ask that he be disciplined for that.  The poll book is completely off.  Completely off.  Off by 30,000?  I'd say that poll book is off by over 100,000.  That poll book... Why don't you look at the registered voters on there?  How many registered voters are on there?  Do you even know the answer to that?  No, I guess I'm trying to get to the bottom of this here.  Zero.  There's zero.  So, my question then... is if the... Guess how many... Wait.  What about the turnout rate?  120%?  Let's let Representative Johnson ask his question.  So the poll book number... There's two things that could happen here.  Either the poll book number... If ballots were counted multiple times, there's two options.  Option number one is that the poll book numbers are not going to match.  They don't?  The actual... not by thousands and thousands of votes.  That's not what we see right now.  You take a look again.  Take a look again.  Option number two is that they essentially were filling in names of people who didn't vote.  Dead people, too?  So is that your suggestion?  Let's let Representative Johnson ask his question, and then when he's done... I thought that was his answer.  That's why my question is, we're not seeing the poll book off by 30,000 votes.  That's not the case.  What did you guys do?  Take it and do something crazy to it?  I'm just saying the numbers are not off by 30,000 votes.  I know what I saw.  I know what I saw.  And I signed something saying that if I'm wrong, I can go to prison.  Did you?  Okay, we're... I'm just trying to ask you a legitimate question here.  Yeah, let's let Representative Johnson ask his question and then don't interrupt him.  And then if you want to respond to it, that's fine.  Did you have more, Representative?  Yeah, I guess I just want to keep following back up with the poll book.  So are we saying that the poll book is either wildly off or that they are filling in names?  It's wildly off and dead.  people voted and illegals voted.  So that's my answer.  I will ask that he be disciplined for that.  First of all, the answer that I gave you is they didn't bother to interview a single witness, just like you.  Single witness, just like you.  Single witness, just like you.  And I don't believe in racism, I think all Chinese look alike. ",
