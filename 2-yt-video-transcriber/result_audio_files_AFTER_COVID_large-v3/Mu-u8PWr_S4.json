            "text": "Hey everyone, Rights Crispy here.  I've been given the green light by my attorney to share the video of when I was illegally arrested.  So stay tuned for that, but right now I'm using this drone footage of Indian Rocks Beach from this morning to show you the beach closures and also to use it as a backdrop to give you a little bit of insight as to the events that led up to the illegal arrest.  But first, I want to thank Vince Pawlowski of the Pawlowski Mestrilli Law Group for his diligent efforts and his letter to the state attorney, which I included in this video that you'll be able to read.  And aside from the fact that I did nothing wrong, I believe that letter played a large part in having the charges dropped.  And they handle all kinds of legal matters, so you can find them at megajustice.com.  All right, here's an aerial view of where the incident occurred.  The guy in the blue line flag truck cut me off by crossing this solid white line, and we were at the very last entrance of this parking lot.  So he could have easily gone around to Seminole Boulevard and gone in through that entrance as well.  But we both parked.  We both got out of our cars.  There was no horn honking, no yelling.  There was no road rage.  And I explained to him, sir, you can't cross the solid white line like that.  He had trouble understanding me.  He doesn't speak English very well.  So I took a picture of his flag and his van, and he didn't like that, so he called the cops on me.  Here's the 911 call.  The 911 operator goes on to argue with him about the address. ",
