And then they changed it to Which,  P.S.,  it's annoying me that it would even say American Indians because it's like, wouldn't God know that that's not what they fucking are?  Anyway, and then in 2006, after DNA evidence came out, the church changed it to... They're Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.  Prove it!  And then, another update, the church conceded in its 2014 Book of Mormon and DNA Studies essay that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA.  The church, through this essay, makes a major shift in narrative from the past dominant narrative and claims of the origins of the Native American Indians.  So basically, in the past, they thought all Native... Americans came from Lamanites, right?  And then they changed it to be like, some of them came from that.
