            "text": "Okay, the white rappers that they have hit up like my man MC Search, my man R.A.  the Rugged Man, even this dude Ritz, even the Yellow Wolf.  They all agreed that this is black music and that technically in their mind, even though they don't want to truly admit it, but they know white people are guests in the house of hip hop and they all said that.  All the white people said it.  It's the black people who are connected to white people.  Because damn near every one of those black people you name is connected to a white person somewhere that they fuck with in hip-hop.  All of them are quick to go against the black man's word and say, oh no, this shit is for everybody.  But... No, no, no, papi.  Yes, hip-hop is a universal music.  Like... But black people created it.  You understand what I'm saying?  Black people created something that's universal.  This is still some black shit though.  You understand what I'm telling you?  This is still some black shit regardless if it's proliferated all over the world.  The English language is spoken... all over the world.  does every person who speaks the english language have a right to talk about the affairs of england?  hell no that makes no sense.  okay that's their affairs.  i love this language.  this is my native language but it's truly not my language.  i'm a guest to this language because it's the english language.  where is in?  i'm not in england i'm in america And there's plenty of people all around the world that speak English, people that speak Spanish.  Are they in Spain?  Can they go over and speak and go to Spain and say, you know what, I think y'all, since I speak Spanish and I love it and I'm a participant in Spanish speaking culture, I should now be able to go to Spain and say how the direction of Spain is.  should be run.  That's absurd.  That's absurd.  And then to say somebody doesn't own a kind of music.  I mean, mariachi music is Mexican music.  Polka music is fucking Polish music.  You know, the Scottish fuck with bagpipes and shit like that.  You know, Japanese have anime and shit like that.  Like, if I like anime and I can draw anime well, does that mean I can go to fucking Japan and start making fucking policy on anime?  No.  Can the Wu-Tang Clan go to the true Shaolin Temple and start saying, yo, this is how we're going to start doing these fucking forms now.  This is how we're going to fucking start kicking and punching and shit.  The fuck out of there.  That sounds fucking ridiculous.  You're a guest.  Wu-Tang would be a guest at the Shaolin Temple just like white people are a guest in hip-hop.  And what the fuck's wrong with being a guest?  You have to be a guest at the fucking Hilton or the fucking Borgata or the W or some shit like that.  Why you can't be a guest in my house?  Like, why is that such a bad thing to be?  You know what I mean?  It's because your white entitlement of feeling like you have to own every fucking thing is what's getting in the way right now.  Like being a participant doesn't make you an owner.  And that's just the fucking bottom line.  And you just got to deal with it.  You know what I mean?  The truth hurts, man.  The truth hurts. ",
