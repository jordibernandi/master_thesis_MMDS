He said he'd make the country great, at least that was his promise.  Hey, Ivanka, it's Randy.  Have you seen?  Thanks.  And now that it's a mess, you'd think at least he'd try to calm us.  Donald.  Donald.  Donald.  Donald.  There's riots all around for an injustice that's systemic.  And suffering and sadness from a dangerous pandemic.  I sexted Jared Kushner and I drove by Mitch McConnell.  I looked on every golf course and I checked every McDonald's.  His Adderall kicks in and since it makes him kind of hyper, he acts like he's a big shot.  But he's scared to wet his diaper.  Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald, Donald.  Guess who's hiding in the basement?  It's that coward, the Bunker Boy.  Who's dividing?  Cause it makes him feel empowered, the Bunker Boy.  A commander-in-chief might address all the grief and what's happening out in the streets.  But he's only a clown, so he hides underground and he sits on the toilet and tweets.  So be careful not to scare him.  He's a fly.  At the height of the protests outside the White House, President Trump was moved to the bunker.  I wonder if there's Wi-Fi on a special tanning station.  I bet it smells like hamburgers and quiet desperation.  I hear they had to childproof the bunk bed that they got him.  Does he have a little ladder?  Doesn't need one.  He's a bottom. ",

Then he heads for the hills and he Netflix and chills while he calls out the National Guard.  For the camera he mugs as he calls them all thugs while they beg him to stand up and lead.  Then he sends in the cops for his own photo ops and he acts like he knows how to read.  Oh, who's that?  Who's that dodger?  Who's that clasp on?  Who's Filoni?  The Bunker Boy.  Bunker Boy.  Bunker Boy.  Who's that dodger with no mask on?  It's that phony.  The Bunker Boy.  Bunker Boy.  Bunker Boy.  So he lies there alone and he jabs on the phone to his girlfriends like Putin and Kim.  He's embarrassed because they're all laughing at us.  But they're all only laughing at him.  All only laughing at him.  All only laughing at him.  Who's that hiding? ",
