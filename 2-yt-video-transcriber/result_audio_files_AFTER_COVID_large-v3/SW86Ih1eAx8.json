            "text": "Zakir Naik, who's the most popular Muslim apologist in the world, he's actually encouraging Muslims to keep databases of information on critics of Islam so that the moment we're traveling and we end up going into a Muslim country, we can be arrested and thrown in jail.  and so i mean this is not some random fringe guy.  i mean can you imagine a christian saying hey anyone who's criticizing islam?  we need to keep documents of information on them so that as soon as they entered as soon as they enter a christian country we could lock them up and then charge them for things they did in in the non-christian country?  that would sound absolutely insane to us.  this is the top muslim apologist in the world who's advocating this.  so basically They're trying to get creative.  They're trying to get, dare I say, artistic in their response.  And so my message to them is, there's only one real artist in this discussion, and it ain't you guys.  And I'll show you by using your Quran. ",

It's an interesting look on you, for sure.  You oughta get some yellow, you oughta do your beard like yellow to really bring out the artistic look.  Like a yellow beard, your black specs, and your red beret hat, I think it'd really bring your vibe together.  But all that to say, David, you you're right.  There have been these threats that Muslims have put out against, you know, apologist families and different people who are believers.  And you have went back at them and you've based that off of a verse in the Koran that you believe is.  That gives you some ammunition to help kind of slow down the threat.  So you're sort of playing their own game.  And now you've got this idea of drilling the Quran.  What's that all about?  What are you going to do there? ",

            "text": "Well, it's good to, you know, the two birds with one stone type approach.  If you can do multiple things with one, one task then well that that's kind of that's kind of cool.  so you take something like the Muslim apologists who are trying to silence people.  And keep in mind, all of this, all of this, whether we're talking about Zakir Naik telling Muslims to keep databases of information in order to have people arrested if they travel into a Muslim country, whether it's Muhammad Hijab going after people's wives, whether it's Ali Dawah saying that when Islam takes over an area, ex-Muslims are gonna be executed.  Whether it's Ijaz Ahmed doxing people, giving out their personal information and so on.  All of this, it all has the exact same goal, right?  It all has the exact same goal.  In Christianity, if you become a Christian, Christianity has some rules.  Those rules apply to you, right?  Christianity doesn't say, oh, and by the way, you non-Christians, here's how you have to live.  There have been Christians who did that, right?  You've had Christian empires, Christian nations that imposed things on non-Christian people.  But Christianity, that's not the ideology or the religion that does that.  You're not commanded to do that.  Whereas in Islam, Islam does not just have a set of rules for people who believe in Islam.  It has a set of rules for the people who believe in Islam, and it has a set of rules for the people who don't believe in Islam.  And the people who believe in Islam are supposed to force the people who don't believe in Islam to follow those rules that are made for them.  That's easy to do in a Muslim country where in a place like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, you can lock someone up for blasphemy.  I see myself frozen on the screen.  Do you still hear me? ",

            "text": "Okay.  So in a Muslim country, that's very easy to do.  You can just lock people up.  In a non-Muslim country, you have to get a little creative.  How do you make people follow the rules that they're supposed to follow according to Islam when they don't believe in those things and you can't enforce that on them?  So how exactly do you do that?  Well, there are all kinds of ways you can do that, but notice it's just amazing how successful they've been at this, right?  Politicians, the media, educators, entertainers, these guys all walk on eggshells around the topic of Islam.  No one cares if you're blasting away at Christianity, but things get very, very sensitive as soon as you're talking about Islam.  Well, guess what?  That's exactly how it's supposed to be according to Islam.  You can blast away at anything, just not Islam.  And so in a Muslim country, you can blast away at all kinds of things, just not Islam.  Here we are in non-Muslim countries and we end up with almost the same thing.  You can criticize Islam to some extent.  But you're going to take some heat for it, right?  You're going to be threatened by people who will threaten you over that sort of thing.  But even from non-Muslims, you get labeled a racist.  You get labeled a hate monger.  Even if you're a Christian, you're blasting away at Islam because you're trying to help Muslims leave Islam.  You get blasted by your fellow Christians.  Oh, how can you be so hateful criticizing Islam?  And that's kind of what I'm talking about with, you know, we absorb these ideas that we didn't get from the Bible.  You didn't get this idea from Jesus.  You didn't get this idea from the Bible.  We kind of absorb the idea at some point.  Hey, if you're blasting away at someone's ideology, it's because you hate that person.  Where in the name of common sense did you get that?  Well, you've basically been manipulated.  You've been manipulated.  You've been had.  And so Islam is doing everything it can to make other people adhere to the rules that Islam has set for us.  And I think at some point, at some point, you just have to say no.  And you just have to say, no, I'm not following your rules.  And so just to give you an example, Muhammad, Muhammad, Once he conquered Mecca, once he had power over the pagans, Muhammad smashed the idols of the pagans of Mecca.  So once he conquered Mecca, there were 360 idols at the Kaaba.  Muhammad smashed them to pieces.  Say what you want, but you can't say that's very respectful towards other people's religion.  Somehow, if you ask them, if you tell a Muslim, hey, you know, I'm going to drill a hole in your Quran.  Oh, well, we would never, we would never do that with another person's religion.  What are you saying?  Are you saying you're better than your prophet?  Your prophet had utter contempt for non-Muslim religions.  He smashed people's idols.  He didn't care.  So on what basis are you condemning me?  You can't condemn me on the basis of Islam.  I mean, you can.  You can say because it's, because... You're doing something to the Koran, which we believe in.  Therefore, you shouldn't do that.  But yes, if it were not the Koran, then it would be fine.  But that's not what they say.  They say, well, it's wrong.  It's wrong to insult someone's religion.  Absolute nonsense.  It's absolute nonsense.  Islam shows more contempt for non-Islamic religions than Islam.  anyone else, anyone else does. ",
