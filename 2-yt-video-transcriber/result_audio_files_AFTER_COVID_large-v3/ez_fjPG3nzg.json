We had a good relationship with Hitler until he invaded Europe.  Now, you might be thinking, but that was a long time ago, Joe.  What are you talking about?  I actually did the math.  So I think he's talking about, let's say he's talking about roughly 1935, early Hitler.  Joe got into the Senate in 1921, right?  That was 100 years ago, roughly.  And so that means 14 years.  the difference between 1921 and 1935.  So for 14 years, Joe Biden was in the Senate because he was in in 1921.  You see what I did there?  And apparently he had a good relationship with Hitler at the time. ",
