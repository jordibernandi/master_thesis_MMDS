And in addition to that, when that occurred, what did Romney do?  Romney said, no, let the Detroit go bankrupt.  We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.  Governor Romney said, no, let foreclosures hit the bottom.  But it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says 47% of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives.  My friend recently in a speech in Washington said 30% of the American people are takers.  These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors.  They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. ",

I love this place.  Look, what's not to like about Vermont?  One of the things I'm proudest of.  is getting passed, getting moved, getting control of the Paris Climate Accord.  I'm the guy that came back after meeting with Deng Xiaoping and making the case that I believe China would join if we put pressure on them.  You had people like Margaret, excuse me, you had people like the former chairman and leader of the party in Germany.  Go to Joe 30330.  Watch what happened when those kids from Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president.  And some of you covered it.  It's not that they don't want to help.  They don't know quite what to do.  Play the radio.  Make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone.  Make sure the kids hear words.  And to get hot, I got a lot of, I got hairy legs that turn, that turn blonde in the sun.  And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.  They'd look at it.  So I learned about roaches.  I learned about kids jumping on my lap.  And I've loved kids jumping on my lap. ",
