            "text": "I know she don't want me to get another bit.  I wanted another bit.  Something big.  I gotta get these little bitty ass punk dogs.  What's up guys?  I said, don't you know?  No, I hate that.  I don't have the King Corso.  And they're like, oh, shit.  What's up, Evelyn?  Barbecuing at Mike's.  Yeah, yeah, Barbecue King.  He was getting it.  My man got it in.  We were here barbecuing at the crib.  My dude Mike, he's the barbecue gorilla right here.  Looking like Beanie Man and shit.  My brother Mike here my route live.  Mike.  choke holds.  is there a way?  you're an expert on martial art.  is there a way to get out of a choke hold?  oh absolutely there's a lot of ways.  one's a gun no but but yeah there's definitely ways to get out of the choke hold.  but remember there's two different kind of chokes.  there's a choke that you see in ufc okay or you know mma.  That's a blood choke that cuts off the oxygen.  What the police are doing is choking people by their windpipe.  That is an air choke.  That kills you.  Two different things.  Even though this is called a choke, the blood choke, it cuts off your blood supply to the brain.  You fall out.  You're fine.  There's no death behind that.  Yeah.  The air choke kills you.  Yeah.  And when somebody doesn't know what they're doing, that's the thing that we're talking about.  Some even cops think, because they see UFC, you know, you choke somebody and they just go out.  Yeah.  Two different things.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you, if somebody's in a choke position like that, by anybody, how would they, even if they can't get out, how do they at least loosen up the chokehold?  It's hard to explain.  I don't have to show you.  I ain't about to let you throw mine.  Let's throw a motherfucker.  But sometimes when you think too much technique, it's going to mess with you.  If you can grab somebody's fingers, I don't care how strong they are.  Yeah.  If I grab your finger and break it and bend that thing where it's supposed to go.  Yeah.  You're going to let go.  So just grab a finger and make it your own finger.  It's your finger from that corner.  And that kind of pain goes deep.  That goes into the nerves and everything else, and people let go.  I heard if you're being choked and you can't really move your hands, is there a way to hold your head down or something that will help?  Not if it's already under your throat.  Okay.  Okay, you know, you got to fight the actual choke.  Okay.  There is a way.  I think we demonstrated on the... That's Miss Gillian.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, but there's a way... Oh, y'all did?  Yeah, so there's a way you do it because the power's coming in this way.  You got to turn the arm this way.  Turn it up?  Use your body to turn it this way.  Okay.  Because I'm strong this way, I ain't going to be strong that way.  Right?  So there's actually a very, very, I mean, I've challenged people to put me in a choke hold and try to keep me there.  Yeah.  And when I do that, it's almost hard.  I mean, it's very hard to, you know, resist that.  It's not that hard to get out of it if you know what to do.  Yeah.  It's very difficult if somebody's choking you and they wrap their legs around you.  But that's usually somebody who's, you know, really a jiu-jitsu, like high-ranking jiu-jitsu person.  Somebody said they like Gil's arms.  Her arms are gold.  Look at Gil's arms.  Look at them arms.  Is there a way, I heard, if somebody has their arm, if they're choking you from the back, one way is to put your foot behind their body.  Is that effective?  Something like that.  If they're in front of you, it's hard to get your foot behind your body.  Because a lot of times, when people see these demonstrations, they're seeing people not really resistant.  But it's got to work if you're off balance.  Because when people choke you, they don't understand they're nicely behind you.  They're moving.  And so you've got to be like this.  So what I'm talking about is this.  I don't care if you're moving me around.  I can turn your arm.  I can turn your arm.  I can grab your finger.  I can rip your finger off.  No matter if you're running around with me.  Okay.  This arm is connected to your hand, and your hand is connected to your fingers.  And I will rip that joke off.  You can't do that in UFC.  Okay.  That's not allowed.  Yeah, yeah.  In the street, you can't.  Yeah.  I will turn your finger and put your finger on your elbow.  We were talking about that UFC fighter who was talking about.  they can hook Mike's ass.  What was the guy's name?  Man, I don't want to make that dude more famous than he is.  You're giving that guy way too much attention.  I know.  Way too much attention.  Right, right, right.  You know, I mean, my assistant on the YouTube channel beat his ass in the UFC.  Oh, shit.  My assistant.  Right?  You can pull that up.  Look at... You know, Alan Joban and who he beat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  So it's... But see, that whole calling people out their names thing... I'm sorry.  If he lived in  L.A.,  it would... I would have definitely spoke to him already.  You know what I mean?  You know, and it's just some of the things, it's just like, I don't disrespect nobody.  Right, right.  I don't accept disrespect from somebody like that, especially if you're supposed to be a fighter.  We're supposed to be in the same fraternity.  Yeah.  There's a gentleman's agreement there.  Now, it's like, yeah, I see you.  It's going to be interesting.  Because that's just what it is.  You don't do that.  You don't do that.  I'll see my man one day.  If I lived in Florida, I would have damn sure rolled up on him already.  Seriously, man.  I got people who seriously want to hurt that dude.  Just because, you know, I respect him and everything else.  But UFC fighters, Tyron Woodley, you know, a lot of people, they appreciate that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I know folks that will hurt him more behind what he said.  You know, everybody got their minions and their soldiers.  Now what was your relationship with Kimbo Slice?  Kimbo was a friend.  Kimbo was a friend.  We trained together.  I went to help him.  Me and Imani Lee.  And the truth of the matter is, if I told you what Kimbo did say, about training with me or whatever, I would sound arrogant.  Right.  I would never even say that.  You know, I was trying to encourage Kimbo.  Myself, Ross Rudin, there's people who was down for him because he was a real good person.  And so my thing was I'm going to spend time.  I ain't going to try to dime.  I'm going to spend time.  If I got some technique that can help you.  Yeah.  And you came up, you know, on your own from the streets and everything else.  He didn't get a chance to learn proper technique and everything, right?  He had all this heart.  And yet, you know, he was a beautiful person, nice person.  So I was going to do whatever I could to help him.  Right, right.  And that's what it was about because I have a friendship.  Right.  And so that's why this whole thing, you know, This I don't.  I don't accept this from that person.  Yeah, talking crap like like he's a better friend.  Yeah, like he had something Right myself on the line for this brother and We trained together.  we we spilled blood we trained together.  Yeah, and so I was trying to help him.  I Who do you think is the best UFC fighter, in your opinion?  Ever?  Right now.  Not ever, just right now.  Oh, right now, Jon Jones.  Jon Jones, okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right now, Jon Jones, man.  I've been trying to get with him for a long time.  Man, I would love to spar with that guy.  I would like to, you know, trade, you know, knowledge.  I just think we have fun.  Yeah.  George St.  Pierre is probably, you know, go down in history as one of the most complete UFC fighters ever.  Best fighter, I think, pound for pound, who I've known of, would be Hicks and Gracie.  Okay.  Yeah, Hicks and Gracie.  That dude fought out of his weight class, and he's the epitome of fighter mentality.  Focus, technique, everything.  That guy had everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, John Jones is the beast.  John Jones, he's the truth.  Yeah, I mean, John Jones is a physical phenom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he can use some of the other stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, the last, the Deontay Wilder fight, what do you think Deontay did wrong in that thing?  Sometimes, man, I think you got to watch out for these people that are surrounding you, man.  It makes you feel like... I mean, he was saying that he was one of the best fighters out there.  There's a lot Brother Deontay needs to learn and train on.  You can't just go by two punches.  It's power.  You know, start working the technique, footwork, all that other stuff.  That's... You know, I mean... Marcus, you know, his trainer, like, knows better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm like.  What did you not teach the student?  Everybody knows you when you got power.  Yeah.  That's right.  Now you gotta work on them.  other tools.  Yeah.  So people forget about the power because now your footwork is so damn good.  That jab is so damn good.  Yeah.  Your movement is so good.  Mm-hmm.  Now they don't know what you about to do.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  You need to work on all of that, man.  Mm-hmm.  You need to learn and the whole... You know, he seems like a great guy.  He's got discipline himself.  He's got discipline.  He's got to work the footwork.  He's got to fight like a little guy.  Yeah, yeah.  If he fights like a little guy, nobody will stop him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You talk about that privately.  We don't talk about that.  We just talk about that privately.  We got these two goddamn dogs trying to fight.  Lord, Lulu trying to fight somebody.  And I asked you, we were talking privately about the potential Mike Tyson, Holyfield thing.  Do you think?  Yeah, I think they're trying to get Mike Tyson in Holyfield.  I think, right?  I think.  I mean, it's off.  It's off.  I think people will watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  History behind that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, indeed.  Yes, indeed.  I know I'll watch.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We're chilling here.  It's Father's Day weekend, guys.  Hope y'all chilling with your parents out there.  We're going to go live a little bit later.  We'll chop it up.  Peace. ",
