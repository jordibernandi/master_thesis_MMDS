            "text": "The thing that I have been mentioning for so long, especially in the series of 22 Future Events of Revelation, the thing that I said for years, you can go back and see, 2014, 2015, I said it.  This thing is coming, and now the latest Hollywood blockbuster has made a movie whose plot is basically my sermon.  I'm really astounded, like, should they be paying me or not?  Because it's exactly my sermon.  First of all, I said, when asteroids come, or meteorites impact, whichever name you want to call it, when big rocks fall out of the sky, which Revelation chapter 8 predicted, they're going to lie to us if we're here.  They're going to lie to you if you're listening.  They're going to lie, and they're going to say it's going to hit on this side of the earth.  And so what will happen is all the people will flee, even take planes and boats and whatever, and go to the other side, and that's where it will impact.  And then the rich and the elite and the military will go to the other side.  It will be like that.  Whether they do it knowingly or whether they just make a colossal mistake, that's how it's going to happen.  I believe that.  And now there's a movie whose plot says that exactly.  So I want to show you a clip of that.  Whoa.  Where are they going?  I don't know.  One of the first chunks is about to hit.  Hit?  Only part of it.  It's going in the ocean.  But you look at that.  Hey, where's the explosion?  Let's go.  But the sky's on fire.  Not only do they take my sermon as a plot, they even take the location.  If you watch my sermon in the 22 future events of Revelation, I say specifically that there is one place on earth that shows the world that the topography has been carved out by an asteroid impact, and it's the Gulf of Mexico.  And this movie shows the first impact happens in Florida.  It's called the panhandle.  That's exactly where the curve, part of the curve is that was carved out by an asteroid impact.  And we believe that happened during the time of Noah's flood, which is why a lot of organic material was buried suddenly, and that's how you get petroleum and gas.  That's why you see in Texas, there's a lot of petrol there.  America has become energy efficient because millions of organic things died and were buried suddenly.  And under that pressure, it becomes gas and petroleum.  So they took the plot that you're going to be lied to, it's going to go the wrong place, the elites are going to save themselves.  You know what?  You're going to be left alone.  And you can see this with the riots in Minneapolis, Seattle.  People were left alone.  People called 911.  They said, we can't help you.  They said, please file a complaint with your city council.  That was literally the message in one of the news reports.  You could see.  The call was... aired and they said, we cannot do anything.  Please file a report, a complaint with your city council.  Have you ever filed a complaint with your city council?  Does that go very far?  Another video recently, they're having riots in New York, you know, in the suburbs.  People's houses are broken into.  There's chaos and there's a police car coming and the guy's like, yay, the police are here.  And the police just kept driving away.  Didn't want to mess with the rioters.  When asteroids come, when meteorites impact, when these things of tribulation begin to come, like in Revelation, it has been predicted, it's going to come to pass.  There's no way out of it.  You're going to be left on your own.  If you don't have God, you need God.  These movies are like, it's almost like the left, you know, Hollywood is dominated by the left.  It's almost like they have seen something in the future.  It's like they've gotten their foretaste of something, but they don't know it's in the Bible and they don't know what the response is.  The response is, I believe God and I need to repent of my sins because these things are judgments and curses coming upon a fallen sinful world.  But they just see it and they see it even better than a lot of Christian preachers.  Till today, these things written in Revelation are considered controversial for pastors to preach.  Why?  We're living at the edge of it.  I mean, if Hollywood is leading the way of the plot of the Bible, the shame's on us.  Because the Bible is written that we, the preachers, would bring the message to the world.  And instead, Hollywood is ahead, but not ahead of me.  I preached it before you.  You're going to make millions of dollars.  It was my plot.  Because I spelled it out back in 2014, 2015.  I dare you to prove me wrong.  Go and watch 22 Future Events of Revelation.  It's all there.  So, really amazing the times we're living in.  They know it's coming, whether they know scientifically that something's out there or whether they just know in their spirits that something is going on, times have changed, and we're expecting a colossal disaster.  And something happens to America.  Because America is not there to defend Israel in the last days.  So this is the real issue to us.  Why isn't America there defending?  Or are they just unspoken?  I still believe America's best days are ahead if you don't vote the wrong way on November 3rd.  You still have the power in your hand to stop the colossal evil that's going on.  But we're not voters here.  It's up to the American voters.  It's up to the American voters.  We're a church.  We're not talking about how to vote.  We're saying you have a chance to roll back the evil and support pro-life, pro-baby, pro-gospel, pro-church, pro-Christian leaders.  That's what we need.  And any country that starts persecuting Christians, bombing churches, imprisoning pastors, beheading new converts to Christ, all these countries got plagues.  They'll have locusts, droughts, their economies will crash, all sorts of things will happen.  And God's holding even the worst back.  The worst will come for the unbelievers and the rejecters of God.  Rocks are going to fall down on your houses and cars and on your heads eventually.  If you are hearing this broadcast, seek shelter immediately.  What is it?  What's going on?  So I think this movie, it's called Greenland, is going to be a blockbuster.  It's very well done, and again, Hollywood... It shouldn't have been Hollywood.  It should have been the Christian church to do this.  But I don't know.  You know, Christians are doing pretty soft kind of social family light movies.  And they're nice.  They're nice.  I'm happy that they do it.  But these things that really are at the forefront of people's minds.  These things that are actually quite exciting things, the news ahead of time, were not really doing much.  Back in the day, Left Behind series, Kirk Cameron starred in a few Left Behind.  I thought they were okay.  But the computer graphics and the technology that's used by Hollywood is really quite amazing.  Read the Bible is what I'm saying.  I didn't say go watch a movie.  I say read the Bible, believe it, and give your life to Jesus before those things come.  Because when they come, you're going to be in a panic.  The world will be in a panic, and that's when people are willing to give up their freedoms.  And that's when suddenly an antichrist figure will appear, and he'll say, give up your rights and your freedom.  I'll take care of you.  Everything will be okay.  It's going to happen.  The Bible says it.  So guard yourself against that.  If you have never given your life to Jesus, you just say, Lord, I repent of my sins.  Jesus, thank you for dying on the cross for me.  Thank you for being raised from the dead.  Come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior.  That's it.  Like that, you say that, you cry out and believe on the name of Jesus, the only Savior, and you'll be saved. ",
