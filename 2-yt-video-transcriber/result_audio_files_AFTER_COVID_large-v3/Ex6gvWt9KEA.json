You look like J.J.  from Good Times.  Come on, boys.  Get some balls, baby.  I am the infantry.  I am my country's strength in war and eternity in peace.  I am the heart of the fight, wherever, whenever.  I carry America's faith and honor against our enemies.  I am the queen of battle.  I am what my country expects me to be.  The best trained soldier in the world.  In the race to victory, I am swift, determined, courageous.  Hard with a fierce will to win.  Never will I fail my country's trust.  Always I fight on, through the foe, to the agenda, and triumph over all.  If this is it, I fight to my death.  I must stop the scourge I have won.  I am a Jew in the years of freedom.  I do not do weep, and stutter to cowards, and fatigue to superiors.  For I am mentally dumb, mentally strong, and morally straight.  I have forsaken all my country, my beach, my comrades, my secret duty.  I am relentless.  I am the infantry.  Follow me!  Here we go.  We're going over.  Coming over.  I got a hamburger.

Keep low profile, you don't get a bullet in the head.  Put your BFA on your... Underneath with your free hand.  Let's go!  Right.  You know why your weapon's not shooting?  Why would it not be shooting, Private?  Maybe because you have run out of ammo.  Maybe because you have finished all the rounds inside your magazine.  How?  So now you can no longer shoot because you have no more ammo.  How did this happen, Your Honor?  You shot it all, Private.  Private, your weapon is clear at this time.  Step back to the rear.  It only works if a round is in the chamber.  Tell me where to throw my grenade, battle buddy.  Got you covered, battle buddy.  Back out!  What's in front of you?  Enemies, drill sergeant.  They're over there, right?  Yes, drill sergeant.  Where'd your grenade go?  Over to the left, drill sergeant.  Drill sergeant, I dropped my grenade somewhere over there.  That's twice.  See what I'm talking about?  Oh, my God. ",
