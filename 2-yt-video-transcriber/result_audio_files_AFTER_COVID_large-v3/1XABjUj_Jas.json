            "text": "so i decided to watch the warrior nun.  that was a big mistake.  i feel like warrior nun is like how to make the worst chosen one character 101. like it's a step-by-step playbook and you guys know i hate disliking female characters if i don't have to.  but i was just like so deeply frustrated by this show by ava by the mythology and just the way that a show that is only 10 episodes long can feel like a 26 episode cw season.  like What is The Warrior Nun?  The Warrior Nun is a 2020 adventure series on Netflix that is based on a comic book series of roughly the same name that has been adapted for screen by a man named Simon Barry.  It stars Alba Baptista as Ava, a quadriplegic woman who is brought back from the dead after the halo of an angel is put into her back.  and she is imbued with all of this divine power and becomes the warrior nun part of the secret society of the church of broads who kill demons.  and of course there's conspiracies because the former warrior nun died in very murky circumstances and her girlfriend is trying to figure out what happened and they all have to come together to save the church and the day.  You know what it is.  And I gotta say, it's a really good thing that I watched Cursed first, because if I had watched this and then watched Cursed, I might've been a Cursed stan.  I might've been like, Nimue, you never did anything wrong in your life, girl, because Nimue at least got some shit together.  But Ava?  Ava's family died in a car accident.  And so she's been in Spain in this Catholic run hospital for the majority of her life.  She's been bound to a bed.  She was a quadriplegic until she was magically fixed.  And that's already a problematic trope that is gross and not really handled in my opinion very well.  I will link down below to what writers with disabilities have said about the topic.  That reality is what guides a lot of Ava's decisions.  however it guides her to a point where it stops the plot from moving forward.  Ava is you know she gets these amazing powers and she's instantly you know walking around meeting cute boys you know doing good friends and that's all well and good.  Then when the nuns are like hey girl you got this super power you got this responsibility I do expect her to have a moment where she's like yo.  I just got these new powers back up off me.  I need to go have fun.  I need to go get some and you know do what I gots to do right.  Understand all of that.  However, that can only go on for so long, okay?  Kirstie Swanson, when she became the slayer in that 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie, she went from being a cheerleader to the slayer in 86 minutes.  Time is money.  Time is demon blood.  I need you to take your two episodes to life.  Got the power.  Ooh, difficult.  Mm, gotta struggle with this.  All right, but I gotta get into the game because we only have 10 episodes.  So you can't spend seven of them.  seven of them in denial about your destiny or in denial about where your powers come from.  like you were resurrected you have a circular disc in your back you can phase through walls you can heal you are super strong and you're like isn't?  science again could deal with this.  episode one.  episode two we still figuring out your little jealous figure.  episode three by the time that you read in this magic book telling you all about why the magic exists.  i need you to wrap it up because like episode again episode seven she's going to some scientist woman being like.  there must be a scientific reaction.  i'm just like yo.  is brian mcknight playing because we are right back at one.  I don't understand why we're having these conversations.  Girl, you see the organization of Secret Warrior Nuns.  You've seen the book.  You have the magic sword.  You have the powers.  Why are you asking this woman about science?  And I know that the creator Barry said that he felt like removing science from it would be disingenuous or whatever.  Link to the interview down below.  In my opinion, the science element is fine.  It's just that like the fact that Ava is in episode seven looking to science for a solution just feels like she's going backwards when she should be going forward.  And that's very aggravating as a viewer.  it's also very aggravating and i think there's a chosen one trope in general when she's the least competent person in the room and it's added on.  because here's the thing the cast of the show.  It's very diverse.  You have an Asian woman who's a lesbian, Sister Beatrice, the best character, shout out to her, she's great.  You have Lilith, who's played by a Colombian Spanish actress, half Colombian, half Spanish actress.  She's awesome, shout out to her.  You have Shotgun Mary, played by a Black woman with a, whoever was greasing her parts?  You were doing work, girl, because them shits looked shiny and well-maintained.  Curse could use some of that brilliant technique.  That's all I'm going to say.  Like, you have all of these, you know, the diverse cast of really interesting, mostly queer-coded women doing their thing, being quack, quack, warrior nun, right?  Then you have Ava.  who wants to do shit like hang out with her friends.  And I would, again, I would feel more for this if when we have her voiceovers, her voiceovers didn't make it seem like she's just making inane judgment calls.  Like she's like, I just want to kiss him.  He's so hot.  I'm like, is this Outlander?  I do not need all this commentary.  I get it.  If you looking at his arm muscle, his arm meat, you think he's sexy.  I don't need you to... to tell me that.  It just doesn't help that even though the actress who plays Ava is, I believe she's both Portuguese and Brazilian, so she's Latinx, even though she's Latina Latinx, She's white passing, very visibly so.  So you have this, in this main group, these three visibly non-white women all trying to circle and protect and get this visibly white woman to get her shit together.  And I'm like, This is what happens when you want to have like diversity everywhere, but don't want to make your lead visibly non-white.  It's like you end up playing yourself extra hard as you did in Cursed.  Where it's like, again, if you have Lilith, who is the most competent and she's salty because she don't got the halo and I'm watching her and I'm like, I understand why you're salty because Ava is not interesting.  And it doesn't help that the writing for Ava is just so Buffy-esque.  And I say this as someone who still enjoys Buffy despite denouncing Whedon and not liking Whedon anymore as a creator because of all of the sketchiness surrounding him.  Team Rey.  Not every... Actress can do quips, okay?  Sarah Michelle Gellar, when she said, well, you were mistaken, that shit was Emmy worthy.  That shit was art.  That shit was delivery, okay?  Not everybody can do that.  Comedy is hard.  And you just can't have her making all these jokes and making all these references that don't even sound natural coming out of her mouth.  It's okay for her to be a little bit more stoic.  I like the fact that she is not a, you know, team player.  I don't mind that she doesn't trust the church.  of course not.  that that's that's fine.  i get it girl me either.  i understand all of those things but let those rationalities play into her judgment.  she's not a child.  i think she's about 19 years old and even if you want to say she's a rest of development because she hasn't had time to really explore herself and grow.  okay i get it but Can't be seven episodes.  They spend like six episodes on this guy named JC and his crew and they never appear or get mentioned again after a certain point.  And I'm just like, so they were just in here straight up oxygen thieves and this is just how it's going to be, I guess.  It's just everything about.  it is just so repetitive and it makes it hard because the last three episodes is actually kind of... could eat.  and what's worse is that if you know anything about television genre um if you have even you know just an um an iota of common sense you already know what's gonna happen.  church corrupt nailed it.  angel might be not good person cool got it.  not so shocking.  the giles character not really a good guy oh a little bit spicy but again not a reach.  The evil priest that everyone thought was evil is the red herring.  Like it.  Shout out to Freddie from Pumpkin Scooby Doo.  Red herring.  Got it.  But none of this is like groundbreaking material to which I needed to wait eight episodes for us to get to it.  Like in the final episode, the final episode should have been the penultimate episode and everything should have been pushed back two more episodes.  It just was so poorly paced and put together and just tedious.  And I just, I remember just feeling like, why is everything taking so long to go to the most obvious conclusion?  It's the obvious conclusion, guys.  It's a chosen one narrative.  We know she's gonna join the church.  We know she's gonna end up bringing everything together.  We know the team gonna pew, pew, pew, pew all over the Vatican.  This can't do it.  This can't do it.  We don't got all day.  I know it's quarantine and we got endless time, but there's anime to watch.  I got Fire Force to catch up on.  I'm on season two right now.  I don't have time to wait.  Now, I know I just did the video about queer representation.  Go watch it.  It's very good, even though it's long.  very long but it's very good.  what is interesting is that barry was interviewed about the queerness of sister beatrice ava and a few other characters and his statement was um kind of bullshit.  let me let me just put it up for in regard to a queer character or whatever.  we don't want them to be defined by that.  we want them to be defined by who they are and let their sexuality and let their relationships and let their journeys be included in that.  We never tried to paint any character with just one defining characteristic.  By defining Ava and Beatrice too quickly or too irresponsibly, we could kill it and ruin it.  And I don't want to do either.  So for now, let's just say we're open and exploring, much like the characters are.  Okay, so Ava... She doesn't have any defined sexuality.  That's fine.  That's whatever.  Good for her.  Let her go off.  She hasn't had time to sample everything.  She can sample a little bit of this.  She can sample a little bit of that.  It's all up in the air.  But let's talk about Sister Beatrice.  Take a sip of my drink because my throat is parched next.  So Princess Beatrice, her main defining quality in the show is that she is like kind of stoic and a badass kick-ass fighter.  She can pew-pew-pew with everything, she the GOAT.  We love her, we stan, best character, shout out to her.  She became such a powerful warrior, is devoted to their church and all of these things because of her queerness, because she is gay.  She basically says that because she was gay, she got sent to the nunnery, which I don't understand why.  The nunnery is a hot den of lesbian action.  Read a French novel.  She became a powerful warrior to give herself value because she was being told that she had no value because of being gay.  So... You did already defied her entire character around the trauma of her being gay.  So... And like Ava for the first six episodes, her entire thing is about her relationship with this other group of people through her sexual and romantic desires towards this cis het boy.  And none of the characters are that well developed, to be quite frank.  I mean, there are, the only thing that I can say about the characters is that they're all very good at their job.  They all, you have Shotgun Mary, she's the loud one.  She's the loud one on the mission.  Sister Beatrice, she's the quiet one on the mission.  Lilith, she's the angry, quiet-ish one on the mission.  And then there's Sister Carmilla, she's the cute one on the mission.  They're not that well defined for you to be like, oh, if we establish anything concrete about their queerness, we couldn't like change it up later.  Also, sister bitches is a nun.  So who she fucking?  Like, she took our orders.  Is she going to renounce the church?  I would love that for her, but we don't know that yet.  You know what I mean?  And also like, not even fucking, like fucking has nothing to do with your sexuality.  Like, again, like you're saying all the things about how like, we're not defining it based on this, but you give her an entire backstory about her being a tragic lesbian.  Maybe it makes sense.  Also, I think it's really interesting because they basically have their angel character, the Aurelia.  Aurelia is a Spanish noble woman whose land was stolen by the Moors and takes up the.  you know she takes up the the cross for the church during that and they don't get into no details about it.  but you know me as a tutor slut i know about this time period called the Reconquista.  This is when problematic warrior queen Isabella Castile is on the scene because she's doing some disgusting shit.  The Reconquista was based, why am I saying it like this?  The Reconquista was essentially when Spanish forces pushed the Moors back out of Spain and unified Spain altogether.  But you know what they also did?  But you know what the Reconquista led to?  The Spanish Inquisition!  of the jews and a lot of persecution of non-law and non-christians.  so this in here like this is your queen this is your hero this is your angel god person.  Now in the original comic, because I did do my TV trope slurge, apparently she was like a Valkyrie who turned away from Odin and to Christ, which, you know, is a less problematic depiction.  But I guess they wanted to get that little, you know, realism.  Plus the show takes place in Spain.  So I guess they wanted to do that instead.  Anyway, Warrior Nun is a show.  It's been renewed for season two.  And I tell you what, if Curse doesn't get renewed for season two... but warrior nun did.  i'm gonna be mad even though i will admit warrior nun had better graphics than cursed.  so like just from hair alone warrior nun does win.  i ain't gonna lie that shit was better looking but i enjoyed cursed more.  so i hope that curse gets renewed as well because i would rather watch that than season two of the warrior nun.  i just felt like It reaches a, Warrior Dawn is a perfect example of what's wrong with taking the Buffy formula, but not knowing what made Buffy work.  Buffy is a campy show, but it had a really good sense of mythology, internal logic.  The acting was really solid for the most part.  Like Sarah Michelle Gellar was giving you life and not everyone can do that and i just feel like if you're gonna take the buffy formula you have to know what worked about buffy.  buffy was a well-written show.  it only has two terrible seasons.  this season is already bad and i just feel like i hope it does well because it has employed a lot of really good non-white women in the leads.  however i just feel like you know I wish that when people are casting these shows, they are thinking beyond just like, let me check the boxes.  They're actually giving thought to how these actions and these realities would impact people's lives.  They got that a little bit with Shotgun Mary, but I think it was just easier for them because they're like, well, she's black.  We'll give her black things to do.  And it's like, okay, but how about?  she has something to do that isn't about her either avenging a white woman or trying to help out another white woman.  if you like these videos and my content please like share subscribe all that stuff.  do you like my hair?  i feel weird about it.  it's like i. i i'm slowly like i have to wash my hair and i just decided to just like kind of like wet it slightly and it just came like this and i was like i look really cute.  so i decided to make two videos today.  um i'll say the the saddest thing that happened to me in quarantine was realizing i was a 4c.  Colonizers got me again. ",
