            "text": "The audience is important to any celebrity's rise and function.  Without an enraptured and supportive audience, celebrities would be just like the rest of us.  Writer P. David Marshall argued that, quote, celebrity is an acknowledgement of the public's power.  Take internet meme star and rapper Danielle Bregoli, also known as Bad Baby, a.k.a.  Cash Me Outside.  There are thousands of ill-tempered and culturally appropriating white teenagers online, but Danielle's stardom was secured by the public via social media, who shared her infamous appearance on Dr.  Phil millions of times and engaged in the antics that followed.  Somewhere, a girl exactly like Danielle Bregoli sits non-famous and without lucrative endorsement deals because she never was seen by the right audience.  But hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself.  If you have one, do me a favor and think about your favorite celebrity, whether they're an actress, singer, YouTuber, model, designer, or author.  How much do you love them?  Does the extent of your love cover lustful fantasies, merchandise purchases, and social media interactions?  Or does it mean defending them against endless criticism, adopting their style, or even ignoring their worst behavior?  Would you cheat on your current partner with your celebrity crush even if you knew your partner wouldn't be okay with it?  Would you commit a violent crime for your fave?  Would you help your favorite cover up a violent crime?  When does celebrity adoration cross over into what has come to be known as celebrity worship syndrome?  If you're one of those people who doesn't have a celebrity fave and you pride yourself on not engaging in gossip, before you congratulate yourself for being so evolved, first, you should understand that the reasons most of society engages in celebrity worship and gossip are layered and varied.
