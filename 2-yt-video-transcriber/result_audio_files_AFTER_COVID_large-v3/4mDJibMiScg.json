            "text": "No, he's saying our venture is a commercial.  We're not making money.  They're independent.  Am I wrong?  Is this really private boardwalk?  Point Pleasant doesn't pay?  No, the people paid for these boards.  This is a public boardwalk.  Right, so we were just walking along.  We saw these guys right here harassing these two.  How did you guys know to even take your stuff out?  We do this all the time.  This man's giving you a hard time for filming in public?  They're all taking pictures of me right now.  Jersey Watcher YouTube channel, subscribe.  I'm also commercial and I refuse.  Jersey Watcher YouTube channel, I'm commercial, I refuse to shut down my camera.  I'm refusing to shut it down.  America Constitution, baby.  Yeah, we will challenge that.  I saw American Patriot trying to run you over and I had to step in right now.  So where do I have to go then?  On the other side of the building right down here.  So right here?  No.  The building's right here or beyond there?  Now the lieutenant at the Pledge Mill Police Station said that you absolutely can film in the public.  These two are trying to get an interview.  No, it's not commercial.  It's just a commercial.  It's a commercial area right here.  No, he's saying our venture is a commercial.  Correct.  We're not making money doing it.  They're independent.  No.  right here look doesn't this make me commercial?  thank you doesn't this make me commercial?  i'm commercial all right all right we all have the freedom of press in america anywhere in public.  i'm sorry to get involved but i saw you being harassed.  this isn't commercial am i wrong?  is this really private boardwalk point?  pleasant The people paid for these boards.  This is a public boardwalk.  Right.  That building is private, right?  No, it's also on the boardwalk.  It's a private business, I guess, considered.  The whole property is owned by the city.  But this, this is like a sidewalk.  So we were just walking along.  We saw these guys right here harassing these two.  The taxpayers pay for it, so it's public property 100%.  The taxpayers pay down there.  No, they don't pay down there.  And who's this guy making us laugh?  The taxpayers pay down here, but they don't pay down here.  And we're not talking to anyone involuntarily.  Everyone we go up to, we say, would you like to talk to us?  They say no, I'd like to talk to you.  I have a lot to say.  I'm not forcing anyone to interact with me.  Everyone's taking pictures with their family.  It's no different.  If you go around kicking everyone out the city, that's the cops.  They don't know this.  Even Disney World doesn't kick anybody out for recording.  You don't need to know my name.  Disney, you got a lighter?  No problem.  Yeah, all right.  No problem.  You said there's no problem.  No problem.  If I, here's the thing.  If I, I respect, if I truly, I don't think that's correct.  If I truly believe there was private property, I respect private property.  But this is a public boardwalk.  It's definitely paid by taxpayer money.  That's a private building.  That's a private building.  It's all paid by taxpayer money.  So it's a boardwalk that's a different color.  All the way down.  That beach is public.  Where does it become public?  This boardwalk must be public.  Those in your home are at private property.  That's all private beach?  He says that's a private beach.  Wow.  It's a shame how America's been so dumbed down.  Let's ask a police officer.  America's been dumbed down so much.  Look, I'm a firm supporter of private property.  I would never disrespect private property.  Private property is a backup and put it out to the public property.  Absolutely, but I don't think it is.  It's not private.  Everybody's on private property.  That guy has his phone out.  Let's get rid of him.  He's taking pictures of somebody.  You're worried about two people trying to interview people on our boardwalk.  Educate yourself and go ask the police who owns the beach.  The beach is owned by the city and the city pays the tax dollars.  Another YouTube star.  You gotta love it.  Bye, YouTube star.  Who owns the beach?  Disney World?  I was walking by, they were telling this gentleman he can't record, so I started my live stream up.  Thank you guys for practicing your First Amendment rights out here.  I want to talk to you guys.  Sure.  How did you guys know to even take your stuff out?  We do this all the time.  You say something about your recording, and it's not illegal.  He lied to you, he tried to intimidate you.  I do this every weekend for the last six weeks, and no one's ever said anything.  I walk by and I'm like, Yeah, First Amendment audit.  You'll learn more about what your freedoms are out here in the public.  You know, some people don't know all that.  I totally know what you do.  Dude, I'm in public office myself, so I know what you're talking about.  Right.  I've done this for six weeks, and no one said a word to me.  You're in public office?  It's just these guys had nothing better to do than to come and mess with you guys.  And the police.  don't talk to us.  They're all nice.  There's two cops over there.  They just washed it in.  I would never do this in a restaurant.  You're right.  I respect that.  There's no way the taxpayers didn't fund this.  It's free press.  It's right over by the police station.  They saw us on YouTube.  Yeah, they walked over us.  They said, excuse me, and walked over us.  I wish I were a reporter.  You said you're a public official?  yeah i have a whole public office in england.  i'm on the borough council there.  um would you like to subscribe?  jersey?  watch your youtube channel.  would you like to endorse me for edison board of education?  wait a minute.  i know you guys.  no i can't.  i can't endorse anyone because i'm here on behalf of the 501c3.  good to meet you man but i'll be happy to talk to you guys about.  you're in edison.  yes sir are you guys all from edison south jersey?  my wife got pulled over that.  No turn on red until 7 o'clock.  Two minutes to 7, the guy pulled me off.  I live right around the corner.  It'd be absolutely ridiculous.  Yeah, I'll be happy to chat with you about that later.  So here we are with the borough councilman.  They tried to stop him, but he couldn't.  The people had to put a stop to that and defended our public officials' rights and movement.  I didn't know you were getting a ticket.  I'm sorry.  What are they getting a ticket for?  1378.  Who owns the beach, do you know?  Who owns the beach?  Yeah, we got one before.  How much money do you guys make a day doing that?  It's going around trying to find as many people I don't know that they can't serve on the boardwalk.  Look at this grace And he's writing a ticket I guess right?  So they're going out hunting.  This is what they do.  They go out and they look around everywhere and try to find people from out of town that don't know that they can't smoke on the boardwalk.  And then they give them citations.  They probably give out like 800 of these things a day.  Let me give you a card, man.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  So they're doing this to everybody out here.  Neither.  I'm a registered Republican, but I am a registered Republican.  so far as that's what I needed to do to get into the position I am in.  If that makes sense.  I was a libertarian before and that didn't get me very far.  You guys gonna subscribe?  You guys gonna watch our YouTube channel?  Do you guys know that guy... Yes, yes, you guys know him.  Yeah, I've seen his videos a bunch of times.  Well, he's uh, he's uh, he's uh, he's uh, he's uh, he's uh, he's uh, So this is the extortion racket that they run out here everybody.  I'm gonna cut this off.  Are you sure you don't have drugs in your pocket right there?  Sit the description of somebody that We gotta be Lakers Probably getting shit because of that, you know what I mean?  Probably.  Who can do more push-ups?  Which one of you can do more push-ups?  I can.  You can?  You sure about that?  He says he can do more push-ups than you.  I think you guys should have a competition right now.  Maybe later.  Aw, man.  We would like to see it.  The real question is, which one can recite their oath of office?  Yeah.  It's funny how they never remember that.  It wasn't his to begin with.  Words and nonsense.  How many cigarette tickets do you guys do a day here?  I can't disclose that.  You can't disclose.  It's public information.  You got a lighter so I can light my cigarette?  But I'm not a public information officer.  If you'd like to know that, you can head on down to the 416.  So is this still the boardwalk right there?  Can you give me a roundabout figure?  What do you think?  Guestimate it.  I don't know.  He doesn't know.  I don't want to lie to you.  He doesn't know.  How many do you give out, you think, about a day?  I don't know.  He doesn't know.  All right, well, don't extort too much today. ",
