So the Thug Life stuff was one of the early sort of internet iterations of Ben Shapiro meme culture.  I'm forever grateful to whoever is the person who did this.  It's really, really funny because, of course, I'm a nerd.  And so juxtaposing me to the sort of Thug... I mean, I'm like wearing a tie there, right?  And then the thug life culture.  It's pretty great.  I mean, this did become a Halloween costume for me.  I believe year one of the Ben Shapiro show.  You can go back.  You can find the episode where I actually wore the memes, the gift sunglasses.  And I wore like a thug life hat and all the rest of it.  But it's a source of endless amusement even today to watch those kind of things to the blunt come in from the side.  So I enjoy that stuff.  Al Sharpton, say hello to Ben Shapiro. ",

I used to be on his show weekly, and we would just kind of hash out the news for 15 or 20 minutes.  This particular time, I was scheduled to call in, and just at the time I was supposed to call in, then Al Sharpton, who was then running for president, called in himself to be on Keith Larson's.  This is in North Carolina.  And Keith says to me off the air, you know, Al Sharpton just called in.  Would you like to be on the air with Al Sharpton?  And I was like, okay, there's at least a half a shot that this is actually just a prank and this isn't actually Al Sharpton.  And then you can hear the interview.  He starts talking to me.  I'm like, oh, actually it is Al Sharpton.  I'm never going to get on the air with Al Sharpton again, right?  There's never going to be an opportunity to be on the air with Al Sharpton.  Again, I was 19 at the time, I think 19 or 20 years old.  And and so I said, OK, well, now that I've got to ask him a question, I'm going to ask the only question that really matters about Al Sharpton, which is why is he a terrible person?  And Al Sharpton did not actually have an answer to this.  If you actually listen to the rest of this particular interview, it's really funny because Al Sharpton threatens me with a lawsuit.  I say this and he says, yes, questions like that and you could get sued.  And then he and Larson have this broader discussion, and Larson comes back to me and says, do you have anything else to say to Reverend Sharpton?  And I said, not really.  I just want to say to him that if he feels like suing me for my $5,000 in bar mitzvah money, he can come right after me anytime, Mr.  Sharpton.  And that was sort of the end of the conversation.  So the thug life began early, is I think all you can say about this. ",

Don't you feel like when you come on a leftist network and you're being attacked that maybe it's because you're just a little bit intolerant?  These are usually the way these conversations go.  So, you know, I'm glad, Brian, that you haven't done all of those things.  You've done some of them.  I'd forgotten about that one.  That's a good one.  That's some solid stuff there from Shapiro Thug Life.  Sometimes you forget the good things that you've done, the good things that you've said.

Here's what a single-payer healthcare system would actually do.  Okay, folks?  It would actually make doctors literal slaves who would have to live in cabins on a plantation somewhere.  Alright, folks?  And the idea... And the idea that doctors are just your slaves who you can, you know, marry without their consent and then make half-doctor, half-regular people babies with.

Because that parody doesn't even make sense.  This one is obviously taking my perspective on healthcare and then taking it way the hell out there, but it's funny.  I mean, the impression is funny, and it's obviously mocking my sort of trains of logic and how I speak and the way that I break up my sentences and all of that.  And so that stuff I find really, really funny because, again, it is a takeoff on my general perspective.  The Freedom Tunes guys are really hilarious.  The best one of the Freedom Tunes, by the way, is the Thanksgiving dinner where it's all versions of me, sort of like Back to the Future 2 where every character is Michael J. Fox.

And I think that that's not only a problem.  I think that that takes the heart out of society.  There are legitimately millions of people in this country who believe that I will go to hell because I don't believe in Chinese Jesus.  And you know what I think about that?

Take my arm and put a knife in it and stab you.  Well, maybe we should like think about what the actual possible downsides here are because virtually every action that we take has some unintended consequences.  I have a duty to kill you.  Wait, hold on a second.  You have no evidence whatsoever that that is the case.  I'm here to kill you.  What do you even care?  Why can't you leave me the hell alone?  I'm going to say what I think is true here, and we're done.  I love Dave Rubin now.  You know what I think about that?  I don't care.  That's fine with me.  I don't care.  I think it's good.

Actually, I'll admit, the better version of this is Jordan Peterson debating Jordan Peterson from Dave's show.  That one is definitely the better version of this.  Although, it's enjoyable, and I have seen the Ben Shapiro versus Shen Babiro kind of stuff before.  The fact that I'm a meme is of utter amusement to me, because again, I am probably the squarest person on planet Earth, so the fact that I've become part of this sort of meme culture is endlessly hilarious.
