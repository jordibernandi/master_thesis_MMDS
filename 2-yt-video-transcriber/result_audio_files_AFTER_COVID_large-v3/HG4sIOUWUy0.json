            "text": "Hello.  It's April 1.  This is not an April Fool's joke.  I've been working out on the tractor.  Okay, so this is going to be as short as I can possibly make it.  It's late in the day here.  I've been blocked from getting back on Twitter, so I won't be able to be doing any posting there.  It was a tricky way to do it.  And I can't reach out to Twitter to get them to undo the problem on my account.  So probably gone from Twitter by deliberate act or, you know, happenstance of software.  Who knows?  Anyway, this is going to be a short video about horseshoe bats.  Horseshoe bats were the bats that were being studied at both of the bio labs in Wuhan.  The reason that they were being studied there is because the Chinese wanted to answer a question.  The biolab workers wanted to answer a question.  These bats that they were studying, these horseshoe bats, which have six subspecies, so it's quite diverse and there's one extinct branch.  These horseshoe bats are very interesting because like humans, it was thought they were like humans and that they did not make vitamin C. And thus the question, how could they possibly exist with the huge amount of virus that they carry in them continuously if they didn't have any natural immunity against the viri that were infecting them?  And so this has been something that has puzzled the Chinese for a long time.  And I have included a link down below to an article from 2011, a published paper that describes an interesting understanding that arose from the Chinese research into horseshoe bats.  And the understanding is that it is not true that horseshoe bats don't make vitamin C. There are bats that do make vitamin C, but they don't do it as we recognize.  that's why vitamin c is so critical to this current violence all right to the current situation in crises and why it is the key to where we need to go and what we need to understand.  so here's the.  here's the.  it's in the article.  you can go read it.  it doesn't take very long to get down into just past the um the abstract and get into the guts of it.  you'll see them make a very bold uh statement.  These are Chinese scientists paid by the Chinese government within the structure that was the housing organizational structure for the CDC of China Biolab No.  4, which was in Wuhan.  which was studying horseshoe bats.  The other bio lab was studying horseshoe bats.  Okay, so the conclusion is, in 2011, that horseshoe bats do make vitamin C, but that we basically don't recognize it as such.  That whereas dogs and cats and other animals on this planet make vitamin C and have it measurable within their system, as a function of how healthy they are, bats do not.  This makes sense because bats live in an environment that's mostly deprived of light.  And so light to them is very precious.  So we could ask evolutionists if indeed this might be the case that evolutionary biologists, right, like one of the Weinstein brothers, Eric Weinstein, or Weinstein, anyway, one of the guns there is evolutionary biologists.  And I think that evolutionary biologists can support the conclusion that light is a precious resource to a bat.  And so unlike a dog who can get ill or get a virus attacking him, and go lie in the sun in order to generate more vitamin c at the base of the follicular mass of the hairs which is where they make their vitamin c dogs and cats bats are not able to do this.  light is a very precious resource.  so bats do not make vitamin c as we understand it.  they don't have the vitamin c floating protein within their body in an extractable measurable form.  What they have is paraimmunity on demand.  If you'll read this article that's linked below, you'll see that these Chinese scientists came to the conclusion that the horseshoe bats had a pseudogenetic structure, okay, pseudogenes that produced a pseudo... G-U-L-O, which is their way of saying the protein structure that catalyzes or creates the vitamin C molecule.  So these bats make vitamin C, but they make it on demand.  And this is what was the amazing discovery out of the bio lab in Wuhan and why they were able to create such a fierce virus.  Okay, because bats don't store vitamin C. They don't make it via light.  They make it through this de novo process, this final creation act, this chemical catalyst process that creates it on demand from a signaling molecule that is not discussed in the article and is deliberately not discussed, deliberately avoided, but its absence is glaring.  It is hugely pointed to by the fact that they don't discuss the signaling molecules that result in the pseudogenome being triggered.  to cause these proteins to create vitamin C on demand, on is to survive with a certain viral load.  And beyond that, where that viral load would threaten the bat itself, at that point, there is a signaling molecule within the bat that the Chinese know about that we do not.  that causes vitamin C to be created in its point of need and its point of use.  And so this article and a number of others that were studies of these horseshoe beds are still available online.  I put the link in this description, and you can go and download it.  This is why vitamin C works, but it's also why vitamin C is necessary to be at a certain level and continuously maintained.  because we now have to adopt a supplement strategy that is similar to what the horseshoe bat does with its creation of paraimmunity on demand when the viral load starts to threaten to get out of hand.  As long as you have that vitamin C at a containment level, you're using the bat's strategy against the virus that they extracted from that bat and that they are attacking you with.  Okay, so you can kill the the virus load because unlike the bats we can take more vitamins to maintain and contain.  we can take enough vitamin c to slam the viral load out of us and that was the strategy that the chinese communist party started using or or adopted from.  let me phrase that they adopted from.  uh chinese doctors on the scene in wuhan and guangzhou.  okay the chinese communist party adopted a high vitamin c regimen.  They were already allocating L-ascorbate, not ascorbic acid, but L-ascorbate to military units only out of three L-ascorbate factories.  This evidence has disappeared off the internet.  It existed primarily on the deep web that I was aware of, and it was removed.  Our connection was removed as of March 1 at 11 a.m.  Pacific Coast time.  So, I don't have access to it and other people don't have it.  However, the article below is one of a number of articles that are obtainable in world repositories about Chinese work with the horseshoe bats specifically focusing on vitamin C. So, basically, this is a... a slap in the face, a bitch slap to anybody that thinks I'm merely a crazy fucker.  Okay, I am indeed a crazy fucker, but that does not make me wrong.  I am quite correct about this.  And unless people understand that it is a bioweapon and vitamin C is the primary key for this at a specific level, people will die unnecessarily.  Okay, why does chaga work?  as an augmenting agent for vitamin C, like Chuchuasi from South America, which is also a tree bark extracted from a tree that has many properties that are similar to birch trees.  All right, so Dr.  Paul Cottrell, in the early days here, worked with people and presented a white paper in which they identified via computer study specific molecules that were likely to be effective against COVID-19, coronavirus, whatever the fuck they're calling it now.  So this CCP virus had identified 30 compounds, or at least 22 that I'm aware of.  The 22 were located in plants.  There was one for birch trees.  Chaga mushrooms extract this stuff from birch trees in a fashion and a method and a concentration that is more amenable, more harmonious with the human body, in my opinion, than the birch extract itself, especially over a long term, and that's what we need to understand.  In order to survive this bioweapon attack, even the mainstream media is now starting to get online with this.  In order to survive this bioweapon attack, We need to adopt this strategy long-term until we can get rid of the bioweapon from our environment, which will not be done, in my opinion, by regular disinfectant except in small areas.  This was why I wanted a boat like the USS Roosevelt, to undertake a specific protocol that involved hardening up the sailors with a specific regimen of vitamins and chaga, or chuchuasi, for those who can't take the chaga, because there are some people who the mushroom is just not going to be compatible with, because it makes their medicines work harder,  etc.,  etc.  So that's why I wanted a boat, because it was a contained... area in which we could harden the people involved as an experiment with safe vitamin C levels, safe chaga, etc.  And we could also apply specific kinds of decontamination that I think I understand as to why other kinds of decontamination are not working with this.  And that's a subject for another short video.  So my thing here at the moment, the reason for creating this video, is that I would like people that see this to download it Reupload it to your own channel.  Share it any place you can.  Put it on Twitter if you can.  I'm effectively banned there.  Put it out to all the social media because our military needs to understand what is in this article below, which will have the academic backing to make it sound like it's not coming from some strange internet nutjob.  Whether or not he's crazy is immaterial if he's right, and I believe I am correct.  So shut up now.  The article link is in the description.  Please pass this around.  Get somebody's attention.  It's very difficult because, like everybody else, they don't trust media, and they sure as fuck don't trust internet nutjobs.  But we can get through this, okay?  Now that we know what the Chinese are hiding, why they're hiding it, there's only two elements that they're hiding that we don't know, which are the two different kinds of signaling molecules that turn this virus on and off.  uh but it does mean that the the chinese communist party the ccp uh so i shouldn't call it a chinese virus it's you know it's the ccp virus can be defeated and then we can reconcile globally with the ccp and decide what they owe to whom anyway.  so with respect guys.  uh i won't be on twitter.  My only social media contact will probably be through YouTube.  Don't waste my time, but if you've got something pertinent, you can send me an email.  It's easy to find that. ",
