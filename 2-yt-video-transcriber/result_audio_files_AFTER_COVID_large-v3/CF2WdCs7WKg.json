And I couldn't find out what city it was, what the cop's names were, but I just can't stand racism.  And I don't know if y'all seen this video.  I couldn't find it any place else.  And I do my best to get videos out to y'all guys that you haven't seen.  And hopefully y'all haven't seen this one, but I'm posting it anyway.  Because like I said, I can't stand this kind of stuff.  This guy's in his own front yard walking around.  But because he's black, and I do believe it's because he's black, That they stopped him.  You're suspicious and we want to know who you are.  We want to see ID.  I don't believe they would have stopped any white person in any one of those other yards.  I don't believe it.  And nobody's going to be able to convince me that they would have.  This is a racist thing and I think that's all there is to it.  You can't even go in your own front yard and walk around in this day and age without a couple of cops messing around with you.  All right, so we'll get on with the video and I'll let y'all decide for your own selves what y'all think. ",

Man, I wish I would have been his next door neighbor at this time and seen this going on.  I would not have been able to stop myself from coming out there and reading the riot act to these two cops.  You do not drive around the neighborhood and question people that are in their yards and get ID.  It's none of your effing business what they're doing in their yards.  Especially, it's not even nighttime.  Not even nighttime.  And he's going, it's suspicious that you were walking from the front yard to the backyard.  Absolutely effing ridiculous.  And I wish I had the name of the city and the name of the cops, but it's not there.  And I asked on the channel, I found it on and they didn't answer.  So I would love to give this town a ration of BS for this.  That looks like this thing turned out.  Okay.  Uh, some of the family walked out the front door and after that, I don't think there's anything they could say about it.  They couldn't keep saying what was suspicious.  But they ran the plates on the car anyway, even though it's none of their damn business.  And if a cop sees this, you tell me this is okay.  Come on, I dare you to come in and tell me this is okay, cop.  Because if you do, we know what kind of cop you are.  All right, this is PNP News.  I'm out of here. ",
