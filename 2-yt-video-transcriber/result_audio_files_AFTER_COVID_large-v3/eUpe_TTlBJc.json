            "text": "So Vash has quote-unquote called me out.  Well, please let me respond.  Yes, Vosh, everyone who disagrees with you is a Nazi, and this isn't getting tired in any way, shape, or form.  You notice that's something you have to do, continually call people Nazi rather than produce some kind of solid argument.  And you, again, resort to pettiness like nobody likes his theory.  Well, it's not even my theory, to be perfectly honest, because it came before me.  But, you know, you should probably ignore the people in the third world that support the yellow CEOs, third worldism, or maybe the people in the first world that actually support me.  But, you know, what would be the point of that?  The fact is... You really are a terrible excuse for a human being.  I'm not afraid to go on your show and call you what you are to your face.  By the way... right there in the description of this video is the link to you sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl, and yeah, that really does make you a complete greaseball for doing that.  As for having me debate you, debate what?  Debate like you debated Caleb Maupin, you had him come on your show and you just called him a Nazi the whole time, and then and claimed that everybody who fought and struggled against the Nazis were Nazis themselves.  I mean, we can kind of see the logic here.  The conservatives do that all the time.  You know who the real fascists are?  It's the anti-fascists.  You know who's really racist?  It's the anti-racists who are really racist.  So we're already well aware of this kind of mentality that you seem to share with conservatives.  But as for the liberalism thing... Well, yeah.  You keep doing liberalism.  You know that thing where you steer people away from revolution towards voting for Joe Biden?  That's liberalism.  That's pretty much the definition of it.  I'm pretty sure that would be the best modern anti-Marxist liberalism right there.  You know why?  Why?  because for you socialism is a secondary goal which comes from your utilitarianism.  you don't put socialism first.  you look at what you want and aim at that.  you don't do what scientific socialism would have you do critically analyze the system what makes it The way that it is, and learn from it, and from that you would extrapolate how to transform it.  What you do is look at it and say, I don't like, I like this. ",
