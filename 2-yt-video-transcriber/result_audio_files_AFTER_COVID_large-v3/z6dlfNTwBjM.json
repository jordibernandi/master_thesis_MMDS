            "text": "Hey, it's Jordan.  Delighted to be joined by Brianna Joy Gray.  You are the National Press Secretary for Bernie Sanders' campaign.  currently with Current Affairs, used to be with The Intercept, so you've been inside journalism and outside.  And I want to talk about a lot of things.  Obviously, I need to start with the most distasteful thing.  So Joe Biden makes those comments in an interview with Charlemagne Tha God.  I watched the whole thing, and as awful as the, you know, you ain't black comments were, I think a lot of other things he said are getting a little lost in the shuffle because there's a lot of other terrible things.  But let me first ask you, what were your thoughts?  Because you've been critical of Biden during the primary, maybe even more critical than Bernie was, frankly.  What were your thoughts on?  not just what he said, but it seemed like he started talking in black vernacular and changing his vocal tones.  What were your thoughts? ",

            "text": "Look, I think the most disappointing aspect of that exchange was that Solomon the God was making a good faith request for Joe Biden to be attendant to the needs of African-Americans and say what his agenda for black Americans is and how he is going to earn a vote that so often is taken for granted, so often characterized as.  a firewall, so often described with a sense of entitlement, because there is, I think, a recognition that the options are few for Black voters and that to the extent that all Democrats or many Democrats are feeling like they're between a rock and a hard place with Joe Biden and Donald Trump and dealing with the lesser of two evils, Black Americans have felt that tension, I think, acutely for a very long time with two parties that have For decades now, been rather inattentive to the pretty grievous needs of our community.  So, yeah, he basically said point blank to Charlemagne's face that I don't have to court your vote if you aren't already with me.  If you are confused about who you're going to choose in the fall, you ain't black.  And that is also another example of Democrats trading in this kind of racial essentialism that treats one's political views as part and parcel of their racial identity and erases the diversity within communities and blinds them to how they can specifically attend to those needs and attract voters with progressive policy.

But Biden is kind of a serial fabulist.  I mean, he lies a lot.  And I will get into the campaign in a bit.  But, you know, Bernie didn't call him out on these lies.  But just in that interview, he reinvented history.  He said he wasn't for mandatory minimums.  He wasn't for three strikes and you're out.  He said he was against incentivizing states during the crime bill with more money to build more prisons.  Quick Google search.  He was for all those things.  And you're starting to see, frankly, I'm criticized for even showing things that the Trump campaign is tweeting.  But you're starting to see the Trump campaign open up the floodgates, frankly, on what Bernie just chose not to do from.  They just put out an ad on Biden and the crime bill.  They've put out things on his trade policies.  What?  You know, you're a communications person now back in journalism.  What do you think about, I mean, he just kind of reinvents history and the media really never has challenged him on this. ",

            "text": "Yes.  Look, I echo the frustrations that many have articulated that Bernie could have done more to point out Biden's lies and a lot of the other contrasts between himself and other candidates.  But the reality is that in that last debate, Biden lied, I think, a grand total of nine times about nine discrete issues of substance and importance.  Bernie was doing his job of drawing those distinctions and what I think he understood might be the final opportunity to be on the stage with Biden and do so right as the pandemic was exploding in full force.  And he said, these are the facts, Joe Biden lied about them, and the post-debate coverage was, did Bernie do enough?  I don't think so.  Moving on, there's a pandemic, right?  So it really is incumbent on the media to hold Biden's feet to the fire.  And it's deeply frustrating to see the efforts that the campaign did make.  You know, I'm old enough to remember when Senator Nina Turner penned an op-ed in January, I believe, calling out Joe Biden for consistently basically selling Black voters And the media turned on her and said that she was being unfair and attacking, you know, Uncle Joe?  and how could she and the campaign distance itself from those critiques.  So it can't be both ways.  It can't be that the campaign is.  You know, people are frustrated that it didn't do more to draw those contrasts and at the same time isn't supported by the media and corroborating what the campaign is saying.  That, in fact, Joe Biden is being untruthful.  Joe Biden, as you put it so kindly, is a serial fabulous.  Joe Biden is hashtag Lion Biden.  And what we're going to do with that now that Donald Trump isn't showing any of the restraint that the Biden campaign did or doing any of the water carrying that the liberal media is doing, us not talking about it isn't going to make it not an issue in a general election context.  to the extent that Joe Biden is not yet the Democratic nominee, I think it's in fact our obligation as people who want the strongest candidate possible to beat Trump to both battle test Joe Biden at this time, and if he does not meet that test, if he is not able to survive and withstand and develop appropriate responses to these critiques, we should be thinking really seriously about whether or not we want him to be the nominee to champion progressive issues in the fall.

But based on being in the field and I've interviewed a lot of people in Flint and Detroit and South Carolina and other communities, there seems to be a real divide between, I'd say, the under 40 African-American crowd, just like the white generational gap.  where the African-American ages that are younger want to know, what are you going to do for me going forward?  It's not just that survival instinct, like we have to just vote blue because the Republicans will take our hard-fought achievements away, but what are you giving us?  Whereas older Democrats, older African-American Democrats, particularly in South Carolina and other places, kind of might close their eyes to certain things.  Did you see that as the press secretary for Bernie's campaign, that kind of divide between older black Democrats that, frankly, if a progressive is going to win nationally, they do need to make inroads with that older black generation?

            "text": "Yeah, I think that people who have, again, using this kind of essentialist framework and attributed the overwhelming black support for Joe Biden to what it means to be black, that everyone is supporting Joe Biden for the same reason, their blackness, as opposed to breaking down, okay, it is older black voters as opposed to younger black voters.  I believe Bernie Sanders actually won black voters under 50, so not so young black voters.  What does we make of the fact that black Americans support Medicare for all at a larger percentage than any other racial constituency in the country and yet voted disproportionately for Joe Biden?  Well, maybe we should have a more substantive conversation about voters as voters and trying to do what they think is best to beat Trump.  the fact that they were often voting in accordance with what the media was telling them was the most electable candidate.  And if you think about voting that way, if you break down and understand differently what Black voters were actually doing with their votes for Biden, then you start to think about what Biden should do in terms of attracting voters differently.  If you believe that Black voters voted for Joe Biden because they liked his policies, then you think he shouldn't change a thing.  He can maintain their support through the fall.  But I think what you see from that exchange with um charlotte man the god is that in fact black voters are wanting more are demanding more and part of the things one of the things they're demanding is something like medicare for all.  health care is the number two priority for black women according to an essence poll from last fall and it's actually only one point behind the number one priority meaning it's basically a statistical tie for the number one thing on people's minds, right?  So if you want Joe Biden to beat Trump, if you want the Democratic nominee, whomever they are, to beat Donald Trump, if you want him to be able to attract support from black voters, if you want him to be able to attract support from Latino voters who are gonna be crucial in a lot of these swing states, places like Texas and Arizona, then you should think, what are the reasons that Bernie Sanders was able to garner 70% of the Latino vote in Nevada?  Could it have something to do with the fact that Latinos are the most underinsured constituency in America, and Bernie Sanders was the Medicare for All candidate, and polls show that people trusted him with healthcare more than anyone else in the field?  If we don't start thinking about constituencies beyond their kind of overarching racial beliefs or constraints or what we project to be their overarching racial desires, then we're going to miss opportunities to build the coalitions that are necessary to actually defeat Trump in the fall.

            "text": "And one last question on the race component.  It seems to me what I've observed traveling around the country, is there's two types of, oh, there's many types of racism, but you have Trump versus Biden.  Trump is the more in-your-face, visceral racism, and Biden is the just more, you know, day-to-day country club racism that puts out platitudes, but in policy and the way they speak are racist.  And, you know, we're basically being told, well, the Trump one with the white nationalism and all that is a direct threat to black people and brown people, and it is.  But I don't see how Biden and this arrogance and also lack of a tangible plan for black America and, I mean, policy is racism in many ways.  Do you think that that differential between the in-your-face Trump racism and, frankly, the neoliberal racism that has ravaged black communities.  Obviously, original sin for centuries, but really The last century, you know, as white people made gains, 1950s and 1960s, the black people were not part of that middle class explosion.  Do you think that divide between those two kinds of racism is starting to get a little smaller and people are seeing both are unsustainable and unacceptable? ",

            "text": "There was a great article on this Biden brouhaha in The Guardian in which The author said that there is our money waters and people are unclear as to whether they should support Trump or Biden.  That's Biden's problem.  That's that's something for Biden to rectify.  So I don't want to you know, what Trump has.  Donald Trump has done in terms of advancing a racist policy agenda, I don't want to minimize and shouldn't be ignored.  But the reality is that oftentimes it's Democrats who have the imprimatur of doing the right thing and being the good guy who are able to achieve the most in terms of ratcheting back the social safety net because they are not under the same scrutiny as Republican bad actors.  So it is Bill Clinton and welfare reform, with welfare reform, who is able to do more to ratchet back the social safety net and advance our draconian criminal justice policies and further and pour fuel on the fire of mass incarceration than any Republican candidate, right?  It was Obama who made the Bush tax cuts permanent, right?  So we have to be clear-eyed about the threat that, yes, the Democratic candidate can pose to the long-term interests of marginalized communities in this country, including Black people.  And we should not allow his close proximity to the first Black president, who we should remember picked him not because of his racial bona fides, ability to engender trust among more racist white Southern not allow that close association to act as a shield from which Joe Biden can fend off, with which he can fend off legitimate criticisms of his policy record.  If you care about Black voters, saying Black voters supported Joe Biden as a way to shield him from criticism isn't showing that you care.  Holding his feet to the fire and making sure he's accountable to the voters that ultimately put him in office is the way that you show solidarity with that community and our needs. ",
