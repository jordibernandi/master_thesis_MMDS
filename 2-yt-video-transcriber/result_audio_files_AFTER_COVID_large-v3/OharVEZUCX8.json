And the question is, is it worse to be hated because your father, father in law, incited an insurrection against the US Capitol?  Or is it worse to be hated because you would not let the Secret Service use one of the six and a half bathrooms in your own home?  Hello everybody, I'm David Shuster and thanks for joining us.  All actions have consequences and the chickens are coming home to roost now with increased frequency against Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.  And let's be clear, don't feel sorry for them.  They have a net worth estimated at $1.1 billion and they were not considered wonderful people before they moved to Washington DC.  They had questionable real estate deals, questionable investors.  One of the apartment complexes that they own got sued for overcharging people for rent.  Another complex in which they were financially in the hole prompted them to reach out to unsavory characters for help in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and China.  In Manhattan before they came to Washington DC, they lived on the Upper East Side.  And a number of their friends, their social circle have now been telling any reporter who will listen that they want nothing to do with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump.  That they are horrified by the actions of this couple.  One of those actions included a tweet by Ivanka Trump in which she described the rioters at the US Capitol as patriots.  She then deleted the tweet.  Well, that was the last straw for the few remaining friends that they had on the Upper East Side of New York.  And Ivanka and Jarrett have been noting for a while that they were being excommunicated.  So a few months ago, according to multiple reports, they bought a piece of land in Florida. ",

            "text": "There's also this wonderful country club called the Indian Creek Country Club adjacent to all this property.  However, in order to get into this country club, you have to be nominated.  And all it takes is one member objecting and you're not allowed in.  Well, at least one of the members has told members of the media down in South Florida that Ivanka and Jared need not apply to the Indian Creek Country Club.  One of the key reasons that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner wanted to move to Florida in the first place is because Ivanka has made it clear that she wants to run for political office and challenge Republican incumbent Senator Marco Rubio in the 2022 primary.  That's right, she wants to challenge incumbent Senator Marco Rubio.  Well, the Rubio camp upon hearing this has said they are thrilled that go ahead and run Ivanka.  They think that her chances are next to nothing and that there couldn't be a worse brand than Ivanka Trump and a better one for Rubio to win his reelection.  In other words, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, they're not wanted in the Upper East Side of New York.  They're not wanted in Washington DC.  The Secret Service hates them.  And the only place that they are wanted in Florida is by a Republican senator who thinks that he will cruise to victory over her.  And by the way, the home where Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are planning to build one, well, that community doesn't want them either.  There was recently a moving van outside of the Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner home in Washington DC.  It said college hunks hauling junk, junk indeed. ",
