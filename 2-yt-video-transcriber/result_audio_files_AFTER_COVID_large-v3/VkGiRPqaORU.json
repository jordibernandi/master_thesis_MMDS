Congress and this committee in particular has a responsibility, of course, to ensure that the Census Bureau completes a full and accurate 2020 census free from political interference.  Yet in the last week, the administration made clear that it is overriding Census Bureau professionals by forcing them to rush by one month remaining census operations, regardless of the quality and the accuracy of that data.  This political interference, if not checked by Congress, will harm hard-to-count communities, including rural communities, communities of color, tribal nations, and low-income communities for the next decade at least.  So, Chairman, I urge you to schedule a hearing on this topic because, of course, we have a duty to ensure a fair and accurate census. ",
