            "text": "Alright, so here's the scoop.  This guy claims that he has matched with over 500 women on online dating apps or sites or whatever you want to call them.  And he said he has gone on exactly 100 dates and he has kept notes all along the way and detailed notes, a lot of notes.  Info on it.  Info on it.  Info on it.  Info on it.  It just says here, over two years, I've had over 500 matches and gone on exactly 100 dates.  Out of curiosity, I took notes, a lot of notes, thought I'd share all the numbers of what I experienced going on 100 dates in joy.  It looks like his name is, I'm not really good at, what is this, Reddit?  But it looks like it's Eyes and Heart, I don't know.  And this was actually sent to me by Sag, one of my viewers, so thank you Sag for sending this to me, because this is hilarious.  Alright, let's jump right into it.  So he starts off here, from February 2018 to April 2020, I've matched with 500 women on dating apps and went on dates with 100 of those women.  I've kept notes on every single date as well as every single match.  Here are the numbers I've compiled.  Enjoy.  So first off, we start here with where did I meet everyone?  And he breaks this down, matches from top to bottom, and dates from top to bottom, which it looks like his best overall average was plenty of fish, eight dates off of 12 matches, so not a lot of matches, but a pretty good turnout.  And the worst, of course, I think was what, Tinder?  161 matches and only 19 actual dates out of 161 matches, so just goes to show you what's going on with these sites.  Next question, did my dates look like their profiles in real life?  He says here, 71% were heavier than their profile showed, 66% looked older than their stated age, we've talked about that before, and 38% looked nothing like their profile.  Nothing like it, insane.  To be honest with you, I can't even deny any of these numbers.  I can't verify exactly his age.  I read something that said he was in his 40s maybe, but I don't know if that was true or not.  Whatever it is, I'm 38 and I can tell you that what I'm seeing on this list is... I don't see any reason why these are fake.  There's no reason to lie.  These are all very accurate to what I have personally experienced, so maybe you can agree with that.  So profiles of my 500 matches.  488 had photos of them exercising.  481 had photos of them eating or drinking.  464 had at least one photo in their profile.  they were not in.  How weird is that?  Pictures of food, nature, art, things of that.  441 had moderately filtered photos, very common.  408 had photos of them hiking.  When I read that, I was like, I honestly have seen a ton of photos of women hiking.  It's like a new, I don't know, new thing.  315 had photos of only their head or face, which is just a clear red flag.  That's probably why 71% were heavier than their profile showed.  291 had memes or quotes as photos.  273 profiles said no hookups, they all say that.  267 had Snapchat animations in their photos, a crown of flowers, puppy dog ears, some sort of a filter from Snapchat.  206 had heavily filtered photos.  202 referenced Donald Trump, good and bad, which honestly, that's probably one of the more common things I see on girls' dating apps is if you're a Trump supporter, just swipe left.  They don't even want to talk to you.  They don't even want to give you a chance, nothing.  You're just automatically out.  197 spoke negatively about prior relationships.  162 had cats in their pictures, and 91 only had one photo in their profile.  Interesting.  Breakdown of the dates, the cost of the dates.  Most expensive date he went on, $237, bud.  That's a waste of money right there, man.  You can get a lot other places for $237.  Average cost of a date, 78.51.  I see no reason.  that's not accurate.  I mean, two meals and a couple drinks, you're easily at 80 bucks, plus a tip probably.  You're probably over 100.  Number of times a date paid.  Ready?  How many you think?  I'll give you a minute to think about it.  100 dates.  How many times did a woman pay?  Three.  Honestly, I was surprised to see three.  I thought it was going to be zero.  Numbers of times.  the date split the check, 27.  I think that that's a little bit more common.  All right, number of matches that tried to get me to sign up for their private porn or OnlyFans page.  141 of the 500 matches were hucking their bodies on some sort of a OnlyFans type site.  Scary.  38 second dates, 21 third dates, 9 were 7 plus dates, that's not too bad.  How many girls do you think got drunk?  Out of 100 dates, how many do you think got drunk, like drunk drunk?  17.  Who made the first move?  Well we'll get to that in a minute.  First date, first impressions.  31% were dressed like they just rolled out of bed.  I went on a date one time in Florida and the girl showed up in like a ratty Harley Davidson t-shirt and like these ugly mom jeans and just looked like she just rolled out of bed.  So I've been there.  26% were dressed like they just left the gym.  That's probably more common, I would have thought.  61% had way too much makeup on.  36% had way too much perfume on.  53% had their hair up in a messy bun.  18% wore heels.  Interesting.  91% couldn't put their phones away.  91% could not stop being on their phone during a date with somebody.  91%.  My favorite stat, guess how many?  What percent of 100 dates were late?  93%, 93% were late to the first date.  First date conversations, what did they talk about?  87% talked about their kids.  77% were scorned by an ex.  73% said they have trust issues, don't they all?  71% talked about politics and orange man bad.  68% talked about past and present medical problems.  I've had that a lot.  Oh, I had this and I had that.  You know what, they want that sympathy, that like, I don't know man, it's that victim's thought process, like let me get them to feel bad for me.  64% said they don't have time to date.  62% said they are suffering from some sort of depression, which honestly goes right in line with the percentages of women that are currently on some sort of an antidepressant.  I mean, that's a lot of women taking pills.  57% talked about their current financial situation, whether it be, I guess, good or bad.  All right, let's get down to the nitty gritty.  How many put out?  41 kissed on the first date.  So 41 out of 100 dates kissed on the first date.  16 had sex on the first date, which I would have thought the number would have been a little bit higher than that.  I would have thought, I mean, maybe, I don't know what his level of game is or what the level of woman that he took to bed on is, 16, but I would think that you could close a higher percentage than 16 on the first date.  24 wanted to have sex on the first date.  I don't understand.  Maybe he just turned them down, or maybe they were... Maybe they were the bad ones.  Three said, oh, hold on.  Who made the first move?  62 times they did.  So, two to one, basically, of them making the first move.  And here's a very interesting one, and I have a story for this, too.  I met a girl one time.  We went on one date.  She came over to my house one time, and I was walking her out to her car, and she did this.  First date.  Three.  Three women said I love you on the first date.  How scary is that?
