            "text": "Hey guys, you know how PragerU is a billionaire, millionaire-funded propaganda campaign basically meant to disseminate misinformation and, you know, propagandize to young people and bring them to the right?  You know how?  that's a thing that exists and it's awful and we hate it, they lie in literally every video?  Like, I'm not even kidding, they lie so much that whenever I cover a PragerU video, we do a little minigame where we check everything they say and find out what a fucking... What a fucking liar they are.  Well, thankfully, some heroes have risen in this terrible political climate we exist in to fight back against the shameless propaganda of PragerU.  And we now have... The Gravel Institute making a leftist, or at the very least, like, liberal PragerU, essentially.  It's basically progressive PragerU, and it's doing pretty damn good.  They put out, like, I think two or three videos so far.  Getting a lot of subs from it.  I think just yesterday I saw they were at 69 subs, now they're at 77,000.  Or 69,000 subs, now they're at 77,000.  And they know how to appeal to the Zoomers, too, like on Twitter, from what I've seen.  So, I haven't watched any of these videos yet.  I imagine they're pretty good.  We got capitalism versus freedom.  Is big government really the problem?  Some pretty good evocative titles, good kind of analogous to PragerU.  They're doing some good work.  However, this has very much upset the right, particularly Lauren Chen, who we'll be covering today, because they love having this political apparatus that is paid for by politicians.  millionaires that is meant to disseminate misinformation with no pushback whatsoever, but now they're getting that pushback and they're not happy about it.  So let's see Lauren Chen bitch and whine for 17 minutes, of which I'm going to, you know, speed up to 1.5 times speed, about there now being a pushback or a competitor with PragerU.  Let's go ahead and watch.  Because Lauren Chen, by the way, is a white nationalist, thinks white people are being replaced, white genocide, LGBT people are degenerate, pedophiles, all those things.  She's an awful person.  Fucking white nationalist, alt-right type. ",

I go out of my way to do the research on it on stream, and we find that they just outright lie.  They lie about basic shit, like nothing.  They'll cite an article and show one paragraph about how this article says a certain thing or this study says a certain thing.  Then we find that study and we read the conclusion, and it comes to a completely different conclusion.  Or after you read the paragraph they show, the next paragraph where they cut it off, Debunks what they showed on screen.  It's fucking hilarious.  Or that one time, I think Vosh covered a PragerU video that was, like, featuring some, like, cookie shop owner, and the whole video, like, the guy's saying, yeah, I just own, like, a small business, cookie shop, whatever.  Then Vosh goes and looks up the guy's company, and they have a massive fucking warehouse, a massive fucking factory that takes up multiple acres of land.  It's not this, like, tiny little home family business.  It's a massive fucking factory with multiple warehouses with thousands of workers.  Just, like, little, like, unreasonable shit they lie about.  Hey, Lauren Chen, you should watch my videos on PragerU.  I represent, I show, I just showcase them lying on a regular basis.  Maybe we'll cover a PragerU video next stream, I don't know.  At least they admit.  At least they fucking admit that academia disagrees with them.  Oh, but they're in the palm of the left's hands.  I'm sorry that, like, facts and logic and truth tend to have a left-leaning bias.  Because the left is correct about these topics.  It must be really hard for you guys to have to shamelessly peddle misinformation and lies in order to push forward your political propaganda.

He wanted to make a university, like an actual university, like a campus, college, all that shit, that would push people towards right-leaning ideas.  Like an unironic re-education camp for fascist ideology.  But he couldn't manage it.
