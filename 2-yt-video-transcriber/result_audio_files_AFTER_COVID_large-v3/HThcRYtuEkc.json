He has made that claim over 150 times that no other presidents been able to do it.  He did it, but no other presidents been able to do it for literally decades.  Except maybe the one, go to this picture, because it looks like Obama is signing Veterans Choice in that photo.  And the reason it looks like that is because he was, and that photo was taken on August 7th, 2014.  And that photo is on defense.gov.  So it seems like you'd have to support the troops by acknowledging reality.  But he still claims he did it, but it was in 2014.  Seems weird. ",

This administration points out sort of all the things not to do and veterans are such a key one.  You could easily trot out veterans as he does all the time, but do it in a better way instead.  And I encourage everyone to read this New York Times article that came out about six months ago.  And it was about how Trump basically handed the VA to three of his friends, golf buddies at Mar-a-Lago.  to systematically privatize and dismantle the VA.  And not to mention all the like drunks and weirdos that have been head of the VA and like resign in shame, resign in shame.  Yeah.  Bernie Sanders has been working around veterans rights for a very long time now.  You could have easily just worked with him.  You could see, right?  Trump comes into office, works with Bernie Sanders.  Democrats on the left are like, mouth agape, don't know what to do, right?  And Bernie initially was like, look, if he wants to do some good, I might work with him.  Well, that disappeared within two months.  But anyway, all to say, he doesn't care about veterans.  He never has.  All of that is BS.  And it's so easy to point out. ",
