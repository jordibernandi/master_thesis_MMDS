            "text": "Do you believe in God?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  Today I'm going to tell a story about God.  Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Molesky.  This is my YouTube channel.  I think I should say, hello, this is the JMO Show, the most incongruent channel on YouTube.  Today, I would like to tell you what I deem as the most important story that I have inside my body.  I've wanted to tell it for a long time.  I've told it a million times in real life.  So I thought I would tell you.  Now that I have a little bit of a platform, I think it's a cool story and I'd like to get your take on it.  All right, ready?  Settle in.  So I went to Catholic school until seventh grade, and my mother wasn't a big believer, but God was in the household, especially at my grandma's house.  We were Catholic, Catholic school, raised Catholic.  And I thought that God, Jesus Christ was an axiom.  I had no idea that God was a belief system and potentially not based on facts.  If you're a believer, you would say that it is based on facts, but we all know even if you're a believer, they say to have faith, right?  So when I was in first grade, you know how at the end of like the last day or two of school, there's nothing for the teachers to do.  There's no homework.  So you just kind of dick around.  Well, I had a music class and at the last day of school, Mrs.  Gilbert showed a slideshow, you know, just different pictures, animals and whatnot.  And one slide she showed, there was a picture of a big explosion in the sky.  And she said this, well, she said it was the big bang, but she brought it to the big bang and said, this is an explosion in the sky and people that don't believe in God, Many people believe in a theory called the big bang, that there was a big explosion and that's what created the universe and earth and us.  And I raised my hand and I said, you mean some people don't believe in God?  And she said, yes.  And then at that moment I was destroyed.  If there was a book, it would be a red pill for first graders in Catholic school.  I went home that day and while it should have been a fun summer to play outside and do kid things and make mud pies and climb trees, I couldn't eat.  I couldn't sleep.  I was sick constantly with anxiety.  And remember, I'm like seven years old, six, seven years old.  And I went to my mom and I'm like, mom, what if there's not a God?  She's like, just read the Bible.  Okay.  My mom wasn't very good at parenting in that degree realm.  But there was no, it's looking for answers from a book in which you're questioning its validity.  I mean, that's very, very difficult to do, especially when you're a kid.  So it was probably a month and a half in summer where I wasn't eating, I wasn't sleeping, I was just sick, with the idea, what you're probably wondering, if there's not a God, then when I die, it's over.  So I was struggling with my morality because I had thought that when I was good and kind and sweet and prayed that I would be rewarded for all eternity.  Right.  And that, and that was yanked out from me.  Thanks Mrs.  Gilbert.  So I, a month and a half in my mom finally was like, okay, we have to take you to a therapist.  So I went to a therapist and she didn't help me.  But I remember her saying to my mom in front of me, I deal with this a lot, usually college and beyond.  This is the youngest kid I've ever had.  Yeah.  You know, I happen to know a six, almost seven-year-old right now, and she can't... There's no... Her brain's not there, so I don't know what in the hell I was doing when I was that age.  I was always kind of a grandma when I was a little girl, though.  But anyway, we did the therapy.  It didn't work.  My grandma lived out in the country, so I went to her house all the time.  And across the street, there was a huge field.  I mean, there was this field everywhere, trees, forest.  And I said, I'm going to go play.  So I went across the street into the field and I'm like, okay, there's, if, if there's going to be any answers, it's going to have to come from God, even though I'm supposed to believe without seeing and not question.  Right?  So I go far out into the field where there's no view of me because there's big front windows at my grandma's house and I don't want anyone to see what I'm about to do.  So when I'm, when I'm through and you can't see me anymore, I get down on the ground on my knees and I say, father, son, Holy spirit.  Amen.  Dear God, I know I'm supposed to believe without seeing.  have faith but I'm losing it here.  so I need you to show me that you're real.  so I wanted to be easy on God.  you know he's busy.  so I said to him how about you show me two birds?  if you show me two birds I'll know that you're real right.  and it's a summer day.  so I'm like trying to really give him a soft a soft thing to do.  so I say my prayer and I get up and I start looking for birds and I see a Robin.  I'm like okay well I asked for two.  there's one who Thank you.  You know, I'm desperate at this point.  And then there's like a little flock of, I remember a little flock of birds that came and I was like, Oh dang.  I asked for two and he gave me many.  Very good God.  Thank you God.  So I keep going on my hike walk.  It's probably a half hour, an hour later I'm playing and climbing trees and doing everything.  And I had forgotten about the prayer and I was, I went into the woods and I was walking out into the field and it was a big open field, like an L shaped.  Okay.  I'll grandma's house.  So I'm on this stretch and I'm walking and I see something big moving.  I'm like, what is that?  And I look and it's this, the big thing and it's walking and it gets up and it takes flight.  I think it's a Sandhill crane.  I think it's, but it seems bigger than that.  I don't know.  I'd never seen one before.  I've seen them since.  And it, it goes the biggest bird I've ever seen.  And it lands a hundred feet away from me, picks up its mate and they both fly above me and away.  Isn't that cool?  I love that story.  I've only asked God for the one thing, right?  And, and he showed me.  He gave it to me, but this is kind of where I want to get your opinion.  because, because, because there's a million things I may have seen them, you know, an hour before and it not registered consciously, but subconsciously.  So I asked for that thing.  I don't know.  Or God answered my prayer.  So since then I was like, okay, thank you.  It's the one thing I asked and you gave it to me.  Got it.  Now here's where I'm at.  five years ago.  Okay.  So that story took me many years, like propelled me in belief for many years.  And then I read a book called Nailed.  It's like, I think it's the nine myths that show Jesus never existed at all because I started questioning my faith again.  And that book destroyed me.  It's not nine myths.  It's just hundreds of pieces of historical data that don't bode well for the idea that Jesus existed.  And I know there's going to be people listening that are like, you know, historians agree.  He was, he was real.  I'm not there.  I'm sorry.  I'm not there.  But anyway, that book destroyed me.  And I think I got, you know, I question a lot of the, the maliciousness and anger of some of my commenters, you know, I'm like, why are you even looking at to be enraged?  if if there's if if you believe something why would you come to me to tell me i'm wrong?  but i did this with with god.  when i read that book i was like.  i can't believe i've been lied to.  my grandma was lied to my mom was lied to everyone was lied to about god.  how dare that happen?  and that's when i really started to unpack government and god and religion and media and education and everything because what else have i been wrong about?  so I started consuming content like Christopher Hitchens and just any atheist Christian debate I could get my hands on because usually the atheist, in my opinion, usually the atheist won and it felt so good.  I can't tell you why exactly, but it did.  It felt very nutritious for the starved mind of vindication for the pain that I was experiencing at that moment, right?  So I'm going through that and then I quit my job as a fine dining server because I have a website called iamwaitress.com.  It's not around anymore.  The YouTube channel is still there, but I really love great customer service and hospitality and nurturing and all that.  So I wanted to do a tour of the country to spend shifts with the top rated service teams in the country to write about what excellent service is.  And I was using couchsurfing.org.  Do you know what that is?  It's like Airbnb, except for it's free.  You have to do a bio and then you get rated and people either say, yes, you can stay with me or no, you can't.  And I was in my car on my way to Nashville and I said, okay, God, I still want to believe in you because you gave me the birds.  but you also get, there's also this book, you know, of, you know, and if you're all knowing and everything is peachy keen in the Bible, you did some boo-boos.  Okay.  So I said, I want to believe in you and I will devote myself to you depending upon what I see in the coming days.  That night I stayed at a man's house who used to be a hardcore Christian.  And then he turned to atheist and you know how that goes.  the pendulum is very strong on that.  So he had this love for God.  And then it was like, it's the dumbest thing ever.  I was duped, just like I had recently thought.  And he said so many things to me that compelled me to stop believing in God again.  Here's another question.  Do you experience this?  It's like if I start to believe in God and feel... And I even hate that there's feelings involved, but I feel like that would be the only way for a God to communicate would be very internal.  But when I get the sense that there's a God, I feel a lot of connection for everyone and everything.  A lot of beauty, a lot of glory, a lot of appreciation, a lot of awe.  But then, like that, I can snap off into a science-minded world.  thinking only personality.  I guess it's right brain versus left brain.  And then that makes more sense than the feeling.  So it's like whatever path I even veer a little bit to, I can easily slant into that direction.  Do you experience that?  Or have you always just been religious or non-religious?  So anyway, I do this trip.  And now where I'm at is It has occurred to me that there could be a God, but it's not the God that we were taught about.  I don't care if you're Muslim, if you're Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Protestant, I mean all forms of Christianity, but there could be just a bigger hand at play.  And that's kind of where I'm leaning now.  Why did I want to tell you that story?  I don't know.  I feel like that bird story is the most important thing that's ever happened to me in my life.  And I've told it, 200 times in my life.  And I want to tell it to you.  Let's break this channel up a little bit.  And just tell a little story now and then.  What do you think?  There's no code word.  I don't think I'm going to do a commenting on comments unless you really want me to.  Tell me no.  I don't think it's necessary.  That's it.  That's my story.  Thank you for tuning in, new people and people that have seen me before.  I appreciate you and I hope that you're happy.  I don't care if you believe in God or not.  I want you to be happy.  I want you to be tested.  and win and find fulfillment in that and a happiness of self of who you are.  That's what I want.  Okay.  Bye. ",
