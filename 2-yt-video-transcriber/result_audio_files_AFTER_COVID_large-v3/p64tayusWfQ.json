Have you ever found yourself in a mind-numbingly frustrating situation, like a grocery store line that was just taking forever?  Or maybe it was a comment on Facebook that cost you a few IQ points.  How do you react in this situation?  Every day of our lives, we are dealt challenges that we have to overcome.  Those challenges are petty, you know, stubbing your toe, and they can be more serious, like the death of a loved one, or losing your job and so we all have to learn to deal with those things.  and there have been hundreds maybe thousands of religions and philosophies and belief systems that have attempted to help us do this.  so on today's indirect message i want to talk about stoicism.  the ancient greeks you know.  they left us this treasure trove of ideas about how to lead the good life and so much of it still applies now 2 000 years later.  but before we dive in a little qualifier this philosophy isn't going to be for everyone And it's not going to fix all your problems.  But I think that it's a perspective that's worth considering, even if it enrages you.  Fortunately, the Stoics welcomed critique, and they actually gave us some tools to deal with anger, too.  So when I first told my therapist about stoicism, she was kind of alarmed.  In retrospect, I think it's because she thought I meant I wanted to be stoical, you know, kind of like unfeeling and emotionless. ",

As a general rule, the Stoics wanted us to take a closer look at how we manage our negative emotions.  And the Stoics didn't want us to push these feelings down or to deny their existence, but to try to prevent them in the first place.  And if we can't prevent them, to try to keep them from. ",
