            "text": "Today the Navy officially released three videos of UFOs.  They are called Fleur, Gimble and Go Fast.  The internet immediately took this as meaning that aliens are real.  But the videos are not actually new.  They were internally declassified back in 2017 and immediately released by Tom DeLonge's To The Stars Academy.  I started writing about them in December 2017 and with the help of others I quickly arrived at likely explanations for all three videos.  The FLIR video is most likely a distant plane.  The video was taken well after the famous encounter with a hypersonic zig-zagging tic-tac by pilots from the Nimitz.  This object doesn't actually move on screen, except when the camera moves, and it resembles an out-of-focus low-resolution backlit plane.  I don't know what the pilots saw, but this video does not show anything really interesting.  The gimbal video is also probably of a plane.  It's not rotating.  What you see is the infrared glare of the engines, which is larger than the plane.  It looks like it's rotating because of an artifact of the gimbal mounted camera system.  This is all a bit confusing, so I made several videos explaining it.  Oh, and the aura around the plane, that's just image sharpening.  It happens all the time in thermal camera footage.  It's not an alien warp drive, it's just the Unsharp Mask filter.  The Go Fast video probably shows a balloon.  It's not moving fast, it's not skimming the water.  And you can verify this yourself, because all the information you need is in the numbers on the screen.  You just need a little high school trigonometry.  The apparent speed is just an effect caused by parallax.  Over the last few years, I've made a variety of videos explaining all this.  You can find the playlist linked in the description.  If you've got questions, especially about the gimbal video, then I've probably covered it there, or it will be covered in the various discussions on Medibank.  If it's not covered, then let me know, and I'll try to find an answer.  All I'm explaining here are these three videos, not other videos, and I'm not explaining any Eyewitness accounts.  These three videos are not as interesting as they seem, and they all have quite plausible explanations.  The Navy probably arrived at similar conclusions that these are simply things like aircraft, drones, or balloons, but because of the default operational security regulations, no one can talk about it.  And that opened the door to all this speculation.  Hopefully I've cleared it up a little.  Visiting aliens are always a possible explanation for any UFO video.  But these videos don't show evidence of any kind of advanced technology.  So unfortunately, the real explanations, while fun to investigate, are probably pretty boring. ",
