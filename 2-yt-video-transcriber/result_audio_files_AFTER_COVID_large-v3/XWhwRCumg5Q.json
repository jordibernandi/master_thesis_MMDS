            "text": "Because Dr.  Flowers has created a blog and podcast dedicated to addressing the issue of Calvinism, especially as it is related to the recent rise in popularity within his own denomination, Southern Baptists, he is sometimes accused of being imbalanced or obsessed with this one topic.  This is an understandable perception if all you know of Leighton is through his popular Sociology 101 podcast.  But this short video below should help you to understand Layton's motives and his ministry.  Here is a list of the ministry websites that Dr.  Flowers oversees and or works with on a regular basis.  TexasBaptist.org, TexasApologetics.com, ChristianApologetics101.com, Supersummer.com, and SeeYouAtThePoll.org.  A listener sent in this satire article inspired by the Babylonian Bee, which demonstrates the fallacious manner in which some of Dr.  Flowers' opponents have attempted to dismiss his views.  Enjoy.  The title, The Plague of One-String Banjos, satire article submitted by a listener.  Thanks to the objective and reasoned discernment of Dr.  James White, a popular Christian apologist, the serious epidemic of dangerous banjos with only one string have been brought to the attention of at least a dozen or so people.  Of course, we are not talking about actual banjos here.  We are talking about theological bloggers who have the audacity to create websites or social media pages that have a limited focus.  Rather than including all sorts of random and tedious mundane information about the blogger's everyday life, some rogue theologians have the gall to create pages that cover one particular subject of interest.  It is quite appalling that the World Wide Web even allows this type of catastrophic particularity and focus.  Dr.  White is working tirelessly to stem the tide of one-string banjos by commenting on everything from bike rides to bow ties throughout his day.  One faithful White fan expressed his appreciation to the great apologist, saying, quote, Dr.  White, thank you for not just having one, two, or three strings, but thousands of them for us to read about throughout our otherwise boring lives.  You give us a reason to keep coming  back.\".  One particularly notable offender that White has regularly ridiculed for his one-string ways is Dr.  Leighton Flowers of Soteriology101.com.  This theologian-turned-blogger has a wife and four kids.  He regularly preaches at a large church, serves as an adjunct professor, and the director of evangelism and apologetics for Texas Baptists.  where he oversees literally dozens of evangelistic and apologetic events throughout the year, yet he has the unmitigated gall not to tell us about all of this on his Soteriology blog or social media pages.  Oh, and it gets worse.  Our investigative reporter learned that just last week, Dr.  Flowers rode his bike for over an hour, and he did not even tweet about it.  Well, he might have, but we only read his Soteriology 101 Twitter feed, so we assume he did not.  When will this madness stop?  Flowers' sociology blog was created to address the major sociological controversy between Calvinist and traditionalist in the Southern Baptist Convention, as that was the topic of his doctoral dissertation.  But followers have come to expect a certain level of disclosure from theological bloggers.  Just what is Dr.  Flowers trying to hide?  Other obvious one-string offenders are the creators of monergism.com, calvinistcorner.com, effectualgrace.com, reformationtheology.com, reformbaptistblog.com, and many others.  We reached out to Dr.  White to get his comments on these one-string banjos, but we still have not yet received a response.  We are sure, however, that they will receive a thorough tongue-lashing from the great apologist.  After all, we know that Dr.  White is nothing if not objective and impartial in his criticism of others. ",

But I haven't had to do so by yelling and screaming.  You are stupid in comparison to God.  Shut up.  This will result in a four-hour edition of his podcast.  Cowardly.  I find it cowardly.  That you will continuously mock.  What are those little animals you're not supposed to feed after midnight or something?  You know, they're really cute and snuggly, and then you feed them after midnight.  That's what we've got here.  So, gremlins.  Is that what it is?  Okay.  Very tall gremlins.  Because it's just slightly loony.  And I'd never heard of it before.  And nobody else I know ever had either.  So he is a popeless Catholic when it comes to this issue.  Remove the text from being relevant to what you fear.  And you need to understand this traditionalist movement is a fear-driven movement.  They're seeing what's going on, and they're seeing that they cannot stem this tide.  And so they have to come up with something.  It's a rearguard action, is what it is.  You don't have the right to tell them otherwise.  Sit down, creature.  You live for maybe 80 years and then you die.  You are stupid in comparison to God.  Shut up and listen to what he says.  It just seemed to me he was trying to get an audience by constantly responding to me.  Oh, hey, listen to what I had to say about what he said.  It's an absurd objection.  And nobody staying before God some days could be so stupid as to make it.  Because they know their own sin.  and the presence of the Holy God, they're not going to be coming up with this kind of absurdity.  Most folks are going to be more impressed by story time with Uncle Leighton.  A single, meaningful, reformed writer, not a single one of the Westminster framers, not a single one of the London's Confession of Faith framers that would have even, they, every single one of them would look at you and laugh in your face, sir, and you know it.  You know it.  Don't tell me you don't know it.  Layton has been corrected on this.  And again, people go, hey, if he's been corrected on it, and then he keeps lying about it, doesn't that say, you know, the father of all lies.  Okay, okay.  It does not say much for Layton.  Professor Flowers is a one-string banjo.  I mean, he fell apart.  He face-planted.  It was any debate judge, any atheist debate judge, just simply doing the question, answer, dum-da-dum-dum.  Gone.  Done.  Over with.  Right there.  I mean, just that clear.  He was not handling the text in any meaningful fashion. ",
