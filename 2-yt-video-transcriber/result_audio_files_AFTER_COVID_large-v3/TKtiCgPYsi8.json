            "text": "Hello, Bezel T3.  That was Perry Stone.  The myth, the legend, Brother Perry Stone!  Okay, the myth, the legend, I forgot that part.  During an appearance at the Ramp Church in Cleveland, Tennessee, talking about three things that are happening in 2020 and 2021.  As I want to do, I began to meander around Perry Stone's website and found in the online store section, among other such theologically rich digital downloads as Infants in Heaven and When You Dream About Snakes, well, I came across this shiny little set of spiritual hardware.  Hello, Bezel T3.  That was a flashback to last week, the 23rd of January, 2021, when I did a video on Perry Stone entitled, When You Dream of Snakes and the Meal that Heals.  Two books that can be found by clicking the shop tab of Perry's website.  Now, I used some video clips from an infomercial that Perry put together in which he promotes an absolutely unbiblical notion that daily communion with juice and crackers will bring about physical healing, among other such things.  Perry also sells what he calls a meal-to-heals communion kit.  It's the same kit you can get online from Noah's Ark distributors.  It contains two cups, a juice vial, a funnel, a bread container, and a fancy leather pouch.  Now, in my video, I argued against this silly and even dangerous notion of personal daily communion.  Perry spoke about a three-fold atoning work on the cross, which he says includes physical healing.  Now, first thing to make clear is that nowhere in Scripture are we commanded to take the Lord's Supper on a daily basis.  What we are told in Acts 2 verse 46 and following is that together, as the assembly of believers, day by day, they attended the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts.  Believers assembled together and were taught, ate meals, which included the Lord's Supper, and prayed  together.\".  So, the idea that individual disciples took the Lord's Supper in his or her own house, well, that's right out.  You see, it's called communion because believers commune with the Lord Jesus and with each other.  Perry goes on to say that by receiving communion, you can receive healing in every area of your life.  As he says this clearly unbiblical statement, he is standing by a huge piece of matzah.  Now all that to say that Perry got his knickers in a twist over my critique of his aberrant teaching and proceeded to contact YouTube through his Voice of Evangelism organization and had my video taken down.  This resulted in a copyright strike for me.  And there you go, the essence of the cancel culture.  If you got power and you don't like what someone says, just shut them down.  Now, the question we should be asking is, why would Perry do this?  I mean, really.  He is an individual who is the head of a multi-million dollar ministry in Cleveland, Tennessee, who has his own television show on TBN called Manifest.  whose YouTube channel shows over a half a million subscribers.  It's all very impressive stuff.  And yet, Perry and or his minions found the time in their busy day to contact YouTube with a legal copyright takedown complaint against me.  So, I contacted Perry via email and asked him to retract his complaint.  This is what I wrote.  Hello.  I have been made aware that you have claimed copyright infringement on my video entitled, When You Dream of Snakes and the Meal that Heals.  Taking the time to contact YouTube indicates, for reasons only you know, that my video definitely got under your skin.  I believe that I am legally justified in using your material in accordance with the fair use section of the U.S.  copyright law.  Since I believe you are being totally unbiblical promoting the Lord's Supper as the meal that heals, I felt compelled to express my opinion, which for now is still a First Amendment right.  Why not allow my video to provide another point of view and let the viewer decide?  Please retract your claim.  If you truly believe you are being biblical, then why would you suppress my opinion, unless there are other reasons for not wanting my point of view heard?  Let God be the judge.  Please have YouTube restore the video by tomorrow, January 27th, 2021.  Know that I intend to do another video either praising you or admonishing you depending on your response.  Thank you, Bezel T3.  Well, January 27th has come and gone and all I heard were crickets.  So Perry, it's now time to get admonished.  Now, Perry is deeply entrenched in Pentecostalism as evidenced by what he says here.  He is speaking at Evangel Temple exactly one year ago today, the 28th of January, which happens to be my birthday.  Many nominal people believe.  Okay, let's stop right there.  Perry is categorizing people like me as nominal, meaning existing as a Christian in name only, but not really a Christian at all because I'm a cessationist.  Let's continue.  that speaking with other tongues passed away a long time ago.  And there are churches in Jacksonville, Florida, where a pastor will stand behind a pulpit, really all over the United States, not just Jacksonville, and will tell their people tongues have ceased.  Tongues no longer exist.  These people who say they speak with tongues are foolish.  They are deceived.  It is a bunch of jibber-jabber, jibber-jabber.  jibber-jabber, as opposed to biblical tongues where people spoke in actual known languages that were unknown to the speaker.  All right, Perry, why not give us an example of biblical tongues?  Yes, Lord, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Unbelievable.  So once again, more madness in the NAR camp and one more bit of evidence that this is not of God.  You know, I'm going to have to agree with our friend from Revealing Truth Channel.  Any rational person should look at that and see that Perry likes to make the minor things in Scripture the major things.  And of course, he was making that all up, all those weird sounds.  You know, You know what I'm talking about.  Tongues, signs and wonders, end times, prophecy pulled out of today's news stories and dreams about snakes.  It's also paltry and trifling compared to the major themes in God's Word, and yet so enticing and alluring to the biblically ignorant.  So there's that.  But back to my earlier question.  Why would Perry be so threatened by my video critiquing his teaching called The Meal That Heals that he would have YouTube take it down after being up only three days or so?  There's no way I can know Perry's motivation.  I can't know his mind and his heart.  But I can and will speculate a little bit.  I want to suggest that either Perry knows that what he is teaching is false and wants nothing to shine a light on his deception, or he actually believes it, but his pride won't tolerate anyone questioning his understanding of the Bible, or it could be about the revenue streams.  There's a reason that Perry has become the latest example of what's known as the cancel culture.  And I'm willing to bet one of these possibilities is very close to the truth.  Perry ends his infomercial talking about making a family altar and the importance of daily communion.  A family altar and daily communion?  Friends, there is no need for a family altar, whatever that is, and the Lord's Supper is not a vitamin supplement.  Now, I went on to explain what I am convinced is the biblical understanding of the Lord's Supper.  It is rather a visible means of God's grace for the struggling Christians.  And if we're honest, we are all struggling from time to time.  It contains the same promises as found in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  As baptism is a sign and seal of the initial cleansing of a sinner's heart, the Lord's Supper is a continual sign and seal of God's gracious supply of gospel nourishment that every Christian needs for the journey through this life.  Also, as surely as I see with my eyes and taste with my mouth the bread and the cup of the Lord, so surely I can know that through the Holy Spirit's presence, the Lord Jesus himself nourishes and refreshes my soul for eternal life with his crucified body and poured out blood given for me once for all.  on that wretched tree.  Perry Stone is very well versed in Biblical head knowledge, but his overall emphasis is on the wrong syllable.  He is a lot like the Pharisees Jesus spoke to in John chapter 5.  Jesus says to them, You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life.  And it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.  Jesus goes on to say, For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me.  Now, Perry, speaking directly to you, I'm not trying to be vindictive here.  You are free to claim copyright infringement within my video, although it does raise that pesky question as to why an evangelical titan such as yourself would waste the time to do so.  But a lot of what you teach I would call Christless Christianity.  It's not the true gospel, and you alone will have to answer for that.  May the Lord Jesus Christ, through His Spirit, rebuke you for teaching a false gospel in the meal that heals.  May you read these words from Paul in 1 Corinthians with a fresh set of eyes and repent of your false teaching.  1 Corinthians 3, 11-15.  For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.  Now, if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, Each one's work will become manifest, manifest, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.  If the work that anyone has built on survives, that the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.  If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through  fire.\". ",
