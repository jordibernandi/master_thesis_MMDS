Real nice, comfortable ride.  Worked out really well.  Got some 35-12.5-20 Nitto.  trail grapplers on here with some 20 by 10 fuel throttle wheels on here.  Give a nice look, nice proportion package.  Came out really nice.  Here in Hawaii, we got to put these little flare extensions and mud flaps on for this recon inspection we have.  So that's on there to get this thing to pass through the inspections and everything.  Looks really nice, really great blue color on this one.  Turned out really well.  Any questions you have about this build or any other builds, just leave a comment.  We'll get right back to you.  Thanks for watching.  Thank you. ",
