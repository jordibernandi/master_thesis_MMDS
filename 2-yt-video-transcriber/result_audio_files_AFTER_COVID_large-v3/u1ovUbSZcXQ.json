            "text": "Everything bad throughout all of history has been the fault of the left.  Everything good throughout all of history has been because of the right.  This fact has been known by every historian throughout all of history, and those who deny it are merely expressing their feelings, not the facts.  As you can see, all of the data supports the fact that the right is better than the left.  The right believes in the highly scientific idea of a benevolent, wrathful god who created you with a purpose to love and worship and he will reward you with an eternity of happiness.  All of the best countries of the world have the highest percentage of god belief.  Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mexico, Pakistan, Colombia, and Somalia.  The left believes in no good, that we are all a random accident with no purpose, and the highly unscientific idea that we evolved from animals, and therefore there is no right and wrong, and you can do whatever you want.  All of the worst countries of the world have the lowest percentage of god belief.  Hell holes like Estonia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Czech Republic.  The left wants white people to feel guilty for slavery.  But did you know that starvation happened in communist countries?  And every leftist supports everything that ever happened in a communist country.  Slaves in America, on the other hand, were allowed to have such delicacies as cornmeal, water, and sometimes even bones with leftover meat still attached.  So how absurd is it that we are supposed to feel guilty for taking care of our fellow human beings?  The left believes in ridiculous things like climate change.  Could it be that the scientists have a so-called consensus on climate change because they were paid off by the big solar panel industry?  Consensus or agenda?  It is true that we are currently undergoing Earth's sixth major worldwide extinction, the Holocene extinction, but is that really anything to be concerned about?  The left seems to think so, but how ridiculous is it to believe that climate can adversely affect agriculture, make equatorial areas too hot to survive, drive mass migration and affect human sustainability in the near future.  Meanwhile, the very wealthy fossil fuel donors who support us are. ",
