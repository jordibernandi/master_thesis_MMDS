I look forward to working with everybody going forward.  And really, once again, thank you very much from me, the Royal Marines, and the United Kingdom.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, it's a completely unexpected honor.  I mean, it means a huge amount.  I know what it means to the US.  And to be recognized for what I did at that level is a great honor.  I'm humbled, really.  Being able to actually live and breathe as a US Marine for two years has been pretty incredible.  I've made some great lifelong friends.  I'd like to think that we bring a good sense of humour to the job.  We're probably quite well renowned in the Royal Marines for one of our commando values is cheerfulness in the face of adversity and not taking things too seriously where you can make light heart of them.  I think it's important to be able to smile in difficult situations.  While I'm not saying the US Marines don't share that, I think that's something that we pride ourselves on in the Royal Marines.  So I'd like to think that that's one thing I've been able to put back into the system.  I would just like to say thank you.  As I say, I'm truly humbled to have been recognised for this.  It means a lot to me.  It's a huge honour to have been awarded this.  It really is a... As I said, it was a team effort.  I mean, it really wasn't anything I did differently or wouldn't expect a U.S.  Marine to have done.  And I like the fact that it doesn't matter the color of the uniform that you wear or the flag on your arm.  You can all work together, and we work for one another and those either side of us.  And that was the most important thing.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
