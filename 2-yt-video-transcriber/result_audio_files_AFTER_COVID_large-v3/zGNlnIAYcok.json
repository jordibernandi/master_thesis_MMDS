Fact When your small business was in trouble, you knuckled down, worked harder, and made sacrifices until you got back on your feet.  Donald Trump declared bankruptcy six times.  See, Donald Trump is nothing like you.  You haven't been accused by 30 women of sexual assault or rape.  You haven't destroyed families and put children in cages.  You haven't let Russia put bounties on American soldiers' heads.  You haven't called American soldiers and veterans losers and suckers.  You aren't responsible for over 185,000 deaths because you failed to do your job.  You're nothing like Donald Trump.  Remember that when you vote. ",
