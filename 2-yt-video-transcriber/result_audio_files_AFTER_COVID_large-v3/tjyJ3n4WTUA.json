Those stimulus checks would not be just for two months and were a precursor to a universal basic income for everyone.  March 30, 2020 Philip Tilton.  Facebook by Debbie Daniels.  I cannot prove but it comes from very high up that Oprah has been arrested, talked and has been released to do some requirements to make connections.  Tom Hanks has been arrested and was set for execution.  Rita Wilson has been arrested.  Trudeau has been arrested and was in quarantine confinement.  Ellen DeGeneres has been, or was going to be arrested shortly, along with many, many, many others.  all claimed they have been affected with the virus, have probably gotten the tainted adrenochrome, or were without adrenochrome and beginning withdrawal, which was said to be horrid and resulted in death.  Weinstein would probably die.  He was going through adrenochrome withdrawal.  Politicians, CEOs, actors, musicians and the many were being arrested all over the world.  We should see three maybe more, days of darkness and then information should flow as to what was and has been going down.  The MSM was totally lying to us and have made totally false stories about this virus.  The doctors were complacent in giving out false information and the numbers were all fake.  Pray and pray and wait for the beautiful world on the other end of this pandemic.  1.  Nothing has gone yet.  No news.  2.  Still hearing good things about this week.  3.  Hearing that the first stimulus bill was not enough and we needed more.  4.  Judy note, my concern was that Pelosi and company were now busily writing a second bill full of pork and their favorite projects related to their leftist agenda, not helping the average Joe, and we were going to have to pay for it.  5.  Banking contacts were still hopeful that they would see their funds released tomorrow Wednesday the 1st of April.  That was what they were being told.  I don't see how that would be possible because of the logistics for exchange centers which were running on a skeleton crew.  They have sick people with sick family members.  I do not know how they will roll this out.  The three days of darkness as we understand it was to cover up military moves to arrest all the rats.  We hear this is what they are using as a cover.  I have talked to several of you who have been having rolling blackouts over the last few days here in North Carolina and in Florida.  There have been several hours each day with no internet and phone.  Are they trying to prep us for it perhaps?  7.  The last few days we have basically seen the nationalization of the bond markets, which is the Federal Reserve telling the rich people that their money is safe.  At the same time it does provide safety for 401ks and pensions because they are heavily invested in the bond market.  The Fed has also started purchasing mortgage bundles from Fannie Mae and Freddie to try to prop this up so it doesn't crash.  8.  The only reason this doesn't scare me is the information I am getting that our central bank, US Treasury, has taken over the Fed.  Basically I think they are printing unlimited fiat to overload the system so they could pin it all on the Fed.  You bankrupt it, put in the new gold, asset-backed system and boom.  That's what I see happening.  9.  Starting tomorrow Wednesday the 1st of April we may get three days of darkness with no internet in order to make the mass arrests say military contacts.  Judy Note, Fleming said that since the mass arrests were going so well that they may have decided against shutting down the internet, phones and social media during three days of darkness.  Others say mass arrests were going on right now and we were already in the middle of the three days of darkness.  D-March 31, 2020 Nazara Part 11 Public and Individual Proofs, Mortgage Deferral, Utah.b where Blink discussed the CARES Act of Debt Forgiveness.  E-March 31, 2020 A call to email President Trump on hospitals firing doctors and health care workers for speaking to the media about working conditions and lack of care.  President Trump's email, Whitehouse.GafatGmail.com.  A sample email.  Dear President Trump.  This is outrageous.  Hospitals are threatening to fire health care workers who publicize their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic, and have in some cases followed through.  The New York-Lang-On health system has warned employees they could be terminated if they talk to the media without authorization.  Where is our freedom of speech?  How can we lose these very important frontline workers who risk their lives to help us get through this pandemic?  These institutions should be sued big time.  Hospitals tell doctors they'll be fired if they speak out about lack of fear.  www.bloomberg.com.  weblink.  Sign with your name and address.  F.

The latest celebrity to fall to coronavirus was CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, an outspoken enemy of President Trump.  Cuomo was the brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.  Judy Note, it was rumored that the reason so many celebrities had recently fell victim to coronavirus was because a certain lab which shipped out adrenochrome, the blood of a traumatized child, had shipments tainted with the virus.  This was done to catch those who raped, tortured and murdered children in their worship of Satan.  Many of these same celebrities were connected to Jeffrey Epstein and his pedophile island. ",
