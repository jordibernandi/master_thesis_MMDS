People, I was getting messages in the last video.  It is a problem that a lot of people are saying to us.  our videos are not actually put in the recommended side or on the right side of the video.  I don't know what the problem is there, but there is a problem.  So we do rely on you guys to share the content.  So please help us win this battle.  Please share the video on any way you can do it.  And even take the link and stick it on another YouTube video.  Just let others know what is going on.  Really, that will really help the channel. ",
