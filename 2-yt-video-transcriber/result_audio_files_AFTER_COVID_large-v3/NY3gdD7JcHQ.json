Welcome to Zeducation.  Welcome to another episode of Zeducation.  Today, we're going to have a little fun, again, reviewing some of my favorite SJW meltdowns, some of the virtue signaling out there, all of it in the name of justice, the world's newest religion, social justice.  If you cringe, you win.  It means you have an ounce of common sense, an ounce of logic left in your brain, and you know that this behavior is not helping anybody.  before we get to these meltdowns as always please subscribe to this channel and please click the bell for notifications when new videos are uploaded.  now on to some of my favorite moments from the past couple months in the social justice movement.

I would go insane.  Would you?  Let me know in the comments.  Would you ever?  How much money, how many beers would it take for you to date a woke woman?  Oh, solidarity.  Solidarity.
