With seven Dove Awards, several Grammy nominations, the Isaacs are frequent guests at the Grand Ole Opry and are popular artists on the Gaither Homecoming videos.  This is their story of unshakable faith.  This is today's life.  Becky, you all are so busy.  You've been touring, you've been in the studio, you've been traveling.  Take me back a little bit when you got involved in the group and what inspired you? ",

It seems like in the last three or four months, I've slept in my own bed about six nights.  Wow.  So it's been busy, and you know, we're touring, and not only touring three and four days a week, but we're also making records, and playing the Grand Ole Opry, and doing different things that require mid-week services.  So it is a busy time, but we're blessed.  I am 43, and so I started in the family as soon as I could talk, pretty much.  When Mom and Dad discovered, which you may hear the same stories from all three of us, because we grew up in the same home.  But by the time our parents discovered that we could sing, which was probably three and four, we were in perfect harmony.  And so I'm the baby.  So my sister's a year older.  My brother's two years older than Sonia, so he's three years older than me.  And we were singing in full perfect three-part harmony by the time we were three and four.  And so as soon as they realized that we could sing, immediately we started filling positions.  And by the time my sister was nine, she was on the guitar.  By the time I was 11, I was playing mandolin.  And then Sonya was on mandolin.  And then by 11, I was on guitar.  And then about 14 on upright bass.  And, you know, it's just been our life.  You know, we just have committed to the music. ",

It doesn't matter the crowd size or the, it usually depends upon my environment for me.  But yeah, I get very nervous.  And so when the Grand Ole Opry is over, then I'm like, That was awesome.

            "text": "Well, I think that I'll start out by saying that the only difference between my family and whoever's watching is that we're actually behind the microphone.  Our families live through the same thing that all the viewers are experiencing and the pedestal that we're put on is sometimes just one of those things where they think that maybe we live in a different world but the truth is that we all experience different things and can relate to them because we're all going through something.  and for me.  in the year of 2000 I woke up and everything in my body had begun to shut down.  I went from doctor to doctor and finally I made it to the Mayo Clinic where they then diagnosed me with a very rare form of Crohn's disease because not only was my digestive system completely out of whack, but all of the nerve endings from my head to my feet were severely inflamed.  The doctor said I would probably go blind in both of my eyes by the time I lived to be older.  And so I never really had just the basic Crohn's.  It started in the small bowel, eventually going to the large bowel.  And by the year of 2011, I had ulcers in the colon.  I was on a chemotherapy injection for six years.  I was on a Humira injections.  I was on 20 different pills to stay alive.  And I really didn't think I would live to see 40 or 50.  So it was challenging all of those years.  All the while we're traveling by plane and bus, 200 shows a year.  That's definitely where you see God's faith, His grace is sufficient because He always gave me what I needed to get on stage, but getting to that stage was the challenge for me.  Every morning, getting out of bed and dealing with such a physical... My nerve endings would burn so bad.  If I would get out of the shower, my skin would burn so bad for hours that I would almost have to just sponge bath two and three days at a time because it wasn't worth the pain.  And so on the year of 2011, I took a step of faith I've never taken before.  And I found myself, after trying everything on the market, by the time I found this place in 2011, I was on the very last medication Mayo Clinic said was available for my condition.  I found myself in a holistic clinic called Internal Balance in Brentwood, Tennessee.  And it began a step of faith for me because that's when I began to realize that that there's more than one way to bake a cake.  There's more than one way to get better.  And in 2011 was the last, February 22nd of 2011 is the last day I took any medication for my condition.  In the last eight years, I've been walking and healing, which has become my testimony because in John 9, we read of Jesus passing by a blind man and he spits on the ground and he takes the clay and he puts it into the blind man's eyes and he tells him to go to the pool and wash.  And I love that story because this blind man does receive a miracle.  But it wasn't until I was desperate for God to heal my body that I realized at the moment that Jesus touched a blind man, he didn't receive his sight.  You see, he had to walk by faith and not by sight.  And nowhere in the Bible do we read how long it took the blind man to go from the temple gate where Jesus was to the pool.  But commentaries have said that the closest pool from the temple gate where Jesus would have been and these miracles would have taken place was a half of a mile or longer.  And so we know that the blind man walked by faith and not by sight.  And so it became my theme in 2011 when I walked into this holistic clinic.  I didn't get healed instantly.  It's been a process for me over the past eight years of regaining and taking back everything that had been taken from me.  But I stand here eight years later 100% well and no longer medically dependent.  I can take normal showers.  I'm the only one in my family that still has 20-20 vision.  And I'm holding on to that.  Age is starting to catch up.  But I no longer have ulcers in the large bowel, the small bowel.  I'm just walking in complete health and wholeness.  The amazing part of that is all those years I developed such anxiety and forms of depression, but most anxiety stage fright because the medicines were just weighing so heavy on me.  I was so fatigued all the time.  And now in the past eight years, I've just been walking in.  this whole new liberation and freedom of this is what life is all about.  And I'm really living life for the first time. ",
