I have pity.  You will miss the live reaction to the most hotly anticipated debate possibly in American history.  I mean, I can't think of a debate that I was more hyped for in my fucking life.  Whatever happens is going to be insane.  You could watch it.  You go to CNN and watch it.  You go to wherever they're doing it and watch it.  Fall asleep to it.  Or.  You could, for the low sum of five fucking dollars a month, become a real human being.  For the first time in your life, you won't be a slug crawling on your belly, barely scraping by in the biological order.  You will be feasting with your brothers and your sisters in Valhalla.  And all you've got to do is sign up for the Patreon.  Come tonight.  Come watch us cover this crazy shit.  Who the fuck knows what's going to happen?  Trump might shit his pants.  What's going to be funnier?  What's going to be funnier, I ask you?  You watching that alone and going, or you watching that while we're all here going, Trump shit his pants.  Think about it.  Become a patron.  Or continue belly crawling through the primordial slime that birthed you? ",
