And he's like, yeah, I'm doing okay.  I'm like, awesome.  Hey, when you come back, make sure to mention I sent you a DM, all right?  I need to, like, build my streamer cred.  Thank you, XQC.  I appreciate it.  Oh, did Maya raid me?  Thanks for the raid.  Hey, I think your statement was really dumb, but I think your animal stuff is really cool.  Gave up the great work.  I support you and all your podcasting people.  God damn it.  I feel like... I feel like... I don't like... Well, I like being in the spotlight to some extent, but I don't feel like I'm like fucking hogging everything or it's like crazy, okay?  So I feel like every single thing I say is gonna get clipped.  So I'm trying to just play Minecraft tonight, okay?  We need to step aside.  There's a lot of shit going on, okay?  So here's my thought process.  when something like this leaks, okay?  I'll read my statement real quick, okay?  Are y'all watching this cringe?  What kind of 30-something-year-old covers statements via screenshots of text?  Okay.  Man, fuck.  Every time I say something mean about Miz, Miz gets really mad.  Miz is probably one of the most drama farmers on Twitch.  Miz's whole explosive growth on LSF was all being a drama frog.  I don't understand this statement.  It's a very weird statement to make when you're dating, like, the living embodiment of covering other people's drama on LSF.  It's a very, very, very weird criticism for her to levy.  It's possible, though, that maybe she's mad at Mizgif for stuff like that, too, I guess.  Yeah, like, Mizgif and friends were literally making fun of Novaru for doing porn when she was 18, like, on stream and, like, having a laugh about it while she's, like, crying about it.  It's very interesting that Maya is so against this type of content, but I don't know.  I don't really give a fuck that much.  I mean, the realistic explanation is it's easier to attack people that you aren't dating, so whatever.  Why isn't Fed doing this?  So Destiny's reading it all.  Did he get permission from Fed?  I hate the streaming world, dude.  Like, we're all fucking reality stars.  They didn't pay me.  The rate has been canceled.  Did you guys read this thread?  Damn, Destiny's so dumb and Elle's so dumb.  It's not even a hate thread.  Okay, yeah.  The thing that I'm thinking is that this thread was DMed to multiple streamers, meaning that it's only a matter of time before losers like Keemstar are going to be covering this shit on their stream or their YouTube chat, right?  It's going to happen.  I personally... And you can disagree, that's fine.  I personally think that I have a relatively unbiased way of reading this compared to some of either the insane incels on the internet or the insane all-women-are-queens people on the internet.  I think I read things in a fairly unbiased manner.  I don't really have a horse in the race.  I can read it, say, this is what I think is wrong, this is what I think is right.  I would rather be the first one to publicly cover something like this and do it by reading the entire document than having the first word on this be somebody like Kingstar, which is what's going to happen.  Um, so yeah, I mean, once it's already leaked, I could keep my mouth shut.  Like once other people are talking about it, of course I'm going to talk about it too.  Right.  Because everybody's going to throw their two cents in here, whether you like it or not, that's what's going to happen.  I'd rather be like the person that covers it first.  Cause I can read through the whole thing and then give my, um, you know, feedback on things.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Destiny Bullshit.  Are you not mad at Offline TV for not supporting Lily after her first twit longer?  I've had problems with Lily's... Not Lily.  I don't usually have problems with Lily ever.  I've had problems with Lily TV in the past, but I don't hate any of them.  Like, I'm cool with most of the Offline TV people.  Or all of the Offline TV people, I think.  I don't usually hold grudges like that.  People fuck up sometimes, and I get mad over it, but I don't hold grudges over anybody.  Please acknowledge that you benefit and that you enjoy it as well.  Not judging, just say it before they do.  Why the fuck would I say it before they do?  Of course I benefit from it.  And of course covering drama is fun.  Anybody that denies either of those two things is stupid as fuck.  But that's not really relevant here, right?  Is that not what Keemstar would say?  Linus, do you really think that Keemstar is going to cover this the same way that I would?  I think Maya doesn't like you because of the stuff that you said about them on Reckful's death or something.  Um, I'll always stand by shit like that.  That's just a fact of the matter.  You will never have more friends in your life than the day you commit suicide because every single person will take to social media and reveal that they were actually your best friend.  It's cringe as fuck.  I know a lot of people that talk shit about him privately.  quite a bit that came out and they were apparently his best fucking friend probably.  But I don't give a fuck about that.  Who cares?  If you're actually friends with him, why the fuck do you care what some loser like me says, right?  Take it.  Let's do whatever.  I don't remember what I said about Maya or Miskif specifically.  I don't think Maya or Miskif didn't like Wreckful.  I don't even remember talking shit about them related to that, did I?  I don't think I did.  But I have no idea what I even would have said related to that.  This is how Keemstar decided to cover the breaking story. ",
