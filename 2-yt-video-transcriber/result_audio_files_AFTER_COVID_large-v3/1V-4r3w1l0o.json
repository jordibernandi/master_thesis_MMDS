            "text": "All right, goblins.  All right, goblins?  I'm just trying to think of a new catchphrase for you.  Hey, everyone.  All right, goblins.  All right, goblins.  That's the fucking great stuff.  So, number one on my list of worst things about living together is... Because you try to film a video and your girlfriend just suggests that you say alright goblins to everyone.  How was I to know you were filming a video?  Because I said I'm going to film a video and then I sat down here in front of the camera.  What if someone steals it before I film my next video?  It's too bad.  You have to make your next video very quickly.  That's fair.  All the biggest YouTubers are watching this and gonna steal All Right Goblins.  Real intro.  Hey everyone, I'm Riley.  Today I'm gonna be talking about some of the best and worst parts of living together with my beautiful girlfriend who's off screen.  Say hello, Fiona.  All Right Goblins.  She's busy with work.  so she can't be in my video, but I'm still gonna bother her because we're in a studio apartment and there's always so far away from her I could get, so you're in this video whether you like it or not.  Woo!  So I've made a list of some of the best and worst parts of living together, um, sapphic edition, women who like women edition, queer edition, I don't know, something like that.  So like half of this video is gonna be really cheesy, gross, mushy stuff, and the other half is just gonna be me roasting Fiona, so... But before we hop into that, I want to tell you about this video's sponsor, the Dollar Shave Club.  So this is the Ultimate Shave Starter Set that they sent me.  And inside it basically has everything that you could need for shaving.  You've got this handle, which is really great and sturdy and heavy.  And this starter set comes with two of the razors and the restock box ships with four of them.  But they've got really high quality blades and they feel super good against your skin.  but genuinely like i love these razors so much um i have a bunch of them with us.  we're in vietnam right now traveling and they're the only razors that i've brought.  they're the only ones that i've used.  they're super great like they just feel so good against your skin and i just love them a lot.  but i also use them and they're really good.  yeah she uses them because she steals all of mine.  you could at least when you're done rinse them off and get the hair out of them.  Yeah, that's pretty gross of me, won't lie.  Yeah?  I use them regularly, and I suck at cleaning them, and they're still really good, and I still go back to them.  That's fair.  The Ultimate Shave Starter Set also comes with the Post Shave Dew, the Shave Butter, a Prep Scrub, and Post Shave Cream, so you've really got everything you could possibly need for shaving stuff here.  And Dollar Shave Club also does a ton of other stuff, like toothbrushes and deodorant and all sorts of, like, grooming and shower care type stuff.

Okay, so I am going to start off with one of the worst things just because I'm currently sitting in it right now, which is that there is hair everywhere.  There's so much hair because we both have long hair and we have like a white tile kind of floor.  And it's just every day.  there's like piles and piles of hair on the ground.  And I'm currently like sat in it.  And if I move anywhere, there's like 500 hairs hanging from everything.  honestly gross.  it's pretty gross.  i don't know why you're with that now.  anyone who watches like a minute of the video is gonna know.  i think it's relatable.  anyone who has long hair has to know how much it like sheds as much as you.  i do shed an impressive amount like most of the hair i think is mine yes But it's definitely compounded by the fact that it's both of us.  There's a lot of hair.  So if you have long hair and your partner also has long hair and you try living together, you're going to be constantly picking up clumps of hair from the ground and sweeping it.  It's only happening here because it's all tiled.  Yeah in our last place we had like darker floors and parts that were like carpeted or had rugs or whatever and we did not clean it as much.  and now I'm kind of grossed out thinking about how much hair was just there that we didn't see.  Because here it's just so visible because it's like light tiles and stuff.  I'm okay without grossness.  okay but one of the the best things.  this is really cheesy but it's so nice to just wake up and have some cuddles every morning like you don't you?  you know?  it's just.  it's right there.  you wake up you get a little cuddle it's great.  yeah the cuddle is right there you just you wake up you're all sleepy you just.  it's so nice like you.  don't get that when we're long distance because we were long distance for a couple years and it was just lots of no cuddles.  It was really cute.  It was really cute.  It's really nice.  It's a good thing.  Okay, so one of the best things is also kind of a drag at Fiona.  Well, because for you, you have someone who does the dishes and the laundry and hangs up your towel.  I imagine it's really nice.  It's like... have your laundry get done and you can just kind of take a shower and throw your towel wherever and it just gets hung up and dries nice and perfectly.  if you're living with someone who cleans up all of your stuff.  that's the best part is it not?  is it not nice?  This is a nice one and a drag.  That's just a drag.  It's a nice one for you.  It's the best part of, is it not the best part of living together?  She knows I'm right.  If you're broke and you're in a studio apartment, you just don't really have a private space.  We're always up in each other's business.  You're super well off and you have like a five bedroom apartment and you can just go hide somewhere else and like have your own area.  That's cool.  but we're mostly in studio apartments as we're traveling.  And it's just, it's tough to not have your own space.  Like if one of you is listening to something, the other one's listening to it too.  Like if you want to have a phone call, the other person's there for it.  You're just always kind of involved in each other's stuff.  No more secrets.  No more secret life for you.  Yep, because we both had really involved secret lives before this.  One of the best things is you always have someone to play Mario Kart with, or, I don't know, whatever other game people play in their lives, but for us, it's always Mario Kart.  It's just, I don't know, if you're feeling tired at the end of the day, if you just want to have a little thing to do, you get to play Mario Kart at the end of the day, and it's really nice.  I like it.  That's, like, that code word set me up.  I want to play Kart now.  Now you want to play Mario Kart.  I'm like, how long does this video get to take?  We can play after my video, if you want.  No.  No?  So long.  it is really nice to like like.  i like playing games on my own but there's something different with like being able to just sit down with my girlfriend at the end of the day and play a little mario kart and like chat about our days but also have fun playing a game.  it's really nice.  oh one of the worst things but i think this is us specific is that i want the temperature inside to be like hot all the time and fiona always wants it to be super cold and i like it to be quiet and she likes it to be really loud like she's always playing a tv show or music or something and so we just have very conflicting ideas of what our space should be.  We always say that I want a loud ice cave and you want a silent sauna.  A silent sauna.  It would be nice.  Yeah.  So we have to kind of, we've like made arrangements about like when someone has to wear headphones and like we'll have one area of the room like colder and one warmer if we can.  Like if there's like an air conditioning or a fan or whatever.  Or I can just put a goddamn jumper on.  I don't like to wear a million jumpers at my own home.  It's like 95 degrees out and I have to wear like a sweater and sweatpants in my own home.  One of the best parts is that you get to get pets together and start a little family.  And we haven't done that yet, but we plan to get so many cats and dogs and I'm so excited.  We're gonna have so many adorable animals.  That's such a perk of living together that we haven't got to have yet, but I'm really excited for when we do.  One of the worst parts of living together for me, you're fine here, is that I get to wake up to Fiona's first 500 alarms every morning because she sets alarms like every 10 minutes for like an hour and then does not wake up for any of them.  So I wake up for all of them and then I get Fiona's attention.  I'm like babe your alarms are going off and she's like turn it off for me.  and just goes back to sleep and so for like hours.  sometimes I just keep waking up or I wake up at the first one and I can't go back to sleep.  you're fine you're snoozing through all this.  if your partner sets a million alarms and you're the only one who wakes up for it I'm sorry.  that's that's the worst part of living together.  yeah no rebuttal.  yeah no rebuttal.  this is very cheesy but one of the things i really like is having calm uneventful moments together because when we were long distance and we were together it was like we had to be doing stuff all the time because it was like you only have a week or two with this person.  but now i just really like.  i like when i don't know nothing's happening like we're just together and like eating breakfast together or just both chilling on our phones on the couch like it's just sweet like we just get to be together and like nothing's really happening but we're together.  i like it.  Thank you.  Okay, I've run out of worst parts, so another best part is that you always have someone to scratch your back or give you a massage when you need it.  True.  Yeah, that's some good shit.  I do, I'm gonna make the most of that.  Yeah, it's just, you need, you need, it's not the same to scratch your own back, and you can't really give yourself a massage, so it's a really nice perk of having someone around.  Okay, I've got a couple more best points, though.  This one is pretty specific to us, but it's really nice to have someone to, like, travel the world with.  I wouldn't be traveling through this many countries on my own for so long because I think I would get lonely, but because I have Fiona, I'm able to go to all these cool places and do a bunch of cool stuff.  yeah pretty dope.  and last one at night when we're not playing mario kart i have someone to watch shows with and like react to them and stuff.  because when i watch shows on my own it's not as entertaining for me to yell at the tv by myself but when fiona's there and i get to yell at the tv and get her reaction back and we get to talk about it it's really fun like we've been watching sherlock lately because i never saw it as it came out and it's really fun to talk about it and like i don't know just disgusting to re-watch shows with you because your reactions just You're so into it.  You always record my reactions and you don't need to.  I have amazing tips for you to put in the video.  No.  Literally, like, you cannot handle any kind of awkwardness.  Ah, there's so many awkward things.  Like, the show we were watching the other day, anytime a show has, like, people sitting around eating a meal and it's just silent and you just hear the clicking of their fork and knife and stuff, it's so awkward.  It's always like, oh, everyone here, there's such a tension in the room and they don't know what to talk about.  And it's, oh, why do they ever have scenes like that in shows?  They just shouldn't.  I think that's everything.  That's all the best and worst parts of living together that I could think of, although I'm sure there's like a million more that I just didn't think of.  Thanks for partially being in my video, Phi.  You're welcome.  In the comments, let me know if you live with your partner, what are some of the best and worst parts of living together?  And remember to go to dollarshave.com slash riley to get your Ultimate Shave Starter Set for $5.  Thanks so much for watching, and I'll see you next time.  Goodbye, goblins.  No.  Farewell, goblins.  You're right.  Farewell, goblins.  Stop. ",
