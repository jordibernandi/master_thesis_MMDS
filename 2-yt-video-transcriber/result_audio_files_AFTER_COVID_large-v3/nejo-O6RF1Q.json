            "text": "Please, President Trump, please, please, I hope you have a plan.  God, please save us.  All right, everyone, talk about the most massive fucking cock-sucking, disgusting bullshit you could possibly have from an incoming asterisk president.  We got to talk about Biden again.  But now he is president now.  He just got sworn in.  Wait and see.  Wait and see.  It literally just happened.  We heard the crowd cheer.  That doesn't mean he is the president.  That cannot happen.  Joe Biden is president right now.  You can admit that.  No, they stole it.  They're proclaiming it, but he's not the president.  He's not God's president.  But he's the president of the United States.  No.  Hello, this is Super Trump 2020.  I'm very, very sad right now.  My president has gone.  And now we're forced with a dictator.  This is so crazy.  I want to say Joe Biden will never be my president.  I'll never call him President Biden.  Joe Biden, you're a crook.  You're a thief.  You're a liar.  You friggin deserve to be arrested right now.  This is crazy.  Nothing's happening.  And this inauguration looks like what you would expect from a one party state.  This inauguration looks like the Chinese Olympics.  President Trump, if you see this, please save us.  I don't even see our American flag anymore.  Biden's talking with some kind of crazy flag.  This is America.  This is our land.  Please, President Trump.  Please, please, I hope you have a plan.  God, please save us.  Save us from the devil, please.  Y'all about to have a panic attack.  This is our country, our country.  This is awful.  God, please save us, please.  Well, this is that moment when all the, uh, Trump supporters that had faith, or at least said they had faith are, uh, drowning in their tears right now.  But, uh, those who still have actual faith are relaxed, calm, chilling, because they know that there's nothing that can stop what's coming.  Let me tell you, people Biden is never going to be.  the president of our country.  Just because he just swore in does not make him officially.  There are documents that have to be signed first.  All this means right now is that there is no acting president because the transfer of power is in the midst and taking place right now.  Right now the military is in control.  Just sit back and watch and be patient.  For those of you who've been on my most recent videos trying to spew hate and tell me that you're reporting me to the FBI.  Excuse me if I don't fucking care.  I wasn't going to make a video, but I feel for the safety of myself and my family considering the fact that Secret Service has come in and interrogated my entire family the last two days and they are looking for my whereabouts.  I have no reason not to comply with you, however.  I'm not meeting you anywhere.  I'm not guilty of anything.  And for those of you who have reached out to my local and state police to start this nonsense to begin with, I know exactly who you are.  And trust me, I will be giving names out.  Yesterday, Joe Biden was inaugurated.  I don't know if anyone watched it.  I didn't, but I'm told it happened.  And so I believe it because I'm actually I'm trying to adjust my behavior to prepare myself for the next few years by just believing everything that the screen people tell me.  So screen people say Joe Biden's president.  Hell, yeah.  I salute President Dementia.  And I'm going to tell you something else.  You're a Nazi and you're brainwashed by MKUltra.  This election was a fraud.  If you're a Republican or if you're a Trump supporter, you need to not put up with this shit.  Donald Trump is our president.  And if you're one of the leftist idiots that did this shit, goddamn you bastards.  Who the hell do you goddamn think you are?  Fuck you.  President Trump!  If you see this, please save us. ",
