The President, just days after having this discussion with Bob Woodward, said this from this podium.  On March 30th, he said, I do want them to stay calm.  We are doing a great job.  If you look at the individual statements, they're all true.  Stay calm.  It will go away, but it's important to stay calm.  So this president does what leaders do, good leaders.  It's stay calm and resolute at a time when you face an insurmountable challenge.  That's what this president has done.  It will not appear that the president lied to the American public about the threat posed by COVID.  The president has never lied to the American public on COVID.  The president's been very.  the president was expressing calm and his actions reflect that.
