It depends on the runoffs in Georgia.  Am I crazier as this dude or real life Carlton from Fresh Prince?  So we won't know until January.  Why aren't they letting these Democrats do this?  And then even then, even then, Donald Trump set the precedent of having cabinet members that weren't official cabinet members.  So Joe Biden can have whoever he wants in the cabinet.  It doesn't matter what the Republicans say.  He can literally just do that.  It's already a thing that's been done.  That's why Donald Trump had never filled any of his cabinet positions, really.  The precedent is already there.  I was never anxious, but I was livid with the Dems for losing seats in the fucking House.  Um... Yeah, I mean, so there was a combination of things where people voted against Donald Trump, not necessarily for their particular Democrats.  They ran some pretty bad Senate people, though, let's be fair.  Some of the Senate races that they, like, the candidates they had were not very energetic individuals.
