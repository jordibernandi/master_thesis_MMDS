            "text": "shalom family.  welcome to a tail nugget.  title of this is weda a judah judah.  does it mean the kingdom of the jews?  welcome to a tail nugget.  does weda a judah judah mean the biblical tribe of judah?  answer yes slave coast.  now.  many of you have probably seen this map dealing with the slave coast in africa.  here we see it says kingdom of judah okay kingdom of judah or weda slave coast weda.  now some people will say it does not mean judah that we're playing with the words That we're stretching it to mean the tribe of Judah.  And they state that we have no proof of such a claim.  Is that really the case?  Who's being deceptive?  That's the question.  Slavery in the kingdom of Judah.  This is one of the areas slaves or Jews were taken from that were sent into slavery around the world as prophesied they would.  From the slave coast in the kingdom of Judah where there were Jews.  Washington Post, Weta and Beneath.  Less than a mile from what was once West Africa's biggest slave port, The departure point for more than a million people in chains stands a statue of Francisco Felix de Souza, a man regarded as the father of this city.  There's a museum devoted to his family and a plaza in his name.  Every few decades, his descendants proudly bestow his nickname, Choc-Choc-Choc, of a de Souza who has appointed the clan's new patriarch.  But there's one part of the D'Souza legacy that is seldom addressed.  After arriving here in the late 1700s from Brazil, then a Portuguese colony, he became one of the biggest slave merchants in the history of the transatlantic slave trade.  So, family, you know, if you want to get into more about what happened during this time, right, you have to go back to some of our other teachings like Jews in Europe.  that talks about our people being in Portugal, being in Spain, and being sent to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Angola, things like that.  So this just validates, okay, what we've taught you in the past, that the Jews who were sent to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, sent to Angola, sent to the slave coast, they were black Jews.  Many call them Africans today.  Now, some people are going to tell you that.  Weta, Judah, a Judah does not mean the tribe of Judah and that we're playing on words.  Well, let's see what other people thought.  Right.  Let's see what they thought during the time of this captivity.  Let's see what the scholars of the 1890s thought about the word Weta, whether or not it represents it.  the tribes of Judah from Israel.  Primary evidence for WIDA being Judah.  Societe, La Guinseigne, Geographie, Bulletin, Montpelier.  The date of this book is 1890.  This French book states, WIDA, FIDA, a WIDA, WIDA, Judah, or a Judah, is an old city frequented since the 16th century by the Portuguese slavers who gave it its name.  Its inhabitants were said to be Judaic, and they were indeed considered as a remnant of the scattered tribes of Israel.  Okay, so here's one source that says that Weta represented the scattered tribes of Israel.  So if someone tells you it's not, you can tell them, well, I have a source that says otherwise.  More evidence from Elise Recluse.  His book is called The Earth and Its Inhabitants, The Universal Geography Northeast Africa.  Elise Recluse states about Weta, also known as Ajuda or Judah, known to Europeans by various names of Feta, Harita, Weta, Weta.  The old writers called it Judah and its inhabitants were said to be okay.  that's two sources okay.  so i'm like the ones who say we're incorrect.  are they lying to you?  i'm giving you the evidence you can go look it up yourself.  ronald john phd.  the seventh feast of israel and the messiah second edition Memoirs of the Reign of Basa Ahadi.  In a 1790 edition of the Memoirs of the Reign of Basa Ahadi, King of Dahomey by Robert Norris, a map was portrayed, which was a direct eyewitness account by the English and French.  On the map, they designated the town of Ouida as the country of the Jews.  The town is called Judah or Ouida.  The Portuguese call this town a Judah.  The people today in this town still pronounce their town in their native tongue as Judah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  A direct eyewitness states that Weta, Judah, a Judah, a country of Jews.  But Weta don't mean Jews.  We're wrong.  Or is somebody else lying?  Is someone else trying to deceive?  I wonder.  It's really sad.  Conclusion.  If anyone tries to tell you that Weta or Judah, Judah in West Africa does not mean they are of the tribes of Israel, you can use this evidence to prove them wrong.
