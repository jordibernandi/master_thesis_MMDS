He died at the age of 94, but he was a delightful soul, wonderful man, a great, great thinker.  And my library is just full of his books, all of which are gigantic accomplishments, I can tell you.  But Martin Gardner, as rational as he was, I think about three or four years before he died, he told me on a phone conversation, he said, but you should know, Randy, that I'm a deist.  And I sort of stopped on the phone.  I said, I heard that, but I didn't know whether to believe it or not.  Now, a deist is a different thing from a religious person.  A deist, he explained it.  He tried to explain it to me.  He said, a deist is somebody who believes that there is some overarching... overpowering force that brought all this into existence and that has some sort of influence and is in the background.  And I said, Martin, do you have any evidence for that at all?  And he said, no, I freely admit it.  You've got all the evidence on your side, Randy.  I don't have any evidence whatsoever.  And I said, well, why do you believe it then?  And he answered me, now, this is charming and it's typically Martin.  He says, because frankly, it makes me feel better about myself.  That's all I need, guys.  I don't need him to give me some big philosophical thing and quote all the famous philosophers of time.  I don't need that.  If it made Martin Gardner feel a little more secure, and he realized he was reaching the end of his life, and I accepted it with a certain amount of, a little twinge of, oh boy, I wish he hadn't said that kind of thing.  But nonetheless, it was my good friend Martin, And bless them.  I have great memories of them. ",
