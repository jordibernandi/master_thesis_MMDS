I'm going to enjoy watching every single second of this.  Initiate sequence one.  Victor 6, this is Victor 7, two miles out from your location.  Victor Six and Victor Seven, coming in hot!  Oh, they're... they're the slow zombies.  That was stupid.  Guys?  Come on!  Great.  We're ourselves done.  Got it.  RCX-D, deploy.  Heal on me!  Latch man!  Charlie team, sitrep.  Charlie team's good.  So we know an axe will go through a zombie skull, but now I want to see how many zombie skulls will a 50 cal go through?  Everybody good?  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Jared?  Jared?  Jared, you good?  He's turned!  We gotta put this fatty down!  No, no!  Jared!  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!  I'm not turning!  I'm just sick!  From what?

We can't do that.  Send it in now.  Victor 7, this is Command.  Negative on exfil.  It's coming.  Say again?  Say again, what's on the way?  Hey, they denied ex-phil.  They said something's on the way.  What's on the way?  Touch it!  Everyone stop it!  Enough with the violence!  Can't we be grown-ups about this and realize that our differences are what make us special?  It's not about what's on here.  It's about what's in here.  Or here.  Here or... Let's be honest, I don't know Predator anatomy, but the point is, it is about love.  Not hate.  Fuck this!  I have an idea.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Great idea.  Also, who got their spine ripped out?  Oh, God, guys, come on!  Run!  Go!  Get to the trees!  One more time?  Get to the cover!  Super close, so like the rotary asset vehicle?  Eli, get the fuck out of here!  Get to the chopper.  That idiot dead yet?  Sir, you're going to have to see this.  Did you ever look up at the stars and think that we're not alone in the universe?  You're an alien!  You're pretty cool, dude.  Space weed is freaking crazy!  You're my best friend, you're my best friend.  You're my best friend I've ever had.  You're my best friend, you're my best friend.  You're my best friend I've ever had.  Everywhere I go.  I want you with me.  Everything I do.  I want you by my side.  You lift me up, you supersize me.  A planet of friendship that will never die.  Tell those idiots to get back to base.  Now.  Roger, sir.  I'll be at B-site.  Thanks for watching, guys.
