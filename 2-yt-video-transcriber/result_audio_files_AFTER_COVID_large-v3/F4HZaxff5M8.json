And I poke at him a lot.  And so his video, exactly what I didn't want to happen, happened on election night.  So let's see about Dave's cope.  I'm very excited.  I'm very excited about this.

It seems to me, according to our math here at Corncob headquarters, it seems... I'm just getting a report now.  Donald Trump has lost the election.  Joe Biden has won it.  Yes, confirming that, confirming that again, Joe Biden has beaten Donald Trump.  Joe Biden, who everyone agrees was kind of a soft candidate coming into this race, kind of a soft candidate.  Not a lot of people excited about Joe Biden, but a lot of people just don't fucking like Donald Trump.  And look at what happened.  Imagine if they ran someone that was even more likable and progressive than Joe Biden.  Imagine, I can't believe that Donald Trump thought he could beat someone that was just not shitty.  like Hillary Clinton.  And even, like, he's still a little shitty.  He's just not shitty like Hillary Clinton, right?  Imagine.  Imagine such a thing.  If the Republican Party continues to triple down on this Donald Trump stuff, we're still going to have to deal with them.  They're still going to win elections in the heartland of America.  But I don't think we've got to worry about presidencies if people still show out and stop being complacent.  They lose the popular vote every time.  We need to get rid of the Electoral College.  If we get rid of the Electoral College, Republicans won't win a presidency for fucking 20 years, minimum.  Minimum.  That's not even right.  Let's call it 16... Yeah, let's call it 24 years.
