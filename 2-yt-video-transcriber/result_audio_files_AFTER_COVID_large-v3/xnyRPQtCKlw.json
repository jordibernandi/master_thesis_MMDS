We have a pressure gradient.  That means at some point above us the pressure gets so low it's considered a vacuum and that's space.  Look at this video from Red's rhetoric.  In this video as the rocket increases in altitude you can see the gases expelling from the bottom of the rocket being illuminated by the Sun as the rocket gets higher and higher.  You can see these gases expanding as they leave the rocket more and more until it gets to a point where the gases are expanding so much.  you can barely see it.
