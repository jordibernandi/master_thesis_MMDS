I'm commuting and, you know, taking the bus to University City and back, you know, a couple of days a week.  And I'm just consuming Eagles podcast.  And there was just a different energy in the city that year.  when the Eagles are good in general, the vibe, the atmosphere changed.  is just not what it usually is.  People just literally seem happier because they are.  And that year, obviously, I didn't win the Super Bowl, but it was one of those things where fans could tell that season from just a couple of weeks into the season, I would say from about week three on, that there was just something special, something different about that team, different that season.  And, you know, I'm kind of Getting my shit together, getting my degree finally.  You know, going to games every Sunday down to Link.  I'm partying in the parking lot before the game, tailgating.  I go in the game and it's an easy win.  So it feels like, you know, all that anxiety and worry that's usually a part of every Eagles game and so synonymous with my fandom overall.  This gnawing feeling that, you know, the floor is about to fall out on you or you're going to get bopped in the face at the last second doesn't really happen that season.  until in December, the Eagles look like the best team in the NFL.

The Rams are also very, very good that season in this big game in Los Angeles at the Classic Coliseum.  I was at the time, given my own personal slant, looking for a new job upon my December graduation.  And I'm just applying, throwing feelers out to a million different places.  And I applied for this job in LA.  I don't even know what... I couldn't even tell you what the job was really at this point.  It was just a nonsense startup company, digital startup company job.  And I'm having this phone call conversation with them.  And I'm just like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just like trying to get to the next stage.  You know what I mean?  Try to leave an impression.  They were like, well, we'd like to see how people are in person before we hire them.  We see how they are in the workforce.  Would you want to come to L.A.  and like work for us as like a work trial for a week before we extend you an offer?  I'm like, Newsflash, I live in like fucking Philadelphia.  How am I going to do that?  And they're like, we'll literally pay for you to fly here for your stay at an Airbnb and give you a per diem if you want to come here.  And I was like, all right.  Like it was like the week between, you know, the last week of classes and finals.  I was like, fuck it, I'll do this.  And they were like, well, you would start this Monday.  We could fly you in Monday morning.  And I'm like, hmm.  I look at the calendar.  That's Sunday.  The Eagles are playing in Los Angeles.  So I say, hey, would it be possible if you fly me out on Sunday morning instead?  Just so I have a day to adjust to the time zone change.  Yeah, sure.  So I fly from.  I get like a 6 a.m.  flight from Philly and I have it.  I have a layover in Chicago, so I'm nervous about delays and all this thing.  So as soon as my plane is taking off from Chicago, I buy a ticket to the Eagles game from my phone.  And as soon as I land, I go and throw my crap into this unbelievably nice, too nice for me for a dumbass 23 year old Airbnb in beautiful Santa Monica, California.  Hopping an Uber to the Coliseum.  I go there.  I get this big, you know, 30 ounce Bud Light.  I walked in my seat.  The weather's beautiful.  There are Eagles fans all over.  I'm in one of the most famous sports stadiums in the entire world.  And I just, you know, I'm about to get my degree.  And I feel like I am literally, you know, have the world by its balls.  And just shortly into the game, Carson Wentz, who again had been this savior figurehead in Philadelphia, they had just drafted him with one of the top choices in the NFL draft the previous year, looked like the most valuable player, like he would win the league's most valuable player award that season, suffers a gruesome injury of his own and tears his ACL.  I walked up to the stand, the Eagles still won, they clinched the division, they were going to go to the postseason.  But I had... gone all over across the country to see the Eagles at this moment, I thought would be their pinnacle to that point in the season.  And it was just this crushing defeat that felt like the end of what we all assumed was going to be the best season of our lives.  obviously didn't get that job.  thank god i i like where my life's at now.  so i come back to philly.  i work.  i worked.  i worked for them for a week.  they gave me like a hundred dollars every day.  i was just like going out to eat at these like phenomenal mexican restaurants at night you know getting a nice eight hours of sleep in this beautiful airbnb.  it was like a mini vacation that i you know.  i had to go sit in this workstation for for seven hours a day just checking emails doing nothing didn't get offered a job.  come back to Philly and Nick Foles who had left a few years back had some success under Chip Kelly.  that offseason had been signed to be the backup quarterback to Carson Wentz the prodigal son had come home.  he comes in as Wentz's backup gets him to the playoffs and then once the playoffs start he turns into Tom Brady.  he's better than we even thought Wentz was for that short period of time Three years ago.  today, we're recording this.  The Eagles made the NFC Championship game.  The game for so many years of my life had been a day of worry, knowing that the Eagles were inevitably going to lose this game.  And I'm there.  And they absolutely fucking bone crush the Minnesota Vikings by a score of 30 to 7.  Goal.  Roll into the Super Bowl. ",

The NFC Championship game was like the biggest 70,000-person party I've ever been at.  They just like... There were no rules.  I walked home from the stadium, was walking down Broad Street, walked back to my house in South... I was told from my parents, my parents' house in South Philly.  And it was just one of those things like, what more could you ask for?  And then the following two weeks later, they won the whole thing.  The city goes wild.  It's amazing.  They have a victory parade that we always talk about for years in Philadelphia.  I just want to see the Super Bowl parade.  I would, you know, bullshit.  my friends like, oh, what are you going to do when the Eagles win the Super Bowl?  My friend was like, oh, I'm going to take my car and I'm going to like leave the keys in the middle of the car.  And I'm going to like throw beers out from the trunk and tell people to beat the shit out of my car.  And I'm going to collect a bunch of insurance money.  I'm like.  that's that's insurance fraud and i'm like he's like i'm gonna do it.  and then i meet this friend on broad street the night they went and he just like i go up i give him a huge bear hug like i don't even say anything to him.  he goes dude cop said in a at 2 a.m.  i can move my car here and i don't know what happened after that.  but i think you really want to think.  like had been saying that for years like not just a one-time thing.  that was his.  that was what was going to happen.
