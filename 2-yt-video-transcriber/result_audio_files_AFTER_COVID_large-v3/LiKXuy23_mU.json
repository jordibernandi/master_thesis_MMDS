            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Thanks for joining me.  Quick video today.  We're going to cover some of the developments that have manifested over the past week with the states pushing back against the overreaches, again, of the federal government committed, of course, at the hands of a Democrat-controlled national federal government.  So for those of you who paid attention in the live streams on Wednesday and then last Sunday, we talked about the eventuality that the states would push back against the feds on two key things.  Second Amendment issues and immigration.  And what we've seen this past week is particularly Texas.  Texas is pushing back.  In this week, we have seen, I believe it was today, that the Texas Attorney General has filed suit basically regarding immigration issues.  The feds have said that they were not going to do what's actually in the purview of the federal government, which is to actually police and protect and defend the national borders.  When you have sponsorship for massive illegal swells coming into the United States from the south of the border, and the feds are not only ignoring their responsibility but now are completely turning it on its head and inviting and sponsoring and supporting people to come in and flood the borders, A, they're violating what actually they're supposed to be doing, and then B, they're overreaching and doing what they shouldn't be doing.  So the Texas Attorney General, I understand, is basically moving forward to put a stop to what the feds are doing, which is to neutralize the proper enforcement of the laws and the powers which they are supposed to have under the Constitution.  And they're doing this, make no mistake, they're doing this for a very specific purpose.  AOC decided to flap her trap like she always does.  Who listens to that blustering bag of wind?  I don't know, but apparently her constituents do in the crap hole of New York City.  She said last week that the southern states and red states needed to be liberated.  And I mentioned this in the live stream, but I'll say it now in this shorter format.  When you hear a devout Marxist and communist element like AOC spout the term liberated, you need to understand where she's coming from and the political underpinning and ideology from which she is forming her vernacular.  Liberated in the mind of a communist means liberated.  invaded, occupied, and subjugated.  If you need any proof for this, look at the way the USSR handled the republics which formed the old Russian republics.  They invaded them under the pretext of liberating them, then subjugated and occupied them, destroyed local cultures, made everybody speak Russian.  I mean, this is what they want to do.  So when AOC and her ilk in the are talking about liberating the southern states and red states.  What they are trying to go for is flooding the southern states and the red states with massive waves of illegal immigrants who they then shove into the larger urban areas and get them on the Democratic voter rolls.  Because overwhelmingly, first generation immigrants in the United States do not vote politically conservative.  They vote leftist and they vote with the Democrat Party.  Fact.  So when you've got leadership in the Democrat Party talking about this, and then you have the machine of the federal government now stepping back from the proper and lawful exercising of granted constitutional political powers, it is within the fiduciary interest of the government of the state of Texas to assert its rights and to push back against the feds.  So mad props to the attorney general of Texas today in doing his job and pushing back against the feds.  The next point that I want to bring up is the Second Amendment.  And we have seen this week that Texas Governor Abbott advocated for the state of Texas becoming a de facto Second Amendment sanctuary state.  This is the tip of the iceberg, I think, on this one.  Because as we have seen, that first-time gun ownership is through the roof right now in the United States.  First time ownership of firearms by people who maybe have grown up around firearms, but never felt the push to actually own them.  This is a very real fact in the calculus of the political agenda that the left is trying to work on right now.  When you have Biden talking about in February, was it last year?  Yeah, February of last year, that he wants to push for an assault weapons ban, that he wants to push for magazine restrictions and limitations.  They're doing this for a very, very real point, and that is whenever regimes, totalitarian regimes, come into power, the first thing that they do, we all know this, is to disarm their subjects, their prey, their fodder, to soften them up for the slaughter so that they have no effectual means of resistance physically against the onslaught of tyrannical overreach.  Texas, of course, Governor Abbott talking about Texas becoming a Second Amendment sanctuary state.  This is just the beginning, and I submit to you that more states are going to rapidly file in.  Now this brings us to the point of what you can practically do.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  I believe personally that the covering, the hedge, has been removed spiritually from the United States.  Why I think this is, I'll tell you in no certain terms.  We have a lawless government right now, a government that does not recognize, A, natural law and the laws of nature and nature's God, and then B, when you have offered up an abomination of prayer like what we saw two weeks ago on the floor of the Capitol, the National Legislature, where you have a man and a woman and offering of prayers to a false God, not the God to which this nation was founded upon, and the laws of the God in which this nation was founded upon, that is the God of the Bible, that is a mockery.  That is an absolute mockery and spitting in the face of God.  Be not deceived.  God is not mocked.  For whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.  The nation itself has had, in my opinion, its covering removed.  So what that means is that we have a duty locally not only to pray up our areas and many of you have joined with me not only in fasting and prayer but also going into the boundaries, going to our state boundaries, county boundaries, city boundaries, the boundaries of your property and praying them up.  We also have a responsibility to work in the state legislatures and to work on our local level.  Now those of you who have maybe contacted your representatives before or you may have engaged with them in some way, you may be saying to yourself, oh, A, they won't listen to me, or, oh, B, they're good to go.  Let me mix this up a little bit and encourage you specifically to request face-to-face meetings with your local, particularly your state representatives and state senators.  Because for the good ones, for the good ones that are there that are pro-Constitution, they need to know that we have their backs.  And not only do they need to know that we have their backs, they need to know that the wind is in their sails to push back mightily against the tyrannical overreach of the federal government.  Furthermore, for those of them that are not so good to go, they need to come face to face with us and see we're not cool with what you're doing.  So in the words of Alejandro Ocasio-Cortez, we need to be keeping accountability in the back of our mind, right?  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  If you're going to have an elected representative like that entity in New York, call for the creation of lists and for keeping accountability roles of people who have voted a way that she didn't like, then I think it's logical to assume that the inverse would be suggestible.  That there needs to be a face-to-face interaction with people in a proper and respectful way.  A face-to-face interaction with representatives who are in our backyard so that they know and have to look into the face of their neighbors, the ones whose rights they want to sell away.  It is important at this point that we not only take back, so to speak, take back ownership and dominion of our local areas in prayer and in fasting and in going to the boundaries and speaking up that hedge and praying up that hedge, worshiping, whatever it is you want to do.  I know people may think that's stupid, but I don't care at this point.  Like seriously, the mockers, the scoffers, since when has their counsel proved true or their words proved sound and wise?  Never.  Never.  never.  People like that, they're lost to the annals of history.  The people of whom history is made, they're the movers, they're the shakers, they're the doers, they're the people who get up and go and make it happen.  So to follow out of what Texas is doing, I think that there's going to be probably within the next few weeks to a couple of months, you're going to see rapid succession of people that may have been a Freudian slip who are advocating for more solidification of the state's rights and reassertion of the powers of the states versus the federal government because the federal government is becoming the number one violator and abuser of the rights of the citizenry.  Change my mind, prove me wrong.  They are, they are, governments are, were, always will be the number one perpetrator of abuse and tyrannical overreach and ultimately genocide of the people who they're supposed to serve.  So the best thing that we can do right now, go to these places and pray, contact your local representatives, request face-to-face meetings with them, and share with them your concerns.  If they're good to go, let them know you've got their back.  Ask for them to push more.  Ask for them to submit better bills in the legislature to defend the rights of the people.  In the days to come, we're going to need it.  And if they're not good, then it's appropriate that they be able to look the person in the eye who they want to sell down the river, so to speak.
