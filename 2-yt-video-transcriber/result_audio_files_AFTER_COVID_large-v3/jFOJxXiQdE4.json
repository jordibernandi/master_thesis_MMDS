It won't.  But to be less of an excessively literal asshole about this, try not relying on your memory for this.

Oh, so the aliens don't project their images on the bird.  The bird is the projection of their image.  They project their image in the shape of a bird.  Could their image be projected in a different shape?  How many shapes can it be projected in?  Is there a limit to the number of shapes they can project their image as?  Because honestly, if they can project their image in the shape of anything, that kind of seems like it means nothing. ",

Gee, I wonder what those could be.  A few months back, I kept seeing sparkling white birds of small size and also large size.  They looked like they were made of glitter.  Also, these clouds have been prominent in Fresno, California.  And they just make you wonder so much because they are so strange.  Clouds in California?  That is strange.  The first thing I said was birds, then you clarified it.  It really look like faces are in them.  Okay, can somebody give me the dosage on how many mushrooms I have to eat to see the faces?  Wow, I finally do see something.  Do all pictures you take of birds have that white ring just around the outside of the bird?  Those are called sharpening halos, Terry.  They happen because of the sharpening algorithm in the camera, because what you're looking at is a goddamn digital photo, and not everything you see in it reflects reality, because it's a thing produced by a camera, not a perfect copy of reality.  These sharpening halos show up on the light side of crisp borders between dark and light areas in a photo, or video in this case.  And it's not just this commenter who thinks they mean something they don't mean.  I've seen this before, I'm not sure where these conspiracy videos all run together after a while, so can't really provide a source on that.  But I doubt most people watching this would be too surprised to see that.  Anyway, here's a video I took with my Huawei P20 Pro looking out my bathroom window while I was sitting on the toilet.  Don't judge me.  And you can see the exact same effect very clearly.  Something dark against the blue part of the sky is about the best case scenario for this.  Or I should say the worst case scenario, because obviously real photographers want to avoid digital flaws like this, but for people like you and me who are trying to make the most messed up images possible, possible in conspiracy theorists case because they think it demonstrates aliens or spirits or Whatever and in my case to demonstrate why it's not that it's the best case scenario.  You know why I'm so interested in this kind of stuff.  It's because it's so easy to figure out and I don't mean because that makes my videos easier to make although that does have its benefits he.  But no, I'm interested in it because of what the ease of figuring this stuff out says about the people who don't bother to.  I find this mental phenomenon fascinating.  Like, you could go to Google and type something like white edges around objects in digital photo, and it'd probably take you all of about five minutes to figure out the answer.  And then you could take your digital camera and test it out and it'd work.  Most likely, anyway.  But instead, these presumably adults are consciously making the decision to stay ignorant.  To believe really dumb things without giving a flying fuck if what they believe is true.  It's just disappointing how many people don't take responsibility for their own ongoing education in their lives.  Whatever, I'm not here to rant.  Good thing you said that.  I was starting to wonder, but now that you said it, it must be true.  That's enough comments. ",
