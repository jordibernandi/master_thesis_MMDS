            "text": "Dating today is trash, we've covered this, but dating as a black woman is complicated trash.  What is up, family?  It is T, the nappy-headed jojoba.  It's all about dating woes for two videos in a row as I get ready for an event that I'm about to go to a little bit later.  A lot of y'all, and I mean a lot, expressed interest in hearing my thoughts on the Pacific challenges that black women face when dating.  And over on my Patreon, I polled my patrons the other day to ask them to choose the topic for my next Tea Talk, and this is what won by a considerable margin.  So thank you to everyone who voted.  now here we are with back-to-back videos about dating.  if you missed my last video I explained my hypothesis as to why dating as a millennial and truthfully why dating in the age of dating apps and social media for any person really is trash.  and even within this trash experience there's definitely a special trash that I've experienced as a black woman.  Before I go any farther, let me just say that my real ones will already know I am never one to want to compete in the oppression Olympics.  That is not what this discussion is.  I probably had dog hair on my nose this entire time, but I just got it off.  Anyway, I don't think there's any value for anyone in crowning a particular group as the one who gets it the worst in any examination or discussion regarding marginalization.  That's just trying to win at losing.  Having said that, it's not debatable that black women have, historically and currently, not had it the best.  And I have a particular interest in shining a light on the challenges that Black women in particular face, as well as in empowering and unifying Black women.  I'll give you up to one guess as to why this is of interest to me.  Anyway, I say all the time, the only perspective that you can have is your own.  compassion lies in working to understand perspectives that are not your own.  So this is my perspective as a Black woman, which I hope will bring comfort to other Black women who share this perspective, as well as foster better understanding amongst those who do not share this perspective.  With videos like this, I often get whataboutisms in the comments, as well as people who just want to somehow invalidate my experience.  If that is you, congratulations.  At best, you will get no response from me whatsoever, and at worst, you're getting blocked today.  All right, let's get into this.  This Tea Talk is by no means an exhaustive exploration of this issue, but here is why dating as a black woman is complicated trash.  First off, if you do want to partner with a black man, we don't have an especially deep field.  Unfortunately, we don't have the time today for me to get too deep into issues like the 13th amendment, AKA slavery 2.0, or the fact that black men face the highest risk of being killed by use of police force.  And this risk peaks between ages 20 to 35, which is incidentally when most people are trying to partner.  as well as the issues of internalized racism and internalized anti-blackness.  Once we're past the black men who have been rendered ineligible bachelors by being dead or in jail, because there is truth to the cliche, we're then left to deal with the remaining eligible bachelors who often aren't even interested in black women, despite the fact that these men were almost definitely raised by their black-ass mama, their black-ass granny, their black-ass auntie, or their black-ass sister.  Trust and believe, this is a thing.  Black men who are color-struck, or to use the more modern term, colorist, and only want to date light-skinted women with good hair.  The black men who only date Latina women, I suppose because they're not willing to commit all the way to the bit of just straight-up dating a white woman.  And of course, that brings us to the undeniable prevalence of the wear-the-white-women attitude amongst oh-so-many black men.  I don't know if this preference, as so many of these men like to call it, is as pervasive with any other racial group.  Deadass, whenever I see a black man who interests me, I have to ask myself, but does he even like black women though?  I cannot express how bizarre it is that not only do I have to ask myself this about our own men, I have to ask it all the time.  I did a live recently where I told y'all that, for me, it's like gaydar, except for black men who only date white or otherwise non-black women.  And at this point, my beckydar is calibrated.  I rarely miss.  The other extreme on this spectrum are, of course, the hoteps, and that too, It's a no for me, dog.  This would not be a get ready with me if I didn't say lashes BRB.  Whilst I was doing my lashes, I was thinking to myself that there's probably a lot of you guys who are like, um, you didn't finish your eyeshadow.  I've been doing a lot of looks like this lately where I play with negative space and actually don't put anything on my eyelid except maybe a gloss.  I'm probably going to use my Infinity Glass by Linda Hallberg.  Still trying to say that correctly but Linda Hallberg to us Americans.  Anyway, I really enjoyed putting something colorful in the crease which you wouldn't normally do and then on my inner corner and then just leaving my lid bare or doing the glossy lid.  so that's what I'm doing today.  But with a glossy lid I always apply the gloss last because it shortens the life of your makeup overall.  so I might even do this just before I leave but maybe I'll do it at the end of the video just so you guys can actually see what it looks like on camera.  It's very similar to the look.  that I was wearing in my previous video.  I even used the same palette, which is my Spectral palette, I just used different shades.  Today I went turquoise, last time was more lilac-y.  So yeah, just letting y'all know, your girl, she's kooky!  Sometimes her makeup is kooky.  Back to dating.  As Black women, we can widen the field by dating outside of our race, of course.  But it must be noted that dating interracially comes with its own complications for us.  First up, being fetishized.  Much in the same way that the Cardassian family has built their entire brand on fetishizing black men to then insert themselves into our culture, black women are fetishized and hypersexualized almost as much as we're erased.  Invisible Woman got the whole world watching.  Real thing that happened to me.  I went out solo dolo a few Fridays ago because I was in the mood to dance and my friends were acting like old people.  I went to a spot that I go to all the time because I know the bouncer.  It's always nice when you have a connect wherever you are.  And actually, I also already told this story on a live just a couple weeks ago.  You know, you miss a live, you miss a lot.  So I'm not going to rehash this whole thing in great detail.  Out solo dolo, doing my thing, meet a group of people.  They seem cool.  except for one white man in this group who decides that he cannot go on with his evening without telling me that he slept with a black woman for the first time ever.  And this had happened just a few days prior.  This stranger felt that I really needed to have this information.  I don't think I need to unpack the several many really a lot of ways in which this guy is obviously severely crazy.  clearly he had this idea in the space where his brain should have been that there's something inherently different or kinky about intercourse with a black woman.  it's kinky to people like this man because it's still seen as forbidden or taboo or just because so many people automatically and always other black women.  but they think they're not racist because exoticizing black women is somehow complimenting us.  The unfortunate thing is, this guy and the encounter that I had with him, they are not unusual.  I cannot tell you guys how many instances in my life I've had non-black people, and I don't mean white people only.  I mean white people and non-black POC.  There's this weird desire to, I guess, earn points with black people, to seem down.  I'm not like those other white people, those other Asian people, those other Middle Eastern people.  I listen to hip hop, I'm cool, I'm down.  Another real thing that happened to me, I went on a first and last date with this guy from Bangladesh by way of London, who casually dropped the N-word in the middle of our conversation.  You know, to show me he gets it.  This happens in all types of interactions, from professional to romantic.  Almost every single time I go out with a guy who isn't black, there's this moment where the dude tries to race flex.  100% of the time, it is awkward and bizarre.  It often involves the guy crowbarring in that he has black relatives, as if I'm supposed to be like, oh, your great granddad had a black cousin, so you totally understand my experience.  marry me.  Another thing I've experienced far too many times is non-black men asking me if I'm fully black.  I've had guys insinuate, if not state outright, things like, but you don't have a typical black nose, you're very beautiful.  Again, this is real life.  Public service announcement to all the men out there who think that they're paying a black woman a compliment when they tell her that she looks biracial.  I am beautiful because I am black, not in spite of it.  Get the fuck out of my face.  Add to this list the double standard of how qualities that are seen as positives on other women suddenly become negatives when it's a black woman.  She's not assertive.  she's angry.  She's not sexy, she's a skank.  She's not lively, she's loud.  She's not a boss, she's a bitch.  If she's independent, she's too independent, masculine even.  It gets more complicated still.  as a woman, I'm in an unusual position because I don't want the things that I'm supposed to want, at least according to societal norms, i.e.  according to other people's baggage.  This opinion is perhaps even more polarizing than the others that I've already stated on today, but here we go.  By and large, black people are always at the forefront of driving culture.  We don't see the future, we are the future.  And then invariably our IP gets stolen and some other party profits from our creations.  Anywho, here's where it probably gets controversial.  Where black people far too often tend to lag behind is being forward thinking in our social dynamics and beliefs.  Case in point, the truly archaic and ignorant responses from so many in our community to the recent news about Dwyane Wade's daughter, Zaya.  Zay or a Zay, I'm not sure and I apologize.  So my unconventional feelings on marriage and children are typically met with the most resistance by other black people.  I have gotten some truly insane comments, not just in real life, but especially here on YouTube.  I did a whole video about this, but for the unaware, I don't want kids.  ever.  And even though, when I was still actually on the apps, I put this critical detail in my profile because I wanted to be clear from the jump, I would still have guys sliding into my likes on the daily who had it in their profiles that they do want kids.  This comes down to either one, our old friend functional illiteracy, or two, pure arrogance.  These are so delusional that they think that I only don't want children because I haven't met them yet.  I hate it.  The fact that women are so often not believed or taken seriously when we say that we don't want children is infuriating to say the least.  But again, I've already done an entire video about that already, so I'ma leave that there.  While I'm not completely opposed to marriage, it's also not a life goal for me and it never has been, even when I was a little girl.  Relationships take work, yada.  Well, bitch, I already have a job.  Not to mention, I like my alone time and I need a lot of it.  Perhaps that'll change if one day our field actually gets a bit deeper.  If someday I meet someone who makes me feel differently about getting cuffed, great!  Love that for me.  Alright, I'm pretty much done.  I just have to do finishing touches like bottom lash mascara and throw on some gloss, so I will be right back with the finished look.  Now that we have made it through those awkward slow-mo shots of the final look, I will bid you guys adieu.  I did have to bust out the ring light because it's getting darker and darker by the minute.  My look concoction is all Fenty, and details will be in the description box, as they always are, so you better not be asking me.  And this head wrap actually was gifted to me by Losa Tam.  They contacted me on IG.  They slid into them DMs.  It's nice because it's lined with satin so I don't have to worry about putting a silk or satin scarf underneath it.  I can just put it right on my head.  So I will also link my turban.  In the meantime, in between time, I'm going to figure out what the hell it is I'm going to wear to this event.  But thank you for hearing me out on my thoughts on why it is especially challenging for me as a Black woman navigate these dating waters.  now I probably could go on and on about this topic even more but I think I've said enough at least for this tea talk so we're gonna wrap it up here.  thank you so much for hanging out with me all the way to the end.  I got to figure out what I'm going to wear to this event and I will leave you guys here.  oh but before I go one bit of housekeeping I just needed to remind you guys to never trust anyone with a morphe code.  I Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed hose there.  I'm going to take that down. ",
