If you're new to the channel, why not take a second to tap on the subscribe button, so that you'll be notified when new science, theology, and news videos come out.  If you've been watching this channel for a while, you'll know that I contend that the Gospels and Acts are merely the codification of decades of stories about Jesus, previously whispered from one believer to another, growing with each telling in the name of convincing more people to join the movement.  Essentially, the Jesus of the New Testament is a legend.  Not that there might not be a few details inspired by real events.  Maybe there was an actual apocalyptic preacher named Yeshua who got himself killed by the Romans, just as there might have been a Paul Bunyan or a Johnny Appleseed.  In any case, when I saw that cold case detective J. Warner Wallace posted a video to tell us why we know the story of Jesus isn't a legend, I had to click to find out where I was wrong.  It starts with Jim's existential doppelganger, Lee Strobel, to toss in the first softball question. ",

            "text": "ladies and gentlemen of the jury please buckle up for a moment as we do a whirlwind look at the so-called evidence behind these claims one at a time.  we have only one extant work attributed to Polycarp, the Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, which might technically be a composite of two letters, but what's important for this discussion is that it's all of the writing of Polycarp that we have.  It's not long, and there is no mention of any kind of jaunt.  Strange.  There's an early Martyrdom of Polycarp biography of this church father, written by someone else.  This comprehensive document also doesn't claim that Polycarp was a disciple of John.  Odd?  No.  We have to wait until decades after his death, before next generation.  Irenaeus, who Detective Wallace will talk about in a minute, makes the first vague allusions toward any Polycarp-John connection.  In Against Heresies 3.3.4, Irenaeus wrote, Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the church in Smyrna.  This is 180 AD, and by this point, the word apostles was being used as a generic term for anyone sent out to preach the Gospels.  not specifically for the twelve disciples.  at very least no mention of john.  the next phrase waters it down further because polycarp's interactions with those who saw christ again not necessarily the twelve but maybe casual observers was merely that he conversed with them.  carrying on.  polycarp had received this one and sole truth from the apostles that namely which is handed down by the church.  so whatever polycarp received from the apostles.  irenaeus went out of his way to specify that it was what the church was teaching.  polycarp got the apostle teaching indirectly just as stroebel and wallace receive apostles teaching indirectly.  there are also those who heard from him that john the disciple of the lord John.  But Irenaeus didn't hear it directly.  A friend of a friend heard that Polycarp knew a funny story about John.  Not even that Polycarp himself witnessed the event, just retelling it like any bard might.  That's a far cry from Polycarp being the student of John.  Now we jump ahead to the 3rd century Christian author Tertullian, who, like Detective Wallace, is attempting to build a case for succession.  In Prescription Against Heretics 32.2, he claimed, \"...as the Church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by  John.\".  Now first, Polycarp became Bishop of Smyrna in the mid-2nd century, so John would have been well over a hundred to have been involved.  Possible, but unlikely.  Second, this directly contradicts the earlier 2nd century source that says Polycarp was installed by the Church of Asia.  Certainly, Irenaeus would have said John, not the Church of Asia, if that had been the known story.  This is merely another example of the kind of legend building around church fathers that were supposed to be investigating about Jesus.  It's an epidemic.  Flash forward to the late 4th century, before Jerome finally becomes the first to declare that Polycarp was a disciple of John.  That's not a chain of custody, that's legend.  Another of the second generation church fathers, Ignatius became bishop of Antioch in the 2nd century.  Of the 15 letters that claim to be from Ignatius, scholars affirm only seven of these as possibly authentic.  oddly in none of these letters does ignatius mention john his supposed mentor.  even in his letter to polycarp the other person alleged by wallace to be a student of john.  the only explicit tie of ignatius to john is found in the epistle of ignatius to the virgin mary.  However, this letter is universally rejected as authentic, having been written not in Greek, but Latin, and in the 5th or 6th century, not the 2nd.  Ignatius' inclusion in this list can be from church tradition only, since this is one of those rare cases of literally no textual evidence for a claim.  Things are marginally better for Papias.  Unfortunately, none of Papias' writings survive, other than when he is quoted by later church fathers, Irenaeus and Eusebius.  In these quotes, Papias never claims to have known John, but 2nd century theologian Irenaeus does describe Papias as the hearer of John and a companion of Polycarp.  now i'll save this for another video.  but irenaeus really doesn't think highly of papias seeming to want to discredit him rather than uphold him and my impression of papias is that he's a bit of a bragger and an exaggerator who would definitely name drop John if he could.  But that doesn't factor in for what Detective Wallace is saying, because we don't have any quotes from Papias, spurious or not, about John at all, let alone something that could affirm this so-called chain of custody that Jim is attempting to establish.  Okay, back to Jim. ",

That's not exactly a close student relationship.  I find no historical connections at all to Papias or Ignatius.  None of Polycarp Ignatius or Papias claimed to have known John the Apostle.  These claims were made about them later, vaguely at first, and then more boldly as the centuries wore on.  This is exactly what legendary development looks like.  The Gospel of John doesn't claim to be written by John, and I find the authorship tradition to be incredibly weak, but a topic for a video on its own.  So, how is Jim's chain looking?  This isn't an officer handing evidence to another officer and documenting it.  This is more of an outside consultant implying that because police officers sometimes know of each other, we shouldn't worry about the fact that there's no paper trail on this bullet casing. ",

Even if I restore your supposed evidence chain, I'm not worried about the story having its core elements in place by the 2nd century and those carrying forward into the 3rd century until today.  No, I'm worried about this massive gap back here, between Jesus and the first written account.  Which isn't John, by your own admission.  The vast majority of the legend building would have happened in the time of the oral transmission, in the 30-60 years between Jesus' death and our first gospel mark.  Beyond that, I do think earlier creeds attest that the basic resurrection miracle claim was there in the early years, but all the extra circumstances around the tomb story and the post-resurrection appearances, the ascension, and so on, those kept on growing and growing decade after decade.  It's what the evidence shows.  This is the chain in the custody link that you need to worry about, Jim.  The rest of the chain doesn't matter if you don't have this first one. ",

But we don't need to assume anyone in the chain is lying.  It is sufficient to propose that the people might merely be mistaken.
