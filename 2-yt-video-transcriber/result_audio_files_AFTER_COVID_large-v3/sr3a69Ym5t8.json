            "text": "On May 17th, 2019, Disney released the soundtrack for the live-action version of Aladdin.  Though the film mostly resembled the original 1992 animated film of the same name, there were some things that made the movie distinct.  For example, there was an entirely new song written for Jasmine by the songwriting duo Pasek and Paul.  This wasn't the first time that Aladdin had been changed.  In fact, the Disney retelling of the story has changed a lot throughout the years, beginning from an original treatment of the film, written by none other than Howard Ashman, that was eventually scrapped by studio executives.  That's what we'll be focusing on today.  To show you how the music for Aladdin has changed throughout the years, we'll have to go back to the beginning and talk about Howard Ashman's lost Aladdin.  Let's get right into it. ",

            "text": "But to be free.  After production had wrapped on The Little Mermaid, the songwriting duo Howard Ashman and Alan Menken went on to work on an adaption of Aladdin, one of the stories from the Book of One Thousand and One Nights.  Ron Clements and John Musker, the directors of Mermaid, would also come over to the film.  Ashman had submitted his early treatment of the film in 1988.  Generally speaking, a film's treatment is similar to that of an overview or synopsis of the film idea.  It usually includes all of the important conceptual elements, structured in three to five acts, each with a beginning, middle, and end.  So, Ashman submitted his treatment for Aladdin a year before The Little Mermaid came out.  The film went on as planned, but was eventually halted by then-executive Jeffrey Katzenberg.  After Aladdin was scrapped, Ashman and Mankin were eventually tasked with making the then-struggling film Beauty and the Beast into a musical.  Despite initial hesitation, Ashman and Mankin would go on to create a wonderful soundtrack for the film, cementing it as one of their most well-known collaborations to this day.  After the success of Beauty and the Beast, the studio revitalized the Aladdin idea, resulting in the 1992 film.  However, let's go back to that treatment of Aladdin.  Those familiar with the 1992 version will be surprised to find out that the 1988 version was much different than what it would become.  For example, instead of being set in the fictional city of Agrabah, the movie was set in Baghdad.  There were also two genies in the film, the Genie of the Ring, who narrated and commented on the story, and the Genie of the Lamp.  Aladdin also had a slightly different trajectory.  In the 1992 version, it's clear that Aladdin steals because he doesn't have any other options, but he still wants to show people that there's something more to him.  Songs like One Jump Ahead and the One Jump Ahead Reprise serve to not only define how he relates to society and how society views him, but also that he wants to show them that there is so much more to him as a person.  Aladdin is not an adult on his own, but a 15-year-old who lives with his mother.  After accidentally ruining his mother's rug that was supposed to be sold in exchange for their rent money, Aladdin feels immense guilt and wants to do right by his mother.  This is represented beautifully in the heartfelt ballad Proud of Your Boy, a song that shows you a personal side of the character that functions similarly to what the One Jump Ahead Reprise does in the final film.  To say Proud of Your Boy is a good song would be a tremendous understatement.  It paints emotions swiftly and elegantly in ways that, in my mind, makes it one of Ashman and Mankin's crowning achievements.  For example, consider this bridge and the following verse. ",

            "text": "The line, some sun, some pride, and some joy particularly gets to me.  The simplicity of I wasted time and I've wasted me also feels just so gripping.  The whole song also brings up questions of living up to one's family values, something that puts Proud of Your Boy on the same pedestal that Part of Your World sits on for me in terms of being an LGBTQ anthem.  When I listen to it, I'm reminded of just how complicated the notion of family is to LGBTQ people, whether you're reconciling with your given family or are seeking out your chosen one.  If you want a specific version to listen to, I highly recommend the Alan Menken demo of the song.  Anyway, if you want to learn more about how Disney I Want songs play into the history of LGBTQ music, I'll link to my video on that in the description.  I'll also be linking to my video on Howard Ashman's work so you can understand the context of queerness in his songs.  Another significant part of the early version is that Princess Jasmine was not the romantic interest.  Instead, the character of Abi would develop an intimate relationship with Aladdin while he went to go save Princess Jasmine.  Even though Aladdin is able to marry Princess Jasmine at the end of the film, he chooses to follow the true love he has found with Abi.  This is an interesting change that's also reflected with music.  Princess Jasmine even has a very snooty number titled Call Me A Princess that shows off her personality, serving as a comic song more than anything else.  The character of Jafar was not only called the Wazir, but his parrot was also called Sinbad.  The Wazir even had a song in the original draft, Humiliate the Boy, a rousing villainous number about taking away all of Aladdin's power.  In the final movie, the song was removed, and in its place was Jafar's Prince Ali reprise, serving a similar purpose to what Humiliate the Boy would have been, at least according to the storyboards.  There was also a song called Why Me that was tested for that spot, but was eventually cut in the 1992 film.  Certain aspects of the original treatment were upheld in the final 1992 movie.  For example, the songs Arabian Nights, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali were all kept in the film.  Of course, if you saw my previous video talking about musical aesthetics in Aladdin, you're already aware of the ways in which the film codes the music according to stereotypical Middle Eastern aesthetics.  The original Howard Ashburn treatment is no different.  having arguably clearer distinctions between a vaguely stereotypical Middle Eastern sound and very strict Broadway-sounding numbers.  If you want to learn more about this, I'm going to link to my video on the subject with the timestamp, so you can skip to where I talk about this.  I also recommend reading the article Aladdin Animated Racism by Jack Shaheen that goes into the Orientalist issues with the 1992 film.  It can be argued that most of those issues were also present in the original treatment.  Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg has said, I would remember those words if I were ever fortunate enough to come across an enchanted lamp with a genie able to grant three wishes.  My first wish would be to have the Disney studio make films that fulfill the stated ideals of its executives.  My second wish would be that all other Hollywood producers did likewise.  My third would be that reviews of this kind would never again be needed.  Like the two Disney Renaissance films that preceded it, Aladdin released in theaters to critical acclaim.  Ashman passed away in 1991, so Sir Tim Rice was brought in to finish lyrics for the remaining songs.  Though the film had traveled far since the original 1988 treatment, Howard Ashman's influence was still strongly felt.  After the film won Oscars for Best Score and Best Song for A Whole New World written by Mencken and Rice, Sir Tim Rice wrote to Howard's sister Sarah that without the great talent and inspiration of Howard I would not have been thus honored.  He went on to say that his work will never die.  In the early 2010s, Aladdin was adapted into a stage musical with many aspects of Ashman's original treatment intact.  For example, Aladdin's friends from the original treatment, Bab-Kak Omar and Kasim, are kept in this version with their signature buddy song, Bab-Kak Omar, Aladdin, Kasim, still there.  Another cut song from the treatment, High Adventure, also made it into the musical.  Proud of Your Boy was also included, but in the musical, Aladdin's mother is deceased.  That being said, the musical still maintains the structure of the 1992 film, likely because of the importance of Jasmine and Aladdin's romantic arcs to the overarching story.  Despite this, though, the song Call Me a Princess was still included in the Seattle run of the musical, but was cut during the Toronto tryout before going to Broadway.  Though the text is complicated, Ashman's knack for lyrics and concept shines through the original treatment, from the perfect buddy song of Babkak Omar, Aladdin, Kasim, to the cabaret-esque nature of Friend Like Me.  However, no matter what, I always come back to Proud of Your Boy.  Not only does it symbolize something personal for me, but the lyrics also show what made Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's collaborations so touching.  When done correctly, a song can feel as natural as breathing. ",
