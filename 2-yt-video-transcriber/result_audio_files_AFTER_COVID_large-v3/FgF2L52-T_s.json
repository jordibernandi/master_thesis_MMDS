Thank you for calling 9-1.  What's your emergency?  9-1?  What the hell's 9-1?  We're the police.  What's the 9-1 mean?  Well, ever since we got defunded, we can't afford the extra one.  So, it's just 9-1 now.  Oh, gotcha.  Alright.  So, what seems to be the problem?  Uh, somebody broke into our house!  Alright, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.  I'm sending over my thoughts and prayers right now.  Thoughts and prayers?  Somebody broke into our house!  Send help now!  Please deposit 40 cents.  40 cents, please.  Oops!  Unfortunately, that's all the time we can afford.  I wish you good luck, and I thank you for calling 9-1.  Now, wait a minute.  Who the hell am I supposed to call for help?  I don't know.  Call a counselor.  What are we gonna do now?  Who are we gonna call?  Ghostbusters!  If there's something strange in the neighborhood, don't call the police.  Call Ghostbusters!  If there's something weird and it don't feel good, don't call the police.  Call Ghostbusters!  That's right, guys.  If somebody's breaking into your house, call a counselor.  Don't call the police.  I ain't afraid of no ghost.  That's right. ",
