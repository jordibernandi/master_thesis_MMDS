            "text": "Shalom, koholo, yehowah, bashem, nawashai, bashem, makar, kudash.  The Bahamas unto the apostles and the elders, salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity, risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  To the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth, let be light.  unto the speckled bird, the Israelite foreigners.  And to the Akwaf that are listening and learning, to you I say shalom.  This is your brother Malcolm from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago.  Coming at you once again with another lesson in truth.  I just started this video, you know, about five minutes ago and it just cut off.  It's been doing that a lot lately.  It cuts off on the first try.  It's almost like my phone's, you know, these eagles got their AI or their agents.  I don't know what the hell be going on, but it does that a lot.  It cuts off on the first try on the video and then it lets me record afterwards.  But, um, You know, I was watching a video where the elder apostle Tahar made a statement about prophesying about World War III because that's what time we're in.  You know, we should be occupying ourselves with prophecy.  And everything's been going on to drown out World War III, to drown out the fact that the war drums, the drums of war are beating very, very loudly.  You know, you got to... You know, this mess with China, you know, that's picked up.  You still got the thing going on in Syria between the Israelis, America, America and Russia.  Now they're saying that Russia did some sort of hacking.  All this finger pointing and name calling and back and forth and the nations are completely and totally divided, man.  And if you go to the book of Habakkuk, All right, which I'm just basically quoting the scripture.  This is Habakkuk, the second chapter, verses one through three, roughly paraphrased.  But he, you know, the Lord took refers to Habakkuk as a son of man to tell him to prophesy.  It tells him to write these things down on paper, you know, and though they tarry, you know, they surely shall come, man.  And the prophecies are happening right before your face, man.  Like I said, everybody's so preoccupied.  The media, all they're showing is the Crown Royal One-Nine and the vaccinations that are going on.  And all these other things that are leading us up to World War III are happening.  And so we know how close we are to the end, man.  And knowing that the Lord is only coming back for the elect, for the elect of Israel, not all Israel and not all people.  And being that yesterday was a merry wickedness, people were sending me messages.  People in the world, they don't know any better, man.  And that really has nothing to do with the Lord.  The Lord was born during the Passover.  The Passover happens at the end of winter going into spring, man.  It tells you that.  The Lord was born during the Passover.  you know that's right there in the book of luke but nevertheless uh uh you know.  john 17 and 9 he says i i pray not for the world but i i pray for them that were given unto me.  so they know there was that christmas song.  joy to the world.  the sun has come or the sun is born You know, however that song goes.  No, it's woe to the world.  Not joy, it's woe to the world.  And so you gotta understand that word world, man.  Because in John 17, nine, that word there is cosmos, the same as in John 3, 16, all right?  In John 3, 16, the cosmos is an orderly arrangement.  What's that orderly arrangement?  The world of Israel, the Israelites.  All right?  If it meant the entire world as if the way people teach it, the way Christianity is taught, it would, it would, it would, the word there would have been oinkamini, right?  You got to look up words and look up the meanings of words.  And, and, and contrary to, to, uh, some of these, these, these, uh, fake caps out there who teach the otherwise and say, well, I can't, the doctrine being English because the things in English, it tells you right there in the Apocrypha, in the pro prologue to the book of Ecclesiastes, that things spoken in other languages have not the same power in them as they're spoken in their true tongue.  All right?  So you have to translate because the world there, how can you use John 3.16, all right, and say that everybody is saved, but then John 17.9 says he prays not for the world.  So what are you trying to say, that the Lord is schizophrenic?  That he's double-minded?  He's got a, you know, I'm trying to, bipolar?  He's on meds?  Because, you know, America loves his meds, man.  Esau loves his meds.  All right?  But, um, But you get to Jeremiah 11 and 14, and what did Jeremiah say?  He said, pray not for these people, man.  I mean, yeah, 11 and 14, he says, pray not for these people.  Lift up, don't shed a cry, don't shed a tear.  Lift up not a prayer for these people.  But yet, you got this doctrine of teaching that God loves everybody, and that is simply not the case.  Anyone saying that is a complete and total liar, man.  That's not the truth, all right?  That's not the truth.  okay what does it say in isaiah?  uh uh 45th chapter in the 17th verse right it says that israel you know israel you know yasirallah jacob would be a world without in the world should never be brought to shame.  oh she didn't even look.  she just threw a door open.  man i'll tell you man somebody's wondering what that damn blonde wickedness on her head.  but uh But yeah, you know, it tells you right there in Isaiah that Israel would be a world without end.  So when Israel goes into power, all the other nations are going to go up under it.  And they should never be confounded, never be brought down ever again.  Why?  Because we're going to be made perfect.  Because the law... the law of the bible is going to be put within our inward parts which is what is going to make us perfect which also proves that the law is not done away with which is something that christianity teaches all right which has failed just like america is failing christianity is failing big time okay.  and then uh to finish this up uh You go to the book of 2nd Ezra and it's pretty much the same thing, man.  2nd Ezra, the 9th chapter, verses 1 through 5, he tells, you know, the prophet Ezra tells you that basically what Habakkuk said, and this went even more into detail, where there will be uproars of the people, wars and rumors of wars, you know, all the troubles, all the things that are happening, the crazy weather patterns, right, that the Lord began to visit the world that he created.  All right.  And that the end is manifest.  All right.  The end is definitely manifest, man.  You know, it's it's it's.  I mean, as I drive, if you're looking at all this family dollar.  burnt down, destroyed.  Why?  By BLM.  All these stores.  I was coming down 95th and now you just hit the hood.  To my left is an empty, used to be a car lot.  And that's a normal thing all across the city, man.  All these used car lots.  And not only used car lots, but regular car lots.  There's so many empty ones now.  The car lots aren't there anymore.  It's like a lot of these stores are boarded up and not there anymore.  And that BLM jacked this place up, man.  You know, and you still got Jake.  that's following behind that mess.  You know, and that's another prophecy of the end days.  The Lord said, woe unto them that go down into Egypt, you know, and they lean into Egypt for their help and not to the Lord.  That's in Isaiah, the 30th chapter.  All right.  Right.  You got this little Edomites, you're decent too.  Just scooped up Jake.  These are projects I ride by.  Just scooped Jake up right out the projects.  You know?  Hey, look, it's two things.  When you see Becky rolling through the hood, she looking for D&D.  Both or one or the other.  And there's drugs and dick.  All right?  That's what she out here for.  No, I'm just saying that's just another sign, man, that the end is manifest.  Right next to the... to the projects, they put up this wicked-ass church, man, Trinity Church.  This is the church made famous by Jeremiah White, too, in case y'all didn't know, the one that Barack Obama used to go to.  You see, they messed it up, because back in the day, there used to be a skating rink, man.  They tore down the rink, you know, what was called a rink of the loop, I forget which one, tore it down and built that wicked church, man.  All right?  But there go Becky.  But yeah, man, the end is manifest, man.  It's showing itself.  And yet you still got people who don't believe, people that still think this is funny, think that this is a joke, think that they got time, you know?  You know, I had a friend of mine that grew up with me.  You know, when I first told, of course, they were the first people I told the truth to, man.  You know, first ones.  And what did he say?  Well, at least he believed.  I give him that much.  He just believed that none of this was going to happen in our lifetime.  But he could barely look me in my face when these subject matters come up.  You know, when I'm rarely around him, when I see him, you know, they don't want to talk about this stuff.  Or on the low, they'll be like, yeah, he was right.  But hey, the time is getting short, man.  Repent, repent, repent.  Read fast when you can.  Pray without ceasing.  All right?  Read fast when you can and pray without ceasing.  All right?  So with that, man, I'm going to give all the praises going on to you. ",
