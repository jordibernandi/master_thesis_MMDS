Hello everybody, I'm David Shuster and thanks for joining us.  Coy Griffin is facing charges stemming from that January 6th riot at the Capitol as well as charges related to the illegal transportation of firearms in violation of DC law.  The founder of Cowboys for Trump will be lucky if he sees freedom anytime soon, because prosecutors are also reportedly considering charges involving terroristic threats.  And that's something that Coy Griffin arguably is familiar with.  He was pictured by the Daily Beast over the summer riding his horse in the street and declaring a good Democrat is a dead one.  Last April, Griffin objected to New Mexico's mask mandate and said, I don't care if you are a governor, you can still swing at the end of a rope.  Last May, he called for a sheriff's posse to push back in New Mexico State Police.  Quote, if you all don't have enough deputies to get the job done, call us, there's a lot of us ready.  Form a sheriff's posse, we're ready.  A few months earlier, he suggested the formation of an army through New Mexico's fish and gaming email lists.  Quote, if a man wants to put an army together, that's where you would put it together at through all of our hunters.  To be fair, not all Cowboys for Trump are outlaws.  And I suppose one could make the argument that the leader of Cowboys for Trump is not guilty by reason of insanity.  After all, being crazy has never been a disqualifier for holding elected political office, as we've seen.  Back in New Mexico, Griffin still has a few years left on his term as Otero County Commissioner.  However, state officials are already pledging to try to seek his resignation.  The State Attorney General Hector Baldera says that if Griffin does not resign, the state will begin lawsuits to try to force him out.  The AG says that Griffin has misused his office for personal gain, neglected his duties and participated in a criminal insurrection.  Griffin vows to fight and legal experts say that removing him may not be so easy.  As an old cowboy saying goes, telling a man to get lost and making him do it are two entirely different propositions.  Here's another cowboy quote though that also applies to Coy Griffin, don't squat with your spurs on.  And let there be no doubt the founder of Cowboys for Trump is feeling the pain. ",
