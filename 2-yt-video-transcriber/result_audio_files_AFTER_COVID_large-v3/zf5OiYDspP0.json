            "text": "what's up youtube.  this is tony harvin on the check-in hoping everyone is doing well even to the haters and enemies during this pandemic of dealing with this coronavirus situation.  i'm checking on everyone in their families to see if you all are doing well.  i know a lot of people lost their jobs going into heavy debt and suffering from other trials and tribulations.  Me personally, I am doing great.  Still working classified as being an essential worker as a truck driver here in the state of New Jersey.  Whereas majority of my deliveries are to hospitals in the Northern New Jersey area.  I deliver frozen foods and in the loading dock areas, there are trailers that have freezers on them.  And yes, the hospitals, as the media said and mentioned, They are using them to house dead bodies.  At one location in Montclair, New Jersey, I did see with my own eyes hospital personnel taking in a few bodies.  So this thing is not a joke.  You know, I know a lot of people got a lot of conspiracy theories upon this coronavirus situation.  You know, at most hospitals, they do prescreen us delivery drivers for the virus.  In general, I'm still working out at a personal gym that is closed off to the public, you know, staying in great shape and condition.  And then also I'm doing my three to five mile runs.  On top of that, I'm still putting together these truth of God videos, you know, these biblical debate and discussion videos.  And I'm also thinking about putting up videos that is dealing with animals.  It's just an idea that I have.  So bear with me.  You know, I like to make my content very sharp and on point.  So let me know how you all are doing during these times of this pandemic.  You know, shout out to everyone at First Church of our Lord Jesus Christ.  You know, those who are following the truth of God, prayers and blessings to everyone who are dealing with this, you know, situation, who have family members or family members, friends or anyone that dealing with this virus who have lost anyone from the coronavirus situation.  much love and much respect to you all even love to everyone who are hating every enemy out there.  you know prayers and blessings to you and your family.  you know I just don't have time to go back and forth with people doing these situations you know.  so i'm concluding now.  so just leave your feedback and uh feel free to follow me on facebook or instagram at tony fast hands harvin t-o-n-y.  you know space f-a-s-t h-a-n-d-z space h-a-r-v-i-n.  peace.  stay tuned.
