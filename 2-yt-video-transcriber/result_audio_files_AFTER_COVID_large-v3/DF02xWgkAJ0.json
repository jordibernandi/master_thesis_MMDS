Do you notice that a few countries aren't being shown?  Right here is actually Afghanistan.  Literally the most important reason why many Chinese Uyghurs had become radicalized and even waged jihad is because Afghanistan and its never-ending American war lies right on the Xinjiang border.  But of course, the Western media doesn't want you to know that.  With that said, I knew that I had to see Xinjiang with my own eyes in order to know the truth.
