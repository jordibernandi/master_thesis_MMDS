            "text": "My dear brothers, we're destroying each other because we don't really understand the root of who we are and what our oppressor is doing to us through us.  My Hispanic brothers, La Raza.  Who are you?  You ain't Spanish.  Why?  Because you speak Spanish, you Spanish?  I speak English, I ain't an Englishman.  I speak a little French and a little German.  I ain't French and I ain't German.  I studied Latin and I speak Latin, but I ain't Latin.  You are a victim of the Spanish conquistadors who conquered your people.  You are more Indian Native.  African.  Mixed in.  That's why you love the drum.  You didn't get that drum, brother, from no Spain, doctor.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You say, I'm Cuban.  I am Puerto Rican.  I am from Guatemala.  I am from Costa Rica.  I am from Nicaragua.  Yeah, you can call all them names.  But what's the root?  The root is Africa.  And now, because you speak Spanish and we speak English, your hair curlier than ours, some of you.  Your nose a little thinner than ours, some of you.  All of a sudden now, we are competing in a society for the crumbs that fall from the master's table.  And we who are the oppressed original people of the earth are fighting each other in the barrio or in the ghetto when we should be locking arms as family to fight for the total good of all of our people.  They got us in our ignorance.  We have become the number one destroyers of each other.  White folk don't have to kill us anymore.  We are doing it now better than they did it. ",
