            "text": "Hi everyone, SaintMaine here.  This video was brought to you by a donation from Thomas.  He didn't give me a specific topic, so what I'd like to do is cover a Reddit post that includes this graph.  survey called, From 2012 to 2018, the number of men not having sex has doubled.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  It certainly hasn't, and the typical excuses of adult content in video games are being thrown around.  Instead of the most obvious one that Tinder came out in 2012, and it's changed the dating world forever.  Before Tinder, things were starting to get bad, but after Tinder showed up, the bitchiness factor went off the scale.  Video games were obviously around before 2012, and so was pornography.  Since mid-2006, the adult tube sites were there too.  Yet back then, men were having more sex with internet porn being around from 1998 all the way to around 2010.  Men were buying adult content and downloading it for free and enjoying sex as well.  Video games were also clearly not to blame, because first-person shooter games came out in the early 90s, with things like Castle Wolfenstein and Doom.  Later on, we saw 007 Goldeneye on the N64.  Even when World of Warcraft was in its heyday 10 years ago, that didn't lower the sexual activity in men.  In fact, I remember female chameleons playing games like that and getting together with gamer guys.  Where are those girls today?  Men getting more into adult content and video games is a non-argument.  Of course, Tinder and Bumble might not be the whole story because correlation does not equal causation.  But dating apps have changed the dating landscape.  In 2010, I saw Grindr for the first time and thought to myself that this would be amazing if it were made for straight men and women.  But the only thing that's been amazing is my lack of interest after using them.  Knowing that I could get a girlfriend a lot easier using such apps made me a lot less interested.  Besides, the quality of women on those apps is rather disappointing.  It's also the fastest growing way for people to date these days.  More men are using Tinder than ever before, but the deck of dicks is stacked higher than it's ever been to tickle a cooch.  If you look at this graphic again, you'll notice that as of 2018, 28% of men ages 18 to 30 have not had sex in the last year.  This has never happened before, and I wonder if the numbers got worse in 2019, but I bet you certainly that they have gotten worse in 2020, with the COOF.  I also looked up the fertility rates in the United States back in 2018.  And the only state in the lower 48 with fertility rates that were replacement was actually South Dakota.  I'll get to my thoughts about how America will most likely become an incel nation in five years, maybe ten, in a moment.  But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, the MGTOW's Guide to Retiring on 200K in Southeast Asia.  Luca Vendetti is the author.  He left the West taking his savings with him and achieving his goal of retirement at the age of 33.  The book shows you how you can easily do the same and easily create a passive monthly income covering your expenses in Southeast Asia.  It's a great book for someone like Vention MGTOW.  Instead of heading to Asia and feeling overwhelmed, he could have read this and know a little bit more about what he was getting himself into.  Maybe you as a man were meant to be drinking dirty martinis on the beach taking Polaroids of ladyboys, if that's what you're into.

So if you're looking at that trend line on that graph that I showed in the first part of this video, then you'll notice that if the trend line holds, then one-third of all men between the ages of 18 and 30 have not had sex in the last year.  It's not outlandish to say that another five years, it'll be well over 50%.  All of Gen X and late millennials with kids listening to this, you better be ready for a situation where you have no grandkids.  Because 50% of men are not having sex, which means populations will reduce by 50% or more going forward.  If you have sons, your odds will go down even further.  If you play the baby lottery, your odds of winning an incel son or a single mother daughter are higher than they've ever been before.  I also don't believe that Tinder is the only thing to blame for this, but also women's mean demeanor.  Women have become increasingly nasty to men that give them attention and they seem to be getting off on it these days.  I don't know how or why, but that seems to be my hunch.  A while back I had a woman contact me out of the blue that I hadn't spoken to in ages.  Then she ghosted me right after me asking her a question.  She saw it, but no response.  Ironically, I had no interest in dating her, but I thought she just wanted some headshots or something.  And I certainly didn't want any head.  It's cruel and unusual behavior on your part when you ask someone a question, get an answer, and then ignore them like that.  I thought she was either looking for someone to do a job for her, or either that or to catch up.  I won't be making the same mistake again.  What women like that don't realize is that for every guy they treat like that, other women are treating him the same way.  Eventually, he equates all women as being mean and nasty.  And then when people tell him that the right girl is out there for him, he just scoffs and gets angry.  It demoralizes men from going out there and talking to other women and forming relationships.  I haven't been on a date in almost five years, and I don't care anymore.  But if you're an incel and all that happens is you get ghosted and abused by women all the time, then at some point you'll simply stop trying altogether.  You'll lose hope and video games and porn will be a lot more appealing.  I guess that in that particular case correlation is not causation.  You aren't playing video games instead of playing with women willingly.  You're doing it because you don't have any other choice.  You can't amuse yourself with real boobs so you oogle the ones on the screen instead.  At least the men from my generation could get their little hands-on jugs instead of the younger guys just gawking at them on a screen.  This is why I hate to say this, but MGTOW is a historical aberration.  It came about in a perfect time where women still gave us attention.  Bad attention.  But by God, we still got some.  We were treated poorly and we got sex.  Young guys today are being treated poorly, and they aren't getting anything to show for their emotional suffering that they face.  So for many, why bother with abusive thoughts, not even interested in using you as an emotional tampon, but are now using you instead as an emotional punching bag?  There is a term in psychology known as transference, when you transfer your feelings, in this case negative ones that you receive from someone else to someone else.  When you've been pumped viciously by one too many chads that laugh in your face and dump you like a do-rag and then you transfer all that toxic masculinity onto innocent men.  Those innocent incel men have no one else to dump that crud onto.  So they internalize it until they either blow up, Elliot Rogers styles, or until they just stop talking to toxic women altogether.  Because they're not masochists.  That means that women are going to have a lot less emotional outlets.  Then those women run out of victims, so that's why a woman I haven't spoken to in many years asks me a question and then ghosts me.  Maybe more men than ever are walking away from the friend zone and dating altogether.  And women don't have anyone to talk to, so when they finally do find a guy that gives them their attention, they abuse them of no fault of their own.  But maybe the guys that are out there talking to women, maybe there aren't enough of them anymore, and women have too much negative emotions to dump too quickly.  Because we all know that if 90% of women are dating 5-10% of the men out there, then they're usually on their best behavior around those guys, or they'll get dumped like a turd.  So they can't really express their angst until they find a simp orbiter, and those guys would rather be playing video games and fapping off instead of being abused, then you can see that there's going to be a supply and demand problem.  In the peanut gallery under the Reddit post, there's a lot of great input.  One man says that maybe men are answering the call of duty, not call of booty.  Another guy says that men are just walking away from something that's become too toxic to deal with.  Yes, some men, but not all.  Another guy says that the survey is not correct, and that women are virtue signaling, and that only one in five women being celibate is not being accurate, implying that they're all having sex, and the ones that say they aren't are lying about it.  Another guy says that if 28% of men in 2018 said they were sexless, that's only the number willing to admit it, and that he suspects that number is much higher when you factor out old married men and factor out that most men will lie about not having sex.  He thinks it's probably closer to 80% of men aged 20 to 30 not having sex in the past year.  Another guy says it's close to 50% now, especially due to COVID.  I agree more with that 50% number.  Yet another guy says that society and her women will be forced to learn that for every man they make a loser, a woman is going to lose just as much later on.  Of course, from my experience, women are notoriously bad at predicting their own futures.  He says that 30% of men are incels or that they quit the market.  That means that 30% of women will be forced out of the marriage market, but not necessarily.  There are guys out there that will get married in their 30s and then taken to the cleaners.  Women will still get that sip money, they just won't stay married, because divorce will guarantee that they get to keep it.  The thing to keep in mind with regards to that survey that created the graphic is that men increase their notch count and women decrease it.  But even still, the trend is going way up.  Yet another guy says that women have decided to starve men of sex, the majority of men.  This is also the answer to the rise in incel populations right now.  Women can either control men through sex on a regular basis, or starve him of it entirely.  He's thirsty both ways.  One because he's an addict and craves it all the time.  The other way he also craves it all the time, but he's under a woman's control because he's desperate to get his dick wet.  The man in the middle that's had his fill and gone his own way is the uncontrollable man.  He doesn't need female validation anymore because he's had tons of it in his life.  I have to reiterate this again that the MRA, PUA, and incel communities, or the three whoresmen of the fempocalypse, and all three groups are desperate for women's attention and approval.  It's MGTOW that stands out as something entirely different.  But as I was saying, the social circumstances that make men going their own way are quickly disappearing.  The last guy says that he has absolutely zero interest in dating anymore.  It's just too stressful and unpleasant.  I also don't want to risk my wealth or my career on them either.  So I'm out and women are playing musical chairs with the available chads rejecting everyone else that won't take steroids or get plastic surgery.  The idea of looks maxing is where the YouTuber face in LMS comes in.  He's offering a solution to young guys that can't get any action that goes beyond jerking off in the comfort and safety of home.  He's showing them how they can take their money instead of spending it on women that they'll never sleep with.  Instead, they can make their appearance as appealing as possible to get into their pants.  I like the solutions-based approach.  MGTOW is solutions based for the individual man going his own way, while looks maxing is the same for the individual incel man.  So where does this go in the long run?  Does the birth rate drop so low that governments begin to get involved motivating men and women to mate through penalties if you have a penis but refuse to use it?  What if you have one but women refuse to let you use it on them?  Will the government still punish you in that case?  Either women will reproduce in harems one day, or dating apps like Tinder will have to be banned.  Our experiment with social media is leading us down a dark path for our society.  But women will never be willing to give up the dating advantage that Tinder gives them.  Joe Rogan, on the other hand, seems to think that Elon Musk's Neuralink will ride into the rescue.  But I beg to differ.  Women already have enough tools to manipulate us.  Imagine if they could read our actual minds.  They'd want to read ours, but when we want to read theirs, they will just run away like the flash.  Or they'd claim that it's mental rape.  I just see a future full of a generation of men that are mostly incels, with a lot of anger that need to be guided towards a solution.  In the end, MGTOW may have been nothing more than a stepping stone from the MRA and PUA to incel.  Anyways, that's it for today.
