All right, give me the blown cheese sandwich right now, fucking hell.  Mr.  Holt, do you have a laugh?  No, I'm just... You're within six feet of other people, and you're not wearing a mask.  I'm sorry, Dad.  Jace, man.  You're not in trouble.  I'm just here to talk to you, brother.  Can I just ask if you have a mask?  You're within 60 to 100 feet there.  I mean, now you're good because everyone's gone, but... Oh, that wasn't me, sir.  What are you doing?  Oh, nothing.  I just wanted to come talk to you.  I saw that you were fixing.  Yeah, you're not in any trouble.  I saw you were within six feet of other people, and you didn't have a mask on.  So I was just asking you to put a mask on.  But now that everyone's gone, you know, you're socially distanced.  It's not a big deal.  All right?  Do you have any questions for me?  I have a little question.  All right, cool, man.  Have a good night.  Have a good one, too, man.  You're a pervert.  No, I'm not.  Oh, shit. ",
