            "text": "what is up beautiful family.  i hope that you guys are having a great afternoon.  so i wanted to come on here and just talk to you guys today about this urgency that i just really feel in my spirit.  and i you know when i first started this youtube channel about a year ago i felt the urgency stirring within my spirit probably seven months prior to when i started my youtube channel And I saw other watchmen and watchwomen within the community that were kind of sounding the alarm.  And I had talked to other brothers and sisters within the body of Christ who had been feeling the same urgency that I was feeling.  And I didn't know that there were other people out there who felt the same way that I did.  That... that felt that stirring inside of them.  i thought that i was the only one.  i knew that the return of the lord i knew that the rapture of the church was soon because of all the signs and dreams and things that he had been giving me and not only that but what i had been reading in the word i knew 20 years ago that we were halfway there okay and so as time progressed and i started to really watch for the lord's return you know i lived a lot of my life as a carnal christian.  for those of you um who are new to this channel um i was saved as a little girl so i attended free chapel worship center outside of atlanta georgia.  my pastor was jensen franklin and i grew up in that church and it was just such a holy spirit filled church.  um it was just the most amazing church um and i've i've actually had a really hard time finding another church that compares to that one but i had a supernatural feeling of the holy spirit when i attended that church.  uh the youth center had just been built and it was the first night that i attended youth service.  it was a wednesday night and they had a guest speaker and i just remember crying out to god in the.  uh, out there in the, just with all the other kids, there was praise and worship going on.  And I just remember being in my seat.  I was standing up and there's praise and worship going on for the youth.  And I just remember like having that longing for Jesus.  Like I just, I believed in the gospel, you know, I had that childlike faith.  It wasn't Anything that I was doing in my flesh, I just knew what my pastor had told me about Jesus and I believed in him.  And I just remember that night just longing for the Lord and thirsting, just completely thirsting for him.  And, you know, the word says that whoever is thirsty, let them come to me and drink.  I was just thirsting for the Lord.  And so I remember the pastor had called all the youth down and asked if we wanted to be prayed for.  And so, you know, I think a lot of us have had experiences where I don't know if I want to go down.  No, I was just like I headed straight down towards the altar.  And I just remember all the kids lining up and the pastor just coming by and gently placing his hand upon my head.  and he just prayed for me.  and all of a sudden i just remember being out completely out like a light.  um if the only way i can physically describe it is that it felt like my stomach was open and it felt like a rushing waterfall or like a rushing flowing river was flowing into my stomach from like up above and I could feel the rushing of like this water completely just rushing over my body from head to toe and I was uncontrollably crying.  it was like a wonderful a good cry that I couldn't stop because I was literally like in the presence of the Holy Spirit being filled with his anointing.  and so um I was out forever.  long story short I had a uh you know I was filled as a little girl with the Holy Spirit at a young age and as time progressed and I got older um i fell off the bandwagon.  you know like life happens and i lived a lot of my life as a carnal christian it it never meant that i was not saved um but the lord had just been like working in my life.  and um so he finally brought me to this place where he was just calling me onto youtube and and wanting me to start this ministry and i didn't know at the time but um you know.  so as i started to get uh closer to the lord again um you know he finally pulled pulled me back to him and i i've stayed there all glory to god because you know without him we could literally do nothing in our flesh.  but he pulled me back to him and as i grew even closer to him i you know received even more dreams from the lord.  um my visions started when i started this youtube channel.  i was receiving words from him.  and so i just felt like this intense like um.  just this intensity like this um urgency in my spirit.  uh as i started to watch for the lord and i realized that a bunch of other brothers and sisters were feeling the same exact way and the way that i felt a year ago when i started this youtube channel is completely different from how i feel now.  i i felt that urgency within me stirring inside that that time was short.  but now the the urgency that i'm feeling in my spirit the only way that i can describe is it's like i really feel like time is up and it just the way that i'm feeling inside um confirms the vision that i had from the lord.  i think it was like the third vision i might have while i was brushing my teeth one night and Literally I was just brushing my teeth and I saw like a bunch of like pictures like flash before my eyes kind of like you would see in like a movie scene and all of a sudden after all the pictures like stopped kind of like a time lapse or whatever.  I saw in big bold cap letters and it said time is up with an exclamation point.  um so i was like wow like okay time time is up and so um i just want to like express this urgency that i'm feeling inside.  um i know that these next couple months are extremely high watch times and this is the thing guys like.  there are so many people right now who are living in unbelief.  even Christians are coming to other Christians channels who are watching and saying you're crazy that's just mother nature like that's not really a sign from God like we probably have years and years to go down the road or he's not really coming uh this year.  and I just want to you know guys take some time in your free time And if you feel like you have unbelief in your heart and you're in denial, you need to just go to God and talk to him, talk to him and have a regular conversation with him and say, Lord, help my unbelief.  Anyone who has an ear to hear, will he will speak to like he is speaking to so many of us right now.  and it's time for those of you who are mocking and scoffing or you're just in unbelief or you're in denial or you're writing these things off as just not not the the words of the lord.  okay if you're doing that ask the lord to help with your unbelief.  it's time for us to be bold and open up our eyes and say okay maybe the lord really is speaking to us.  okay we're not all crazy and like i said those of us who have an ear to hear and eyes to see The Lord is speaking to.  if you want to know the times and the seasons that we are in.  Actually, the Bible tells you that for the times and seasons, I don't even need to write you.  You will know perfectly.  Why?  Because we're children of the light, not children of the darkness.  He says that that time will not come at you like a thief in the night.  You'll know.  So we don't sit here and we don't set dates, okay?  The Lord has never told me, Chelsea, I am coming on so-and-so day at this time, this hour.  however the lord says we are his children of the light we don't belong to the darkness and so we will know perfectly.  and he says i'll give you signs in the heaven uh and signs down below and i'll pour out.  i'll pour out my spirit on all of my children and they'll prophesy and they'll dream dreams and they'll have visions.  i will let them know.  guys he's speaking to us.  stop writing it off as just just as like something natural that that the that the world is just that mother nature is doing.  okay ask the lord to help your unbelief.  the urgency that i feel in my spirit.  the time is now.  jesus gave me a vision that said.  time is up.  so when are we going to stop denying it?  when are we going to stop denying his voice?  satan is the one that has you in disbelief.  satan is the one that that draws the veil over your eyes.  okay there's a lot of people in unbelief right now as far as the times that we are in but there's also people right now who are in unbelief as far as the gospel goes.  jesus says that there's going to come a time where people stand before him and he's going to say depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you Not because you didn't do, do, do for the Lord, because he didn't know you.  That you heard the gospel of your salvation and you rejected it.  I never knew you.  There's only one way to the Father.  He says it's through Jesus.  It's through His Son.  There's not any other way to heaven but through Him.  It's by faith alone and Christ alone.  It's not by work so that nobody can boast.  It's not anything that you can do.  It's not about being a good person.  It's not about, look what I did.  Look what I did for you, Lord.  I cast out demons in your name.  I had dreams.  I had visions.  I gave to the poor.  Look how good I was.  I didn't cuss.  I didn't drink.  I didn't slander anybody.  I didn't steal.  And he's going to say, depart from me, you workers of iniquity.  I never knew you.  They didn't belong to Christ.  They didn't believe in Jesus.  He said, it is finished 2000 years ago on the cross.  He died for your sins.  He buried, he was buried and he rose again.  He says that whoever believes in me shall not perish, but have everlasting life.  And there are Pharisees out here right now who are unfortunately blinded, so blinded by Satan, rejecting God's truth, completely blinded, thinking that they have something to add.  that they can bring something to the table and it be good enough.  oh it's faith alone in christ alone.  but it's also what i do.  to maintain it.  it has nothing to do with you.  so say jesus help my unbelief and don't think that you have it all right because there's a lot of people out there who are very prideful right now and are shutting themselves off to the truth.  they don't want to come to jesus and ask him god what is your truth?  because they're too scared to be wrong.  you don't want to be somebody who stands before him and says depart from me.  i never knew you.  there's only one way to receive the holy spirit.  he said by this gospel you are saved first.  corinthians 15 verse 1 through 4.  By this gospel, you are saved.  That Christ died for your sins, he was buried, and that he rose again.  Ephesians 1 verse 13 says that when you hear that truth, when you hear the gospel of your salvation, you receive that truth, you believe on him for salvation, the Holy Spirit comes in and dwells within you.  He seals you and he never leaves.  But the people who are trusting in their own self-righteousness and their own filthy rags for their salvation.  Oh, it's what Jesus does, but it's what I do too.  That's not it.  That's another way.  There's only one way and it's through Jesus Christ.  So I'm saying this right now because of the times that we are in.  Time is up.  if you're playing games and you're playing church and you think that it has it's all about how good you are.  oh it's all about your good works you make.  you need to make a decision right now.  believe in the gospel of your salvation.  believe that christ is who he says that he is that he died he was buried and then he rose again and he truly did do it all on the cross.  he said it is finished Guys, there is no more time left.  This urgency that I feel, I don't think that we're going to make it into next year.  And I'm going to be bold and say it because this is the time that we sound the alarm.  We don't have time left.  And how much more does Jesus have to give you?  How much more does he have to speak?  How many more signs do you guys need to realize that it's time?  Jesus, help my unbelief.  Show me your truth.  Because when that trumpet sounds in the twinkling of an eye, that's it.  And there's going to be so many people who are going to be screaming on their hands and knees who knew the truth and they rejected it.  They rejected him.  They relied on their own self-righteous.  Jesus says the only way that you are righteous is through faith.  It's not your self-righteous that you have that makes you good, that saves you.  It's his self-righteousness that is imputed to you by faith alone in Jesus Christ alone.  Guys, it is time to wake up.  now if you're a christian you have believed in the gospel for your salvation.  um and you just you're in disbelief.  okay i'm praying for you.  i truly i'm praying for you.  i really want you guys to start being bold and sound the alarm to the other people to people around you and let them know there's no more time.  jesus is coming.  i love you all and i'll talk to you soon.
