            "text": "Hello everybody, my name is Graham Owen and you are watching the Political Vigilante.  What?  Where's Jolene Maxwell?  Where is she hiding out?  Oh, the Jerusalem Post says she's reportedly hiding in Israel.  Daughter of late Jewish media mogul Robert Maxwell and Mossad agent, her dad was a Mossad agent, is being protected in a number of countries including Israel.  She is sometimes in the UK, but most often in other countries such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.  Why is she hiding?  Well, it started coming up this summer, but then what really happened was this.  FBI investigating British socialite and others who facilitated Epstein.  So investigating, they're sort of probing.  This is December 27th.  haven't charged her, but they're trying to get at her, not to mention several of the women are forcing, they're doing a civil suit.  And here's what's happened with that.  Judge takes rare step to help serve elusive Jalene Maxwell with lawsuit.  This literally just happened today, February 14th.  Jalene Maxwell is so impossible to find that a Manhattan judge has taken the rare step of allowing her to be served with a new lawsuit by email, according to a federal court filing Friday.  This is what's happening.  So these women are not backing down, and God bless them.  It's not just Virginia Roberts.  It's several other women that are pushing this law.  And they can't even serve her.  And so the Manhattan judge is like, how do we serve her?  Because we can't find her.  So she's being protected by Mossad and Israel.  That's what it looks like.  Remember when I interviewed John Kiriakou and he said, when I asked him about what he thought about Epstein?  killing himself, he goes, this has to be the Israelis.  That's what he said on this show.  So I have an Epstein playlist.  Watch all the videos in the Epstein playlist and you'll see how this starts to really unfold.  But people aren't letting it go, which is a good thing.  I'm not letting it go.  It's five months since it all, six months since it all broke.  I'm not letting it go.  So this is just a little story.  But, and I follow Virginia Roberts, now it's Virginia Giuffre on Twitter.  And she started calling out people like Naomi Campbell who were at all these parties, who hung out with Jelene Maxwell.  And to be clear in this Jerusalem Post article, they're like, they keep calling her socialite.  I'm so sick of that.  She is a pedophile sex trafficker.  She settled out of court with Virginia Roberts.  Virginia Roberts in a sworn testimony, in a sworn deposition, I always have to make that very clear.  Virginia Roberts didn't accuse her of raping and trafficking her on social media or in some interview.  She said it in a sworn deposition, and the way a sworn deposition works, you're under oath.  You're under penalty of law.  If you lie, it's perjury.  That's punishable.  So you better know what you're doing.  And there's no earthly reason for Virginia Roberts to threaten, oh, she's trying to get money.  No, she's not.  They've threatened her life.  There's no way.  This is real.  And all these people who are around, this thing about Virginia Roberts, I've seen interviews with her, Virginia Roberts Dufresne, is she's like, everybody knew about it.  There's no way this can happen without everybody knowing.  And you know what?  It's a multi-billion dollar global sex trafficking industry.  That means cops are in on it.  Jeffrey Epstein's pilot, who flew his helicopter and flew the Lolita Express, oh, his plane crashed a couple months ago?  That's weird.  But Virginia Roberts isn't backing down.  This is her calling out Naomi Campbell.  You saw me at parties.  You saw me in Epstein's homes.  You saw me on the plane.  You saw me get my haircut.  You saw me on the streets.  You watched me be abused.  You saw me.  Awareness, justice, Jalene Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein, Naomi Campbell, Prince Andrew.  Yes.  Trump's tied to this.  There's new depositions of Trump, of a woman accusing Trump.  You know?  So it's really like, I want to bring that up for you.  Because I just got this.  Let me bring this up here.  It's pretty graphic and pretty horrifying.  Now, you can't read any of this.  I know it's very detailed.  But it is like material witness.  This woman, Katie Johnson, right?  In April of 2016, put this down here.  It's talking about Epstein and Donald Trump, you know, being raped by Trump and Epstein.  Bill Clinton, so Trump, this is a woman accusing Trump of raping her and Epstein, him and Epstein raping her.  We know Trump was on his plane at least once.  We have all these other connections with William Barr, right?  Acosta, we know Bill Clinton was on the plane 26 times.  This is the thing, the diehard Clinton people and the diehard Trump people won't look at the other.  The people that don't like Trump bring this up and they never acknowledge Bill Clinton.  And the people that support Trump and hate the Clintons never bring this up.  I'm sorry, they're all guilty.  They're all filthy guilty.  So Bill Clinton was on Epstein's plane 26 times.  Hillary was on two times, right?  They were at Epstein's compound in New Mexico, which this woman talks about going to.  So let's not forget that.  I know this isn't, there's a lot, they still haven't found her, and oh, Epstein, we don't know what happened to him, but let's not forget, let's not forget, here's Jalene Maxwell at Chelsea Clinton's wedding.  This is after she had settled out of court with Virginia Roberts Giuffre.  Right?  So everybody, I don't know.  I don't know what's happening.  I don't know what's happening.  So we're going to keep following this.  They're hiding Jalene Maxwell.  The Mossad is covering her.  Looks like it.  Her dad was in Mossad.  John Kiriakou, former CIA, said that's what he thought.  FBI.  is now investigating her.  Formal charges need to be... She's also in a lawsuit with Virginia Roberts to try to block, to suppress evidence from being unsealed.  Because in there is evidence of like photos and all this stuff that really... So we're all gonna keep talking about that until they find her and hunt her down.  Put him in prison, put Trump in prison, put Hillary in prison, put her in prison.  The ruling class is awful.  They're all awful.  You think the Republicans and Democrats are different.  They're all filthy and corrupt.  They're all part of a global pedophile sex trafficking ring.  There's your ruling class, everybody.  They're all friends.  They're all pals.  There's your ruling class.  Thanks for watching the show.  Hey everybody, like, share, and subscribe.  Hit the bell notification button.
