How do you, and I know that you were a seminarian at one point, how do you, you know, not drink yourself into a stupor?  How do you deal with the ugliness of the world? ",

            "text": "So why did I react the way I did when Obama gave his speech to AIPAC?  Because I have people I care deeply about in Gaza as friends and I'm not going to betray them.  And I just can't.  Why did I lose my job at The New York Times?  Because I have friends in Iraq.  I mean, I don't be overly dramatic, but I knew that they would die and some of them did die in that war.  And I can't betray them.  I teach in a prison.  If you don't walk out of a prison and you're not angry, something's wrong with you.  So I think the problem with the liberal class is that oppressed people are abstractions.  And that's what's dangerous and that's what kills us.  But when those of us who are privileged, especially white American men, have real relationships, which doesn't mean that I pretend to understand where they're coming from or what their lives were like.  I try to understand.  But I'm also cognizant, because I spent 20 years in the developing world, that privilege is a form of blindness.  And as much as you struggle to understand what it's like, for instance, to be a Palestinian in Gaza, you never can.  And if you honor that division between privilege, and oppression and recognize and acknowledge that blindness, then you can have real relationships with oppressed people.  Most of my students are African-American, very poor.  And that's what keeps you whole because it becomes personal.  and hope becomes personal, not rational, I suppose.  I mean, I have taught for 10 years in the prisons, and I have one student who was \u2013 charged, picked up at the age of 14 for a crime.  I'm 100% certain he did not commit, coerced.  He is 14 years old.  He weighs 90 pounds by three detectives in a Camden City police station.  The sign of confession he can barely read.  He's declared an adult at 16.  He's tried at 17.  And he's given a sentence where he's not eligible to go before a parole board until he's 70 years old.  So I taught a course called Conquest.  He's one of my best students.  He's got a 4.0 average.  This is all through Rutgers University, which allows them to earn their BA degrees in prison.  It's a great program.  And he waits after class.  We read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Open Veins of Latin American, C.L.R.  James' Black Jacobins on the Haitian slave revolt, only successful slave revolt in human history.  And Haiti's been paying for it ever since.  And So he's my only A plus.  and he waits till the class leaves and he says, I know I'm going to die in this prison, but I work as hard as I do because one day I'm going to be a teacher like you.  And he walks out.  That's hope.  I'm going to change the world, but I can live on that.  I still live on that for a long time.  And maybe we only change the world one person at a time anyway.  But I think the problem of liberal elites is that they actually don't have relationships with oppressed people.  And and that's dangerous because when you have real relationships, you will and you care.  You will stand with those people no matter what.  And you will be angry at what is done to those people.  And that's what Augustine says.  Hope has two beautiful daughters.  Anger and courage.  Anger at the way things are.  Encourage to see that they don't remain the way they are.  And I think rooted in those personal relationships will keep you whole and keep you radical.  But if you don't have those relationships, it's very easy to fall into despair and cynicism. ",
