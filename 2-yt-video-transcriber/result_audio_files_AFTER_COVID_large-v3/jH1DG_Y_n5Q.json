            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 29 May 2020.  Well, real brief on the stock market.  The stock market is, I'm talking U.S.  stock market now, is in a confirmed uptrend.  And yes, there was a sell-off on Friday, but the weekly gains pretty much held.  So regardless of what the fundamentals show, The market being overvalued in so many ways.  Nonetheless, you can't fight the tape.  As they say, market is in an uptrend.  First story up, the S&P cuts Rolls-Royce credit rating to junk on the COVID-19 hit.  Spoke about Rolls-Royce in the last week's perspective and talking about it's not the automobile manufacturing.  It has to do with Rolls-Royce.  aircraft engines and of course these big corps borrow and borrow and borrow And they pretty much have availability to borrow no matter what the ups and downs of the economic situation is, but obviously can't go on forever.  And with the hit that the airline industry has taken at large, S&P found it necessary, I guess, to cut their ratings.  This is just a precursor to a lot of things that are changing, as we all know.  Next up is another Reuters article.  U.S.  core capital goods orders shipments tumble in April.  new orders for key usb capital goods timber tumbled in april and ship mr klein bolstering expectations that the cv crisis will lead to the deepest economic contraction in the second quarter since the great depression.  so you're starting to see this come out more and more.  i mean reuters is pretty mainstream.  we know who owns it and you know they're kind of prepping i think the the public at large to be prepared for what's ahead.  And what's ahead, folks, is going to be quite interesting.  Very seldom do I do a weekly perspective without getting into Zero Hedge.  And another great Zero Hedge article for your weekend reading.  It's really not that long an article, but definitely can help.  gather every word.  free speech and free markets go hand in hand.  we have neither very well written.  the basis is the headline.  i won't read it to you but it's amazing what really is taking place and i'm sure a lot that follow my work are quite uh quite perturbed at what's really going on, but yet I do think that we have the ability to turn things around, believe it or not.  Wolf Richter does great work, Wolf Street.  Week 10 of the U.S.  labor market collapse, still getting worse at gut-wrenching pace, but signs of a bottom appear.  I agree with Wolf.  Has the collapsed U.S.  labor market finally bottomed out?  I would or will have to get worse.  basically shows the increase of jobless claims, unemployed, etc.  And you can read the article, but you can see that we will probably reach a bottom at some point, probably in the not too distant future, actually, as things are starting to open up in most states.  But nonetheless, this is going to be a severe contraction with the labor market throughout the United States, and he breaks it down here by states.  He sees the top 28 states by initial claim for unemployment claims.  Referencing back to the first article I posted with the downgrading of Rolls-Royce debt, Austin from Reuters, American Airlines says to cut management and supply staff by 30%.  Again, the airlines are basically decimated.  I really think you're gonna see not only a huge contraction in air travel, But I think you're going to see huge increases in prices.  And a lot of these routes that the airlines had available, let's say just six months ago, are just going to go away.  In fact, I'm looking at a flight that I've taken many, many times into the Southern Hemisphere, and the availabilities are much less than they were, again, just six months ago or so.  Switching topics, this is from UPI, headline, Historic Swarm of Locusts Descends Upon India, Destroying Crops, something I've been jumping up and down about for several months now on these weekly perspectives, and that is the food supply is diminishing as we speak and will continue to do so, and it's going to cause a lot of pain and agony throughout basically the entire planet.  some places of course harder hit than others and basically as the waste system is set now it depends on how rich the country is and not necessarily in food supply because some rich food suppliers just can't eat their own supply.  it's shipped off to the highest dollar so it's basically based upon ability to pay for it.  Anyway, India has experienced a historic swarm of locusts, as the country also deals with the CV-19.  Swarms of the desert locusts have descended upon portions of states, and I can't pronounce all these Indian names, so I won't.  And while alerts were issued in the capital of Delhi, warning that the insects could arrive there.  So, devastation.  I've been following this for a while.  This is not a first one.  It's been happening again and again and again, and the results are... obviously detrimental to the human species.  Right in line with the previous article, again from the UPI, UN warns 14 million in Latin America could go hungry due to pandemic.  Well, pandemic locusts supply chain breakdown, weather conditions.  I mean, there's a lot of factors that are moving into this situation, but the UN World Food Program warned that some 14 million people in Latin America could go hungry this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The figures released late Wednesday for 11 countries in the region, including the Caribbean, suggest a substantial increase of some 10 million people suffering from severe food insecurity this year compared to the 3.4 million facing the same condition last year.  There's been a lot of comments that are very recent due to Donald Trump's stance on the social media platforms.  And this one from Charles Hugh Smith is absolutely worth it. ",
