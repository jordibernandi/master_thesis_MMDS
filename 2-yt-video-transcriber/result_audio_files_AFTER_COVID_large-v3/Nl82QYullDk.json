            "text": "I have therefore chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived.  and that is the most important topic on earth, peace.  What kind of a peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek?  Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war, not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave.  I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, They're the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and build a better life for their children.  Not merely peace for Americans, but peace for all men and women.  Not merely peace in our time, but peace in all time.  Our problems are man-made, therefore they can be solved by man.  And man can be as big as he wants.  No problem of human destiny.  is beyond human beings.  Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable, and we believe they can do it again.  Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.  We all breathe the same air.  We all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal.  We must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together.  In too many of our cities today, the peace is not secure because freedom is incomplete.  It is the responsibility of the executive branch at all levels of government, local, state, and national, to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means within our authority.  It is the responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels, wherever the authority is not now adequate to make it adequate.  And it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this country to respect the rights of others and respect the law of the land.  And is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights, the right to live out our lives, without fear of devastation, the right to breathe air as nature provided it, the right of future generations to a healthy existence.
