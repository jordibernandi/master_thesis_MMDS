What have the senators been doing for the last two-plus months?  And the fact is, right now, 74% of Americans are for cash relief during the pandemic.  They know that it's helping keep the economy going and keep groceries on the table and roofs over people's heads.  74% in 2020 might as well be 98%.  It's infuriating that we're still at this point, that we're having these conversations and it's August.  And as you just pointed out in the last segment, millions of Americans are facing eviction and worse because of the end of these unemployment benefits that have been keeping millions of households afloat.

They're actually showing that in many cases, people that got these benefits were trying harder to find a job.  But every dollar has been going right back into the economy, Ana, and the drop to $200 would be very, very difficult, even disastrous for many millions of households around the country.  We should just listen to the American people and say, look, everyone knows that the economy is at a standstill during this time.  We've lost 40 million jobs.  42% of the jobs we've lost are gone for good, according to economists.  So we need to put these supports in place, enhanced unemployment benefits, direct cash relief to families.  and aid to states that will keep the states from having to lay off workers of their own, which is the last thing you need during this recession.  that's teetering again on the edge of a depression if Congress does not get its act together.

I would just say that there's no reason we should be at this point on August 2nd.  And that I put mainly on the Republicans because the Democratic Act, the HEROES Act, The House passed it over two months ago.
