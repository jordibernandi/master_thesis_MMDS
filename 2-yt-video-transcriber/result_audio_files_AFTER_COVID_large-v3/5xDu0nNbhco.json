            "text": "Hello gentlemen, and today I want to talk about a very obvious red flag.  I'm sure many of you have noticed in your observations, but women who pride themselves on doing the least amount of work or the least amount of feminine activities and duties are is an incredibly blatant red flag that any man should obviously avoid.  But it's become something that's so proliferated throughout our culture that is somewhat unavoidable.  And there's different degrees to which women engage in abandoning their feminine qualities.  I think to that recent Cardi B song, and there's a phrase in there where she says, I don't cook, I don't clean, but let me tell you how I got this ring.  And yes, it's a dumb pop song, but it's also a real mantra of women nowadays, especially younger women.  They pride themselves and almost make it a competition to see how high tier of a man they can get with the least amount of work.  So solely relying on looks, which degrade.  We know this, they hit the wall and their looks degrade.  So as a woman, why would I invest in something that has a deteriorating value over time, dramatically?  If I were a woman, I would invest in my skills to be a homemaker and to provide for a family in that way and to be supportive instead of solely relying on something that's going to deteriorate over time.  that's completely out of my control.  But apparently they can't see 10 steps ahead in front of them.  You know, this is something that was obvious to women before feminism.  It was passed down.  Women had skills that were passed down.  Just like men, they would have their fathers pass down trade skills and life skills to them to be the... rulers of their household.  women had skills and traits passed down to them by their mothers.  and now feminism has tossed away any traditional feminine qualities and encouraged women to abandon them but not in favor of anything productive.  because they can't take masculine qualities they can't handle them.  that's why they're masculine qualities.  women can't handle the masculine qualities.  That's why the rates of criminals coming from single mother households far outweighs the rates of criminals coming from single father households.  So if women can't handle masculine traits and they're abandoning their feminine traits, then what are they getting in return?  Nothing.  Nothing.  They give up their feminine traits and just do nothing.  and they're the dead weight on society that offers nothing in return besides an easy lay and a pretty face to look at for a little bit until all the makeup and the drugs and the booze and the late nights and the cock carousel takes its toll and they hit the wall earlier than they should have if they lived a healthier lifestyle.  So any woman who prides herself on not cooking, not cleaning, not being a homemaker, who disdains any traditional qualities of femininity is an automatic red flag and should be immediately disqualified from anything beyond a casual lay at that.  And it's become so common now that you'll be hard-pressed to find a woman who even wants to entertain the ideas of traditional feminine qualities.  And it's so hard to distinguish between the chameleons and those who may be genuine.  Because some women come from traditional households where their mothers still pass on those qualities and they genuinely do have those qualities and want to uphold that end of the feminine spectrum.  But then you have the chameleons who understand.  And these are more conniving.  And I have more of a, not a respect, but an understanding of how they're playing the game.  And they're seeing all their competition, all those other thoughts, and thinking to themselves, how can I be different and stand out from the crowd?  because it no longer requires anything to be a thought.  You get a pair of yoga pants, and get a phone with a camera on it, and take some Instagram pictures of your ass, and now you can attract pretty high-tier men, and you just keep the sex flowing, and you can keep them around for long enough to find a beta provider, or not even a beta provider, an upper-tier man.  So how do these women stand out?  They become chameleons.  They pretend to be anti-feminist.  They pretend to be traditional.  They pretend to be something they're not, and men fall for it.  That's just something that men will have to learn on their own because they will continue to fall for chameleons.  Eventually, with a chameleon, the mask will slip.  The facade will cease.  And a man will see the chameleon for her true colors.  And what he does after that point is a test of his character.  Because if he stays there, then, you know, he wasn't meant for anything besides being prey for the chameleon.  And hopefully men will see through the chameleons because they can't keep up the mask for long.  If you press them in the right ways, they'll fold.  They talk a lot.  They have a big game.  They talk a lot of traditional talk.  But when push comes to shove, they'll fold and they'll reveal they're just as anti-woman, traditional feminine qualities, just as a feminist, as the short-haired, blue-haired... creatures that we've come to know so readily through the culture, through the academic environment.  This is not something that's going away anytime soon.  This is entrenched in the values of our culture, because it's a torch that's passed on between the different generations, and this goes for men and women.  Now, the torch for masculinity has fallen.  It has, but there's a renaissance, a rediscovering, because men are the independent sex, whereas women are dependent on the state of masculinity.  But the passing of the torch from the mother to the daughter has fallen, and it's burned down the house.  They've dropped the torch and it's burned down the fucking house.  And these women today will not be able to pass on feminine qualities and feminine traits to their daughters because they don't have any themselves.  And so this problem will continue to perpetuate itself indefinitely until men put their foot down and demand a change of the culture.  But that won't happen.  Because enough men have withdrawn from the culture and become independent of it.  That the only men left engaged in propping up this facade are the weak men who go along with these anti-feminine women.  So, I don't see how this gets resolved because... The ball's in their court and they won't adapt because they don't see a need to until the crisis is at their doorstep.  But the crisis is already at their doorstep and they don't even know it.  These women are going to be single and or single mothers and they'll be there living in poverty with their shitty jobs, stuck in life with no mobility at all and they'll wonder to themselves how they got here and they won't have any ability to reflect and understand their mistakes they made along the way because the culture will continue to reinforce and justify their choices and their decisions until it becomes suicidal to even have a debate and argue with these people and try to show them the wrongs in their actions because now they'll come for you in your career and your livelihood and it's not even trying to fix their situation because they're lost at that point.  a lot of these women are already beyond helping and Once you've had a body count above, I'd say, six or seven, your ability to pair bond is completely deteriorated.  So they cannot pair bond anymore.  They can't even rationalize a relationship that would last long enough for the pair bonding mechanisms to even try to be repaired.  So, trying to illustrate to these women the errors in their ways is more so a way to act as a warning to the women coming up to not be like them.  If you don't want to be a single thought, you know, just getting railed down every weekend with no real stability in your life, no substance, then don't do what she did.  But we can't even have that dialogue as a society.  So as a society, if we can't even have a conversation, then we just have to let these women go through their life making these mistakes and irreparably damaging themselves and those around them.  So if you ever see women openly abandoning their feminine qualities, quickly disregard them because they're of no consequence to you.  So until the next video, guys, take care.  I don't cook, I don't clean, but let me tell you how I got this ring.  You were nice until we married you and then you showed your true colors.  What you say, that you only meant when. ",
