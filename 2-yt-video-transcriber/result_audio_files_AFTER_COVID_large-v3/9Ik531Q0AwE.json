The amount of sound bites and things that we can play from Jerry Nadler over his long and unsuccessful career is a ton.  But this was, I don't know if you saw this.  Something's off with Nadler.  We knew that, but something is now really off with him.  This was a scene yesterday, roll seven.  He's leaving the podium, sort of. ",

If you do, then that's between you and God.  That's between you and whoever else.  But I just don't.  But something is clearly wrong there, right?  The two options that I see are either he crapped his pants.  He slowed up a lot there, and then he kind of waddled off.  So there could be a fecal disaster going on.  Or he had some sort of stroke or something else happening, which, again, I don't wish that upon him.  But something's wrong there.  And between the gaffes that we see on a daily basis and the one we just played from Biden, which was a little bit earlier this year, what just happened there with Nadler, what we see from Pelosi all the time, what we see from all these people, folks \u2013 These people are prominent leaders in our country.  We can't have that.  We can't have people who are unfit.  We shouldn't be voting in ones with radical ideas and philosophies and or people like Joe who have since caved to radical people and philosophies.  And we can't have people who can't even get off of a damn podium, whether it's because he pooped his pants or because he has a health issue.  I don't care.  You need to be able to do your job.  And you need to be able to do it in a way that inspires confidence from the people.  And I'm just not seeing that.  I'm not seeing it in so many people.  You see it from Maxine.  You see it from Feinstein.  You've seen it now from Nadler.  You see it from Pelosi all the time.  Whether she seems like she's having an health issue or she's drunk, whatever the case might be, it's time that we do better.  We have to be better with who's serving.  But, you know, Nadler, Pelosi, all these names I just rattled off, they've been in government forever.  I mean, we're talking forever.  Nancy's in her 17th term.  17th term.  And this was her yesterday talking about impeachment. ",

And I have confidence that he won't get away with saying, for example, I won with the popular, the vote on the ground, the vote in the mail doesn't count and the rest of that.  What am I missing here about people just not saying, hold it, calm down, Mr.  President?  Now, we do know who he admires.  He admires Putin.  He admires Kim Jong-un.  He admires Erdogan in Turkey.  He admires people who are perpetuating their roles in government.  But he reminds him, you are not in North Korea.  You are not in Turkey.  You are not in Russia, Mr.  President.  And by the way, you are not in Saudi Arabia.  You are in the United States of America.  It is a democracy.

And she said he's not worth it.  There's 40 days left.  She's not worth it or he's not worth it.  Excuse me.  So at least for now, we've got a 40-day reprieve where maybe that won't be talked about.  And she's pushing hard on, you know what, let's just vote.  We've got 40 days.  Let's just vote.  Let's do just vote, folks.  Let's get out there and dominate on Election Day because I think we can.  I think they've set themselves up for that.  I think going down \u2013 I think they know that going down \u2013 she doesn't actually think he's not worth it.  She just feels like she gets stymied everywhere she goes, everything she does.  Trump shoves it right back in their face and they look like fools.  And they don't want to look like fools again so close to the election.  Do I think that impeachment could happen again once he wins?  Yeah, of course.  There's going to be all sorts of crap that happens after a Trump victory, which I do think is going to happen.  I might be wrong, but I do think it's going to happen. ",
