If I lived in Canada, I'd be stacking the Maple Leaf for the most part.  If I lived in Mexico, it'd be the Libertad.  I believe stacking the coin of your country is the best thing that you could do, in my opinion.  However, I do stack other coins as well.  I do stack Libertads.  I do stack Maple Leafs.  But like I said, predominantly, it's been the Silver Eagle.  Up until recently.  Because what did we see happen in March of 2020?  The spot price of silver tanked.  for a very quick period of time, and then it slowly but surely made its way back up.  But ever since it tanked, premiums have been cranked up through the roof.  When silver dropped down to about $12, premiums were cranked up from $2, $3, $4 to $5, $6, $7, and it was really as if we were converting the same exact amount of currency into the same exact amount of silver, even though spot price was significantly less than what it was before.  Believed at the time that this was a business tactic.  I believe that they were trying to prevent Loss of currency and also continue to rake in as much currency as possible because at the end of the day they are a business.  But that was in March of 2020. a couple months had gone by a couple things have changed a couple things have come out and a Lots going on right now Especially in August 2020 which is where we are right now.  spot price is about 28 dollars and change.  the premiums on silver eagles are through the roof and i said this the other day back when spot price was maybe 25 26. i said give it a couple days.  i have a very strong feeling that it's going to be incredibly difficult to get our hands on silver eagles for under 40 a pop.  and here we are right now.  most sites are selling silver eagles for 37 38 39 40 41 dollars a piece through the roof.  unfortunately like i said the silver eagle is my favorite piece of silver to stack coins rounds and bars.  i stack the silver eagle more than anything else.  however i have not picked up a single silver eagle over these last couple of weeks, or even over these last couple of months.  But I wanted to talk about it today because there's a couple of different reasons for the premiums on Silver Eagles to be so high right now, at least to my knowledge.  I'm sure there's more to the story, and this is also a little bit of speculation as well.  But before I get into my opinions and the speculations, I want to talk about the facts.  A lot of people right now are saying that there's a shortage of silver, silver shortage, blah, blah, blah.  I would say no, that's not necessarily the case.  However, in a weird way, it's almost the case.  There's not necessarily a shortage of silver, but there is a shortage of silver that's being mined.  A lot of the mines are closed right now.  A lot of the mines have shut down and less silver, a significant amount of silver, is not being mined as it's supposed to be right now.  so a lot of the mines are shut down less silver is being brought up above ground and that's just what's happening right now.  so in a weird way.  it's almost like a silver shortage although it's not a silver shortage.  it's a mining shortage.  but with the silver that is being mined the small fraction of silver that is being brought up above ground in comparison to any previous year the smaller amount of silver that is being mined, there's also a shortage of silver being minted for that same reason.  They have less silver to work with.  And not only that, but just a couple days ago, or maybe it was late last week, the US Mint said that they're gonna be stopping or reducing their minting this year for the time being, just because of everything going on in the world right now, along with a bunch of other factors as well.  But point being is that the amount of silver coins that they are minting is going to be significantly reduced due to everything going on right now.  So that right there is one of the facts.  And now I also wanted to talk about something that I've just been speculating.  Actually, two things that I've been speculating.  The first one is that the Silver Eagle, as of next year, will have a brand new design.  Now, that's not speculation.  That is a fact.  But here's what I'm thinking.  Here's my theory.  The Silver Eagle has always looked like this.  It has always been exactly the same.  This is my 2015 pocket silver.  And here is a 1987 Silver Eagle.  They might look a little bit different because they're in different condition.  This one's much more shiny and this one is much more dull.  1987 and 2015.  This one's from a couple decades ago, this one's just from a couple years ago.  Same exact design.  You flip it over, same exact design.  Point being is that the Silver Eagle has always looked like this.  It's always been this way.  But starting next year, things are gonna change.  Silver Eagle's gonna have a brand new design.  So what I'm speculating is that due to the fact that the 2020 Silver Eagle is the last year of having this design, I think a lot of people are trying to stockpile as many 2020 Silver Eagles as they can because they are no longer going to have this design.  There are millions and millions and millions and billions even of Silver Eagles with this design from 2020. all different years over the last couple of decades, but starting next year, this design will be no longer.  So I believe a lot of people are happily paying a ridiculously high premium for Silver Eagles because the design is going to change.  But there's one other reason that I think the premiums on Silver Eagles are through the roof as well.  which is, I believe 2020 is going to be somewhat of a key year, a key date, somewhat of a milestone, because let's be honest, whether it's a silver eagle, whether it's a maple leaf, whether it's a silver bar or a silver round, or even if it's not precious metal at all, if it has a 2020 on it, it's almost as if it's like a survival badge.  Like, oh man, I made it through 2020.  So imagine in 15 years, you're having a conversation at work or with a family member or something, and somebody brings up 2020, it's almost like you're gonna be getting those 2020 flashbacks.  Like, oh my God, that year was disastrous.  That was like a terrible, horrible year.  So I feel like anything with a 2020 on it is probably gonna be worth more to begin with just because it's from that year, that crazy, terrible year, which we are currently in the middle of right now.  And by the way, I just wanted to point out that some of these Silver Eagles are in fact in airtight capsules, which are also kept in airtight tubes.  I did that when I first got started stacking because I didn't really know any better.  I thought that that's probably what you should do.  So the Silver Eagles that I have in little capsules right here are the only Silver Eagles that I put in capsules.  And after I started the first tube, I realized I didn't really need to do that.  Ever since then, I have just been buying empty mint tubes.  I get a multi-pack for just a couple of bucks, and if you guys want to do that as well, I will leave the Amazon affiliate link in the description in case you want to get yourself a mint tube and slowly but surely fill it up on your own, because that's what I do.  The link will be in the description.  There's a couple different reasons why the premiums are so high right now.  And there's really nothing we can do about that.  I mean, I said it in the video a couple days ago.  It's also supply and demand.  So as long as people are happily paying, these sites can happily charge that amount of currency.  And with the Silver Eagles being listed at or around close to $40 right now, I mean, on one site alone, in order to get a Silver Eagle for under $40, you would have to pick up 500 or more of them, which by the way, would run you about $20,000.  So if you don't have $20,000 laying around that you're willing to convert into Silver Eagles, I mean, a lot of Silver Eagles are gonna run you over $40 a pop, which in my opinion is, Kinda terrifying, but here's the solution for the time being.  It's a temporary fix as far as I'm concerned.  This is just something that I've been doing over the last couple of weeks.  I've been getting and focusing on generic silver and 90% silver.  Reason for that is because silver, silver.  at the end of the day, even though the American Silver Eagle, the beautiful, beautiful American Silver Eagle, it's the foundation of my stack.  It's what I've been stacking predominantly.  for the last two and a half years for the most part.  Unfortunately, I've been forced to take a step away from the Silver Eagle and focus a little bit more on the generic silver rounds, the silver bars, the 90% silver instead.  Because at the end of the day, like I said, silver is silver.  Whether it's a coin, a round, or a bar, whether it's three nines fine, four nines fine, 90%, or something else, whether it's a one ounce, a one troy ounce denomination, or a five ounce denomination, a 10 ounce denomination, a kilo bar, or one 14th of an ounce, which is what a 90% silver dime is, regardless, anything you can do right now to break down the premium for yourself, anything you can do to get as much money for your currency, I believe is the way to go.  And from my personal experience and from what I've been doing for the last couple of weeks, I have found that it's best to focus a little bit more on generic silver and 90%.  That's just my opinion, I'm not a financial advisor, so don't take it as financial advice.  This is all for entertainment purposes and it's to initiate a conversation.  So number one, I'm curious.  What are your thoughts?  Let me know in the comments.  But two, I wanted to talk a little bit about 90% silver right now, so I have a little bit sitting here in front of me.  I have some 90% silver dimes.  Let me go and grab some silver half dollars or silver quarters.  I have some right over here.  Because with a little bit of simple math, you can figure out exactly or roughly.  rather, silver quarters, dimes, or half dollars equates to about a troy ounce of silver.  The reason I say that is because silver eagles are a troy ounce of silver, but if you were to work with some half dollars instead, which might make a little bit more sense to you right now at this specific point in time, because these are of a lower premium.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I don't want to say that 90% silver or generic rounds and bars are a low premium right now because the premiums on everything have been cranked up significantly in comparison to where they were pre-March of 2020.  But they might not be low premium, but they are lower premium than the American Silver Eagle.  And these right here, if you wanted to have right around a troy ounce of silver in silver half dollars, 90% silver half dollars, you would only need three of these.  And three of these, the silver content equates to about a troy ounce of silver, significantly lower premium than getting a troy ounce of silver through one silver eagle.  Quarters, on the other hand, another good alternative.  Washington quarters are probably the most common, at least from my experience.  It would take about six of these to equate to a troy ounce of silver.  Four.  Six.  This right here.  It's about a troy ounce of silver.  And picking up six of these would run you a smaller dollar amount than one of these.  Troy ounce of silver.  About a troy ounce of silver.  half dollars, quarters, but it's also silver dimes as well, doesn't matter if they're mercury dimes, doesn't matter if they're Roosevelt dimes, I have a little of each in here.  It would only take about 14 silver dimes to equate to roughly a troy ounce of silver.  Again, lower premium, The con would be it's not pure silver, but that doesn't really matter to a lot of people.  But people like me who prefer pure silver, I guess you can consider it to be a con.  But the pro is that it's still a troy ounce of silver.  when all added up, 14, not to mention lower premium.  I would also say that's a pro.  And here's another pro.  This is broken up.  What if you need to break an ounce of silver?  What if you need to, quote unquote, make change for an ounce of silver?  It's hard to do with a silver eagle.  I guess one could argue you could melt it down and divide it up, but without having to deal with that headache, if you needed, let's just say, half a troy ounce of silver, get seven of the 14 silver dimes.  Get three of the six silver quarters.  if you need two thirds of an ounce of silver.  Get two silver half dollars.  So with a little bit of basic math, with a little bit of strategy, with a little bit of simple calculation, you can figure out exactly how many silver dimes, quarters, or half dollars equates to a troy ounce of silver.  If you can count up to 14, you can figure it out.  It's relatively simple.  So that right there is my alternative for the time being.  That right there is my speculation as to why the premiums on Silver Eagles are so through the roof right now, along with some of the facts.  That's what I like to do in my videos.  I like to present some facts, and I like to present some opinions.  But at the end of the day, it's all for entertainment purposes.  Once again, I'm not a financial advisor, so do not take my videos as financial advice.  It's also to initiate a conversation, so I'm hoping That's something that I said in this video can spark a discussion in the comment section.  Let me know your thoughts.

And once again, I want you guys to head on down to the comments.  and what are your thoughts on the Silver Eagle right now?  Do you think that 2020 being the last year of them having this particular design has anything to do with the premiums being through the roof?  Do you agree with me on the shortage of mining and the shortage of minting playing a role as well?  And the fact that 2020 is a pretty crazy year and might end up being a key year or a key date or whatever you want to call it?  And do you have any alternatives?  when it comes to silver at a lower premium.  How are you stacking right now?  Are you still stacking the Silver Eagle regardless?  Or have you moved on over to generic silver, 90% silver?  Or maybe you're paying more attention to gold right now rather than silver in general.  Let me know your thoughts in the comment section down below.  Thank you guys so much for watching.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And remember, don't you dare stop smiling.  Peace. ",
