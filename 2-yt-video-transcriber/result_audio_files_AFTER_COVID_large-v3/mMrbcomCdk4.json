            "text": "All right, let's go through the ones that are in the courting category.  So, you've either just met or you're sort of flirting and you're not even sure if maybe there's mutual attraction yet or maybe there is but you haven't actually started dating.  So, first red flag that you want to pay attention.  two is if she is stuck up or snooty.  Number two is if she is critical of everything and everyone.  Guaranteed you're going to be on that list she'll be critical of in short order.  Number three along those lines is the never ending test.  So, if she's constantly testing you you can never pass these tests even though you're actually a decent human being and you've displayed leadership and confidence and you haven't actually screwed up in a major way.  then she might be damaged goods or she... Well, yeah, pretty much that.  So, you should watch my damaged goods video or damaged women emotionally damaged women video and or my why does she continue to test you playlist.  I'll put those in the link below.  Number four, your values and or beliefs don't align.  If she's a hardcore feminist and you're a hardcore traditionalist then you might not be able to find common ground enough so that you're going to have a happy relationship.  And number five, Again, along those lines is your long-term goals don't align.  So, maybe she wants to settle down and have kids right away and you still have another 10 years to build your career before you even want to think about that or maybe it's the other way around.  So, if your long-term goals are really in conflict then you're going to have a difficult time progressing in a relationship if that's what you want.  Number six, she disses everybody.  So, she's basically rude or disrespectful to strangers, friends, peers, pretty much everybody.  Again, if she'll do that to everybody else she will do it to you even if right now she's not because she's on good behavior.  If you stay with her you will end up in that category as well of being disrespected.  Number seven, if she's admitted to a string of bad relationships and it's always the other person's fault either she's choosing poorly or she's the common denominator and she's not very good at relationships.  Red flag.  Eight, she has loser friends.  So, again if her friends display any of these qualities well, you know, we kind of are the sum of the people that we hang around with the most.  So, if she's hanging around with people who are not good people.  If you wouldn't date the qualities of her friends not never mind the what her friends look like whether male or female it doesn't matter.  But if her friends are really not people that you would decide you would want in your life you're like oh, this is the kind of person I would want to be in my life.  then that's a red flag.  Nine, this should go without saying but it doesn't always if she's a gold digger or shallow.  Now, if you make lots of money and you're super shallow and you just want like a babe on your arm okay, well good that'll work for you.  But if you're not that and your only value to her is what you can do for her or buy for her then that's a major red flag.  And number ten if you're courting or just getting to know someone if she dresses super provocatively because she needs validation from other men because she's insecure then that's not a good sign.  that's a red flag, that's a red flag.  Okay, let's go on to what if you're dating.  So, she's checked off all these boxes she's not missed anything on these first 10 and now you're dating and here's some other signs that you should watch for.  She's flaky, unreliable or cancels plans and doesn't make up for it with apologies in her actions.  So, she may apologize but then she just keeps doing it and she doesn't change her behavior.  So, her apology in her actions have to be congruent with her behavior.  So, words and actions of apology are congruent.  if that's not the case that's a red flag.  Two, it's never her fault.  it's always your fault or somebody else's fault.  If even if it's always somebody else's fault eventually it'll always be your fault.  Number three, you can never disagree about something big or small without her getting emotionally aggressive or passive aggressive or flying off the handle basically.  Four, she insults your character instead of addressing the specific behavior she'd like you to change.  So, if she calls you stupid or inconsiderate or any kind of name calling is a red flag.  She should address the specific behavior.  I really wish you'd text me if you're going to be late.  I really would appreciate if you could.  whatever, whatever it is it's the behavior not something about your personality that she's attacking.  Five, she's stingy whether it's with money or time or compliments or any of the good positive things in a relationship.  Six, she embarrasses you in public or in front of people that you know on purpose and thinks it's funny.  So, she has a twisted sense of humor that makes you feel bad, red flag.  Seven, She lies even when it's safe not to.  So, what I mean by this is that as you know if you think you're going to disappoint a woman you might tell a white lie.  Well, you know I ran into so and so.  that's why I'm a little late because you don't want to hurt her feelings because you're disorganized or it happened again or whatever.  Whatever it is that is a small white lie which I personally don't like but everybody's different.  But if she can never tell the truth then she will never tell the truth.  This will come back to haunt you at some point.  major red flag.  Number eight, she has a double standard.  So, it's okay for her to go out with her friends and party all night but it's not okay for you to go out and party with your friends all night.  come on.  Nine, She breaks promises over and over and over and over.  You can't rely on her word.  She is all lip service and not true action.  And number ten, she's super jealous and insecure.  A little bit of jealousy is natural, a little bit of insecurity is natural.  We're all a little bit flawed but if she's super insecure, if she's hacking your phone, your computer, or anything like that and you haven't given her any reason to.  if she's showing up you know, late at night because she doesn't trust you and she thinks that you're boning Ashley then that's a major red flag.  All right, so let's move on to relationships and again like I said some of these can overlap so you'll just have to watch for yourself.  So, number one and again we kind of went over this earlier but it's super important.  So, she is never wrong and she never apologizes.  So, this is different than just being wrong or doing something wrong and apologizing but not her actions not matching up.  This is where she's just simply never wrong and she never apologizes.  There will never be an apology come out of her mouth or through her actions.  So, sometimes it can be really hard to say the words.  I'm sorry, but we might be able to make it up by doing something special.  that should indicate very obviously that we are contrite for our actions.  that can work sometimes if you don't need the actual words.  But if she's not willing to do either of those things either with the words or through her actions then that's a major red flag.  Number two, it's all about her.  So, if she ever actually does something nice for you there's a hidden agenda.  But most of the time it's just really pretty overtly all about her, she's selfish.  Three, she never compromises.  So, it's her way or the highway.  quite similar to number two it's all about her.  But she just refuses to compromise either because she's selfish or because she just doesn't want to give in.  Even if it doesn't have any negative effect on her life she just simply refuses to compromise.  that's a major red flag.  Number four, you end up fighting more than you uplift each other.  or the only time that you have great nooky.  nooky is when you've had a big fight and you're making up for it.  Number five, you're afraid to share your truth.  this kind of goes along with the lying thing.  You're afraid to share your truth with her because of the fear of her irrational reaction.  Number six, she uses guilt trips or manipulation to get what she wants.  Now, if this sounds like you you'll want to watch my nice guys video.  Number seven, she says things that are mean to purposefully hurt you especially if she does this when you're not fighting.  Yes, we all lose our temper sometimes and say mean things when we're fighting.  But if she actually does this when you're not even fighting because she needs to suppress your self-esteem so you won't leave her which is kind of, I mean, it's kind of weird that sometimes people do this because they want to tear you down so you don't think you're good enough for anyone else.  But if she does this that's a major red flag.  that's emotional abuse.  Number eight, your only bad relationship is with her.  So, if all your relationships have conflict and difficulty and negativity then the problem might be you, you're the common denominator.  But if all your other relationships seems pretty healthy and happy and positive and your only bad relationship, your only difficult relationship is with her that's a big red flag.  Along those lines is number nine.  If she tries to control your life and especially if she tries to restrict your time from other healthy relationships with friends or family then major red flag, major red flag.  Ten, she has extreme highs and lows.  So, she may have a mental health disorder.  maybe BPD is how we call it bipolar or borderline personality or maybe one of the others.  I'm not an expert on those.  I did do a video on narcissists so you might want to watch that.  But if she has like really high highs and really low lows and it's just a roller coaster all the time and you never know what you're going to get that's actually a red flag.  You may actually enjoy that because it feels stimulating to you but there's something within you that's not that healthy.  if that's what you're digging on dude.  And of course if she's physically or verbally violent that's like a huge red flag.  you need to seek help like call a crisis line and get some counseling.  because that's like the majorest major red flag ever.  Just thought of something extra actually.  If you have displayed any of these qualities in a relationship and you might still think you'll do it again then I think you should take my wake up to love program.  It's not just about becoming the man that your ideal woman will want to be with and that you will respect the most but it'll help you resolve some of these issues that create self-sabotage in your relationships without having to delve into what created it.  You don't have to go through all your childhood stuff.  But yeah, so check that out.  link below.
