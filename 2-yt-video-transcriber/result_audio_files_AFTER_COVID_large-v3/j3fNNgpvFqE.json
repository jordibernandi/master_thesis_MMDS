            "text": "Thank you.  And of course, I think a lot of us who came out of it are familiar with the phrase cognitive dissonance.  And that's really what I felt for a couple of years was this cognitive dissonance.  At the same time, I was doing some visual effects work for a motion picture, which stopped.  And when that job was done, I had another couple month break.  And I decided, you know what?  This has been really bothering me.  I'm going to go find the very best scientific Christian claims that are out there.  I was just going to go find them and absorb them.  over the couple months I knew I was going to be off.  And then I could just be free.  Then it would be like, oh, I don't have to worry about this anymore again.  Now I know all the answers to these questions as they relate in the Bible.  So I picked up, Googling which are the best ones, I picked up the Answers books by Answers in Genesis.  So if you guys are, anyone's familiar with that ministry, they have a set of four books, it was three at the time, that ask the basic questions.  Where did Cain get his wife?  And, you know, all the little, how did kangaroos get to Australia?  All these little questions that you're supposed to, how did all animals fit in the ark?  So I was like, this is the best book.  I'm just going to read this, and it's going to be great.  So I start reading it, and I could feel my jaw drop as I read through.  And it's like, I don't know anything about science.  I've just accepted, based on authority, everything I've ever been told.  But this is crap.  Like, this was shit.  These answers, I knew nothing, but I could tell these were wrong.  And the one I kind of laughed, the one where I remember throwing the book in the air was the one I mentioned was how did kangaroos get to Australia?  Because literally the answer was kangaroos probably jumped off some logs and floated there because a lot of logs float around in that area.  And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?  I didn't say that at the time because I wouldn't have been allowed to say it.  But I threw the book up in the air and that was when I decided, okay, I need to at least read the other side now.  Like the other side... which I never would have dreamed to go look at.  I'm like, what do they say?  Like if their answers are just as bad, maybe no one knows anything.  So I started picking up, you know, Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss and, and all that kind of stuff.  And I was in way over my head, of course, but, but it was just immediately obvious to me that young earth creationism, I didn't give up my faith, but younger creationism was a joke and garbage.  I went from, so I, it took me six months or so to plow through all that stuff.  And I hadn't even figured out the YouTube part of it yet that there was, you know, communities that could help me.  So I'm like, okay, this can't be true.  And this is a big, big problem for Adam and Original Sin.  That was where my head was at.  And not only that Adam had a literal sin, but Jesus specifically referenced Adam, like according to the Gospels he did, and Paul as well in his writings.  And so, well, like if this was a big metaphor, then those two didn't get the joke, right?  Those two didn't.  They thought Adam was a literal figure.  And I grew up fundamentalist.  The Bible was inerrant.  So when you do that, you know, the smallest chink and all of a sudden it's nothing.  Suddenly it crumples because... I think for those who grew up maybe more liberal Christian and that some of it's allegory and some of it's not, you can probably reconcile this evolution thing.  But for me, it was all falling apart.  So then I started... saying, well, where did this Bible book even come from?  I went through Bible school, and I, you know, I was top of my class, and I learned, you know, where I thought all this stuff kind of came from, and I started studying the scholars, and I actually even called up Bible school professors, and they're all like, oh, yeah, we know Moses didn't write those books, and oh, yeah, we know half of the Pauline epistles are forgeries, and we, like, you guys know this, and you don't tell your students, you don't tell people from the pulpit.  I just started... I kind of was spiraling at this point because like nothing that I'd been raised to believe was holding any water of any kind.  So it was that second piece investigating the Bible itself that made me an atheist, even though I jokingly call my first video, Ken Ham made me an atheist.  Ken Ham really made me know that young earth creation was crap, but that sent me then to investigate the, further.  And then I got into mythicism for a while.  I was like, Oh, maybe Jesus mythicism is a thing.  I've now kind of backed off from that only in that, uh, I don't, that's just an intellectual exercise that I can enjoy on my free time.  Um, but my primary mission, my primary thing that keeps me going is, um, all of the people who are basically left behind of all the people who I know who are still younger, first, including my three children, um, So shortly after I... it took about a year for me to admit to anyone.  And that was my spouse that I, um, that I thought I was an atheist.  And in fact, it was funny that Casey was talking about Seth Andrews.  Seth Andrews was the person who made me realize that there was a label for what I was called.  He was doing the Josh Farstein, a hundred thousand dollar challenge thing at the time.  Um, and I'd never seen anything like that before.  And I'm like, Oh, atheist, that's a word.  That's a word I can, I can use.  Uh, and I guess we had that debate yesterday.  Um, Anyhow, so once I admitted to someone that I think I might be an atheist, that set a big spiral of events that I wasn't in control of, that I was outed without permission.  my own permission.  Um, my pastor, uh, advised my ex to kick me out of the house.  Uh, you know, I lost business associates.  I lost basically everything.  I lost.  Um, and shortly afterwards I was, uh, diagnosed with some illness.  So I had this whole real whirlwind of shit storm that happened after, uh, after I came out.  But once I kind of got my footing again, um, I have a really great relationship with my kids again.  Uh, But they are uncomfortable talking to me about the religion thing.  It's just not something they're comfortable talking to me about yet.  But I know they will be someday because our relationship is good.  But because of my health scare, I was also like, I don't know if I'm going to be around to tell them what I want to tell them.  So I started a blog, but that wasn't really adequate.  So I started my YouTube channel.  And my original plan was to... tell my three kids everything that I would want to tell them in case they aren't open to it until too late.  So that's how Apologia came to be.  Obviously, I have some kind of passion for animation and visual style and that stuff all interests me.  But that's, I guess, a long version of answering your question. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  To address earlier, that's partially why.  Now, ham and eggs is a whole separate thing.  If anyone's familiar with my channel, I do a ham and egg news show.  And that's kind of for me to be a little bit snarky.  But all the science videos, you'll never hear me swear because I know that as a fundamentalist Christian, the first time you hear the word fuck, you don't hear a single thing after that, right?  Like nothing... then it's just that gives them the excuse that everything after this is evil and horrible and it's just a mad person.  and they're bad even though obviously in a different language a different word would set you off.  so that's partially why on my channel you're going to see that sensibility.  you don't see me get old earth creationism, for example, if my kids become that, that's fine.  So you kind of see me not attacking as harshly as some of you guys do.  If you think about the audience as my kids, it may explain what I'm doing a little better. ",

I needed people like you and the living dinosaur and Logic and all you guys who were totally ripping apart what I used to hold sacred.  I needed that so badly.  I needed... someone to attack it viscerally and to give me permission to do the same and to essentially to kill it.  Like, I think you guys are probably not converting too many said in their ways people, but when people, once people have admitted to themselves that they're on a spectrum, I think that the message you guys give is so valuable.

Some people suggest, well, just get your thumbs down, and those are probably all the theists, but... Anyway, I get, as I'm sure you do, I think probably all of us do when we get the same stories.  People are messaging me privately, regularly, that I'm helping them in some way or another.  And that definitely makes the all-nighters worth it when that happens.

It's kind of like what you said earlier when you were working on your comic book that, you know, those seeds were planted in your head and then you were the one to convince yourself, you know, I don't know if you would describe it that way.

What I wish I had more, and what I try to... emulate a little bit.  um and there's evidence that i am is that i wish i had role role model people that had come out.  i wish i had known some people who had left so that i could have known what the path looked like.  um so there's value even in just demonstrating what it looks like when someone comes out okay.
