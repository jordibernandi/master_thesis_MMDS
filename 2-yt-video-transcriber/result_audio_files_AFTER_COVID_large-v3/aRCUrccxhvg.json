            "text": "What the hell is going on here?  What the hell is going on here?  What kind of a vehicle is it?  We're going to have to start walking.  Is that cool?  Yeah, dude.  Oh, you're getting out now.  I got my pistol in the door.  Which side are you rolling to?  My side, looks like.  No, this is far enough.  You rolling your window down?  No, I will not.  No?  No.  Okay.  Do you have any weapons inside?  Um, I'm not answering any questions.  What's the reason for the pullover?  Why'd you pull me over?  I wasn't stopping you.  You almost wove off the road there.  Well, you guys are damn near half in the road.  I got around you.  You had somebody who wove off the road.  Oh, no, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  Yes, sir, you did.  No, I did not.  My name's Officer Stowell.  I'm with the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Right.  And you need to show me your hands right now.  Hey!  For what?  What did I do?  Look at your hand.  Look at this hand.  Look at this hand.  Hey.  I did not almost swerve off the road.  Now you're going trumped up shit, dude.  Yeah, you are.  It's all on video.  Yep.  Look.  No.  No?  No, I don't think so.  What did I do?  You're trying to chump some shit up, dude, for nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  I'm not chumping anything up.  Yeah, you are.  I need your license, and the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance, sir.  Hold on.  Let's see what he found.  Oh, shit.  Oh, open the glove box, bro.  It's in there.  I'm not helping this pig at all, man.  He pulled you over for no reason.  I'm not helping this piece of shit.  I'm not doing nothing.  I'm not reaching for anything either, so.  Where's your body cam at?  Where's your body cam at?  Am I detained?  Am I detained?  Am I detained?  There's my insurance.  Am I detained?  Am I detained?  I can't understand you.  Yes, you can.  Am I detained?  Hey, I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  Okay?  I'm leaving.  If I'm not detained, I'm leaving.  You understand me?  You said you're leaving?  Yep.  If I'm not detained, I'm out of here.  You're leaving the scene of the... Right now.  What scene of what?  The scene of a Fourth Amendment rights violation under color of law?  Fuck him.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  there's no traffic.  don't bark bullshit orders.  there's no traffic.  shut up shut up.  what's your name and your badge number?  everybody that's gonna stop here.  what's your name and your badge number?  This is a Fourth Amendment rights violation under color of law.  You guys got an AR-15 sitting here, you fucking idiots.  Are you that stupid?  you're going to leave a running vehicle with an AR-15 in it?  You're blocking the easement.  What are you guys doing this for, man?  We never went off the road.  We avoided you guys by 10 feet.  Gave you guys all the room in the world.  You guys are violating people's rights.  Hey, sir, do me a favor.  Step out of the highway, please.  Please step out of the highway.  I don't want you to get run over.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  You guys are... This is a Fourth Amendment rights violation under color of law.  You do understand that, right?  You have zero probable cause for the stop.  There is not a traffic stop here.  Shut up.  Stop barking bullshit orders.  What's your name and your badge number?  You've got me on the side of the highway.  What's your name and your badge number?  What's your name and your badge number?  It is, sir, it is your policy to identify yourself.  Identify yourself.  You are a public servant.  You need to identify yourself to the people.  What's your name?  I'll be the one asking the question, sir.  What is your name?  So I can ask you questions too, right?  Okay, so you're going to violate your policy right now?  You're not going to give me your name and badge number?  I'll be following the complaints.  Storer.  S. Storer.  This is ridiculous.  What was your reason for the stunt?  You have zero reason.  We avoided you guys, gave you guys 15 feet.  So you guys wouldn't be in danger of a... Step away from the vehicle, ma'am.  Step away from the vehicle.  Step away.  I'm going to need, for my safety, I'm going to need you to step back at least 10 feet during my investigation here.  Back up, please.  Turn your body cam on.  Turn your body cam on.  This is fucking ridiculous, man.  Blocking easement.  What are you guys going to do anyway?  You guys have zero jurisdictions.  You're here to help.  What are you going to do?  You can't enforce any Arizona revised statutes.  What are you here for?  Help them do what?  Violate people's rights?  Give me the honest answer, man.  What are you guys really here for?  Their safety?  And what are you going to do?  Protect them.  It's ridiculous, man.  Come up with a bullshit excuse, this gentleman here, on why you guys are pulling us over.  Because we gave you 10 feet.  That's the law.  To pull over a little bit to give you guys room while you're conducting your stops.  We gave you the room and he says he's swerving.  It was on purpose.  We're doing under the speed limit.  And we swerved over on purpose for this bitch's safety.  And for this motherfucker's safety over here.  And for all of yours.  And you're going to stop us and violate our rights over us?  Moving over for your safety?  The fuck?  What's wrong with you people?  Seriously.  It's terrible, man.  Fourth Amendment rights violation under color of law.  Take a look.  Why don't you Google it up?  That's exactly what this is here.  I'm a constitutionalist.  It's terrible.  You're lucky I ain't driving this fucking thing right now.  If I was driving it, I'd take the fuck off.  And I'd let you guys fucking pull me over and beat me down.  See what you got.  I'll calm down for two seconds.  Let me ask you an honest question.  All right.  Can I, can I ask you an honest man to man question?  Thank you.  We have some really weird times going on right now with our federal government.  Really weird things with this COVID-19 and everybody's rights are getting violated right now.  I've been watching it every day.  When shit really hits the fan, when shit hits the fan, and it's martial law, are you going to be for the people?  Or are you going to continue to follow orders?  Just a question heart to heart.  I really would like to know the answer to that.  It has nothing to do with this situation.  No.  It has to do with your personal... So that answers my question.  We the people outnumber you government officials, so when it comes that time, I hope it doesn't, but when it comes that time, you should probably choose your family over your job.  You really should.  You understand what I'm saying?  Good.  Fuck you.  How's that sound, bitch?  You're a fucking punk, dude.  You're pulling them over for no reason because we were for your safety.  pulled over for you.  You're an asshole.  Back up.  Back up for my safety.  Back up, sir.  Fuck you.  Fourth Amendment rights violation right there.  Hold them over for absolutely no reason.  Go fuck yourself.  How's that sound?  Piece of shit.  Back up.  Keep backing up.  Keep backing up.  It's called the walk of lame.  Keep backing up.  Back it up.  No, they won't give any names.  They won't give any names.  We'll file the complaint pursuant to the video.  You guys are real fucking safe.  Go fuck your mother, you piece of shit.  What are you looking at, bitch?  You're gonna get in without protecting the lady?  Oh, God.  Why don't you go protect the fucking border, man?  It's your job.  What the fuck you doing pulling people over, innocent people, for no reason?  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do?  What you gonna do?  Huh?  What United States codes have been broken?  Not a goddamn one.  You can't do shit.  Stick that thumb up your ass.  Come on.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  I hope you get stuck.  Get out of here.  Come on, bitch.  Stick this to your mother.  You all right?  They violate your butthole a little bit?  They got you?  Are you sore?  I'm sore.  I'm sorry, man.  I feel for you.  Nothing I can do at this point.  Look at these fucking guys.  Fucking bitch.  I'm going to walk it out. ",
