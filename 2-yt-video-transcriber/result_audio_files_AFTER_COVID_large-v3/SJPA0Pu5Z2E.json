Not only that, but they are trying to hide the fact that their parents are doing all the work by calling their father an investor and their mother a housekeeper.  What a joke.  They are taking charge of people when they haven't earned their position at all.  This seems to happen quite frequently when women run things.  They try to flip words around to conceal the reality of their situation instead of doing actual work.  And I say that from extensive experience.  Being a former yoga teacher, I've worked for many, many female business owners.  I've worked for several female entrepreneurs who had their rich husband subsidize their failing yoga studio.  I worked for a manager at a gym whose mommy got her the position.  She was probably the worst manager I've ever had.  And last, a few years back, I had a studio owner ask to meet with me to talk to her about how to put yoga videos on the internet, where she basically asked me to do all the camera work, all the audio, and all the editing for free.  So with that said, this episode of Hotel Hell triggered some harsh flashbacks from my past, and it was very triggering to watch Rena and Vonda be responsible for people's livelihoods, considering how incompetent they are.

Hell, Gordon Ramsay has his own YouTube channel where you can learn how to cook for free from a world-class chef.  But I bet that most of you don't even know how to keep a knife sharp.  Cleaning isn't that hard either.  Do you know how easy it is to clean mold out of a refrigerator?  Some bleach in about five minutes will keep that thing clean for months, if not years.  They aren't even doing the basics.  I mean, certainly, Daddy purchased the hotel for only 300 grand, so he probably isn't going to be able to afford to refurbish all 36 rooms, but you don't have to do that.  In a business situation where you don't have the money to dot all the I's and cross all the T's, you need to focus on the highest priority things that people care about.  And it turns out that most people don't care about all the bells and whistles.  Even with YouTube, a lot of people think you need to have phenomenal editing to run a successful channel.  I can assure you that it does not matter how well you can edit if your content sucks.  So with a hotel, if you show people a nice, competent staff to know the area, if you show people amazing food, if you show people spotless rooms, they will attend your business.  And those things are nearly free compared to what it would cost to remodel the entire hotel.  However, the sisters are too busy blaming all their problems on their staff instead of trying to figure out what their customers want. ",

A bunch of entitled, arrogant children who don't care about the lives they are destroying.  And there are many examples of this in today's society.  Hell, there was one that just went viral.  I'm sure a lot of you have heard what's happening with Marvel.  They picked up a bunch of writers who were obvious diversity hires, and those writers are tanking a business that has survived for 80 years.  How about instead of hiring someone because she's a woman, you hire her because she's a good writer?  How about instead of hiring an African American non-gender conforming zur to get more points at the oppression Olympics, you employ someone who knows what the fans want?  This is exactly what happens when you let SJWs run things.  They destroy everything in their path.  And it's these very people who are always shouting about how they are the most kind, the most helpful and caring and moral people.  Really?  Do you care about all the comic book stores that are going to go out of business because nobody's going to buy a book with two lead characters named Safe Space and Snowflake?  Do you care about all the industries that are dying because you spend more time on propaganda than actual storytelling?  It sounds like you care a lot more about your paycheck and your job title than you do about all the livelihoods of those people who are going to lose their jobs and their businesses.  Feminists love to complain about men owning everything.  Well, do you want to know why men are always at the top?  It's because no one gives men anything.  We don't get laws that force us onto company boards like women do.  We don't get gender quotas.  We don't get lowered standards in the military so that we can have a higher rank while being less qualified.  When people hand you everything on a silver platter, you don't learn the necessary skills you need to survive on your own.  You don't push as hard and you don't do things like you mean it because you know someone is just going to do the work for you when you fail.  You want to know something else?  Men feel ashamed when they are given things they didn't work for.  However, women feel accomplished when they use their vagina to get things they didn't earn.  And when you do that, this is what you get. ",
