            "text": "People don't like to wear masks, especially a lot of my people.  And I mean, hell, I kind of understand it.  You think I like having to cover up this glorious Lyft ornament everywhere I go?  No, this was supposed to be my gift to the public at large.  I gotta keep it wrapped no matter where I go.  That's no fun, but it's what we gotta do.  They don't see it that way.  They say, it infringes on my freedoms.  It doesn't keep you from getting coronavirus anyway.  Of course, we know you're wearing them to keep it from spreading to others.  But that's where we lose these people.  As soon as you start talking about the benefits of others, you can just see their eyes glaze over.  They don't care.  But what's worse, they get offended when you wear a mask.  Two of my buddies from back home have told me separate stories about being accosted at the gas station for having a mask on both times by someone who was clearly in a high risk group.  How infuriating is it to do something for the benefit of others and have one of those others call you a dumbass for it?  It would be like if you were camping in the woods and pour out your campfire at the end of the day, being responsible, but before you could dump the bucket, some little pill-head squirrel runs up to you like, What are you doing?  Forest fires are just liberal bear propaganda smoke.  He's a pawn of Soros.  It's fake news.  I'm like, whoa, little buddy.  Look, I'm, look, I'm not worried about the fire.  I've got a car.  I can leave.  I'm not the one who's gonna die in the fire.  You're the one who'll die in the fire.  I'm trying to help you.  It's my right as a squirrel American to die in this fire.  All right, okay.  It's a forest.  It's enraging.  I told my friends the next time that happens at the gas station, just, light up a cigarette and blow the smoke right in her Nancy Grace face, see how she likes that.  It's kind of the same principle, right?  When we tell people they can't smoke inside, it's not because anyone cares if they kill themselves by breathing dumbly.  It's because everyone else should not be forced to share their shitty air.  But I don't know why I'm wasting time trying to make these arguments.  They're never gonna listen to it.  But I do think there might be a way to sell conservatives on masks, though.  I really do.  The main trick I think conservatives are missing with masks is that masks afford them an exciting new opportunity to pursue one of their very favorite pastimes.  shoving their opinions in strangers' faces.  Think about it, conservatives.  If you want to shove your opinions in strangers' faces out in public right now, what are your options?  Kind of limited, right?  MAGA hat?  Sure.  Simple, straightforward.  You want to get a little more complex?  Maybe a t-shirt with like some crossed revolvers behind a skull and a racist interpretation of the Second Amendment, something like that, right?  Those are kind of your only options.  That, and of course bumper stickers.  Conservatives, who among you doesn't love a horrifically offensive cartoon bumper sticker, right?  Well, here's what you're not understanding about masks.  Masks are just bumper stickers for your face.  See?  Look at that.  Look there.  Now your mouth can own the lips without even opening itself.  And you can be whatever you want.  Look at this one.  Look at that.  Hell, I like that one.  I'd wear that one.  That's pretty sweet, right?  You know you want that.  You want that.  And if slogans ain't really your thing, I get it, buddy.  Words are hard.  I know.  It don't have to be that.  It could be graphics.  It could be pictures.  It could be whatever you want.  The only limitation is your own imagination.  If you want like an elephant garroting a donkey with a rolled up American flag, you sick fucks, you can totally do that.  That's fine.  You can do that.  If you want something a little more fun... Maybe Donald Trump and a bald eagle standing back to back holding up two solid gold glocks like that right there.  You know, why not?  Do that.  You could do that.  You could totally do that.  Give mask a shot.  You don't even have to call them mask.  Don't call them mask anymore.  Call them.  fuck you flash for all we care.  Fuck you flash for all your conservative friends.  Just give it a shot for the love of God.  Try it out.  Who knows?  You might like it, you fucking dummies. ",
