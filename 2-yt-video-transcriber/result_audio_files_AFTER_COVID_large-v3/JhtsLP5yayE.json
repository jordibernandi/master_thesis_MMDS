            "text": "So why does it say there'll be no sea in heaven?  Well, it's very interesting.  When you go through the scriptures, you can notice there's a similar comparison.  The sea and judgment go side by side.  Do you remember in the days of Noah?  Because the people were so wicked, God judged the world by sending a huge flood.  And now because of it, most of our earth is covered by the sea.  And then do you remember Moses?  Do you remember how Moses led the people out of Egypt?  And then the Egyptians started to chase after the Israelites.  And Moses parted the Red Sea.  And the Israelites, they passed through safely.  But as the Egyptians came, suddenly the sea came over and washed them all away.  God's judgment.  And then do you remember Jonah?  Jonah's told, go and preach repentance to the people of Nineveh.  But Jonah had his own ideas.  He ran and he got on a boat and went to Tarshish.  And then the Lord sent a vast storm to get his attention.  And what happened?  Eventually Jonah was thrown into the sea and a great big fish came and swallowed him up.  You see that all the way through the Bible, sea and judgment go side by side.  But this is when it gets very, very interesting.  Do you remember when the disciples left Jesus and went in a boat one night and there was a dreadful storm on the sea and the disciples were afraid, they were scared and they looked out at the ocean and there was what they saw was a ghost walking towards them.  But it wasn't a ghost.  It was the Lord Jesus Christ.  Now, why is that significant?  Because if the sea represents judgment, here's the Lord Jesus Christ above judgment.  He's above being judged.  Why?  Because he's the only one to walk planet Earth who is totally righteous.  So when it says in Revelation there'll be no seed, what it means is in heaven there'll be no judgment.  Because if you've put your trust in the one who is righteous, the Lord God makes us like him.  He makes us perfect.  And when we get to heaven, there'll be no sin in us.  There'll be no desire to sin and there will be no need to be judged.  There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  number two in heaven we will get to gaze at the lord god's face for all of eternity.  revelation chapter 22 verse 4 says this they that's the christian shall see his face and his name shall be on their foreheads.  one of the most precious verses in the bible says this one thing i have desired of the lord that i will seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.  Are you smiling?  Well, you should be because when we get to heaven, the wait will be over.  Finally, we will see the face of our God.  You know, when I was at university, there would be weeks and weeks would go by, months even, when I wouldn't see my family.  But my dad would drive over to the university halls to have breakfast with me, and I can still remember it now when I'd see his face in the car park.  There was something so kind about his eyes, something so lovely about his face, that I knew that this man loved me.  Well, I think when we get to heaven, imagine that.  But times a million, times a billion.  That's what it'll be like when we see our father's face and we look him straight in the eyes and say, thank you.  Thank you for loving me and saving me.  But some of you, when I say the word father... Perhaps a shudder goes down your spine.  You don't have any fond memories of your father because he abused you.  But for you, when you get to heaven, it'll be even more precious because you will get to experience a father for the first time, a heavenly father.  And for all of eternity, you'll cry out, Abba.  Daddy, Dad, I love you.  And that kind of really leads us on quite nicely to number three.  Listen to what Revelation 21 verse 4 says.  And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.  There shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.  There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.  So come on now, talk to me.  Some of you have had a really bad year.  The harvest that has come your way this year, the harvest you have reaped this year has been nothing but sorrow and pain.  But forget about this last year.  Some of you watching this right now, your whole life has been etched with pain.  You've carried the chains of sorrow for years and years now, but know this, whether you've been abandoned, whether you've been afflicted with illness, whether you've been cheated on, abused, you've been poor, you've struggled your whole life.  When you get to heaven, if you are trusting in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, there's a promise that God himself will wipe away every single tear.  There'll be no tears in heaven.  The only tears, if there will be any, will be tears of joy where we will cry out in thankfulness to the one who cared so much about us to send his only begotten son to die for us.  Fact number four, in heaven there will be no marriage.  Listen to Matthew chapter 22 verse 30, it says this, for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.  Now some of you, you really do love your spouse.  And it kind of bothers you to think, for all of eternity, I won't get to be married to them.  For all of eternity, I'll lose that intimacy.  And some of you, perhaps you're listening to this now and you've lost a loved one, your husband, your wife, and it's all you want to do is to be able to hold them again and to be close to them.  Well, there is some comfort to take from this.  When we get to heaven, we will be reunited with all loved ones who have trusted in the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.  And in heaven, there will be perfect fellowship where there won't be arguments, there won't be those embarrassing discussions that you have with your husband and wife.  You will get along with them better than you got along with them on earth.  But the question does still need to be asked, why is there no marriage in heaven?  Well, guys, we need to remember this.  Marriage is just a dim reflection of the great picture, the great marriage of Christ and the church, the bride of Christ.  So why would God give us just a reflection when one day we're going to receive the real thing?  You see, all the way through the Bible, in the parables, there's this picture of this wedding feast, this marriage supper of the Lamb, which is going to happen one day.  And when you get to heaven, even though you've enjoyed being married in this life, you'll think, wow, this is even better because now I'm married to God.  and number five when we get to heaven all of the residents of heaven will be praising god for all of eternity.  after these things i looked and behold a great multitude which no one could number of all nations tribes peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.  What does it do to you when you hear someone drag God's name through the dirt?  What does it do to you when you hear someone say, OMG, blaspheming the name of the Creator God?  What does it do to you when you drive past a church and you see it's empty?  What does it do to you when you drive past churches which have fallen to pieces because no one's been there for years and years?  What does it do to you when you look out at the crowds like Jesus did and see them like sheep without a shepherd.  Well, when you get to heaven, all those longings, all those desires, which don't belong to the natural man, they'll all be fulfilled in heaven.  Because in heaven, there will be millions, billions, a number that no man can count.  of people praising the Lord Jesus Christ.  There'll be Africans who are watching this channel now, we'll be praising Jesus together.  There'll be Indians, there'll be Americans, South Americans, Europeans, people who live in igloos, all around the world.  Everyone from every nation, from every timeline, from every generation, there'll be people worshipping Jesus Christ for all of eternity.  That, to me, sounds like the best thing in the world.  Some of you, you've travelled the world, you've seen beautiful mountains, you've seen glorious wildlife, you've seen Caribbean beaches, sunlit skies, you've seen all kinds of amazing things.  But when you get to heaven and you see person after person from every tribe, every tongue, every nation, Millions, billions, more people than you can ever imagine praising Jesus Christ.  On that day, you will rejoice like you've never rejoiced before.  Now, I'll never pretend that I'm the smartest guy around, but I do know one thing.  I would be completely stupid, completely naive to believe that every single person who watches this video is going to the place we've talked about, is going to heaven.  So whether you've listened to the message a thousand times before, or if you've never ever heard this message, I'm begging you now, please would you watch this video all the way through and hear the greatest message that was ever told, the message of the gospel.

And I want to answer this question by telling you a true story.  A number of years ago there was an English aristocratic gentleman, a man called Sir Roger Bolter.  and one day he went into the town of Colchester because there was a circus on.  there was a fair and he was enjoying himself.  you know he was watching the jugglers having a great time watching the clowns and then he notices that the town clock had begun to chime and a bit like a child would do he starts to count the chimes of the clock 1 ",

            "text": "4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 as he's just thinking did i?  am i hearing things here?  a little man walked up to him and said i just heard that clock.  there it chimed thirteen times.  did you hear that too sir?  and sir roger boulter said yes i heard it too.  i thought i was going crazy but obviously not.  we there must have been a fault or something and he wouldn't have thought anything much of it.  but he had a diary which he took everywhere with him And he wrote down in his diary, the clock chimed 13 times today.  And away he went.  Now, you need to know this about Sir Roger Bolter.  He wasn't a man to hear voices in the night.  He wasn't a man to have vivid dreams.  But one night he woke up with this sudden loud voice saying, go to York, go to York.  And Sir Roger Poulter said, oh, this is ridiculous.  I'm just hearing things in the night.  Anyway, that next morning, as he's eating breakfast, he could not get that voice out of his head.  Go to York.  Go to York.  So he said to his servants, harness the horses.  We better go to York.  As he arrived in York, there was a big crowd of people standing there.  Hundreds, thousands of people in the town centre of York.  And he pulled one man aside and he said, what's all the commotion?  What's going on?  And the man said, oh, haven't you heard the news?  Oh, it's a murder trial.  The last day of the trial as well.  We all want to know what the outcome is going to be.  So Sir Roger Boulterie followed all of the crowd into the courtroom and he couldn't quite see over their heads but he heard this very authoritative voice say, do you have anything else to say for yourself before I pronounce you guilty?  Your Honor, I am not guilty.  I am innocent.  I was more than 400 miles from the scene of the crime when it happened.  I stood there in Colchester and there was a clock and it chimed 13 times.  There was another man.  He stood there too.  He heard it with me.  Oh, if only he was here today.  If only he was here, he would prove my innocence.  And Sir Roger Bolter's eyes lit up and he lifted up his voice and he said, I am that man.  Now I know why I was supposed to come to York.  And he went down and he found his way to the dock and he said, look, here in my diary, I wrote it down.  The clock chimed 13 times.  And there was a bit of whispering going on.  And the judge looked down and went, very well, innocent.  And as Sir Roger Bolter and that little man walked out of the courtroom, the little man looked up to Sir Roger Bolter and said these words.  You know, there's not a man in all the world who could save me but you.  There's not a man in all the world who could save me but you.  Friends, there is only one man who can save you from sin and the consequences of it.  And that's the God-man, Jesus Christ.  Here's how it works.  Take a good look at me now.  As you can notice, I've got a wedding ring on my hand.  So I'm a married man.  Do you think that I've ever made my wife cry before?  What do you think?  Do you think I've ever made my wife cry before?  I have.  You see these eyes?  Do you think that these eyes have ever looked at anything?  That if I could show you the things I've looked at at times, I'd be totally embarrassed.  What do you think?  They have.  You see these fists here?  Do you think that these fists have ever hit anyone before?  They have.  But now ask me this question.  Am I going to heaven?  I am.  Not because I've done anything good.  As you can see, I'm not a nice person.  I've done bad things.  But I'm going to heaven because there's two types of people that get to heaven.  Perfect people and forgiven people.  Now, is there anyone watching this right now who's perfect?  We're not, are we?  But every single one of us can be forgiven because 2,000 years ago, this God-man, Jesus Christ, he entered the world and he took the form of a man, Jesus of Nazareth.  And this man, he taught amazing things.  He healed the sick, he fed the poor, he did wonderful things.  But do you know how this world treat him?  They beat him.  They spat on him.  They smashed a crown of thorns onto his head.  They plucked out his beard.  And then they put nails through his hands and his feet.  And he was crucified between two thieves.  The innocent one dying amongst the wicked.  But the physical sufferings, that wasn't the worst bit.  The physical sufferings which we see on the paintings and we see in the films, that was not the worst bit.  The worst bit was the spiritual suffering.  And it says in the Bible, between the sixth and the ninth hour, darkness fell on the land.  And between those three hours, Jesus cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  And in those three hours, God the Father was pouring out all of his wrath, all of his anger on innocent Jesus for all those wrong things that you've done, for that lustful look, for that anger, for that lie, for all the bad things.  things you've done in your life.  it was laid on Jesus Christ and Christ was crushed on that cross so you could be forgiven so you could have your sins washed whiter than snow and you could be cleaning God's eyes if you call out to him.  and then then they took the Lord Jesus the most perfect thing which ever entered into this world.  they took that limp body off the cross and they laid him in a tomb And one day went by, stillness.  Two days went by, stillness.  But on the third day, Jesus Christ burst forth out of the tomb, out of the grave.  He was triumphant over death.  And that is why Jesus Christ is the only man under heaven by which we can be saved.  That is why Jesus is the only name by which any of us can be saved.  Because Jesus Christ died.  beat the grave he conquered death.  and let me tell you something.  there's a shocking statistic that i bet you've never thought about before 10 out of 10 people die.  i'm gonna die one day.  you're gonna die one day but jesus christ has beaten the grave and if you put your trust in jesus christ he promises to give you eternal life and to give you a hope beyond the grave.  Just like it'd be very, very foolish to jump out of a plane without a parachute, it's very foolish for us to leave planet Earth without putting our trust in Jesus Christ and asking Jesus Christ to be our Lord and Saviour.  So what am I going to ask you to do next?  Will you do it?  Will you call out to this God-man, Jesus Christ, and say, Lord, I've done wrong.  I've done dreadful things against you, O God, and I want to be forgiven.  I know that I can't earn my way to heaven.  Heaven is a gift, not a reward.  There's no good amount of deeds we can do to earn favour with God.  The only way we get to heaven is by putting our trust in Jesus Christ and asking that our our filthiness, our dirtiness, we would be made clean because the blood of Jesus Christ can wash us whiter than snow.  So will you do it?  Will you turn from your sins?  Will you change your mind?  Will you leave the drunkenness, the lies, the lust, the pornography, all the wrong things, will you leave it all behind?  and say, no, today I'm gonna follow after Jesus Christ.  I'm gonna give my life to him.  I'm gonna repent, turn from it all and give everything to him because he is totally worth it. ",
