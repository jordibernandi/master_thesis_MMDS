In August, FactCheck.org labeled a Joe Biden video partly false because it was, quote, deceptively edited to make him appear lost.  However, the video was not deceptively edited and nothing in the video was falsified.  false.  The reason Joe Biden appears lost in the video is because Joe Biden is literally, by definition, lost.

            "text": "It's true that the video edited out material to highlight Biden's sleepy pauses.  But the mere fact the video spliced together Biden's uhs is hardly justification for labeling the video false.  The fact checker suggests the video should have included a written notification to tell viewers that it was edited.  But why should it when all the edits are available for everyone to see in plain sight?  There's no fancy graphics or editing tricks hiding the edits from the audience.  The video didn't alter the meaning of any words or statements.  So then what's the logic for calling it false and suppressing it?  Factcheck.org labeled it false simply for being edited.  But if editing material to focus on smaller parts even small pauses makes a video partly false, then all videos on Facebook deserve that label too.  After all, literally every video clip and soundbite is taken from a larger context.  Even if a video wasn't edited in a digital video editor, every video presents an edited reality, with at least two cuts.  A start, and an endpoint.  For example, PBS's coverage of Biden's otherwise full remarks omitted Biden's embarrassing moment at the beginning.  Print journalism is inherently edited too.  Fact Check itself used editing when quoting Joe Biden, making Biden appear far more clear and concise than he actually was.  Does this mean that factcheck.org should be labeled partially false information and suppressed on Facebook too?  No.  The nature of media to include some quotes while omitting others is problematic, but it's normal and unavoidable.  It's not possible to have an all-encompassing media, only edited reality.  That's why the idea to suppress material for the act of basic editing is especially disturbing.  That logic could be used to selectively suppress any video, any soundbite, any article, ever published.  Labeling a video false for allegedly making a candidate appear lost should not be a fact checking standard.  All across the media landscape, content is edited to make people appear as anything from the devil incarnate to a divine savior.  What videos should be fact checked on is specific content.  For example, were any quotes or images fabricated or misrepresented?  In this case, the correct answer is no.  So I rate factcheck.org's factcheck ruling false information.  This one Joe Biden video isn't special or significant, but it provides a good reminder that factcheckers should not be blindly trusted.  They're not infallible.  They have their own biases.  So they're just as capable of being false and misleading as any other outlet.  Yet, they have the power to determine what gets labeled false and what gets suppressed on Facebook.  What do you think?
