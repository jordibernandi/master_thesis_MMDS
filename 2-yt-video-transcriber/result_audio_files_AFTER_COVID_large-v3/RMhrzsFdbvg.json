            "text": "You need to present the predominant prophetic words that were going across the church in October, November, and December of 2019 in projecting what 2020 would be like.  One of them said that if the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl, revival will break out.  within four weeks of them winning the super bowl we not only didn't have revival we got a pandemic. ",

            "text": "yes well people are rising up and i'm believing for every single christian watching that still small voice is going to become a heralding cry that cannot be ignored.  and as i was reading your book in one of the chapters and i think your book is broken up in three sections And there's one section called Crimes Against the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit.  And one of them deals with the crime of abusing grace and holiness.  And you give the perspective of Bonhoeffer.  Now, what does the rise of the Third Reich and Bonhoeffer have to do with what we're facing today? ",

            "text": "You know, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was asked how Hitler came to power without the church speaking.  And he called it cheap grace.  Boy, is that ironic?  He said the teaching of cheap grace is how Hitler came to power.  Because of the sense of spiritual entitlement that Lutherans felt that God was in control of everything, and if Hitler was bad, God would take care of it.  And because Hitler was getting immediate results in certain ways, that he should be allowed to become Fuhrer.  And you know, Fuhrer means father.  Germany adopted him as their father.  And so it was a spiritual term from the beginning.  And Bonhoeffer identified it in the mid-30s on radio.  Bonhoeffer said, this man is going to destroy Germany.  And no pastor would stand with him.  And so you look at what was the predominant teaching in the American church when the Democrat Party stood up made its bid to control how we're educated, how we're informed, what would be true, what would be false, what should be investigated, what should be ignored.  They fundamentally altered it.  And we should have known that.  Because that's what Obama said when he ran for president.  I will fundamentally change America.  And you know what that phrase refers to, Alan?  Animosity.  A husband would never say to his wife, I'm going to fundamentally change you.  In order to say you want to fundamentally change something, you're speaking that word out of hatred.  And believe me, the hatred that he instilled in many who were fiercely loyal to him, we're still paying the price for that.  And so cheap grace came into the church again.  We began to hear teachings about, some had even taken it to the point where they said, if you confess your sin to God, you're offending him because Christ not only paid for the sins that you committed before you repented, but all the sins that you will commit in the future.  And then they'll deny it.  Well, we have the quotes, we have the documentation.  They tried to say, well, this portion of 1 John was written to the unsaved.  It was clearly a letter to a church, a home church, about Christianity.  When it says, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness.  Paul even went so far as to say, if we say we have no sin, John said, excuse me, he said, if we say we have no sin, then we are liars and the truth is not in us.  And so this came at the right moment.  The church was muscle bound with its own self-congratulation.  It was convinced that the good times were going to happen.  I know I'm going to get in trouble for this.  Jeremiah had a prophecy, a confrontation with Hananiah.  And Hananiah said, look, Nebuchadnezzar is only going to be alive two more years and we're going to be free of all this mess.  And Jeremiah said, well, God told me 70 years.  And not only that, but y'all are going into captivity.  And so we stopped listening to the true voice of God.  We were seduced by a greasy grace message.  Yes.  And it was designed to appear when it did so that we would be caught flat-footed as we are now.  We shouldn't have allowed our churches to be shut down.  We certainly shouldn't have allowed, now that the CDC has revamped and revised its statement, that this possibly killed directly.  I mean, it's misleading to say only 9,000 people died from COVID because it did contribute to the death of people that had diabetes, heart disease, and were elderly.  But it wasn't.  what the Democrats had said.  And it didn't do what they said it was going to do.  And the church has lacked a strong, united, fierce voice to push back the censorship, the manipulation of our children's minds.  We have the power to do it.  but we didn't.  And I believe that this grace teaching contributed largely to the apathy that we're now facing in the body of Christ. ",

            "text": "Because the same... the same tendency to abuse grace flowed into another movement that came into the body of Christ, where they created a controversy between the Bible and the Holy Spirit.  We had Spirit-filled evangelists saying, I have experiences that the Bible can't explain.  And this is what I really believe.  You have to be in your Bible.  You have to read the Word of God.  You've got to base everything on the Word of God.  You've got to treat a prophetic word as a confirmation and a perk.  But the predominant message from God to you is going to come from within the pages of the Bible.  One man of a large revival movement said, y'all are worshiping a book.  I couldn't imagine anything more that was a greater stupidity than to say that.  another said why are we trusting in a book?  they didn't have more than in the holy spirit they did have.  well that almost if you if you had enough.  uh fatigue of mind and thinking would make sense.  but here's the disaster of that statement.  The Spirit and the Word are not in conflict.  This is like parents arguing in front of the children.  The Holy Spirit and the Bible aren't going to disagree with each other.  The Spirit gives life.  We can't read the Word of God without the help of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is not going to help us to stay out of the Bible.  And so the truth is that if you're listening to any speaker, and he's not teaching the Word of God, rightly teaching the Word of God, and focusing on the Bible, and this is where I'm going to say it emphatically, It says in Proverbs, if I regard iniquity in my heart, you will not hear me.  Let me tell you something.  If you put prophecy above the Bible, God will stop talking to you.  Wow.  That's exactly right.  And you will then wander in to an era where you are under the influence of a familiar spirit.  It all comes back to the Bible.  and to the truths of the Bible.  that must be reinforced.  Now, today they released a poll that 30% of evangelicals they claim do not believe in the deity of Christ.  Okay, that makes as much sense as a screen door on a submarine.  Why would you call yourself an evangelical and don't believe in the deity of Christ.  I mean, this is basic.  Well, the answer is the preaching you sat under.  There were men that didn't reference the Bible.  You know, Alan, there were churches that in their church growth manual said, don't use more than two verses of the Bible in any sermon.  limited to two verses.  People can't handle anymore.  It's the scene out of A Few Good Men.  It's Jack Nicholson saying, you can't handle the truth.  And it's a lie.  The one thing that American Christians are desperate for is doctrinal preaching and contextual breaking down of the truths of the Word of God.  They want the Bible.  The only reason they're not getting it is because it appeals to a certain mindset that the church wants in their pew and that person is poison.  here's what i call them and i say this in the book.  they're high maintenance low impact christians.  we have premium.  we have birth defective american christians that because they weren't discipled in the word from the jump told you must repent the lordship of christ.  somebody invented this this layaway plan where you can have it now and pay later you.  you cannot be born again without first acknowledging jesus is my lord.  i surrender my right to a private opinion on what the word of god says.  And then the sermons became all about, we want to enhance you, we want to help you, we want you to feel comfortable.  Well, let me tell you, growing in God is not comfortable, never has been.  And unless your pastor can open the Bible and lovingly tell you you're wrong, you're not safe.  You're blessed, but you're not safe.  You're feeling good, but you're not safe.  And that's why we can't look at the Democrat Party and say, oh, they stole America.  No, the church gave America away.  Because we ceased to be watchers and standard bearers and watchmen on the wall of God to speak to a culture and say, we're not going to allow that.  Our nation is built on Christ and we're going to stand for that.  That's specifically what we should have done and we didn't do. ",

            "text": "Hey guys, we are excited to announce our brand new mentorship discipleship program.  At Encounter Christ Church, we believe that membership, church membership, should be a means of discipleship.  And we've discovered over the last few months that there are many people around the world who do not at the moment have a church that they call home.  And we believe that everyone should have a local church that they attend.  But should you be in a situation where you do not have a local church of faith-filled believers, we don't want you left out in the dark.  We don't want you out there all by yourself.  So we have established an international online membership program.  Now this course is not for everyone.  It is a serious discipleship program for those who want to be connected with a local church and want to be held accountable as they grow in the things of God.  If that's what you're interested in, if you don't have a local church that you can be a part of and you want to be a part of the Encounter Today family, then all you have to do is go to EncounterToday.com and click on the membership tab in the menu section, and it'll walk you through the process so that you can begin your journey of discipleship.  We're looking forward to connecting with you and to standing in faith with you.  Go to Encounter Today right now.  Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying this video.  Make sure you like, comment, subscribe, share.  Your engagement helps us get the word out.  But I've got an exciting announcement for you.  Coming in 2021, in November of 2021, I'm going to be taking a tour group to Israel and to Greece as we walk in the footsteps of Jesus and in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul.  This is going to be a life-changing experience.  And to get more information, all you have to do is go to encounterisrael.org.  This is more than a tour.  It's a mission, and I believe it's going to change your life.  Let's go together. ",
