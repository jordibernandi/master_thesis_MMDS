            "text": "Excellencies, dear friends from Europe and Africa, and I see many friends there.  Europeans and Africans need to understand each other better.  That's why dialogue like the one today is very important.  in terms of a common understanding of governance.  The attitude of adult supervision has to be left in the past.  Examples of right or wrong conduct can be found everywhere.  We must avoid the temptation to reduce Africa to the lowest common denominator with blanket judgements and generalizations.  There cannot be a mutually respectful partnership premised on the unspoken assumption that one party lacks values or has defective values while the other party is a fully formed moral agent.  The complex of politics, history, and context, and public opinion in every country requires a sensitive understanding and a willingness to genuinely listen, learn, and adapt.  We are not talking about excusing wrongdoing or abusing the principle of sovereignty to evade responsibility.  And there are some who do so.  It is about dialogue, respect, and a commitment to the more robust partnership which both Africa and Europe need in order to prevail over the challenges of the 21st century together.  For Africa, Europe is a partner of choice for many reasons.  I believe that next year's summit is the right time to demonstrate the readiness for change and progress On both sides, this is a place where different voices from either side can be heard and factored into the thinking on the future of our nations.  This includes some important perspectives that are rarely considered, which, if I may, we'll get to in a moment.  In Africa, we are engaging with Europe, with a view toward taking the relationship to a higher level and making sure it is adapted to the times we live in today.  For one thing, Africa has assets and capabilities to offer to the partnership, both human and material.  Let's not ask what can be done for Africa, The guiding question should be what can Europe and Africa do together for mutual benefit which neither can accomplish alone.  We aim to change the terms of engagement on trade and investment.  The African Continental Free Trade Area is now entering the implementation phase.  This opens up new opportunities for more attractive cooperation with the partners who are invested in Africa's prosperity.  It is therefore important to ensure that the space to properly and fully implement the CFTA is respected.  We wish to negotiate the future trading rules on a continent to continent basis not in a fragmented or haphazard manner.  We look forward to the new Africa Europe Foundation and this distinguished group of personalities playing an important role in the process, including the business leaders who are involved.  I thank you so very much for your attention. ",
