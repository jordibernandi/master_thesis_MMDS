This is the security video taken from the day that a Santa Clara County Sheriff Deputy, Officer Gomez, sees my phone, broke my hand, and then unlawfully searched my phone.  The Santa Clara County District Attorney, who is charged with public corruption investigations and prosecutions and charged with investigating the police and prosecuting bad police officers, elected not to prosecute any of the nine police officers who were present this day.  Instead, he has spent three years, 29 hearings, and five judges prosecuting me for taking a photograph and recording police inside a public courthouse.  And you might begin to ask yourself what it could be that the judges and the lawyers in this county don't want us to see. ",

There was a factual finding of innocence on Mr.  Clydeburg.  You had an obligation within so many days to notify the Attorney General of that.  And there's also an obligation under business and professions code that when you're charging and not convicting but charging any attorney that you report it to the state bar.  Valerie Houghton was charged in 2015 and I'm asking for that record.  I'm investigating it and that's not in the file.  I can't find it anywhere.  That would be a public record.  There's nothing confidential in that and I want to see if you reported it to the state bar.  I have a likewise response from the state bar that I've requested.
