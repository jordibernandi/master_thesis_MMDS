            "text": "Good morning people.  Watch 165 Lisa Boyce here.  I'm going to give you the gospel.  I want to answer a question too or make a comment in this gospel.  Someone wrote me this morning and said to me, there's more to do than just believe in Jesus Christ.  Okay?  It says Satan.  She goes on to say Satan believes in shutters.  Jesus goes on to say that Satan believes in Jesus, but he will not go to heaven.  I get a lot of people like that.  She goes on to say here that not only who says to me, Lord, Lord, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.  It goes on to say in Christ, if we're living like sinners but believe in Christ, we will not go to heaven.  And down here it says the Bible is for believers.  There are rules and laws and statutes that we have to follow.  Now, I'm going to stop right there because I don't want to go on with the whole comment.  But I told her I'm going to address this comment.  Let me give you the gospel.  1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4.  Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose on the third day according to scripture.  We are saved by grace and faith in Christ alone.  John 3, 16 is just one of the believing verses that I go through every day.  John 3, 16 says, I gave my only begotten son that whosoever believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  Now, the key word is believing.  Satan knows the Bible, Satan believes, but he doesn't have a heart for the Lord.  The Holy Spirit, the one thing that you're missing out of this, and I hope you're listening to this, The one thing that you're missing out of this is when the person accepts Christ as Savior and believes in the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4, that Christ died and shed his blood for our sins past, present, and future.  It is no longer works.  It is grace.  The Holy Spirit will indwell in that believer and convict that person to righteousness.  Will we sin?  Absolutely.  We do it every day whether we know it or not.  But the Bible says that if we ask for forgiveness, He will be quick to forgive us.  The Bible doesn't say anything about repenting of sins for salvation.  Repentance is a change of mind towards Christ.  So I need to get that straight because people are... You're confusing, you're mixing grace and works.  Not only is that dangerous, that's a false doctrine.  We're no longer saved by works.  Works can't save us, works can't keep us saved.  We're saved for works, but like I said, it won't keep us saved.  You have to believe and have faith in the spilled blood of Jesus Christ for your past, present, and future sins.  Repentance is metanoia, a change of mind.  I cannot understand why this is difficult for some people.  They insist that you have to do something.  They take away the simplicity of Christ.  You can't do that.  Because if you take away the grace, then it's no longer grace that you're saying, this is my works.  then you're saying to the Lord, look at what I did.  I have kept your statues.  I have stayed out of sin.  You're lying right there.  I wanted to get that straight.  The gospel is simple.  Accept Christ as your Savior.  Believe in what he did at the cross, which is 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4, and call out to him.  But you take away the simplicity of the gospel of Christ and put your own stipulations in it and put your own works in it.  Then it's not grace.  And you will hear Matthew 7, 21.  Lord, Lord, look at what I've done.  And he will say, depart from me.  I never knew you.  You worker of iniquity.  I wanted to get that straight.  The gospel is simple.  It is not difficult.  People make it difficult.  I just went through a thing on repentance the other day.  I think in my suggestion to this person, you know who I'm talking to.  Go through the video and look for it.  I'll even link it in the description box for you if you want.  Anyway, Keegan, Brother Keegan sent me something this morning that is not good.  This is a Canadian politician leaks a new COVID lockdown plan and great reset dictatorship.  Excuse me, and Australia is part of it.  I'm going to hurry up and do this.  It goes on to say, power mass state premiers, governors, and prime ministers across Australia, the  U.S.,  the  U.K.,  Canada, and New Zealand may try to push another Dan Andrews-style second wave virus attack as part of the Gates-Rockefeller World Economic Forum push for global vaccination and Agenda 21, the new normal.  the new economy.  Canadian politicians in the loop of COVID planning have been told to their horror a plan for a totalitarian response to an international economic collapse involving a federal government offer to eliminate all personal debts, including mortgages, loans, credit cards,  etc.,  funded by the IMF under the World Debt Reset Program.  Indeed.  In exchange, the individual will forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever and partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would allegedly allow individuals unrestricted travel and living even under a full lockdown through the use of photo ID referred to as Canada's Health Pass.  The horrific scenario comes from a Liberal Party of Canada whistleblower from the party's strategic planning committee, which is under the control of Canada's office of the Premier Minister.  He says the second wave will be hyped up and testing around the end of November.  Now, I'm going to link for the sake of time.  I'm going to link this article in the description box.  I told you all something was about to happen.  And I have been saying there's going to be a second lockdown.  I can feel it.  They're going to try to do a second lockdown.  Especially if Trump gets re-elected.  It's just a matter of time.  Things are coming out more and more.  Before.  This election.  It goes on to say the whistleblower warns of a complete and total secondary lockdown with much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions.  This is serious.  Indeed.  This is very serious.  It says here, rush the acquisition of or construction of isolation facilities across every province and territory.  Expected by December.  Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID-related deaths following the same growth curves.  I'm going to link the article in the description box.  I'll let you all read this for obvious reasons.  I'm not going to... I got dinged once.  I'm not going to do it again, so... I'll let you all read this, but in the meantime, I will be back later with more to come.  Just remember, the gospel is simple, and this is basically for a lot of new people that are listening on this channel.  The gospel is very simple.  You just simply admit you're a sinner in need of a savior, and there's only one savior, and that's Jesus Christ.  The Bible says in the book of John, no man comes to the Father except through the Son.  Accept through the Son, Jesus Christ.  Admit you're a sinner.  Believe in the gospel, which he spilled his blood for, your past, present, and future sins, and call out to him.  It's not rocket science.  It's very simple.  I'll be back later.  Thank you. ",
