Those were all lies, people, because Washington, D.C.  right now has perhaps the greatest wall in America, and they built it overnight.  Here is Nancy Pelosi's great wall, all the way around the Capitol, miles long, protected by razor wire, and really tall.  Today, we're going to show you exactly what makes Nancy's wall a great wall, and we are going to have a little conversation about what makes a good wall.  I can't wait to see what this wall has to say.  Let's go find out.  Roll.  Look at the size of this thing.  Look at the height.  The first thing you want in a wall is something where you're walking up to it and you're like, holy smokes, how am I gonna get over that thing?  This is like, maybe I'm six foot tall.  This is twice my height.  I think this is two, two bennies tall.  This is a at least 12 foot tall wall right here.  Look at the size.  solid, height, good, tall wall.  That's the first thing you want in a wall.  Nancy Pelosi knows that.  That's why Nancy's wall is tall. ",

            "text": "The second thing you want with a wall are protections.  You want the wall to make sure that you can't just go and jump right over it, OK?  You want to make sure that it's going to be a bad day if you try to get over that wall.  This is why Nancy's wall is so special.  It has these nice, sharp razor wires on it that really would cut you right up if you were to try to jump over.  I mean, you'd be sliced and diced.  You'd be like a Greek salad if you tried to jump over this thing.  Razor wire goes all the way down the wall, all the way down, look at that.  Guys, this is like Donald Trump's dream wall, okay?  The wall that Donald Trump goes to bed and like dreams about on the Southern border, Nancy erected here in DC.  Nancy's wall, pretty amazing. ",

You gotta be able to cover the space that you wanna protect and make sure that there's a consistent barrier.  This is really important because, listen, if there's gonna be holes in your wall, what's the point of the wall?  So Nancy's gray wall has some real length to it.  I haven't done the measurements, but we can show you here in a map.  This wall would take the next, Two hours of time if we were to walk the whole thing.  It's miles long.  All of Capitol Hill and the surrounding area is surrounded by this wall.  This goes on four miles.  The next thing that you want with a good wall You want it to be firm, reinforced right down into the ground.  You want to make sure that no one can just push it over, right?  You don't want to push the thing over.  You want it to be anchored.  Make sure that it's anchored, like this one.  This one is a great wall.  This thing is down in the ground.  You can see there's cement barricades behind it that anchor it to the ground.  Iron and rebar.  You've got a firm base here.  So this wall has a good, firm foundation.  That's what you want in a good wall.  Nancy knows. ",

So we made sure, Nancy made sure that on Nancy's great wall, she put a big old gate, gate can close and open, and that there's, I don't know, I don't know, John, what have we got, like 10, 12 people there guarding the Great Wall?  OK, so you got an opening.  They make sure they know who's coming in, who's going out.  And you had people guarding the gate.  There you go.  Look at that.  There you go.  See that?  That's called an ID check.  See, that's an ID check.  They checked her ID, and now they know who's in there, and now they know who's out.  And they figured out that it's called a border control.  So Nancy's Wall has strict border control.  Nancy, good job.  This is how you know you're dealing with wall building pros.  This is how you know that Nancy is a pro at building wall.  You gotta have, if you're a pro level, you gotta have the military vehicles, the armored vehicles, patrolling the wall.  Nancy loves, loves making sure that there's military presence in DC.  Big cars, big trucks, big armor, big wheels, burning those fossil fuels right into the atmosphere.  That's Nancy's big wall for you.  Bravo.  And that is what makes a great wall.  Nancy Pelosi, you have built the wall of Donald Trump's dreams.  This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted on our border for four solid years.  And you told him no.  And you sneaky queen, you just put it right here in D.C.  to protect yourself.  So bravo, Nancy Pelosi.  What a play.  Nancy Pelosi's great wall.  Is it here to stay?  Who knows?  We have no idea.  in Washington, D.C.  They haven't told us.  This could be permanent.  You never know.  But here's what's so important is that, guys, we finally have verifiable proof.  Walls work.  Walls work.  work.  Alright?  That's been Benny for Benny on the Block.  This week, see you guys next week.  Hey, it's Benny Johnson here, Turning Point USA's Chief Creative Officer.
