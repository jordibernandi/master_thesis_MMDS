Now, Dr.  Del Valle did a bump from time to time.  I'm talking about 1968, 69.  This goes on.  When he'd come over, I lived on 205 West 88th Street.  He'd bring the little thing, and him and my mom would talk, and my stepdad.  And then somebody else would be there, like a chick, that would help my mom.  And sure enough, he would come over, put the thermometer in my ass, and then look at me and say, Jose Antonio, I have to give you a needle.  And I'd go, give me five minutes, let me think about it.  And my mom would go, what's going on?  He has to think about it.  I swear to God, you don't take that needle, I'll fucking kill you.  So then they would go in the fucking parlor, they'd put on Cuban music, and I would put cartoons on.  Like, it was inevitable.  And then he would have like two drinks. ",

Stop crying, you fuck.  Be a man.  I'd be like, oh, it's going to hurt.  Stop it.  But I would have an allergy to a certain penicillin.  So the next day my temperature would go up.  So he was such good friends with my mom.  He goes, listen.  This is a continuity thing.  Why don't I just leave you with a penicillin, put it in the refrigerator, I'll give you a couple syringes, and whenever he gets sick, just fucking stick him.  So we were at a restaurant.  I was going to Sacred Heart School for Boys, and my mother was dropping me off at 5 o'clock.  We went to a fancy white people restaurant next to Kearney, New Jersey.  I'm talking violins, like white people in the 70s.  This isn't like now, like ha-ha-ha.  These are very conservative white people.  And this is the double whammy of the day.  You ready?

And I'm like, my mom's like, drink your milk.  I go, I want her cheese, chocolate.  You know, the powder.  In those days, we were either the chocolate powder or the strawberry.  I wanted the strawberry or the chocolate.  The guy goes, listen, we don't have that.  What I'll do is put a piece of ice cream.  I go, give me a milkshake.  You know what this motherfucker did?  He got a glass of milk, and he put ice cream on the fucking thing, like a scoop of ice cream.  So my mom's like, drink the milk.  I go, it's just fucking milk with an ice cream on it.  My mom's like, I'm in no fucking mood for you today.  I'm gonna drop you off at the school, but you better drink that fucking milk.  We're the white people restaurant.  Do you understand me?  In 1972, my mom goes, you got about five minutes to drink that milk.  I had my little military suit on and shit, my little Catholic suit on, because I had to bring you back with a suit.  My mom goes, if you don't fucking drink it, I'm gonna pour it over your fucking head in this restaurant.  And I was like, I'm telling you right now, I ain't gonna fucking drink it.  My mother took the fucking milk, Dumped it on my head in this restaurant.  The fucking ice cream sat on my head.  I had milk dripping.  And then the ice cream slowly melted off my head and fell on my lap.  White people are like, what the fuck kind of discipline is this?  So my mom's like, wipe your face.  So when she wipes my face, Joe Rogan, she goes... Do you have a fucking temperature?  Because I was such a sickly fucking kid.  She goes, you got a fucker.

You know what this bitch said to me?  She goes, then don't sit down.  Stand up.  It's better if you stand up.  Let's go down the hallway and the noise will distract you.  You won't get that scared feeling.  I said, this is not going to end.  Like this bitch was not leaving without my blood.  So you want my blood, bitch?  I'll give it to you.  I got out.  Let's go.  We went outside to the fucking hallway.  She put the fucking tube around my arm.  She had a little cart.  I'll never forget.  1979.  She had a little fucking cart.  She put the thing around me.  All I know is she stuck the needle in.  Next thing you know, I'm hearing sirens.  What?  Okay?  And the cart is tipped over.  I'm on top of the cart.  And she's under the cart.  And they've got two aluminum things.  Remember those things they cracked?  Yeah.  And they knocked you out?  They had two of them in my nose directly.  Like to wake me up.  They couldn't get me up.  They just put them in my fucking nose.  Let me tell you about that 13-day experience.  Something I'll never forget that shocked me to that day.  I still remember from September.  They let me out the day Ali lost to Larry Holmes.  Oh, God.  September 28, 1979.  They let me out at 2, and I went and did ass at a party.  Fresh with the bracelet on.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I didn't even take the bracelet off.  There was a party for me, the whole thing.  We were fucked up.  But one thing I remember about that experience... was the third night I was there, how scared I was.  And the guy next to me was an old man.  And I go, hey, what's your name?  And he's like a talent.  He's like, Sal.  And I go, Sal, what's going on with you?  He goes, well, I had a stroke.  And the side of my body that had the stroke is the side that develops the shit.  So I'm having a hard time shitting.  I go, really?  And I'm blowing farts the whole night.  It's a two-man bed.  He's in there dying.  He's just farting. ",
