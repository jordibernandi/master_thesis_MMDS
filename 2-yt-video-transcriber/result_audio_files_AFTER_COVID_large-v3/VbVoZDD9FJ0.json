            "text": "Hello beautiful ladies and welcome to today's video where we're going to be talking about five reasons.  marriage is awesome.  So I've been married for two years now and I absolutely love being married.  But when I got married, some people would have said I was a little bit young.  I got married at 24.  Now, when I was growing up in a more Orthodox religious community, that age was actually just about right and really accepted.  It wasn't considered young.  But at the time that I got married, I wasn't living in the Orthodox Jewish community.  I was living at Manhattan School of Music and I was in my grad program.  And a lot of the people around me thought that 24 was super young to get married.  And a lot of them also thought that marriage was kind of silly.  I knew a lot of my friends who said that they never even wanted to get married, that they thought that the whole premise was silly and that it really wasn't even worth their time.  So I wanted to talk about today why marriage is amazing and why I'm so glad that I did get married at 24, that I am married now, and how much I love being married.  Now, if you are hoping to get married but you aren't yet, I don't want this video to make you feel bad that you aren't married yet.  Because there are great things about being single, but I do think that marriage is a really worthy goal and a really great place to aim.  So I don't want this to make you feel bad if you are looking and you haven't found the right guy yet.  Instead, look at the things that I'm talking about in this video as something to look forward to.  So let's get into it.  The first thing that I love about being married is that there's always someone to hang out with.  It's awesome to know that whenever you want to go out, there's someone there who will go out with you.  Whenever you want to go see a movie, your partner will go with you.  If you ever want to go to dinner together, your partner will go with you.  It's just so great to always have that built in friend who's always ready to hang out with you.  And then in the evenings when you're chilling out, you have someone to chill out with.  It's the nicest feeling in the world.  I remember when I was young saying to my mom, I really can't wait for the time that somebody is waiting for me to get home.  Now, of course, my husband is the one who comes home and I'm the one waiting for him.  But it's the same idea that if I go out with friends and I come back, there's someone waiting there for me.  And it's just the nicest feeling that there's always someone there to be with, that you don't have to be alone if you don't want to.  Now, of course, that doesn't mean that you don't ever get alone time because if you have a good partner and you're in a good relationship, you guys make time to just spend time alone.  But it means that when you don't want to be alone, there's somebody there to hang out with.  And it's the greatest feeling.  One of the nicest things about being married is that you're with someone who wants to hang out with you and they want to be there wherever you go, whatever you do.  Now of course you're going to have different interests, you're going to have different things you want to do, but most of the time you'll just have someone there to be with and it's so nice.  I remember when I was single in New York, I actually enjoyed being single, but a lot of the time I would just kind of do date days by myself.  And I would go out to lunch, I would see a movie, and I would go to a museum and I would do all those things by myself.  And I loved that.  I was able to and I had a great time, but now I have someone to do those things with.  And it's so nice to kind of have that comparison where I had that time by myself and I got to enjoy my own schedule, but now I get to share that schedule with somebody who loves me and who I love.  And it's a wonderful thing.  So having that built-in partnership, having that person who's always there to hang out with you is so great.  I feel like COVID-19 has made this so much clearer because it's really hard to be lonely.  And when you're married, you don't have that same fear of loneliness because there is somebody there and you don't have to worry as much that you're going to be alone.  It's nice to have somebody there and it's just a wonderful part of being married.  The second thing is you have a 24-7 support system.  It's an amazing feeling to know that there's always going to be someone on the other end of the phone who you can reach out to if you need to.  that if you're ever in trouble there's somebody there.  There's somebody who's watching out for you and they're just always going to be there to help you through those hard times.  Life is hard and life is long and having somebody there and a partner to really help you through those hard times and that you can help too is so important and incredible that you have somebody to depend on.  And it's not just the bad stuff.  It's also the great stuff.  It's the successes.  When you're married, your successes are your partner's successes and your partner's successes are your successes.  It's an incredible thing to know that when you do well, they're also doing well.  So your partner is always going to want you to succeed and it's an incredible feeling to know that you have somebody cheerleading for you on the sidelines.  And sometimes they're not even on the sidelines.  Maybe they're actually your teammate because they are working with you to help you get better at those things.  It's so nice to know that there's always someone there rooting for you and your husband is always going to be there to help you.  Now think about those times in your life where you've really had a hard time and you haven't had someone there to help.  It's kind of scary.  It's really hard.  Again, I lived in New York for three years by myself and there were times where I was ill and there was nobody there to help me.  and it's really scary and hard.  and now I have somebody there who's always going to help, who always wants to help, and who's going to go out of his way to help.  And I just feel so happy that I'm married because I know that I'm always going to have that support system in place.  Number three is that you can actually start planning your future.  And what I mean by that is when you're single, you can sort of make plans, but the problem is is that you don't know exactly what things are gonna look like because you don't have somebody else there whose plans you're gonna need to take into account too.  When you are living alone, all of those things are yourself.  You're independent, you have to just do what you need to do while you're single.  And you can kind of make a five-year plan and a 10-year plan, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to come into play because again, you don't have that person who is going to change those things, who is going to help you decide when you're gonna have kids, and who's going to help.  you know if you're gonna work full time and all of those things.  But when you get married, you can really start to make those plans.  Because even though things aren't going to be exactly as you planned them, of course not, you at least have the partner there who you have to take into account.  And you'll at least know what his plans are and how that's going to affect your plans.  When you're trying to plan by yourself, it's just different because you don't necessarily know what things are going to change when you get married.  Getting married changes everything.  All of a sudden you have a timeline for when you want to start a family, when you guys want to move, where you guys want to live.  All of those things change when you get married.  Like I didn't know that I would live in Virginia and then live in Nebraska.  I never would have guessed that.  But then when I married my husband, I knew I had to go with him because my job is flexible.  I can work from anywhere and his job isn't.  So all of a sudden, my plans were totally upended and I was able to be more secure in my own plans that I think I'm gonna work remotely.  I think it's gonna be easier for me to work from home because I'm not going to have to push and pull with my husband about where we'll move.  Don't you remember as a kid, you were like, by the time I'm 20, I'm going to be married, have a house, all of these crazy things that when you hit 24, you're like, well, none of that happened.  It's just impossible to make certain plans when you're not married, when you don't have your partner to help you with those plans.  And that's a really great thing about it is that all of a sudden, you have somebody who wants to make plans with you.  It's not just you trying to plan out against the world.  It's you and your partner.  and you're trying to make a whole plan for yourselves, it's a wonderful feeling to know that you're in it with someone, that you have a teammate to go through it all with.  And so that's a really awesome thing about being married that you kind of don't think about, that you all of a sudden are able to make more secure plans.  Number four is that you'll have somebody there to make you better.  Now, I think that marriage is one of the best ways to actually make you a better person.  If you're in a good marriage, your partner wants you to grow.  And it's not just things that will make their lives easier, but it's also they'll see things in you that they want you to be better about.  For me, I wasn't good at staying in touch with my friends.  I really just didn't reach out to them as often as I should have.  And my husband is great at that.  He would call his friends, have hour-long chats with them, and I never even thought to do that.  And when I got married, my husband told me, he said, I think that you would benefit from really reaching out to your friends, even if they're not in the same city as you.  And all of a sudden, I had this whole different perspective on my friendships.  And it was something that I had never seen myself.  And when you're single, you're constantly having to try and find those things about you to fix on your own.  You're trying to make yourself better, but you don't have somebody to bounce ideas off of.  You don't have somebody who's going to notice those things.  Like for myself, I didn't realize that I wasn't great at conflict.  Even when it was important for me to... talk to people about things.  I just wasn't good at doing that.  And my husband pointed that out to me and it's made me a better person.  And it's one of the things I really value about marriage is that you have somebody there who wants to help you grow.  And I know that I've done that for my husband.  He's done that for me.  And it's really hard to do that on your own.  So that's a wonderful thing about marriage that I'm so glad I have the benefit of.  The last wonderful thing about marriage is that you don't know the value in your own life until you're living for another person.  When you are married, it's not about you.  It's about the relationship.  It's about the two of you as a team.  And you can't put yourself first.  And if you do, it's going to make your marriage a problem.  You constantly have to be living with your partner's needs in mind.  And that is an incredible responsibility and an incredible way to make your life have meaning.  When you are constantly just living for your own self and constantly chasing your desires, you're not really recognizing the meaning of your life.  And the meaning of your life is living for another person.  Even though marriage makes your life easier in a lot of ways, this is one of those things that's bigger than that.  And it's so great because it really prepares you to have a child.  You're caring for someone else, but they don't really need you in the way that a child does.  You have to take care of your partner even though they've chosen to be with you and they can take care of themselves.  But a good marriage is the two of you taking care of each other.  And then when you have a child, when that child comes into the world and it really does need you and it can't survive without you, you already have those things in place in how to take care of another person and to put value into your life by making your life about somebody else.  It's just the best way to prepare for having a child, and it's also a wonderful way to make your life more worth living.  My husband and I live for each other.  That doesn't mean that we're not individuals.  It doesn't mean that we don't take care of ourselves, but what it does mean is that we have purpose in our marriage.  We know that we're living for one another, and that's very godly in my opinion.  It makes me feel closer to God, and it also just makes life so much more than just constantly chasing those desires.  I am so glad that I got married two years ago to my wonderful husband.  And this list is just a tiny portion of reasons why marriage is amazing.
