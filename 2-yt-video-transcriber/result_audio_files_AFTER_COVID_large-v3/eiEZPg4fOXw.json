            "text": "there's a saying in life that is something to the effect of the best revenge is success or the best revenge is happiness and i absolutely agree.  that's why i think you should treat your man as if he's going to cheat and soon i'll be doing a video soon about red flags and how to find a great partner because honestly all the good men are everywhere.  But until then, until that video, let's assume that you found that great man.  Starting today, I want you to treat him like he's going to cheat.  And after he cheats, you need to get your sweet revenge.  Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Milski.  This is my YouTube channel.  So often when you ask someone about their exes, depending upon how much time has passed, they can't have little or vague memories of the person.  And on rare occasions, you hear about people talking about the one who got a. I want everyone listening to be the one who got away.  And the only way you can be that person is to be setting the bar constantly.  I want you to be the mold of the ideal woman.  When you're in a relationship and act in a way that is creating the perfect mold, a few things happen.  For you, most importantly, you can rest your head on your pillow every night knowing that you acted with integrity.  You have fairly managed your emotions.  You have been the best woman for your man.  I'm certainly not expecting or looking for you to be perfect because perfection provides no opportunity for growth.  And we're human, so we're always growing.  So we're not looking for perfection.  All I want for you, from you, is to work to be a little better today than you were yesterday.  That shouldn't be too hard.  It really shouldn't be too hard.  A big theme in all of my videos is trying to align you to a plumb line of fulfillment.  Can and will you get hurt in life?  Yes.  I'm not one for empathizing over pain.  I just don't care if you get hurt.  I care about how you handle it.  Some people whine and complain and openly admit that they're bitter.  And I have never seen a bitter, upset person who is happy, whose plumb line is true.  All I want is for you to always end up happy and to be proud of who you are and how you conduct yourself out in the world.  I want you to walk with your head high because of how you are and how you act.  That's my goal for you.  So moving on to cheating.  When he cheats... I don't want you to go back in your memory and think of all the things you could have done better.  And I certainly don't want you remembering the time you cheated.  If you maintain living like he's going to cheat on you and you want revenge, he should never, ever be able to pull the too cool que.  If you have cheated, you deserve nothing good from that man.  But you wouldn't do that, would you?  No, because you're better than that.  Sorry, I had to change the lighting.  I was getting really blown out.  So now what about him?  If you're setting yourself up for the best revenge when he does cheat, I want him remembering and missing you.  As he enters the world and explores more and more women, I want him to realize how good he had it with you.  So how does a woman go about planning the revenge for a cheater?  Ooh, it's so evil.  So you provoke your man.  You ignite his senses.  You provoke and ignite his happiness, his humor.  You acknowledge that he is your hero.  You provoke his sexual appetite.  You provoke his libido and you allow him to express that pleasure with.  It may take some time, but once you become a master of provocation for him, you will learn the right seasoning for your man.  To do this, you have to pay attention.  So does that sound like constant work to you?  Like your life just rotates around him?  That's not my goal.  My goal is for you to have a wonderful relationship and a wonderful life, replete with opportunity for work or hobbies or social time, whatever you need to fulfill yourself.  So I'm going to give you a shortcut, and I'm going to use a pretty old book called Do so.  It's published in 1992 when you were just a young, young person.  Probably.  Maybe you guys were like 50 when that happened.  I don't know.  So tell me what you think about this in the comments.  So here, my dog is stalking my cat.  it's still happening.  So the idea is we all uniquely of this book, we all uniquely express and feel love in five major different ways.  Here they are.  Quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, gifts, and acts of service.  I'm going to tell you a story to showcase how this can be utilized.  So I knew a woman who was married and she, Oh, This is a good story.  So she was married, and her husband one day wanted to do nice things for her.  So, if my recollection serves me, he cleaned her car and filled it with gas.  He made dinner for her and them, cleaned up, walked the dog, and gave her a massage.  You guys are going to hate this, but it's so important.  Okay, so... So later that night, she said to him, some of the effect of like, do you love me?  And he's like, what?  Do you feel like I don't?  She said, no, I know you do, but I just, he's like, wait, I cleaned your car and filled it with gas, took the dog for a walk, made dinner, cleaned up and gave you a massage to show you that I love you.  What's the deal?  And she said, But you didn't tell me that I was pretty.  So what do you think of that story?  Is that a happy story for that husband or do you think he chose a weirdo?  To me, that's the best story and the best thing that could have ever happened to that husband.  His life is forever changed.  His life is forever happier and forever easier.  He discovered her love language.  When he understands and uses her love language, he doesn't have to do all those things anymore.  He doesn't have to put gas in her car and clean her car and make her dinner and clean up after dinner and give her a massage.  Should he do some of those things sometimes to round out their relationship?  Fuck yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But all of those things that he gave to show love, she could have... Zosia, he could have received.  Simply by saying... You're like the best cook.  You cook for me and I so appreciate it.  Oh my God, you've cleaned up.  The house looks awesome.  I love living in this house.  You're the best wife.  You are so pretty.  You always rub my back.  so nice.  That was her fuel.  The potency was there.  Remember in Back to the Future, whatever fuel he used to power the van?  No, the car?  What was it?  What was it?  It was petroleum.  Plutonium.  It's fucking potent.  Is there a million other ways, solar and wind and diesel and this and that, to gain power?  Yeah, but for that car, for that engine, it took plutonium.  Find your partner's plutonium and use it.  Giving her the words of affirmation, acknowledgement, love, is what she needs to be happy and do all those things that he gave to her.  So instead of giving, he could have received love.  and they both would have been really happy.  So I'm not saying to, like I said before, I'm not saying to neglect the other languages.  Yeah, be well-rounded and use the plutonium.  If you've been around a healthy, loving relationship, romantic relationship, you see that the giving is two-sided and well-rounded, but they know each other.  So some of you might see this as too much work.  If so, then maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship.  Or if so, you might think that he should just know that you love him.  You should be able to show your love in your own way.  It's not plutonium.  It's just like a ferro rod.  So let me give you an example.  Has a friend ever ran to the store and asked if you need anything?  And you said something that you wanted, but you said in a general way, like chips.  Yeah.  Could you grab me a bag of chips?  And then when they come back, they have your chips, but it's not the chips that you love.  It's your fault that you didn't clarify.  They don't know the difference.  Should you be happy and grateful?  Yeah, of course.  But the chips that you really like, whatever.  So has anyone ever cooked a meal for you as their guest and know that you really like something?  And they've said to you, we know how much you like this.  So we made this.  Just having somebody cook for you would have been a kind, wonderful, loving thing.  But knowing that they made something specifically for you, that's out of sight, man.  So that's what the languages of love do.  They save you time, they're just more potent.  And by paying attention, so you have to, by paying attention to your partner and understanding, respecting, and then utilizing their love language, you can save time and communicate your love with your partner in a far more amplified and loud way, which frees up your time.  And now you've set up a relationship where your partner feels totally loved and valued and taken care of.  Do you know what this advice will give to you?  Loyalty.  It pretty much guarantees that he will not cheat.  The whole point of this video is to help you to create a relationship of love and commitment and loyalty and fun.  By acting like he's going to cheat, he won't cheat.  And to be fair, honestly, most people aren't cheaters and they'll stay true.  But I want your man to be ecstatic that he is with you and only you.  This is beneficial two ways.  When you're in a loving, strong relationship, you are more happy.  You are more well-grounded, more stable.  And in the unlikely event of him actually cheating on you, you will have your best revenge.  You will have set it up that way.  Will you be sad?  Yeah.  Will you be fine?  Yes.  Because you're amazing and you're loving and you're loyal and you just lost a cheater.  Good riddance to bad rubbish.  Not you, but this video is over.  Peace. ",
