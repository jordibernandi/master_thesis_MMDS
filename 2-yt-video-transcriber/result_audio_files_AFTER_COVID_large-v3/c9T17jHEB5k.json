And for maybe the listeners that aren't as familiar with it, as you're talking about, Monique, critical race theory is just, you know, one stream that falls beneath critical theory overall.  And critical race theory would see things between you have the oppressors and the oppressed.  And so maybe the scenario would be the oppressors is the white privilege and the oppressed.  And that could be, you know, African-Americans.  It could be, you know, it could be others as well that are oppressed under a white supremacy kind of a system.  And so you found yourself going, OK, when you were living within that narrative, we got to overthrow this oppressive system.  And that kind of creates some anarchy that you see that we got to be able to resist.  You got to be able to fight it.  Well, here you are.  You're stuck in the system.  You're a believer.  What causes you to start questioning whether or not critical race theory is true? ",

            "text": "One of the main causes was I was working and I had an intern and she was white.  She was at a different small Bible school, Bible college out here.  And she came into work one day crying.  and was explaining why or how.  people of color, students of color, were really demeaning white students on campus and telling them that they're just fragile and this is why they're crying and this is why they're angry.  Or the idea that professors had been let go at her university for not upholding things like Black Lives Matter.  That was part of it.  another part of it was a conversation and many conversations that i had with my ministry partner kristen we weren't in ministry at the time we were just friends and she's a theologian and began to question my biblical perspective like how are you defining these these terms that you're using according to scripture?  what do you do with these other scriptures?  in light of this scripture how do you find your identity?  I remember her asking me, well, are you first Black or are you first a Christian?  And I had never been asked that before.  And biblically, how do I answer that question?  We had tons of conversations But I think what really solidified everything for me and really dismantled the worldview was just my conversations with the Lord of God.  Why is everyone so angry?  Why are so many people who are upholding critical race theory and social justice, even within the church, now demeaning one group of people and saying that they have no value or they can't speak?  When for as long as I can remember, I had been an advocate of having all the voices at the table.  What I was seeing now was that we don't want this voice at all.  We need to almost dismantle and get rid of this voice.  And so as I just noticed the violence in my conversations with the Lord, I began to repent.  And I believe that he spoke directly to my heart, telling me I needed to repent from upholding this worldview.  But God is so gracious.  And so as I repented from this worldview, he began to construct in me something different.  And again, it went back to the historic Christian worldview.  How should we be fighting injustice and speaking out on behalf of the marginalized or oppressed?  How do we even define those things?  So that's a bit of my journey out.  But it Those three things, Sarah, Krista, my intern, Krista, my ministry partner, but a deep conversation with the Lord. ",
