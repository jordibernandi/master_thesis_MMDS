Thoughts move with evil and greed.  Since there's so much thought stuff going on, we're going to have to break this down into two videos.  Both will be sponsored by Ridge Wallets because YouTube is BS.  If you don't remember, she was also involved with Casey Tron's charity.  involved money for women and they dressed like Horde or something was so stupid.  It genuinely was.

I'm unemployed in the middle of an epidemic, you bitch.  I know the coronavirus is out there, but if you lost your job, you should really be applying to another job so that you can then have the money to give me a subscription.

Now, of course, that's quite common for a higher number of subs earlier during a stream, but over the course of this four hours, the original goal was 40 subscribers.  When that was hit, this went to 50, and when that was hit again, it was eventually 55.  Which means, just through subscribers, this streamer pulled in $250 spent in subscriptions, on top of that, an additional $50 in tax.

You already know the spiel about the Ridge Wallet.  I've had mine for over a year.  The thing's bulletproof.  It's chainsaw proof.  It's waterproof.  So if you get in trouble with the mafia and they chainsaw you up, and shoot you, then throw you in the Hudson River, long as your rich wallet keeps your information in it, they can identify your body.  Well, that's probably not a good selling point.  Listen, free shipping worldwide, fast returns, and if you don't like it, you can send it back, no questions asked, and no cost to you.  But if you do like the wallet, it's a lifetime guarantee.  How many things today can you buy that there's a lifetime guarantee for?  Absolutely nothing.
