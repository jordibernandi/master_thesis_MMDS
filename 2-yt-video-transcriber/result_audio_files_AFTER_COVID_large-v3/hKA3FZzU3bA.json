            "text": "Oh, sorry, didn't see you there.  Hi, my name is Leron Reedus, and I wanna teach you the difference between a Karen and a Becky.  With major areas of the world currently under lockdown, a lot of people have recently come to the realization that they have a lot of time on their hands.  And depending on what you do, your current level of creativity, or your current level of boredom, some things individuals choose to do range from self-care personal amusement, and borderlining stupidity.  Just like British writer Julie Bindel did when she took to Twitter declaring the names Karen and Becky as racial slurs toward white women, some even comparing it to the use of the n-word, which as a result immediately set us feminists back by at least 10 years.  Now, you might have been one of those individuals who saw this set of tweets, which are still up on her Twitter account as of the recording of this video, bless her heart.  And you either thought to yourself one or all of the following.  One.  How could she put those two in the same category?  Two.  That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works.  Or three.  Oh.  I see white people are white peopling again.  In which case, all of those feelings are accurate.  Because all of them are true.  So in order for us to reach an understanding of why this is an extremely bad take, we must first go over why the names Karen and Becky are used in these regards in the first place.  Karen is the most well-known, and also the most coincidental, yet ironic in its current depiction since its conception.  And this is because the name Karen is Danish in origin, meaning pure, after branching from the English name Catherine.  We see these women, who are mostly white, display that purity with a holier-than-thou attitude inside shops or restaurants when they're trying to get their way, rubbing their privilege in the faces of shop and food workers that are less fortunate than they are.  Thus, when it gets to the point where even the slightest challenge to their purity is made by said individuals, As an attempt to get the workers reprimanded for their actions, or to make sure their purity is given the respect they believe it deserves, they release their battle cry and intimidation, I would like to speak with your manager.  That is how the roots of the name ironically link with the behavior we currently see in those we associate with the name Karen.  The reason why it's coincidental, on the other hand, is because more than likely such an association was not done on purpose.  Like the haircut we associate with the name turned term, the actions of individuals began to grow and evolve to the point where the name Karen just felt right.  Of course, it should go without saying that it is entirely untrue that every white woman named Karen behaves in the way according to the stigma currently associated with it.  I know plenty of white Karens that treat people the way they want to be treated and do not act as if they are above anyone else.  Which is why it constantly pains me that their parents decided to name them Karen.  Becky, on the other hand, tends to be the more malevolent of the two.  Whereas Karens tend to run on mostly privilege, Beckys utilize a mixture of privilege, prejudice, and systematic racism.  Beckys tend to notice the lives of minorities either trying to live succeed, or have fun, all within the boundaries of the law, yet are compelled to involve the display of systematic racism upon these individuals, mostly because she doesn't want them there, by reporting their activities to the police and using their privilege as a white woman as leverage.  even more so when it's proven she was wrongfully accusing said minorities by immediately shifting the use of her privilege to argue that she was the true victim.  The use of the name-turned-term is largely thanks to the white woman nicknamed Barbecue Becky, who called the police on a gathering of African Americans having a cookout in a public park, stating that it was illegal to barbecue in the park with charcoal.  Other instances in the term Becky can be seen in the white woman calling the police on a black girl selling water outside her home because she didn't have a permit, and a white woman calling the police on a black man moving into his apartment thinking that he was breaking into it.  Both Karen and Becky are current terminologies associated with white women that respectively bring attention to the displays of both unbridled ego and privilege and racial domination over minorities.  So what should you do or say if your name is actually Karen or Becky but do not display any of the traits associated with the term that they now carry?  Nothing.  Continue to live your life, because despite it being your name, you are not who the individuals are talking about.  The only prejudice associated with utilizing these names in the way that they are currently used is that it brings unwanted attention to individuals who continue to exuberate the negative qualities that the names turned terms heavily critiques.  As a matter of fact, the only ones actually complaining about how the names are treated and stating that their slurs are individuals who have never experienced the dangers of systematic racism, have never experienced what it's like to have someone speak down on them or think lesser of them because of their hierarchy or privilege, and or are seeking any and every reason under the sun to claim that they are being oppressed.  Which, in retrospective, is a very Becky thing to do.  Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to watch this PSA, and I hope you now have a better understanding of deciphering a Karen from a Becky.  But if you still believe that the current use of Karen and Becky are the equivalent of the N-word, just remember, you don't say the K-word or the B-word in front of other people.  You say Karen and Becky.  Now do it with the other one.  I thought so. ",
