            "text": "So let's start.  If you go to securevotega.com, we have posted all the videos from State Farm for that day that cover the relevant periods.  5.23  a.m.,  they walk in and they discover what is essentially a pond on the floor where you can see water coming out of the sky.  So they say, okay, we can't do our work here this morning.  They call in the state farm people.  It's not Fulton County people, which is one of the other things they said.  There's no Fulton County work order to fix the water leak.  And guess what?  It wasn't in a Fulton County facility.  It was in state farm.  So they were the ones who fixed the leak.  And it was a urinal that was overflowed because we were turned off.  because guess what?  Nobody's in state farm because of COVID other than this particular usage.  So they turned off all those things and it went over the edge of the relief valve.  And that's what caused the leak.  So They come in.  Then you go to another one about 7 in the morning or so, where you have essentially the, I don't know what to call it, the drying Zamboni.  that's driving around on the carpet, cleaning it all up.  Then at about 8.23, you see a woman bring in the table in question.  that has been the point of Mr.  Giuliani's 90-second clip.  She's pulling it with one hand, and she sets it down.  There's nothing underneath it, okay?  Then you can fast forward to later in the day, about 9.45 or so.  Everybody there, there are two groups of people there.  There's cutters and there are scanners.  What happened was the cutters began putting their stuff away because everybody's under the impression they were going to get home.  We have discovered this.  So they start putting covers over the cutting machines and everything.  So then we see also, while the monitors and the press are still in the room, They bring out the carriers, which are normal absentee ballot carriers.  And I will admit, when I listened to the audio of the phone call and the president brought that up again and I heard it on a radio ad again today, I wanted to scream.  Well, I did scream at the computer and I screamed in my car at the radio talking about this because this has been thoroughly debunked.  They bring out the normal absentee ballot carriers.  There are monitors in the room.  There is press in the room.  They take the ballots that have been opened, put them in carrier trays and put them in there and then... put them in the boxes, put the lid on, because the lid matches the box.  And then you see, at one point during the video, a woman crawling on the floor, putting the numbered seals on them so they can keep the chain of custody.  Approximately 10, 25, 10, 30, the secretary in our office receives word that Fulton County is shutting down for the night at State Farm Arena.  So as some of you all who were there on election night recall, the secretary got a little irritated with this and made his feelings quite known.  He said, some of us who are working through the night, we're glad to see that Fulton County sees the need to just go ahead and knock off for the evening.  So Chris Harvey, our elections director, then calls Rick Barron, the elections director of Fulton County, who was at the other location, which was their English Street warehouse, because he was doing election day activities.  Chris calls Rick.  Rick says, we're not shutting down.  Well, Chris says, it looks like you are.  So then you can go back to the videotape and see Ralph Jones take a phone call at approximately almost 11 o'clock.  And you can see his shoulders kind of shrug.  He takes the phone call.  He's being told at that point by his boss, Rick Barron, you need to stay and continue to scam.  So he hangs up the phone, he goes over to some boxes, puts some more seals on them, because obviously if you watch the videotape, many of the people that are there have been there since 7 in the morning.  It's already 11 o'clock at night.  They were all under the impression they were going to get to go home.  So you see him spend about 30 seconds going, heck, what am I going to say to these people?  So he walks back over to the corner of a desk and says, I got the word, we've got to keep on scanning.  So they go back to the boxes that you see them put under the table at the approximately 10 o'clock hour.  There is videotape of this.  And this is what's really frustrating.  The president's legal team had the entire tape.  They watched the entire tape.  And then from our point of view, intentionally misled the state senate, voters, and the people of the United States about this.  It was intentional.  It was obvious.  And anybody watching this knows that.  Anyone watching it knows that.  That's why we released the entire tape for people to watch.  So there's this claim that that was done.  So they pull those out and begin to scan. ",
