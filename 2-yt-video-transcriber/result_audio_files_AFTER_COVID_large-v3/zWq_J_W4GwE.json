            "text": "So I was in prayer with the Lord and I asked, what message do you have for me to give to the people?  It's election.  So much has already been said.  What more could I contribute to it?  So I wrote this down.  This is what I got in my spirit.  Seven D's.  The seven D's of 2020 election.  First D, Donald Trump will win.  Secondly, his next agenda is to bring the Digital Bill of Rights.  It's in my book, Trump's Unfinished Business.  This is an area that he neglected.  He probably had so much going on and had so much opposition and he didn't have the full support of the Republicans.  But today, I declare the Republicans are known and must be known as the party of the digital Bill of Rights.  That means that we have the right to our own information.  We have the right to our own data.  We have the right to free speech.  We have the right for free press.  We have the right to access news like Hunter Biden's laptop without it being censored and kept away from us.  A digital bill of rights is exactly what the founding fathers missed because they couldn't have thought of the technology, but the founding fathers would put into the Constitution.  It must be secure.  Without this, the next election can be easily lost on fraud, on technological fraud.  We must have a digital bill of rights.  The third D, the Democrats are going to be defeated.  They're going to be defeated soundly because they're a party of defamation.  This is the fourth D. God hates defamation.  God hates false witnesses.  God hates what they did to Brett Kavanaugh.  God hates the way that they spoke to Amy Coney Barrett.  God hates their defamation.  Defamation is an awful crime.  And people who defame others loosely or even anonymously, they should not have any right to be hurting other people.  That has to stop.  The Democrats are also a party of death.  Death on so many levels, from the beginning of life to the ending.  Well, they want to end life, right?  So obviously to the ending of life.  Abortion.  Abortion is child sacrifice.  It's no different than what the heathens did, the pagans did to children and offered them up to false gods and burned them alive and killed them.  Dismembering a little child is not your freedom of choice.  It's murder.  They're also the death of free speech through political correctness.  Now you add to it COVID correctness.  Are you speaking COVID correctness?  Then it's the death of religious tolerance.  It's the death of religious freedom.  They're also the death of many innocent people through letting in unchecked terrorism, unchecked immigration, and they appease the terrorists.  They will never, ever criticize an Islamic terrorist.  They will go out of their way to understand and explain why somebody beheaded an innocent person.  And yet they'll have no qualm about urinating on the crucifix or saying that the crucifixion of Jesus never happened or that the disciples of Jesus did not see him rise from the dead.  How can you say that of the very best human beings who ever lived, who taught others to not lie and were willing to pay with their life?  They said, we're eyewitnesses.  Jesus died and rose again.  They're calling all of this lies.  They're the party of the death of babies to the death of truth.  6D, delay.  I think it's very important for us who are on the edge of prophecy, and many people are listening to us, not to hype it up.  I know that strange things are coming.  There will be asteroid strikes.  There will be earthquakes and strange new diseases and viruses.  And yet the Holy Spirit has given us a third great awakening.  Trump will have two terms.  Pence will have two terms.  And then you know what year that takes us to?  2032.  And what is that?  That is exactly the 2000th anniversary of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  And if mankind has been given 6,000 years and no civilization can go back any further than 5,000, so it's quite reasonable that man has had a history of 6,000 years.  It would be prophetic for it to complete on the 6,000th year before we could enter into another 1,000 years of the millennium.  That is end times in a nutshell.  So if you don't understand that, you need to go and study it.  you know, our teachings on the book of Revelation and End Times.  But I believe that this sense of urgency has been replaced with a sense of a great awakening.  God is going to raise up Christians who understand the importance of the vote today, the importance of the victory over the next four years.  It's no longer a question, will Trump win?  Trump's going to win, but why?  What's the reason for him winning?  And the amount of crud, the amount of darkness, the depth of the swamp is going to be revealed.  And it's going to be revealed very fast, immediately after this election.  So we're going to show you some stuff about this right away.  So what's the seventh D?  I asked the Lord, what other D is there?  We got so many Ds.  I cannot think of any.  And he says, Dios.  I thought, wow, what a funny thing, because I never even thought of that, that God is Dios, but in Spanish.  So there must be a Latino factor in this election.  There must be something about the Latinos, especially those you know, Christ-believing, Bible-reading Latinos.  They're going to bring the Dios factor into this election.  So I thought it was very interesting.  God gave me seven Ds, and the last one is Dios.  Do not dismiss what God's will is for America.  Dios is going to do something great in America.  Don't discount the red wave.  I think it's going to be a red wave.  It's not just the red wave representing Republicans.  It's the red blood of Jesus Christ is going to come and wash over not just America, but Australia and the UK and South Africa.  Hallelujah.  Oh, and Asia needs the blood of Jesus Christ to the tidal wave.  And everyone's going to see they've been hoodwinked.  They've been lied to by the media over and over again.  So I declare before the election results are publicized by fake news, Trump wins four more years.  You're going to have a great president continuing the agendas, the 10 agendas of God in Trump's unfinished business.  That's why he's got to be there because there's unfinished business.  Melania is going to continue to be the wonderful first lady, one of the classiest, most elegant first ladies in the world.  You're gonna have Ivanka Trump still there next to her father's side.  So congratulations to President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on continuing to serve in the White House, to make America great, and to protect us and the rest of the world from religious persecution and from censorship of our freedom of speech.  We thank you, we thank God, we thank Jesus, and we thank you for giving your life to such a high-pressure, high-demand, dangerous job.  May the Lord protect you and may your reward be rich in heaven.
