So the question is today, what is today?  Sunday, December 27th, 2020.  Is this the real Anthony Quinn Warner?  That is the question.  What is not.  the question is, is the 5G fear that he had.  Apparently the real Anthony Quinn Warner had IT jobs in the Nashville, Tennessee area.  He was alarmed with 5G.  Apparently he wanted to make a statement.  Another question is, was he groomed for this?  Was he pushed along for this?  Were there handlers involved with this?  Of course there's a million questions, but really I'm just putting this up there today.  Is this the real Anthony Quinn Warner?  And is that your real name?  And did you even exist?  So many questions and not enough answers right now. ",
