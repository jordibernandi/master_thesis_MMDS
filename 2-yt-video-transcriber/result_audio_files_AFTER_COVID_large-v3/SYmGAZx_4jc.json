            "text": "This is Jonathan Cahn.  I've held back on saying something in this way until now.  The shakings that have taken place around us, that have changed our lives, are they a sign that we're approaching judgment?  Is the mystery that began in the harbinger now coming to pass?  And if so, where is it leading?  Where is it all heading?  How much time do we have?  Is there hope?  What are the keys we need to know for the days ahead?  I'm going to open up the biblical mystery behind the shakings that are happening around us.  What it means for the future of America, the world, and you and me.  This will be the first of a number of prophetic messages concerning this hour.  A number of years ago, I wrote The Harbinger.  It reveals the ancient template of national judgment that appeared in biblical times before the destruction of a nation.  In the last days of ancient Israel, nine harbingers, prophetic signs of warning, appeared in the land.  They were warning of judgment and destruction that would come.  Those same nine harbingers have now appeared on American soil.  The first sign is that the nation's hedge of protection is lifted.  An enemy makes a strike on the land, a wake-up call for the nation.  That happened in America on September 11, 2001.  It was then followed by other harbingers, all nine.  But that wasn't the end of the mystery or the end of the template or the end of the progression.  The mystery of judgment was just beginning.  So what happens next, the next stage, is that a nation under judgment is given a window of time to turn back, to come back to God for revival, or to continue in its course, its defiance of God, and head to judgment.  The window of time given is a span of years.  Since 9-11, America has all the more departed from God and warred against his ways.  And that's just what ancient Israel did.  It's following the same mystery.  That would mean that America is heading for judgment.  And the harbinger is a chapter called Things to Come.  It speaks of the shakings that will come upon the nation if the nation doesn't turn back.  Greater shakings, even shakings that can lead to its destruction.  We are experiencing the beginning of those shakings right now.  The Harbinger goes on to speak of what kind of shakings will come.  And I'm quoting from what I wrote years ago.  They may take the form of economic disintegration.  Well, we've been experiencing that.  Disorder.  It's happening now.  Military defeat.  Not yet, but wait.  Division of the nation.  It's happening now.  The collapse of infrastructure, it's happening now.  Man-made calamities, happening.  Calamities of nature, happening.  Decline and fall.  The withdrawal of its blessings, the blessings of prosperity, protection and peace.  The shakings that are happening now that we're seeing, we're seeing a withdrawal of these blessings.  And then in the Harbinger, in the same chapter, as it speaks of the coming of these shakings, it gives the word crown.  Crown is the modern English version of the word corona.  Corona means crown, but there's more.  In the Harbinger, the question is asked, when will the great shakings or resuming of the mystery or judgments begin?  How long after that first strike on the land, the warning strike, the enemy attack on the land, the beginning warning strike of judgment, until the greater shakings come upon the nation?  And a span is given.  There's more than one answer in the Bible for the span.  that applies with regard to the destruction of the southern kingdom of Israel.  The first strike came in the year 605  B.C.,  The calamity, the greater calamities that were to destruction came in 586 BC.  So how long is the span of time?  19 years.  The destruction came in the 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar, 19 years after the first strike, the Bible says.  So when was the first strike in the case of America?  It was 9-11, the year was 2001.  So when is the 19th year?  Will this mystery foretell and pinpoint when the year of shakings will come, when it will begin?  The 19th year is the year 2020.  And 2020 is the year that the shakings have come upon the land.  And so for years after riding the Harbinger, I looked at the year 2020. and wondered if the template would manifest in that year, and it has.  We are living in the midst of this template of national judgment.  The plague is not only called Corona, crown, but it has another name, COVID-19, the number of judgment, 19.  The prophet Jeremiah... foretold, prophesied, the shakings and the judgments that would come to the nation that had been warned, that had the first strike, that would come in the 19th year, which was 586 BC.  One of those judgments, he says, will come in the 19th year, listen, is that of a disease, a plague, pestilence.  In other words, epidemic.  What does it mean?  I believe we are in a most dangerous time.  The days of approaching judgment.  I also believe this time is critical.  I believe September, critical time this September.  This autumn will be critical for America.  And that's why before this year began, I was led to do what I had held off doing.  doing for years and that is to finally write the sequel to the harbinger.  people had always asked and i said no it's not not time and that it had and i knew it had to come out this year to warn his people to warn america of what was actually happening what was going to happen how to prepare that is the harbinger 2 which is coming out as i'm writing this or as i'm doing this right now.  What I've just shared with you is contained in the book, and I will only say that there's so much more revealed and more about all of this that I couldn't even begin to do so here.  To get The Harbinger 2, you can just go online.  It should be everywhere when you see this, and in stores that have books that are open.  One other thing.  If you're seeing this before September 26th, I believe that, well, I'll say it this way.  September, as I said, I believe this is going to be critical, and the autumn critical.  As we approach the 19th year anniversary of 9-11 and the holy days that start with a feast of trumpets, the sounding of the trumpets and beyond, and I felt that for a long time, this is a critical time, I and others before this year began have called for the return.  It's a national and global day of prayer and repentance, not just prayer, repentance.  According to the scripture, if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves... And seek my face and turn from their evil ways.  I will hear from heaven.  I will forgive their sin and I will heal their land.  Now if that has ever been needed, ever, it is now.  The time is now.  It has never been more critical than now for the future of America.  And if we don't take this now, this seriously, we may not have the chance again.  So I invite you to join me in this crucial, critical undertaking throughout the month of September.  Also during the Biblical days of repentance, which are the 10 days of awe.  that begins with a feast of trumpets and goes to the day called the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur.  The day of the return will be September 26th, the specific concentrated day.  September's market, September 26th.  It'll be on the National Mall.  Washington,  D.C.,  a sacred assembly.  I believe it will be a prophetic and historic event in God's sight.  If you can come, it's there.  It's going to begin in the morning of September 26th on the National Mall.  But if you can't, you can bring your church, spread the word.  But if you can't, devote still devote that day.  be part join with in your churches tell your pastors in your homes.  you could have your own event in a field in a public place doesn't matter.  spread the word.  it will be streamed and simulcast.  you can do it.  you'll do it with us At the end of this posting, you'll see the context on how to get more on these things.  I will have more prophetic messages to give you for this hour as the Lord designates.  Stay tuned.  For now, be strong and let us seek the Lord as never before.  For this hour, God bless you.  Shalom.  .  .  .  .  .  Thank you. ",
