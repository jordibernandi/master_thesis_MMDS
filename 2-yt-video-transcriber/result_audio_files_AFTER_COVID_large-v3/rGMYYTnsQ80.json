            "text": "Hey everyone, hope you're staying safe and you and your family are doing well.  I wanna update you on some things here at the Oasis, especially our services this weekend because of our president asking for a 15 day pause to not have meetings.  And our governor has also asked that church not congregate on Sunday mornings.  We were on a conference call this week and he didn't order it to be done.  He just asked, please, because of the nature of the situation, please don't gather.  So we're going to honor that.  I felt like it is important for us to be good citizens.  Also, according to what Paul told Timothy, we're to pray for our leaders.  We're to pray for those in authority over us that they will make wise decisions.  We've been praying for the president, praying for him every day.  We pray for the governor.  And I think it's time to listen wisely to decisions that they may have made.  And the president said, give us 15 days to get this behind us and to get some things done and stop the spread of the coronavirus.  So we will be honoring that this Sunday.  We will be live streaming at 10 o'clock.  Some of the praise team will be here, and I feel like God has given me a message for you, and I encourage you to please watch 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, and we'll try to make it as close to a real service as we can, but it's important that we keep hearing what God is saying.  There's so much of what the world is saying.  And a lot of it is based on fear.  We are not to be a people of fear.  We must be a people of faith and yet also honor the kingdom and our responsibilities.  We do have kingdom responsibilities and we're going to honor those even if we don't meet together.  Our offices are open.  If you need anything, give us a call.  You can email us.  We're available to pray.  We're seeking the Lord.  I'm trying to talk to as many people as I can.  I don't know how many conference calls I've been on this week.  It's been a lot.  And we're trying to make wise choices.  So bottom line is this Sunday, we will be having a web service, live stream service, and encourage you to watch and be a part of that.  And we're going to believe that in this pause, Our government can get some things done and our prayers will continue to generate answers in this trial, this crisis.  So bless you.  I have a word for you Sunday morning and we're going to get through this.  We're going to win.  And as I've said, in my heart, I still believe what I've been saying since the first of the year.  There's revival in the air.  This is a pause, but we're going to move right on with revival.  And I don't think it's going to be as long as some are saying.  I'm believing for accelerated answers.  Agree with me.  And we're going to believe for those accelerated answers.  Let me pray for you and your families.  Lord, I pray for peace in every home.  I pray for calmness.  I pray for protection.  We plead the blood of Jesus over them.  And we say the plague cannot come near their dwelling.  Let their needs be met and supernaturally give them the peace that passes.  all understanding.  We love you.  We are praying for you.  And we will talk to you Sunday morning, 10 o'clock. ",
