            "text": "Fingers down my spine Girl, you're looking at it.  fine Oh, won't you rub your fingers down my spine Girl, you're looking at it.  Hello everyone and welcome to a new sex toy review.  Today's product is Pocket Pussy Male Masturbator Cup Realistic Vagina Anal Oral Sex Toys for Men.  Tree to Ride Hands Free.  Automatic Stroker with 7 Powerful Thrusting Rotating Modes Blowjob Machine for Penis Stimulation by Tree to Ride Store.  So this is the toy.  This is actually called the Dark Knight.  I don't know why this... Again, I don't understand why the boxes ignore this.  So, see right there?  Like, maybe you can't see it, it's upside down.  It says Dark Knight.  That's a cool name!  Why didn't they just call it the Dark Knight?  I mean, were they afraid of getting in trouble?  Can't have a Dark Knight spinning robot pussy.  It's not like officially licensed by Warner Brothers or something.  Anyway, okay, so let's talk about it.  Now, looking at the red and black color scheme, you may think this is somehow related to the Leighton Future, which I reviewed not too long ago.  They seem to be using a similar shade of red as well.  So I don't know if this is like a thing that's going on in the sex toy community where red and black is in.  It is not.  Like, look how big the Leighton Future is compared to this.  Now the lead in future is $200.  This thing is under 50.  So don't expect the lead in future in this.  This is not gonna happen.  So what is this toy?  This is a spinning robot pussy, but it's not the top shelf kind of spinning robot pussy.  It's more of the entry level kind.  So these are other spinning robot pussies I've reviewed in the past.  This is the Oliver's and this is kind of a redesign.  This kind of is in the same category as these.  These are entry-level spinning robot pussies.  They tend to be on the cheaper side.  They tend to have a less powerful motor.  That's okay.  It's okay.  You're getting what you pay for.  So this spinning robot pussy is less than $50, and so you're going to get an experience that's on par with a $50 sex toy.  If you're willing to pay $100, $200, $400 for a spinning robot pussy, you're going to get a different experience than if you pay only $50.  That's just the way it goes.  So if you look at these spinning robot pussies, they all have kind of the telltale sign.  One is they don't have up or down buttons.  They basically have different modes.  And that's true of the Dark Knight as well.  Also, they don't just spin.  They telescope and spin.  But they don't go faster or slower.  That's really the telltale sign.  So I'll show you what I'm talking about.  It's easier to show you on this one because this one has like a window.  So I'll turn it on.  Okay?  And you can see how it spins and rotates.  It doesn't spin very quickly.  I would say it's probably a 200 RPM motor.  It's not bad.  It's just not super powerful.  It's a weaker motor, which is why it costs less.  And the telescoping kind of masks how weak the motor is, where.  if it just spins, you would kind of realize that there's not much there.  But the telescoping kind of disguises it.  And when you click the different modes... It changes direction or it does the crank thing, which is all good.  Nothing wrong with it.  Now that we've gotten the background out of the way, let's talk about the Dark Knight specifically.  Notice that this one doesn't have a vagina-like opening.  If I show you these, the insert has a vagina opening.  Now, it's just a cap, so they make the cap look like a vagina.  With the Dark Knight, They just made it a circle.  They didn't bother with the vagina thing.  But it basically works the same way.  So I'll turn it on to show you.  Turning it on.  Now this is different.  It doesn't have different speeds.  But it has different modes.  And it sounds like an EDM song.  I don't know why.  Here, this is one.  Alright, so we got this.  That's kind of, like, high.  Then it's going... It's kind of going back and forth.  Does that sound like an EDM song?  Like, you put a beat behind this, you could probably, like, get some... Something going on in the club.  ... uh Alright, so... Anyway, okay, so... That's... That's what this... So this is the power button.  Alright?  This cycles through the different modes.  And then there's this one with the lightning bolt.  What this is, is supposedly... This just goes, like, full power.  So I'll turn it on and show you what I'm talking about.  So it's doing its thing, right?  Doing its little EDM music.  And you decide, you know what?  I wanna fucking go balls to the wall.  So you click this button.  And this just makes it go full speed.  No fucking around.  So, you have, like, these different EDM modes, and then you have, like, high.  That's it.  Okay?  So, it's not bad.  It's not bad at all.  I would put it... I would say, compared to these other spinning robots... Let's do a side-by-side.  You'll see what I'm talking about.  Alright?  So, I'll put these... You can see this is faster.  So there is, it's not quite the, you know, the bottom.  For a $50 spinning rope pussy, this is definitely the best one.  So, that is the thing.  As far as spinning robot pussies go, the $50 tier, the kind of the lower tier spinning robot pussies, this one is the most powerful.  Are there more powerful spinning robot pussies?  Absolutely.  But as far as the spinning robot pussies that are at this price range, I don't think you could do better than this.  I do have some questions, though.  It has a headphone port.  Okay, so you're supposed to plug headphones in this, and I assume listen to some moans.  But there's no button for activating the moans.  So I assume they're just always on when the toy is in, you know, is going.  But there's no actual button to turn the moaning on and off.  I guess it's just always on.  There's something else I want to bring up.  This box comes with a lot.  I'm not really sure why, but so here's the thing.  It comes with a stand, so with a suction cup, so you can mount this to something.  Now, when you're mounting it to something, you need to be aware that it needs to be flat and kind of airtight.  So something, ideally something like stainless steel, If you try to stick this to your wall, it's not gonna work because of the texture on the wall.  It's gonna be something flat and sturdy.  But, you know, this could make it a hands-free device.  if you have a thing you can mount it to.  I haven't really had a lot of luck with these.  I just don't have the space.  I don't have, like, a thing to mount my toys to.  So I never really use these, but this is a good feature.  I mean, this is something that you could use.  These come with a few toys.  So if you want to, you can screw this in.  It screws in at the bottom, and then you can mount this to something and then have it be hands-free, which is a cool, cool feature.  It comes with a free bottle of lube.  The Yaroon, it's very, this is a very watery, realistic lube.  It simulates a woman's actual, like, wet pussy juice.  So it's, this is a good, this is a good lube.  Highly recommended.  So you get a free bottle of lube with the toy.  Wasn't expecting that.  You also get a free pair of earbuds.  I assume this is to listen to the moans, but you don't need to worry about having your own earbuds, it comes with its own pair of free earbuds.  So hey, free earbuds.  And then, the one thing I was not expecting, a secondary insert.  Now, it's identical to the other insert, so I don't even have to take the insert out to show you what the insert looks like, because it comes with a second one.  I've never seen a Spinning Robot Pussy come with a second insert except for the Leet'n Future, but those came with separate inserts with different characteristics.  This is just a second copy of the insert that's in the toy.  So you can see that it has studs, and then rings, and then more studs.  And you can see the width.  It's good for an average-sized guy's cock.  It's not overly tight or overly loose or anything.  I really have no complaints.  I just wasn't expecting a second insert.  Because usually these toys don't come with anything like a second insert.  Which is, sure, in the grand scheme of things, it might be a little bit of an oversight.  I just wasn't expecting a second insert to come with this toy.  So, for $50... you're getting a really good kind of, you know, upper-low tier spinning robot pussy, good rotation, but it comes with a lot of free stuff.  It comes with a free bottle of lube, free earbuds, a free mount, an extra insert, all for less than $50.  That's a really good deal.  So if you haven't bought a spinning robot pussy yet... you're looking for an entry-level spinning robot pussy and you only want to spend fifty dollars.  you don't want to spend two three four hundred dollars on a top shelf spinning robot pussy but you want to see what this all this is about.  all this whole spinning robot pussy shit is about.  you want to see what the hype is all about.  so this is a good entry-level spinning robot pussy.  is it the best?  no For $50, yes.  It's the best $50 spinning robot pussy available.  And it comes with a lot of free stuff.  A lot of free stuff I was not expecting.  And it's called The Dark Knight.  So, you know, why not?
