God doggone you, Kevin Samuels, with all these people calling him with their shenanigans, got me listening and laughing.  Listen, ladies, you wanted equality, right?  So I don't want to hear it.  Put on your suit, put on your tie, you know, and get to work.  If, you know, you wanted to... Have jobs and have careers and make more than a man.  And you want, you could do whatever a man can do.  You know what else a man could do?  Date somebody that makes less money than them and give them money.  You asked for this.  All right.  That's what you, I'm sorry.  I'm really not sorry, but I'm sorry just to say I'm sorry for the, you know, the video.  You wanted equality.  So I don't want to hear it.  You wanted to be the mother and the father.  You felt like you could do it.  So now that your world is crumbling around you and the London Bridge is falling down, I don't want to hear your mouth.  I ain't going to do it.  Y'all fought for this type of stuff.  I want love.  You want to be married and divorce the person you was married to because you want love.  I don't want to hear it.  You want to leave your husband because you want to have a job.  I don't want to hear it.  You want to leave the real for the possibility of a fantasy.  So I don't want to hear it.  OK, I really don't.  Man.  Yeah, a man will accept me and my children, and they'll pay private school, and they'll make me a millionaire, and I don't want to have any more kids, but a high-value man will do it for me.  Man, I don't... What you smoking?  Huh?  I mean, Snoop don't smoke nothing as strong as that.  Like, Cheech and Chong ain't never had nothing as strong as that.  You know what I'm saying?  Willie Nelson ain't never hit nothing as strong as that.  No.  Hang on to go to school and get my education and get a career.  Okay, cool.  What the?  Okay.  I haven't found anybody on my level.  Can I tell you something that you really don't like to hear?  Because I'm going to tell you anyways.  Don't nobody want to hear that.  Who on your level?  What is your level?  Huh?  I went to school.  That's my level.  That's your level?  Level of a person went to school?  Okay.  But, you know what I'm saying?  What if you built bad?  Should you be in a built bad level?  Because you got an education, you don't deserve people who built bad like you.  Okay.  Look, man, you want equality?  You're going to get equality in treatment too.  And equality in logic.  And equality in people like, listen, no, no, you can't have it all.  Yes, I can have it all.  Yes, I can.  Who has had it all?  Who?  Name me one person in the history of mankind who's had it all.  Go for it.  Y'all want to go to church and see.  Jesus ain't even have it all.  But you know what?  So I don't want to hear it.  A man is supposed to come here and make my life better.  No, no.  You said you were empowered.  You empowered yourself.  You can do it all.  Clap like a thot when I'm talking.  So I don't want to hear it.  I really don't.  You can empower yourself to go to school and get an education, but you can't get up off your behind and go bust a lap, do some sit-ups, eat a salad.  But you want some super fine, super rich man.  Really?  And you built like an obese gummy bear?  Really?  I'm thick.  All the men like me.  If all the men like you, how come don't nobody like you?  Gee, that's what the guy say to another guy.  Dude, all these girls love me.  Who?  I ain't never seen them.  You just swipe left.  Now nobody want you.  Ain't nobody left.  But left.  Don't nobody want to hear this, man.  You want to have kids by multiple people and somebody's going to come along and help me and save me and treat me like a woman and marry me.  Shut up.  What are you talking about?  I'm triggered because I just want everything to work out for me.  Are you grown or not?  What does this look like to you?  This ain't Mulan, motherfucker.  We tired of your mouth because you're not making no damn sense.  All right?  You wanted all of this.  You got equality.  Shut up.  Stop crying about the equality that you asked for.  I didn't want to pay for a meal.  You don't want to pay for a meal and you don't want to cook?  God damn you lazy.  You know what?  Like, share, subscribe, and die trying.  I'm out.  I ain't got time for y'all BS. ",
