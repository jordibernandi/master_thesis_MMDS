            "text": "Okay, tribe, so this story just happened last night in Austin, Texas.  You have a Marxist communist supporter, BLM supporter, all right, a white guy, right, carrying an AK-47 and wanting to intimidate citizens from going from point A to point B as they travel around the road.  And he thinks, and this is the problem with the second amendment with a lot of people is that you think that the right to bear arms gives you the right to intimidate citizens.  It gives you the right to stop citizens from traveling.  You're no different than fascists.  You are no different than the red coats that you speak against stuff.  But let's see, let's see what he has to say about that before the incident happens.  Can you tell us a little bit about your gun again?  It's an AK-47.  Why'd you got it out tonight?  They don't let us march in the streets anymore, so I got to practice some of our rights.  Do you feel like you'll need to use it?  Nah.  I think the, uh... I mean, if I use it against the cops, I'm dead.  And I think all the people that hate us and, you know, want to say shit to us are too big of pussies to stop and actually do anything about it.  Why'd you start carrying?  Well, our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march anywhere, so I started carrying.  Thanks.  Okay, tribe, famous last words.  Those who oppose him, right, are pussies.  And that was all he wrote.  Okay, let's just be clear, folks, okay?  I'm going to be very clear with you.  Communism, communists, fascists, whatever you want to call them, do not have rights under our Constitution.  In our Second Amendment, the rights written in the Constitution are not to be used against our own citizens to intimidate, to attack, to be a threat to them, to keep them from traveling the roads.  That's not what our rights are for.  So if you think that the Second Amendment gives you the right to carry AK-47 and stop a citizen traveling down the road, you got something else coming.  Because in some states, we actually have some great states in America that actually stand by the right to bear arms.  We have a standing ground law.  And you come around a vehicle being a threat, imposing a threat, and pointing your rifle, you will be taken seriously.  Okay?  But let's watch what happens afterwards.  Everybody back up!  Okay, tribe, so you guys watch these so-called Marxist protesters blocking the road.  You hear the victim honking seven, eight times.  Now, the minute he starts honking seven, eight times, what happens?  The protest, so-called protestors, Marxist protestors, run, angry, pissed off at the vehicle.  You know what's gonna happen next.  We have seen it before.  They're gonna beat up on the vehicle.  They're gonna take out the victim.  They're gonna beat him up.  They're gonna kill him.  Who knows what happens, right?  So at this point, This individual carrying the AK-47, Garrett Foster, who just said that nobody opposes him because everybody's a pussy, decides to walk up to the vehicle with a loaded AK-47 and point it at the victim inside the vehicle.  Now, this is Austin, Texas, and it plays out a little different for Mr.  Garrett Foster.  So he ends up getting what?  Taken down, put down.  You know, and then the vehicle drives off, okay?  Now, of course, the Petifa and those marshals that were there are claiming that Mr.  Gary Foster's a victim and he do nothing wrong.  And it's all the fault of very bad vehicle driver who is driving recklessly and pointing his gun at everybody.  You know, and if you believe that tale, I got a bridge to sell you, okay?  Because that's not what actually happened.  uh, happen.  Uh, and we know that's not what happens on all these stories.  Okay.  That's why they got a lot of people there.  That's what all of them are going to support their own witness story.  So they can, you know, claim to be the hero in this, in this, in this particular story.  Now I'm going to tell you again, this is a perfect example of our constitution and the fact of our constitutional rights.  Okay.  Perfect example.  Marxists and communists are not protected by our Constitution.  You do not have the right under the Second Amendment to abuse our rights against American citizens.  You don't have that right.  It doesn't say anywhere in our rights that you're allowed to use the Second Amendment to intimidate, attack, loot, rob, steal, kill, Any innocent person, any American citizen does not give you that right at all.  As a matter of fact, the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, gives the victim in the vehicle the right to defend himself, his property, the way he's going, the travel and where he's going.  You have no right to stop him.  you have no single right and that's not under freedom of speech and that's not under the second amendment.  so again for all you out there okay defending the uh communists in oregon portland and attacking the federal officers all right Communists don't have the right to blind our federal officers.  Communists don't have the right to put buildings on fire.  Communists do not have the right to kill innocent or hurt innocent people.  You don't have the right.  Okay, and here's another beautiful thing about this whole scenario.  What did they do after Mr.  Gary Fossey got put down?  What happened?  What did they do?  They called the police.  They ended up calling that police.  The same people that are talking about defunding the police calls the police, all right?  And what happens when they do that, right?  What happens when they do that?  They call the police.  Police does their job, all right?  They do an investigation, right?  So I'm going to give a message for all you Marxists and communists and BLM supporters that are talking about defunding police.  Pray.  Man, Lordy, pray that that never happens.  Because you got people like me and like that victim in that car with lots of guns, lots of ammo.  And we're going to clean the streets once and for all.  We're going to take down these commies once and for all.  Ain't going to be no law, no police.  Ain't going to be no 911. that's going to come and help you.  You know, you ain't going to be crying to mommy.  No mommy going to come and help you.  You know what I'm saying?  Nobody's going to come and help you.  All right.  So if you want a wild west scenario, that's what you're going to have.  Especially in Texas.  Especially in Florida.  You're going to have a lot of good people with a lot of guns.  Okay, we've just been itching, itching to take out this scum out of our republic once and for all.  So pray, pray every day.  Pray for our police officers.  Back to blue.  We really should.  You know, communists have no place in America.  They really don't.  So I hope you guys learned a lesson, kids.  And I hope you share this video.  Thank you very much. ",
