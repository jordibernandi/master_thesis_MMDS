I've put together a team of super-awesome kid reporters, bringing kids the news we need.  Why the election and why do we have them?  Because the United States is a government run by the people.  How do you disagree and still get along?  Empathy, Raya.  You don't like them because I'm a better diver.  Oh, foul on the play.  I think news shows should end with a pep talk and a dance party.  Let's keep making this world better, one step after another.  Kid Correspondent, only on YouTube. ",
