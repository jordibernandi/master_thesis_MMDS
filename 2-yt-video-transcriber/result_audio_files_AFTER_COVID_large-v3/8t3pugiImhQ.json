            "text": "If you're not too keen on the government's response to the COVID-19 virus, then you're not alone.  In fact, you're in good company, as many Americans are waking up to the edicts of government tyranny.  Now perhaps you think that's too strong of a word, tyranny.  Tyranny is oppressive government as opposed to liberty of the individual.  Liberty is protected and flourishes when government adheres to its limitations.  Look around you, folks.  Is it liberty when you cannot peaceably assemble?  Is it liberty that you cannot attend worship services because the physical location is forcibly closed?  Is it liberty that you cannot go to a restaurant for a sit-down meal?  Obviously, it's entirely the opposite of liberty.  Oh, but it's for your safety, some might say.  We have to defeat the virus.  Government needs to be able to operate unimpeded to be successful.  Really?  Well, let's take a look at a clip from Congressman Thomas Massey, who offers his input on the government's response. ",

            "text": "Are there internal discussions about the limits of state and federal power with regards to this virus?  There are almost no discussions about the limits of state and federal power.  I can say so far the president's been somewhat reserved compared to the governors.  The governors, I think, are really going overboard here, particularly in Kentucky and Ohio.  I'm not sure what's going on elsewhere in the country, but in Kentucky, obviously, they shut down our schools.  And you could say that's within their purview since the schools are a government function, at least the public schools.  But they also just shut down all of the restaurants.  You can't dine in now at a restaurant in Kentucky.  They're shutting down more and more things every day and putting people out of jobs.  And so when you make a recommendation, so the president and his advisors have made recommendations, I think that's fine to do.  What they're actually doing when the CDC issues a recommendation is they're setting a standard or a threshold that may be later used in litigation.  If the CDC says we recommend that no more than 20 people meet, And then you have a meeting with 25 people and three of them get sick.  Now they're going to come and sue whoever organized the meeting.  But that's not onerous to me.  What's onerous to me are the governors just going in and saying, you can't run your business.  Now, here in Kentucky, we also may have been the first state to have this situation where They posted a sheriff's deputy outside of a guy's house to force a quarantine.  You know, the words self-quarantine have been used rather euphemistically and maybe accurately until now.  But what happens if you don't self-quarantine?  Well, it turns out in Kentucky, I guess they send the sheriff to your house.  Now, I don't know what they would do if that guy walks out of his house and tries to get in his car.  Are they gonna shoot him?  I mean, that sounds like something that was happening in China that we were appalled by.  And here, just a couple months later, all of those appalling videos that we saw in China, now people are conditioned and ready to accept that, I'm afraid. ",

            "text": "The Kentucky story is an interesting one, and many outlets are not reporting the whole story of the family, refuting if he was actually tested.  Since you may find you have some extra time on your hands, I recommend you look up the story at thehill.com.  In regards to all of this, many are saying we can't trust individuals to do the right thing, so government must act to keep everyone else safe.  Now that may sound comforting to some, but let's rephrase it just a bit.  Since the government can't trust you, they are forced into controlling you into doing what they think is the right thing.  Is this the America our founders envisioned?  Over the next several days, weeks and months, you will hear many arguments supporting the legality and the constitutionality of these tyrannical actions.  These arguments will come from elected officials of all levels of government, perhaps even from trusted organizations and politicians from the highest offices.  However, we think that the Constitution is clear regarding what the federal government can and cannot do.  For instance, the First Amendment guarantees the right to a series of freedoms, including peaceable assembly.  The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures.  These are a check onto the federal government.  So far, the federal government has only issued recommendations and not forcible orders.  This does not take into consideration the absolute unconstitutional measures that Congress is taking to pass stimulus, or to ramp up any welfare programs to help Americans deal with this draconian reaction.  The states, on the other hand, are being very egregious in their response.  Each state's constitution has adopted the Bill of Rights in some manner.  For instance, the Wisconsin Constitution lists this under Article 1, Section 4.  Right to assemble and petition.  The right of the people peaceably to assemble, to consult for the common good, and to petition the government, or any department thereof, shall never be abridged.  Now let me repeat that.  Shall never be abridged.  If your state's constitution says something similar, then how is it that the current state government response is not unconstitutional?  Many supporters of this tyranny will go through legal gymnastics to prove to you that the response is warranted, including many good-meaning lawyers and justices.  Yet, state legislatures and legal precedents have abridged your rights.  Would you rather operate in this twisted mire of the current legalese, or do you prefer to get back to the founding documents?  We prefer the founders.  To help make our point, we suggest that you take some of your current free time, thanks to COVID-19, to watch Overview of America, a 30-minute video that offers a straightforward explanation of how our unique system of government is supposed to work and how America did become great.  This video has been seen by tens of millions over the years.  The latest HD version can be found on YouTube.  A link is in the video description or comment section, depending on which platform you're watching.  Then, we ask you to please share Overview of America with others.  By doing so, you are taking an active part in educating others on the proper limitations of government.  This simple action is the fundamental tactic our organization has employed for more than 60 years.  It was President Thomas Jefferson who wrote.  I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves.  And if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education.  This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.  Those currently under lockdown should be able to recognize that the America we see today is not what the founders envisioned.  So please, take an active part in educating others.  Since many members of our organization are not able to get out into their communities to meet face to face, they are currently meeting in their chapters through other means, including phone and online video conferencing.  They are also sharing information like Overview of America to help wake up Americans and enlist them into our action program to get our republic back on track.  This is the true response Americans should have in combating tyranny.  More knowledge applied wisely through our action program will yield accountable government.  Now, all of this being said, what do we think is the proper COVID-19 response by government?  one that doesn't force participation, but one that obeys constitutional limitations and respects our God-given rights.  We'll have more on this later.  And until next time, stay active. ",
