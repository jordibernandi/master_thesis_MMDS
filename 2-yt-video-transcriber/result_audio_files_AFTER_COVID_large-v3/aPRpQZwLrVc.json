Scientists have discovered that the male determining gene, the Y chromosome, is so unstable, it's actually disappearing.  Wait, so men will completely disappear one day?  Yes.  In precisely 4.6 million years, men as we know it will cease to exist.  Wait, but without men, how will we continue the human race?  Women actually have sperm cells in their bone marrow, so we don't even need men to reproduce.  And because we only have the X chromosome, we would only make girl babies.  Yes, we as a society have progressed past the need for men. ",

We have just given up like genuinely fighting for equality.  We're just saying, fuck it.  We're banking on bone marrow babies, making dumb videos like that.  All right, well, I hate to burst your bubble along with 4 million other people, but let's talk about the actual science of this.  The Y chromosome is only needed for two reasons.  One, it carries the SRY gene.  Number two, it promotes the synthesis of sperm.  Sure, the Y chromosome could eventually disappear, but it's already disappeared in mammals and two different species of rats.  However, in one case, the SRY gene moved over to the X chromosome.  So I really hate to burst your bubble, but men are not just gonna suddenly disappear.  So how about we stop bitching about bone marrow babies and things that are gonna happen in five million years and actually sit down and start talking to each other? ",
