So anytime you're done with rehearsal or a theater's closed for the day, you always leave one stand with a single light bulb on, constantly.  And it's for your theater's ghost.  It's also, like, respectful to your ghost.  Like, it is.  It is thanking them for using the theater.  Because when things go wrong during rehearsals, if something breaks, like one time in high school, a metal pipe fell on my shoulder.  It just like broke off while we were rehearsing and we blamed the theater ghost.  So when things go wrong, you also blame the theater ghost, which is kind of what Phantom is. ",

It feels like I'm looking in a mirror or revisiting what my childhood was like in high school theater with a mix of what theater is in terms of how extravagant it has to be.  Especially for that, not the time period of when Phantom is set, but the time period when it was made.  Mm-hmm.  The 80s.  Yeah.  1986.  And 80s musicals are great.  Because even, like, again, Little Shop of Horrors, it also is very cheesy, too.  Yeah, it is.  And it's a great cheesy.  I think that's why I'm not so critical on, like, the lyrics, on how well written they are, because for me, at the end of the day, I'm just kind of like, theater's supposed to be just fun.  At least, like, from an actor's perspective.  Like, there's more when you're the spectator, and, like, you want like A plus theater.  And then I'm sure as well, if you're a composer, there's other elements.  But for an actor, we're more just like, we want good writing, but we also just want a chance to have fun.  And I could tell that the actors in the live one we watch, And I said it to you a few times, I'm like, they're having fun.  There's moments where I like stop listening to the story and I just am looking at the actors on how they're acting.  And that was where I felt the most enjoyment.  I'm going to mention Cats now.  I don't like Cats, but I respect it.  But when I see actors having fun in Cats, then I can sit through it and I can say, oh, I had a great time going to see Cats.  But I don't like Cats.  I'm just going to put that out there.  Especially because I made a face earlier when you two were talking about cats and I'm looking at the camera like, no.  No.  So now it'll make sense. ",
