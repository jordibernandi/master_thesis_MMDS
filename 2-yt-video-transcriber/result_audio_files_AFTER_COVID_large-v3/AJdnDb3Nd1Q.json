Rob and Keith are litigating a cutting-edge property rights case in Memphis that has at its heart a so-called court that is run utterly without due process.  Rob, when IJ launched this case, we released a video that was entitled Court Strips Elderly Woman of Her Home and Ruins Her Life.  Now, that's a pretty dramatic title, and I wondered if you could start by explaining why it's not an exaggeration.  Who is this woman and what happened to her? ",

            "text": "Well, thank you, Melanie.  When Ms.  Holmberg's family and friends reached out to I.J.  and said that she was at risk of losing her home and had a warrant out for her arrest because of the condition of her home after a natural disaster, it seemed unbelievable to us it.  it didn't seem like something frankly that could happen in america and the more that we learned about her situation and about the court where this was happening the more unbelievable and let yet sadly real it became.  ms holmberg is a decades-long resident of a very nice home that she owned outright with no mortgage.  Tragedy struck, a natural disaster, as is common in Memphis, unfortunately, with their particular weather systems, had a tree fall on the home.  And when the repair process began, and we all know how that can be, dealing with the insurance company, trying to get family to help, you know, it's a huge undertaking.  Suddenly, she found herself in something called an environmental court, something that we had never heard of.  And that really, in the very name itself, is not very revealing about what the court actually is.  What we learned is that this is a sort of quarrel.  quasi social services agency where the people working there are not there to help you but are actually in an adversarial role when people go into this courtroom and we actually ended up not only going down to view many proceedings ourselves but also hired a courtroom monitor to watch what happened.  what happened there was shocking.  rather than a court where people are taking evidence under oath, where there is a sense of record keeping, where you have an actual record of what happened in the case so that you can appeal.  This was basically a free-for-all.  People were bellowing out testimony from the audience.  People were sitting up, shockingly, on the... chair where the judge sat in donning robes whose identity was not really clear and were still making decisions.  One of the most peculiar things about this court is that rather than official court staff guiding people through the process, interns from law schools come out and sort of usher people in, explain to property owners that they're there to help defend reaches sort of deal regarding their home but they don't tell them that ",

            "text": "Absolutely, Melanie, and that's a great question.  You know, the Environmental Court has a long history in Memphis.  We can actually trace it back to 1983, when the Environmental Court was first created as a division of Memphis' city courts.  And for a long time, it was sort of a benign institution.  It focused mostly on dealing with property code issues, and people's homes weren't being taken, and the power it had was actually quite limited.  But in 1991, the Tennessee legislature, in conjunction with Shelby County, decided to turn that city court into a general sessions court and with it give it the power to hold people in contempt for refusing to obey orders.  And from there, the system began to snowball.  As Rob alluded to, it doesn't have these rules of evidence.  It doesn't have the kind of safeguards that you would expect to see in a court.  And This issue multiplied when, in 2004, the Tennessee legislature passed this act called the Neighborhood Preservation Act, which is a piece of legislation that permitted private entities and private individuals to sue homeowners in the state, homeowners of vacant lots, to have those lots declared a public nuisance.  And the court could then further order those folks to repair the lot.  And if they couldn't, the court had the power to appoint a receiver, which would then take control of the property, make repairs, and could then sell the property in order to recoup their costs.  But What made it particularly troublesome is in 2016, the Tennessee legislature expanded the act.  In 2004, it was limited to vacant houses.  But in 2016, they expanded it and they said that suits under the Tennessee Neighborhood Preservation Act could be brought against homeowners who were living in their homes, like Sarah Hohenberg.  And so you had this court that didn't have the proper safeguards now adjudicating claims that could result in a person losing their home.  So it didn't happen overnight.  It happened over decades and decades of a slow accumulation of power.  And it's left people like Sarah Hohenberg homeless and, as Rob explained, a fugitive from justice. ",

If you have abandoned buildings or properties that are becoming some kind of threat to neighbors or that leave them kind of feeling vulnerable or exposed, that the government needs some means by which to deal with those properties.  How would you respond to that concern, which is probably a legitimate concern for a lot of people in Memphis? ",

            "text": "Well, fighting blight is certainly something that governments have the right and authority to do.  And blight is a problem in urban centers like Memphis, and they should be able to combat it.  But what we're saying is, is that they need to combat it the right way.  They need to combat it within the limits of the Constitution.  And there's a big difference, constitutionally speaking, between vacant, abandoned, derelict properties and a person's home.  And when a person's home is involved, when Sarah Hohenberg's home is at stake, she deserves some very serious due process protections because no one should lose their home in a proceeding that they can't effectively appeal where they aren't guaranteed to have witnesses who are sworn in, where evidence isn't authenticated and a record isn't kept.  A home is a person's most important belonging.  You see cases referring to a person's home as their castle.  And a person shouldn't be able to lose their home in that circumstance unless they go before a very legitimate court that follows legitimate constitutional processes.  So if Memphis wants to fight blight, they can, but they just need to follow the Constitution when they do it. ",

And in fact, the model that Memphis set up for its environmental court has for decades been promoted by the court's founders around the country as a model for other municipalities to adopt.  We know at this point that there's at least 70 such courts around the country, and we've identified some other examples that are the sort of systemic mechanistic types of housing courts that Memphis has, the city of Detroit and Cleveland, both of which, by the way, as Keith mentioned, have real blight problems, are using this kind of expedited process through their housing courts to have proceedings where people could indeed risk losing their homes.  This is a real problem, and that's why the impact of this case could be so profound.  It's no coincidence that Detroit and Cleveland are both within the Sixth Circuit, the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where this case has been brought.  So a victory here in the long run could really bring justice and due process to citizens in a number of states who find themselves caught in this kind of court. ",

The Constitution says that a person can't be deprived of their life, their liberty, or their property without receiving due process of law.  And the procedures that a person is entitled to vary depending on how important that interest is.  So a property interest like your home, being the most important piece of property that most people own, is entitled to a great deal of process before the government can take that away from you.  And in the environmental court, you just don't have any of the basic courtroom procedures that you would expect.  You know, I kind of like to think of it as, you know, everyone has seen an episode of Law & Order.  Everyone's seen, you know, lawyers arguing before a judge, and witnesses get sworn in.  They promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Evidence is authenticated before it's presented, and you have a courtroom stenographer who's taking fastidious notes.  But... The environmental court looks nothing like that.  As Rob explained, it's a nightmarish DMV.  And at the end of the day, you don't leave without your driver's license.  You instead leave and can get thrown in prison, or you leave and you never see your home again.  And it's those kinds of problems that we're going to try to challenge in this case.  We're trying to get a ruling from a court that says, look, the environmental court, if it wants to take away people's homes, if it wants to have the power to adjudicate these issues, you have to have constitutional safeguards.  You have to make sure that this is a proceeding that's being conducted effectively and within the confines of the U.S.  Constitution. ",
