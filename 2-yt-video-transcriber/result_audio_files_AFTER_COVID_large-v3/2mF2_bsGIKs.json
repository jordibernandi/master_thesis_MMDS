They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management.  I mean, really bad management.  So that seems to be where they.  they're looking for a trillion dollars.  to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some case radical left Democrats, that have not done a good job.  I appreciate today the Wall Street Journal said very good things that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in Homeland Security, Chad Wolf and the folks.  we went into portland and we've done a great job and they had that in an editorial that we that we really won that situation.  but we want the whole week.  we did save the courthouse.  security courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down.  it was in tremendous danger.  we went in we took care of it uh... and uh... we appreciated what the wall street journal said.  uh... as far as the various uh... things that i may or may not sign uh... i may not have to sign I mean, progress is being made, as you know, very well on the Hill.  We'll see what happens.  But I have the right, including the payroll tax suspension, we may do some things.  We want to take care of the eviction problem.  People are being evicted very unfairly.  It's not their fault.  It's China's fault.  It's not their fault.  And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an executive order.  So if we don't get, and we want to do it relatively quickly, I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID.  People get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters.  And this is not a time.  You never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID.  They catch it.  They get it.  And it's no good.  So I may have to do something on evictions, too, because the Democrats amazingly don't want to do it.  We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives.

If you look at India, they're at about 11 million, and we're at 61 million.  And there comes a point when you just want to focus your testing in a different way.  And we'll be announcing some.  What we've done is incredible with the testing.  Not only the testing, not only the number of tests, but also, very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing.  Nobody thought it would be possible to get a five-minute and a 15-minute result.  That's a very accurate result, and we do with Abbott.  Abbott Laboratories has done a great job.  Many of these companies have done an incredible job.  So we're looking at that very strongly, and we're looking at doing something that, if we do it, look, right now, what the testing is doing is helpful, but we're spending massive amounts of money, and we want to have it channeled very accurately.  We want to be able to help the most people we can.  But we are testing at a level that no country in the world \u2014 and I've spoken to the leaders of the world, and they'll ask me about it \u2014 no country in the world thought it would be \u2014 it's even believable that we're able to test so much.  Sixty-one million versus, you know, most countries don't even test.  You know when they test when somebody is feeling badly?  If somebody's feeling badly, they're symptomatic, that's when they test.  And that's a big difference.  With us, we go around and looking, because if we find, we find spots, we find hot spots.  One problem is, from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show.  So it's, you know, as I called it the other day in a statement, I said it's called media gold.  You know, for the media, it's gold.  But the truth is, it's... We've done an incredible job in testing.  Nobody in the world has done the job.  Other leaders have told me the same thing.  They can't believe we were able to do it.  And we will continue.

I mean, in Nevada, where you have a governor, he said, let's just send out millions of ballots, and the post office cannot be prepared.  I haven't spoken to the post office about it, but I don't know how they could possibly be prepared.  Florida has been working on this for years.  and they have a very good system of mail-in, and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee.  So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.  They're so well-run.  Florida is a very well-run state.  Low taxes, low everything.  They've done a great job, really a great job.  And the two governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots.  And even in the case of mail-in ballots, the postal services are built up there.  You know, it takes a long time.  When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they \u2014 and I'll give you the story \u2014 I think you have to do that election over.  That election is no good.  You have to take a look in New York.  They have thousands of ballots.  They don't know what happened to them.  Is there fraud?  Is there \u2014 it's a disaster.  And that's only for a relatively small number of ballots.  But I think they have to do the election in New York over.  The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday \u2014 front-page story.  It's a disaster.  It's a mess.  And they have to do that.  I think they have to do that election over.  Nobody can know what the election result is.  So in the case of Florida, they've done a great job.  They've had tremendous success with it.  But they've been doing this over many years, and they've made it really terrific.  So for Florida, you can mail in your ballots.  You don't have to go.  In maybe a couple of other states, they've worked out a system.  But this took years to do.  This doesn't take weeks or months.  In the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks.  And you can't do that.  I can't imagine the post office could do it.
