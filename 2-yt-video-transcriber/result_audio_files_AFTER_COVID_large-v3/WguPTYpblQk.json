            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  In this video that was requested by a Truth Seeker, I will be talking about some amazing, amazing, but yet deceiving celebrity use of paparazzi tools that was covered up and more.  And you all may be shocked by some of them and some of them you may be like, oh girl, this is old news.  And again, I get a lot of Truth Seeker requests in regards to videos and things of that nature.  I get a lot of emails, a lot of DMs, and I'm trying to get to all of them expeditiously.  But remember, I'm doing this alone.  I do not have any help.  And some things are going to get neglected, unfortunately.  But I am doing my best.  And I thank you all for supporting me.  I really, really do.  I'm trying to, you know, change here.  But with that being said, let's get started.  Now this is a video that I'm going to enjoy a lot because for years I always speculated that celebrities they use the paparazzi for whatever personal gain they may need.  Now we're going to go back a little and then we're gonna move to the present.  For example, You all remember when DJ Khaled surprised us all with a public proposal to Nicki Minaj.  And later, Nicki was spotted with an engagement ring, you know, a few days later.  Well, later, Nicki admitted that it was all faked.  And it was also told that her engagement with Nick Mill was also faked as well.  And it was just for publicity.  Oh, yes.  You all remember when Kanye demanded that Anna Wintour put Kim Kardashian on the cover and Anna said, absolutely not.  Keep in mind, Anna and Kim are friends.  Heck, she's on her app for crying out loud.  So suddenly Kim was on the cover a month or so later.  Well, Wintour admitted that it was all made up drama to sell magazines.  And guess what?  It worked.  They all do it.  It always works.  Now, you all remember Cordell Stewart and Portia Williams' divorce, and Portia was acting all calm and the perfect wife.  Well, it was reported that she was acting this way to calm the public and steer away from drama and being judged from the other wives.  Oh, yes.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  The infamous elevator fight with Beyonce and Jay-Z and Solange.  Oh, not to mention the divorce rumors at the time.  Well, Matthew knows who's a vet at creating distractions and getting things done and, you know, for publicity and things of that nature.  leaked that the elevator fight was a publicity stunt.  you see he may not be B's manager anymore but he said the drama and rumors were just drumming up publicity for their on the run tour.  how does he know?  he said that when he was B's manager they did things like that all the time.  oh and guess what it worked.  You all know B isn't going to leave Jay's ass behind.  I mean, she already went on record that she would die for him for crying out loud.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yes.  Now here is the bomb, and some of you may already know this, but guess what?  That divorce with NeNe Leakes was off stage, and they never really divorced.  That and the wedding was a mere publicity stunt to drum up ratings.  They used TMZ and all the other blogs to push that story.  Oh yes, well I'm still not done yet.  Cordell Stewart.  You all remember him.  I just mentioned him.  And I said in a video I did about her as well.  I will leave the link below if I remember to do so.  Well, it's on my Keisha's Gossip channel just to let you know.  Well, the African-American billionaire, that I'm not even trying to pronounce his name, came right around the time that those rumors started.  And she began posting expensive gifts on her Instagram page.  That is until Tamelia Jones jumped up and said, then was her man and Williams needed to shame the devil and tell the truth.  Then things got even more confusing when Williams finally spoke up to say that TMZ made the whole affair up, like I just said, in the first place.  And they were paid to do so on a regular basis.  So who were all those gifts from?  We may never know.  Oh, I'm still not done yet.  that feud with little wayne and birdman well that was all a publicity stunt just like b and j to promote the uh carter five.  you know that?  oh yes and it works.  oh and there's more guessing.  relationships were just a publicity stuff but some of them actually turned real.  well let's talk about that Vanessa Hutchins and sexy-ass Zac Efron.  I swear, if I was younger.  Anyway, their relationship was a publicity stunt to promote Disney franchise in the best possible way.  It was reported that their relationship was on and off and more like smooth operators.  I mean, they were good, y'all.  It lasted for about three years.  These contracts sometimes last for years.  And the company made millions and so did they.  Mm-hmm.  Now, here is the real tea, and may not shock many of you, the engagement and then marriage with Kris Humphries and Kim Kardashian.  Well, guess what?  Their relationship was a complete fake.  I mean, not only that, but Humphries confirmed that the relationship was a stunt, not that Kim cares.  I mean, she's with Kanye West, a bigger star that goes better with her.  in the end it all comes to this if you're really married out of love you won't display it on national television.  well not everybody.  oh and the divorce proceedings were all fake and seriously embellished.  they made millions from that as well.  kim chris and the network like i said made millions.  and yes tmz was behind and also some of the other big top blogs as well.  just the big top blogs the other blogs is kind of carried on.  you know what i mean now.  Next, you all remember Ryan Seacrest dating model Julianne Hogue?  And it was this big thing.  Heck, I even heard about it.  And that's rare, especially any news regarding him.  Well, it was reported that the relationship was fake at first.  You see, that's the great thing about paparazzi.  You can always tell by their photos whether something is staged or not.  And these two mastered the skill at faking it.  You know, real photos completely.  No one smiles at the camera miles away from it, only when they're close up and when they're ready for it.  There's also the whole thing of public displays of affection.  No one holds hands, cuddles, and looks at each other adoringly at all times.  No one.  Come on, someone.  I mean, no one.  Someone is bound to be in a bad mood at least once in three years, but not all the freaking time.  Well, that's unless the camera's around and then you go and do that.  And you know, if you think about it, a lot of Hollywood couples are like that.  If you wish to look at these random videos that's recorded by random people at the party, you never see the couples together, ever.  like ever and I don't even name a few couples but I'm sure you guys know who I'm talking about.  but that's a whole nother subject.  now the next one most of Taylor Swift's relationships one in particular Harry Styles.  I never got into the whole Harry Styles thing but he's way too young but it was reported that Swift faked a love interest in Harry Styles to get huge attention from the public's eye.  just as she was about to make a new album Inspiration struck just as her relationship and subsequently a breakup with Harry Styles conveniently happened.  Her album, 1989, was a huge success and most of her songs was allegedly about Styles.  Again, allegedly.  Oh, and here's the cougar.  It makes me want to laugh.  The relationship and then fake marriage of Miley Cyrus.  I know one of you or some of you truth seekers asked me to touch this subject but i think my subscribers will really care because most of them are color and but i'm noticing that i'm seeing a lot of diversity which i love and a lot of people from the uk how y'all doing?  and from overseas love y'all.  anyway me continue with the story okay so the fake marriage between molly cyrus and very handsome liam hemsworth.  i'm a huge fan of his whom were put together when they were both pretty young and managed to stay in this fake relationship together long enough to get engaged.  however during the last few months of their troubled love affair molly was often seen without her engagement ring to me why they're not even really together.  Honestly, the rumor that she was saying, and I'm going to be sarcastic here, she said that it was getting cleaned.  I mean, it doesn't need to be cleaned that often.  I'm just saying that was her excuse for not having a ring on.  And then the pair probably saw the huge profit that was coming out of their love and decided they should stay together.  longer.  remember this what i just said.  they decided to stay together longer until they got freaking sick of it and they did get sick of it.  liam couldn't stand her and they both had their side.  things going on and and there is more and this one takes the cake.  i'll be ready for it.  Katie Holmes and Tom Krups.  Now keep in mind, I talk about this on my Patreon in a video.  I talk about Scientology.  I go really, really deep.  I did a lot of research for that video.  So I was kind of upset that you know the outcome was what it was.  anyway in it i said that tom cruise couldn't have kids among other things.  anyway it has been confirmed that tom was in need of a wife and out and of all the actresses who auditioned there were auditions.  yes they do this for the role.  katie holmes was one who accepted it.  they were in love.  It's like they were never in love because there was just too many negative influences to make their fake marriage work, even in the public, even faking it.  Scientology had its fingers in most of these factors.  And they thought having a baby, even though you just watched the video, I'm not going to get into deep in that right now.  So now you know why Tom doesn't care about Jamie Foxx dating Katie.  They weren't in love.  in the first place it was a freaking contract.  Ariana Grande and Big Sean.  it was this huge thing.  back in 2014 you all remember that whereas Ariana Grande and Big Sean was spotted holding hands backstage at the video music awards oh how cute.  and naturally the gossip columnists went crazy started going off the wall.  guess what it was off stage.  However, it's pretty safe to say that the whole thing, gonna say again, was all freaking staged.  As Big Sean released the nap around the time and Grande was trying to be bigger than Mariah Carey, not, the couple broke up due to Grande being spoiled.  Well, her PR said that.  Well, I guess that's any reason.  I guess it's good enough.  I mean, who cares?  They weren't together in the first place.  First of all, what in the relationship?  So by them breaking up, they made even more headlines and they made millions from their albums.  So ching ching, everyone won.  Anyway, last but not least, Beyonce and Jay-Z.  Their relationship was put together by their purposes.  And of course, Matthew had some say in it as well, as he blatantly speaks about.  Jay-Z had an album coming out and Beyonce was breaking out solely.  They were supposed to date a year or so.  You know, and then break it off, just like many couples I've just mentioned.  Until the album, you know, dropped and they go on tour and hit some of Beyonce's songs.  That first album lyrics being, I was in love with the Sagittarius and her signed song.  The breadcrumbs was already being laid.  But it was important that Jay was ready to drop Beyonce.  He thought she was too young and naive.  And that's a big damn difference.  You can be young and then you can be also naive.  But there are some people who are young, but they are not naive.  It's a whole nother subject.  But she became so attached and obsessed, especially after they had intercourse.  You know, Daisy has a lot of experience in that area.  Meanwhile, Jay was reported seeing a lot of women, as we all know.  I mean, that's not old news.  So Matthew came under fire because the rumors started flowing around that he didn't tell Beyonce that it was all a contract.  It was reported that they did break up, as we know, but their people thought they should extend it another year, as I said they have done with many other couples.  Again, they were making more money together.  And Jay-Z image after that R. Kelly.  and Tupac, et cetera, fiascos that was going on around that time, his image was starting to improve.  Hence, let me upgrade you.  Well, it's safe to say it turned into a marriage, and then a baby, and then another baby, and the rest is history.  And there you have it.  An arrangement turned to an actual relationship, I think.  Oh, and yes, TMZ was a huge factor in all of this, just like TV shows, news, magazine, etc.  You pay them for a story or to deliver fake news.  They would do it for you.  I'm sure some contracts and things of that nature were involved for them to not be held responsible for anything.  Well... that's pretty much it.  but yes but yes it was all for business and all for the love of money.  well that's it.  let me know your thoughts below and don't forget to subscribe like and share.  love you all bye.
