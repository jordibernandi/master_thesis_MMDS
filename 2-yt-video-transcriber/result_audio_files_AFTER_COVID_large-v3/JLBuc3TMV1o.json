            "text": "Hi everyone, Lisa Haven here, and I've got so much to show you in today's report.  Everything from leading CEOs holding secret meetings about how they're going to remove President Trump from office, and Trump's attorney, Sidney Powell, is now coming out saying that they have enough evidence to overturn the election in many states.  And finally, I've got information on Justice Alito, who is really sounding the alarm bells here in America saying, look, we're living in a time where our freedom of religion and our freedom of speech are at risk today more than ever before.  I've got some powerful stuff here, but before I do, just a quick break. ",

Two-thirds of those who were asked claim that they've seen an ad for a product on their cell phones that they've talked about but never looked for online, myself included.

            "text": "They've done it before.  We have evidence from 2016 in California.  We have so much evidence, I feel like it's coming in through a fire hose.  So there you have it.  According to Trump's legal team, they are saying they have flows of evidence, as she says, like a fire hydrant coming at them.  But here's the thing, they've got precisely a little less than one month, just one month to prove that they have enough evidence to overturn the US election.  And they're claiming that that's the case.  Now, we don't know if that's the case because we're just sitting back watching it happen, waiting and watching.  And I guess ultimately time will tell.  But there you have it.  Very powerful words there coming from President Trump's team, legal team.  But that's not all.  I also want to show you this article here, and this is on ZeroHedge.com.  Martin Armstrong says this is the most corrupt election in American history.  Great article there.  uh but that's not all that's going on with regard to the u.s election.  there's also talks behind the scenes from leading ceos on how they're going to remove the president if he doesn't step down from presidency.  take a look here and this is on apnews.com.  top ceos meet to plan response to trump's election denial.  It goes on to say on November 6th, more than two dozen CEOs of major US corporations took part in a video conference to discuss what to do if President Trump refuses to leave office or takes other steps to stay in power beyond the scheduled January 20th inauguration of former VP Joe Biden, which you guys know.  we had mainstream media declare him the winner, including the AP there and other news organizations.  Let me just pause for a second.  Who gave two dozen CEOs the power or ability to do that?  I mean, who put them in charge of our country?  This is why this lingering thought in the back of my head is who are they really connected to and why do they have such power?  And we need to really ask that question.  But the article goes on and says during the conference, which lasted an hour, right, they agreed that trump had the right to pursue legal challenges alleging voter fraud.  of course he does.  we all have a right to take things to court but if trump they go on tries to undo the legal process or disrupt a peaceful transition to biden they discuss making public statements and pressuring legislators in the gop right in their states who may try to redirect electoral college from from biden to trump said yale management professor.  anyway the bottom line on this is this is a little bit creepy to me when you're talking about ceos getting involved in things like that of that nature.  they have nothing to do with that but it really shows the power of i guess big money and big ceos when they have according to their own words the power to pressure, right, pressure the legislators in their states who might try to fill in the blank.  This should be in massive question to many people here in America.  Look, they're already talking about removing the president.  We had Keith Olbermann the other day, and this is on foxnews.com.  And this is removing him before January 20th, I believe is what Keith was talking about here.  He wants Trump removed and arrested and calls his 69 million voters morons.  Why does anybody listen to Keith anymore is beyond me.  But he recently left his ESPN gig to launch an anti-Trump YouTube channel.  But here he is calling for President Trump to be taken off his presidency right now. ",
