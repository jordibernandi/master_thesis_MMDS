            "text": "Hey, this is Pastor Ephraim Smith from Bayside Midtown Campus.  But right now, I'm just the little Rev from the living room, and I'm so glad to be with you.  And I want to read to you from the book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, chapter one.  And I'm going to start with verse 24.  And God said, let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds.  the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.  And it was so.  God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds, and God said it was good.  Then God said, let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals and over all the creatures that move along the ground.  So God created mankind in his own image and the image of God.  He created them male and female.  He created them.  God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number, fill the earth and subdue it.  Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.  Sisters and brothers, here at the beginning, we see that God makes human beings different than he makes the animals.  God made the birds in the sky after their kind.  God made the fish in the sea after their kind.  God made the animals on the ground after their kind.  So animals were created to live amongst each other, but to live in their kind.  Human beings, though, we were made different.  We weren't made after brown kinds and black kinds and white kinds and red kinds. ",
