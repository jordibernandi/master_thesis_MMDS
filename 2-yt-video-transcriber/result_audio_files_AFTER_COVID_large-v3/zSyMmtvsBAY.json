And since it was going so well, and also because he didn't realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going.  Listen in closely here.  Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing.  A big box of nothing delivering another box of nothing. ",

            "text": "The problem that I have here is that while, you know, right-wing media outlets are screaming, oh, fake news, see, see, see what's going on?  The real deception is from Mike Pence trying to deceive the American public on Trump's response to this pandemic, whether that's testing, whether that's PPE, whether that's the number of ventilators and how this administration and the task force is working.  It's all been one big deception, one big lie.  And so for Mike Pence to have a press event, a little PR event, where he jokes about deceiving the public while he's part of a nationwide deception on behalf of this administration is disgusting.  So you want to come at me?  You want to tell me that Jimmy Kimmel, oh, fake news?  This is a fake administration.  This entire thing.  thing has been one big juke by donald trump talking about how he saved millions of lives.  no man you cost us tens of thousands of lives.  so mike pence how dare you make a joke about deceiving the public when you're delivering ppe?  you know how much stress nurses and doctors have been under because they've lacked sufficient ppe.  mike pence you should.  you're part of this task force.  you should know that joking about that is disgusting.  you joke about it while you're leading a task force who has two objectives.  right one is to help mitigate this pandemic.  right that's what the medical experts are doing.  but your responsibility on the task force is to make it seem as though this administration's response has been Incredible.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, Mike, it's been unbelievable.  Unbelievably slow.  And you've cost tens of thousands of Americans their lives.  And you want a joke?  You want a joke, Mike Pence?  About PPE and delivering empty boxes?  You want a joke about deceiving the press and the American people?  You're the joke, Mike Pence. ",
