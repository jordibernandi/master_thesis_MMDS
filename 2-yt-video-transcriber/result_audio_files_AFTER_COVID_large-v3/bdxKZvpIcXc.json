            "text": "Come on in the room.  What's up guys?  How y'all doing family?  We are in Los Angeles right now.  I'm in Los Angeles.  What's up young me?  I see you.  What's up?  We are in Los Angeles right now.  The crowds are huge.  Let me show y'all how it's looking out here.  Got the helicopters up there.  This is Hollywood Boulevard.  No, I'm good, brother.  Thank you, man.  You're good.  That's my wife right there looking beautiful.  All right.  They got the National Guard out here heavy.  Let me show y'all what Hollywood Boulevard is looking like, guys.  Hollywood Boulevard, they got the National Guard out here, heavy.  Watch these guys, it's very militarized.  They got those National Guard trucks down there.  It's a very interesting scene out here.  All right.  Like I said, it's heavy, man.  It's serious out here.  You know, the Trump administration, they thought they were going to scare everybody.  Oh, these motorcycles scared my kid.  He jumped a little bit.  You know, they thought they were going to scare everybody with the militarization of everything, but that didn't scare anybody, man.  That made everybody turn up even more.  We got a 6 o'clock curfew out here.  Shout out to Houston.  A lot of cities are turning up.  My baby boy right here, Siri, he has his mask on.  I need mine on.  Let me say this, I want my people in Chicago to be very careful.  We put up a story on the FBA site today.  These white Hispanic informants they've been deputized out there in chicago in the cicero area to attack black people.  they're doing it with impunity.  they're giving them a green light to attack brothers and sisters out there in cicero under the false pretense of them going after looters.  they're attacking civilian black men women and children out there in the cicero area.  i want my people to be very careful out there because they've been deputized.  i've i've from words on the streets.  It's hard to kind of retaliate or protect yourself because the police are protecting them.  Those informants out there in Cicero are being protected.  Hold on.  There's a lot of noise out here.  Sorry, guys.  Hold on.  What's up, Lexi?  Let's see that pretty face.  Let's see that beautiful face, Lexi.  You got some on too.  What's up, Tao?  Another thing what I do, I like to keep my eye out for some of these quote unquote allies.  I've seen a couple of funny looking, low key, alt right looking motherfuckers walking around and I keep my eye on them.  I keep my eye on these cats who look like they got something in their backpack ready to start something crazy.  That's why I'm not going to have my babies out here too, too long because you never know when something goes off.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm careful out here.  Yeah.  All right.  So this is what it's looking like, okay?  I know, I know.  Yeah, that one gotta take care of the babies.  They got them helicopters like crazy.  Helicopters watching everybody, huh?  So, last night around the country was crazy.  Up there in Vegas, a couple of cops got shot.  In St.  Louis, about four cops got shot.  In New York, several cops got ran over by cars.  I mean, the world, the country is fighting back, man.  And all of this could have been avoided.  if people just wanna, they just produce justice.  All of this stuff could have been avoided.  Yeah?  All you have to do is produce justice.  You dig?  The people who believe in white supremacy, for some reason they think that white supremacy will trump karma.  You cannot trump universal karma.  It's gonna come and get at you.  Look at some of these signs out here.  Abolish the police.  Look at these, the ghetto bird is high up here.  Yeah.  Yeah, they monitoring because they know this shit's going to turn up after 6.  See, the curfew, people don't really trip on the curfew out here.  The people ain't really tripping on the curfew.  Let me switch up with my son.  Yeah, that curfew don't really mean nothing out here.  Can't still be out here turning up.  Shout out to Atlanta.  I just got back in from Atlanta.  Shout out to Charleston.  Oh, they gettin' down in North Dakota, too?  Yeah?  Yeah, I got my little warriors with me.  Yeah, I got my little warriors with me.  But it's not gonna stop, man.  And by the way, I'm glad everybody didn't fall for that Blackout Tuesday bullshit.  That Blackout Tuesday bullshit, that was some, there you go, what's happenin'?  Yes, indeed.  That was a con game, guys.  They playing fuck the police out here, NWS.  Like I told y'all, that shit was a cop out.  That Blackout Tuesday was a corporate attempt to kind of dissipate the energy, to put a pause so they can redirect the energy.  When y'all see that Blackout Tuesday bullshit, that's some corporate stuff from the corporate white media.  It's a nothing burger.  It's a bunch of intersectionality bullshit.  Let's see, this is Hollywood High School over here.  It's Hollywood high.  All right.  So we out here.  Yeah, I know they're getting busy.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back that way.  Come on, let's go back up.  we cross the street or what?  yeah all right we're going back up.  okay i saw a with a black trans matters.  okay yeah we gotta watch out for that too.  i saw somebody with a damn black trans matter.  sign.  watch out for that.  that intersectional.  i got it.  we got it thugas.  Watch out for that pivot.  My mask is in my pocket.  I can't talk with my mask on.  My mask is in my pocket.  I got it.  Yes, I'm protecting the family.  We're going back to the car now.  But everybody, again, my L.A.  people, man, be safe tonight.  My Chicago people, be safe tonight out here, okay?  I'm gonna probably go live later on YouTube, so y'all holler. ",
