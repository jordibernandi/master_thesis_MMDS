We are not going to just take a drug test and leave it in the bathroom if it's positive.  So what people were doing was number one, they were using other people's urine.  Number two, they were hiding pee.  And number three, they would do a drug test.  If it came up positive, they would dump it out and throw it away.  My name is Michelle Lipinski, and I'm the principal founder of North Shore Recovery High School.  So any other questions about drug testing? ",
