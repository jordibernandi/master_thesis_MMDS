Can you tell me Matt Chrisman dialectics?  what are dialectics and why are you suddenly having this epiphany about them?

They get bored, Or they hit like their ratio-senation limit.  And it's usually not one or the other.  It's a combination of both.  You hit your brain's natural ability to absorb the symbolic meaning.  And you also lose your ability to withhold pleasure long enough to keep figuring it out.  And then you give up.  And that's what I did.  And that's what most people do at some point at almost everything they believe.  And what I realized is that the dialectic was one of those things, a dead concept that I understood some of the implications of and applied as needed, but that I did not understand the foundation of.  I did not understand the whole contours of.  And I feel like I have slipped into a process that has taken me my entire life, but also is motivated by specific Satori moments.  that I now understand the dialect not as a dead concept, but as a tool of thought, which is the spiritual replica of the physical engine of matter, the thing that literally causes the Big Bang and causes all matter to fire off and obeys the laws of thermodynamics until all matter is extinguished.  That same force that is within all matter is within our brains of dialectical concepts being arrayed against each other until we arrive at a new combination of the forces that we brought together in conflict.

Because he was born after the liberal subject became hegemonic in Europe, he was a liberal subject to that extent.  Now take a guy like Chomsky.  He has admitted that he is in the liberal tradition and that anarchism is in the liberal tradition.  It is.  He believes in liberal subject, which is a subject that is a non-moved upon mover.  That is a identity that is independent of outside influence to some extent and can operate independently by itself.  That's the liberal subject.  And having that fully formed liberal subject making decisions, they're going to make certain category errors.  That is why Chomsky erroneously tells people it's the moral duty to vote Democrat every election, because he's only looking at it through that axis.  Now, Marx was a liberal subject to the extent that he recognized himself as in opposition to other people.  But because he was smart enough, his brains worked the right way and he found himself in the time and place to observe both up close and in patterns, industrial capitalism being born.  He could come at it from outside of it.  And that means that he could press this new reality of industrial capitalism against his preexisting liberal self through actions and thoughts coming from actions and then arrive at a new understanding.  That says that there is no unmoved self.  The dialectical self is just a process.  The dialectical spirit, the brain, everything we think of as a soul is not a thing in itself.  It is a process that something. ",

And that warped their relationship to her one way or the other, because she was never as influential or as threatening as she appeared.  She was always a character who was going to float between two poles.  and just go and not ever, and basically be dissolved between them and never like overcome the other ones because she just started from a smaller base.  She just started from a smaller base and over time it just ground down.  It didn't expand.  So we didn't get that.  that would happen.  We didn't get the, the, the, the, the, softness of the support, I guess.  The softness of the stone of the Warren support.  So that was one way to mistake it, the material way.  The other way to mistake them, which a lot of us did, I think I did to some extent, was the degree to which they were gettable, the degree to which they were on the right side because of their accepting of progressive points of view.  I personally never really bought very hard that these people, when push came to shove, would embrace socialism over Democratic Party discipline.  But I thought there was a chance.  I think a lot of people thought there was more of a chance than I did.  And it turns out that we were all overestimating the chance there was.  And the thing is, is that the reason that I, I think I, I more correctly than some rated her degree of, um, or her her degree of earnestness and her supporters degree?  i was like.  i don't really buy that these people are all just socialists who have gone astray.  i think most of them are not good but there are a few.  but the thing is there were a few who you could tell are just going along because they didn't want to get yelled at or they thought they were solving some problem.  they were triangulating off the bros but at the end of the day if you got rid of her they would go for bernie.  well All that energy spent on her was wasted because I fundamentally misapprehended her actual importance to the process.
