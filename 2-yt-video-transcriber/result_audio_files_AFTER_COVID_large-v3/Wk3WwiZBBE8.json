            "text": "Hello and welcome to the fourth installment in our series, State of the Election.  With the start of the year bringing his impeachment trial, the coronavirus pandemic, the death of George Floyd, and the ongoing protests and riots that followed, whether you support his campaign or not, we can all agree that Donald Trump has had a rough year politically.  So we thought that now would be a good time to look at the possibility of Donald Trump losing his bid for reelection in 2020.  Now, we're not saying he's going to lose and we're not saying he's going to win.  And a video on Biden's chances is in the works.  We're simply interested in the factors that may hurt Trump and lead to a Biden victory.  So in this video, we're going to take a look at what President Trump's disadvantages are, how they might manifest as we enter the general election season, and how Joe Biden might reap those benefits.  If you haven't already checked out the rest of our State of the Election series, there's a link to the full playlist in the description below.

So before we start, let's take a look at how the race currently stands.  At the time of writing, the RealClearPolitics average shows President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by 9.4 points, with President Trump's disapproval at 56%.  Now, obviously it's worth saying that we're still 4 months away from the election, so these polls could drastically change between now and November 3rd, especially considering both conventions are still yet to be held, and historically speaking, candidates usually receive a bit of a bump in the polls after their convention.  In fact, we did a more deep analysis about the important points to consider regarding polling in one of our other recent videos.  There's a link to that in the description.  So why is Trump currently trailing behind Biden in the polls?  Well, the president has received a lot of criticism for his administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  We discuss the Trump administration's handling of the crisis in another video, but safe to say that with the US leading the world when it comes to COVID cases and deaths, the US management of the outbreak isn't going swimmingly.  The real question for this video, though, is how does the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus impact his election chances?  Well, considering the number of cases I mentioned a moment ago, major spikes in several cases going on at the moment, and the apparent second wave on the horizon, the short answer is that the crisis likely isn't going to help Trump in the fall.  To be fair, however, the responsibility of how the pandemic has been handled and the consequences thereof are not solely on President Trump.  state and local leaders also have to bear some of that responsibility.  But the question is, who will voters hold responsible?  Polling from FiveThirtyEight shows that currently less than 40% of those polled approve of Trump's handling of COVID, a number which falls to 36% when talking about independent and potentially persuadable voters.  It's obviously hard to predict how polling conducted about the virus in July will impact the election in November, but the virus has taken a serious dent in the Trump campaign.  Not only do voters broadly not approve of Trump's handling of the crisis, they're also worried about what the virus means for them.  35% of Americans report that they're somewhat concerned about them or someone they know getting the virus, and a further 31% are very concerned about this.  Not only that, the electorate also seemed to worry about the knock-on impact, with 32% somewhat concerned about the economic implications and a massive 54% very concerned.  For an incumbent that was hoping to win re-election on the basis of his economic performance, this really ought to be worrying, unless the president really believes that a turnaround could be as drastic as he's been claiming.  Trump may also be worried about the approval numbers we mentioned too.  The majority of Americans disapproving of an incumbent's handling of a major public health issue would always be a worry for a president seeking re-election.  But even before his decision to enter the 2016 election, Trump was known for his outbursts both in person and on Twitter.  But since he's taken office, many argue that this has become a larger issue.  The problem for Trump is that even among his Republican supporters, these tweets and outbursts can be unpopular.  In fact, a poll conducted by Morning Consult in May of 2018 showed that 72% of Americans agreed that the president tweets too much, as do a majority of Republicans.  In fact, among those Republicans, 38% of those polled disapproved of the president's Twitter habit.  The problem is that during this time of crisis, those tweets could end up looking increasingly problematic for the president.  Republicans that support him may tolerate tweets and rhetoric that they disapprove of in ordinary times.  They might even choose to overlook it and may choose to just look at the upsides of the Trump presidency.  But when that rhetoric is contrasted with the serious impacts of the virus, it may be thrown into a very different light.  There are certainly a lot of people in Trump's core base who love the way that the president speaks his mind.  But there are also many moderate conservatives who tolerate his unique style on a regular basis, but would struggle to do so when the president appears to not be protecting their personal health.  And it's not all about the pandemic either.  There's a number of other factors which could make Trump's reelection difficult.  Let's first consider the ongoing public unrest in the country and the actions that the administration has taken.  Much like COVID, Trump's handling of the Black Lives Matter movement has been broadly unpopular.  In fact, his handling of BLM has been even less popular, with 62% disapproving of his actions.  In fact, after an autonomous zone emerged in Washington DC, similar to the CHOP zone in Seattle, the president tweeted, There will never be an autonomous zone in Washington DC, as long as I am your president.  If they try, they will be met with serious force.  This rather aggressive handling of the BLM protests could prove to be another factor that moderate conservatives might have difficulty with.  The issue, like before, is the contrast of Trump's attitude versus the magnitude of the challenges being faced, something the Biden campaign may choose to focus on, painting Biden as a safer and more stable pair of hands during this difficult time.  Something else which may have a hand in the election is the recent call by Tennessee Congressman Steve Cohen to impeach Attorney General William Barr.  cohen filed a resolution with the house of representatives on wednesday that would authorize an impeachment inquiry against the attorney-general.  if approved barr would be the first cabinet secretary since secretary of war william belknap in eighteen seventy six to be impeached.  Now, while Barr would be the one who is impeached, it would certainly have some impact on Trump's re-election.  After all, Donald Trump is the person who appointed Barr, and ultimately could face consequences for that decision should Barr be impeached.  Now, while we talked extensively about President Trump's positions and actions regarding a lot of his domestic policies, i.e.  the coronavirus and ongoing racial debate, what we haven't really addressed in this series is his foreign policy and how that will play into his election chances.  That said, we won't go into a huge amount of detail here as we're focusing on Trump's difficulties regarding a reelection.  So, if you'd like us to look in more detail about Trump's foreign policy, be sure to like this video and comment down below.  Anyway, reports have surfaced in the last few days about senior administration officials, including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, with both feeling that the President himself was a threat to national security because of the conversations he held with foreign leaders.  They drew this conclusion because of the president's apparent and consistent lack of preparedness for phone calls with foreign leaders, including former British Prime Minister Theresa May, Turkish President Erdogan, and probably most significantly, Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The criticism from his former advisers might not be too distressing for the president's campaign, except for its timing, as it also comes at the same time that President Trump announced that 9,000 troops would be withdrawn from Germany.  The US Senate has even put forward a bill which will prevent the president from carrying out the removal, and it's worth noting that this bill does have bipartisan support from within the chamber.  In fact, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, even described the decision as unacceptable.  Now, to be fair to the President, while they play a part in every election, foreign affairs are more important in some elections than others.  For example, when George W. Bush was running for re-election, the 9-11 attacks, the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq dominated his campaign against Senator John Kerry.  And similarly, after the economic crash in 2008, the economy took centre stage in the election of that year, rather than foreign policy issues.  So with so much happening at home, these foreign policy problems won't likely play into a Trump election loss as much as the coronavirus response and the handling of protests.  But issues in foreign policy certainly won't help the Trump administration.  As with any election though, the question is how voters will perceive all of these factors in November.  And as we pointed out in our last video, there's still a good amount of time between now and the election.  What do you think though?  Will Joe Biden become the 46th president of the United States?  Or will Donald Trump win a second term?  Would you like us to do a video on what Trump's advantages are?  Or what a Trump's second term could look like?  Or even what a Biden presidency might end up looking like?  Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
