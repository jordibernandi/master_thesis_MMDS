Google that, LA Times, THC, LAX, and they'll tell you.  I think it's under-announced.  You can travel with it.  Otherwise, you get arrested.  Just like you get a lap.  Check with the LA Times or Google it.  L-E-X-T-A-C.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, man?  Okay, so he was arrested.  He had a large amount of cameras, TSC, in his bag.  And I always tell folks, the legal amount is, I believe, an ounce.  But you still, if you have under an ounce, they still call the cops, so they still got to check it out.  And most of the time, they'll say the legal amount will let you go.  But they're still going to call the LAX airport police.  So don't get a perp walk like this guy got.  And he'll probably be released.  But just read the article out of the LA Times.  THC, LAX, how much you can bring.  Type that in and you'll see the whole article.  This is Tony Vera signing off here at the one and only LAX. ",
