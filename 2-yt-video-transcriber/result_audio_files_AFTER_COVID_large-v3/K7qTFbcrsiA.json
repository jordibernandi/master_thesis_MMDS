Today we've got ourselves a fellow named Rusty Walker, of whom I've never heard.  He made a video called Atheism is Stupid, which is not an even slightly provocative title whatsoever.  Naturally, of course, his reasons why atheism is stupid are quite thoroughly flawed, biased, and subjective, to say the least. ",

Personally, I'd rather not even have a discussion about truth.  I would rather talk about facts, about data, because while facts and data are part of the umbrella of truth, moral principles are a separate and distinct part of truth as well.  I need to know which you mean, or if you're even making a distinction between the two, before I'm willing to give you a yes or a no.  further i cannot let slide this assertion that there is an atheist world-view.  there isn't.  atheism doesn't come with rules principles or beliefs.  the only thing any two atheists will definitely agree on is that they don't believe in any gods.  everything else is separate.  There is nothing about atheism that compels a person to be convinced of evolution or around Earth, or even that the supernatural doesn't exist.  The only necessary criterion for being an atheist is having no God belief.  If you told me that you believe in a God, and I assumed that you meant that you follow the dictates of the Koran, you'd be very quick to correct me, wouldn't you?  Same thing here.
