He knows he has to jump.  and this is his plan.  he's going to flap his arms and try and save himself.  and i'd say to that man don't do that trust the parachute and storm.  don't trust yourself and your goodness on judgment day to save yourself.  transfer your trust from yourself to the savior and the minute you do that you've got god's promise.  he'll grant you everlasting life as a free gift.  the wages of sinners death and you know the rest.  the gift of god is eternal life.  through jesus christ our lord You don't have to become religious.  You don't have to clean up your life.  Just come as a sinner and say, have mercy upon me, and God will extend his mercy to you because he's rich in mercy.  One last thought, and it might help you coagulate your emotions at the moment.  If I put you on the edge of a thousand-foot cliff, jagged rocks are below you, your toes are over the edge, you can feel the stones crumbling beneath your feet, would that be scary?  course the feeling of fear would be a horrible feeling but the fear itself would be good because it's trying to protect you.  it's saying back up back up from the edge of this cliff.  so that fear that feels horrible is actually a friend.  it's not your enemy.  it wants to preserve you from destruction.  and what i've tried to do with you and it's been uncomfortable for you and for me is I've tried to put your toes over the edge of eternity just for a couple of minutes and let you realize it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  But that fear, horrible though it is, uncomfortable though it is, it's not your enemy, it's your friend.  Because it's trying to preserve you ending up in hell something I'm horrified to even consider.  I want you to be saved.  I want to see you in heaven.  so listen to those fears listen to their uncomfortable feeling and realize it's because of guilt.  it's the same feeling a criminal would get when a police officer talks to him just after he's committed a crime.  he wants to get away.  we love the darkness.  we hate the light.  we don't want to come to the light but I I trust today you're going to think about this at least and consider what we've talked about and consider the.  the value of your life and Your life is more precious than your eyes.  It's your soul.  And Jesus said, what shall a prophet of man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?  So what do you think about what we talked about? ",
