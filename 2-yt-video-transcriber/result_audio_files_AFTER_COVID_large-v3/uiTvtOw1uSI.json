            "text": "Hi, everyone.  Lisa Haven here.  And I've got a massive report to share with you guys.  Right now, the U.S.  economy is in turmoil, even the global economy, but specifically here in the U.S.  Not only did we have the repercussions of the COVID-19 and the draconian lockdowns, but now we have massive riots taking place all across the country and and curfews literally being instituted across the country.  And all of this is having a ripple effect and a destructive effect on our economy.  So in today's report, I wanted to bring on somebody in the know, but I wanted to share a couple economic articles so you can see what I'm talking about.  The first one here is on the economic collapse blog dot com.  Nobody ever imagined that the job losses would get so bad so quickly and literally over 40 million people out of work.  New York Times pandemic to cost the U.S.  economy seven point nine trillion over the next ten years.  So we are looking at some long term devastation here.  So with me, I've brought on the channel noble gold investments dot com Colin Plume.  So are you with me over there, Colin? ",

What does that mean for our economy? ",

            "text": "Well, the biggest thing to look out for is small business.  And Right when we had the shutdown a few months ago, basically within two weeks, 100,000 small businesses closed permanently.  And there's a number of studies, a number of Harvard studies talking about just the devastating effects of having the shutdown.  And then now we were looking to open back up.  And every day that a business can't open back up in full form because of the riots is a negative to that business.  There's a number of businesses besides the 100,000 that closed that are on the brink, that they literally need to open immediately.  And even if they open immediately, the study, it's an interesting Harvard study, it seems like a lot of companies are just going to open just to see if they can sustain, right?  Just kind of open, just not even looking to break even, but just maybe just cover the bills.  And the sad thing is, is that the longer these riots go on, They're not able to do that because of the curfews in many different states.  Couple with what's going to be the ripple effect to.  let's just talk about the insurance industry when many of these small business owners do not have enough insurance to cover a total loss.  You know, when you buy an insurance policy, you sort of assume maybe a small loss, but to cover a complete loss of a restaurant, liquor store, any of these stores that are getting destroyed, it's not in the cards for most of these small business owners.  So I even think the businesses that paid for the insurance are not going to get reimbursed.  They're not going to be able to get whole again, which is the whole idea of insurance.  So I think the small business owner is really getting destroyed here with the riots and us not being able to regenerate and open up the doors.  Another thing that's interesting is savings accounts have risen to the highest level that we've seen since 2012.  Our typical savings rate in the US is anywhere from 5% to 7%.  In April, we were at 13.2% in savings.  People were just hoarding cash, which I think makes a lot of sense.  Right.  That's kind of the natural move is to hoard cash.  The problem is that we need to trade.  Right.  We need.  the economy is built on us spending money and going shopping.  And that's how things are generated.  So we're sort of in a quagmire in terms of people want to be conservative.  They're saving.  But also we need that money circulated to keep the economy going. ",

So there is a lot a lot of hoarding, there is a lot of holding on and even our family, you know, because there is a lot of I mean, we're in chaos in 2020, such as I've never and you've never seen before.  I mean, we've gone from wild bees, what are those murderous bees to which are now in and, and we've got the economy on an unstable path.  We have the riots and we have a pandemic all in the first few months of 2020.  Now, what are some ways, because I know you have protected a lot of people through noblegoldinvestments.com, but what are some ways that the average person can protect their 401 or some of their livelihood during this time?

            "text": "Yeah, well, it's all about something we've talked about for many years.  It's about diversification, right?  I think that we've always discussed not having all your eggs in one basket.  The one silver lining of if you're no longer employed and you had a 401k is now you have a chunk of money that you can move into something else.  You have that freedom.  And there's a lot of talk about where the stock market's going to go.  And I think You can debate it on both sides.  I have obviously some personal beliefs in that.  But I do think that for people that have that access to that 401k to look at some of the other options that are out there, precious metals, gold and silver, obviously very popular.  And I think there's a big spotlight on both gold and silver more as industrial metals than just metals for investment.  Because if you look at where things are going, a lot of the industries that for places to stay clean, for instance, Gold is a very good metal.  It's a metal that stays very clean.  It's indestructible.  So a lot of these industries are using gold and they're also using silver in a lot of electrification of businesses.  So a lot of businesses are moving towards electricity-based products.  So you have these two metals.  that are really in high demand for industrial metals because of where we are today, that businesses need to be clean, they need to have an environment where people are safe in, and that's a big focus right now.  So these two metals are really popular.  So you have people, they have this chunk of money, they can move it into a self-directed IRA with us and the metals or move into other investments.  They have to have that power now to move it.  So I think the silver lining is you have your 401k, you can move it into a traditional or maybe a Roth IRA if that's something that you wanted to do.  but you really have the power now to move it into something that you want.  And I think people are happy about that.  And obviously we've been busy helping people with the paperwork and we have a full staff that does that.  So, you know, everyone hates paperwork, you know, it's, you know, it's tax time coming around here soon.  Nobody likes to, I mean, we understand nobody likes to do paperwork.  We've simplified it.  We have ways to sign electronically and we have people that will literally hold your hand through the, through the whole process. ",

But excuse me, what do you predict the future is going to hold, at least for the rest of the year?  I know we're not like prediction people, but like your best estimate guesstimate of what you think 2020 could look like toward the end of the year, considering the nightmare that already befalls us.

            "text": "And we have an election.  I think this is going to be an unbelievably turbulent year when you have this high unemployment.  And we've talked about this a lot.  And I think you and I have the same sentiment is that low unemployment is really a key to a strong economy.  And I think that's something that President Trump has always kind of focused on.  And we had the lowest unemployment in history with him as president.  And that's gone now.  So when you have this unbelievable high unemployment, you have a lot of industries that are decimated.  You know, the airline industry, you know, there's reports I was reading that they think this could almost be a trillion dollar loss for the airline industry.  you know, predicting where it is now and then in the future for the rest of this year, because people obviously are afraid to travel and fly.  So you have and that's obviously not just money coming in, but also jobs.  So, you know, I think it's going to be a turbulent year.  You have this election.  Nobody knows what's going to happen.  I think that you're going to see a lot of really highs and lows in the stock market.  But I think ultimately, I think the stock market's Still a little bit too high.  I think we're going to see a dramatic pullback there.  And I think that, you know, the next thing that will fall, we're going to be start talking about this probably in October, late September is real estate because a lot of these loans are going to be due and for commercial properties.  And we're going to start to see that pullback.  You know, a lot of major corporations can weather the storm for four to six months.  But if they're not able to get back and start selling the products at the level that they think they can, We're going to see a lot of major retailers shut down.  We see a lot of empty real estate.  And that's just going to segue right into Christmas, which is usually the time where people are spending money.  And who knows if people are going to feel comfortable to to open up their pocketbook.  So I think it's going to be a very turbulent year this year. ",

            "text": "Yeah, the housing market, I don't think will go as bad as 2008 because I think that we've, even though unemployment is, you know, basically in depressionary numbers, I think that more people, they have more sweat equity in the house in terms of they've actually put a decent down payment.  A lot of people in 2008 put no down payment down and pulled money out of the house.  So when they lost it to the bank, it just didn't feel like anything.  They had no interest in it.  This time, more people, I mean, there were some loans.  you could put 2%, 3% down.  For the most part, everyone had to put 5%, 10%, 20%.  That's a lot of money to walk away from.  So I think what will happen is, you know, the, the kids, when I say the kids, the 20 year old kids that we're going to leave are not leaving, you know, the parents, everyone's going to kind of, you're going to have that, that kind of large nuclear family where everybody kind of stays home for a few years.  It's going to be like Europe.  And, um, I don't think anyone's leaving anytime, anytime soon.  And, and, and, but that'll help because we'll have multiple incomes to help cover that mortgage.  And, um, and you know, my, my positive silver lining on all of this is I think the family, the U S family is, is really going to have a resurgence.  I think people are really enjoying the time they're spending at home for the most part.  And so I think there's going to be, that's going to be.  the real positive is just getting, getting to spend some time around your family and having a few months out of that, out of the rat race and, and, and working and things like that.

            "text": "Yeah, just a fun thing.  I wanted to say there's a coin.  It's a coin that was from the late 1700s that is on the market for $15 million.  It's a coin that's regarded as the most well-renowned gold coin ever.  It was the person that minted the coin was the neighbor of George Washington.  So there's definitely evidence that George Washington had this coin in his hands and other of, you know, some of the most powerful people in US history were around during this time period.  So.  So I always like to bring those stories up because that coin initially was sold for $15 and now they believe it's going to get $15 million.  So that's the beauty behind gold.  You know, I think that's, you know, even if you don't buy one of those coins, the buying power, buying gold has always kept up and exceeded inflation.  And I think The big thing is, of course, everyone needs money.  Of course, the bailouts are happening right now.  And you can make arguments on both sides of how much money should be bailed out.  But at the end of the day, gold is something that has always been able to keep up with this incredible inflation that we're going to run into.  This inflation, I think, will rival the late 70s, early 1980s.  The numbers will be skewed because the U.S.  government can always skew the numbers for the CPI.  And they do that.  But I believe that if you look at the true numbers of inflation, I think we're going to be in the 12 to 15 percent range.  And I think that you need to make sure that and I know saving money feels good, but you got to got to get some kind of return because those savings accounts are paying a quarter of a percent.  And if inflation is 12 to 15 percent, like I believe that it is, you're losing 12 to 15 percent of your money every time you leave that money in the bank. ",
