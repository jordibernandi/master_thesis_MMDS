            "text": "Welcome back to the first presidential debate.  Two queens stand before me.  Gentlemen, before the time comes for you to lip sync for your lives, why don't we begin with some preliminary questions.  Joe?  How you doing?  Well, first of all... Okay, I'm bored.  Mr.  President, here's a softball for you.  Can I just get you to, if you don't mind, maybe condemn white supremacy real quick?  Just... Maybe you didn't.  He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly.  Vice President Biden.  If you look at the polls, I'm doing this.  And every Republican has done it a long time.  Because they saw what you did.  Having a panic attack.  You and me both.  Oh my God, Patti LuPone, what are you doing here?  I'm busy.  When gay men are in crisis, I just materialize.  Patti, I'm getting nervous.  What if this gets reelected?  You gotta think positive, doll.  Imagine how much better life would be if Trump got dumped.  Shafted?  William Howard Tafted.  If Donald got fired, we could go back to life as we once knew it.  Miserable and unfair, but at least without the daily threat of complete authoritarianism and apocalyptic destruction.  Wouldn't that be nice?  If Donald got fired according to plan Just think of the things I could do.  I'd stop having nightmares about Kellyanne And finally sing songs about somebody new If Donald got fired.  If Donald got fired, would that be sublime?  I'd put down my bottles and balls.  I'd be back on Broadway and belting sometime instead of cheap internet parody songs.  Excuse me?  Nothing?  If Donald got fired.  President Trump did a phenomenal job.  Donald, quit running your scam.  There's nothing to tout.  You're no Abraham.  Donald, we're all in a jam.  Please get the hell out and take Lindsey Graham.  It would be so nice if he lost on election day.  I'd build him a new wall.  I'd pay for his new home.  And I'd let Melania stay.  Really?  Now.  O'Donnell, please go far away.  Donald got fired.  There wouldn't be any more rack.  Less old complaining.  Dictators regime.  He will destroy this country.  No more smug elites.  Whee!  No more goddamn tweets.  Whee!  Fake news.  Fake news.  Look, Daddy, I'm the worst president.  Love me, love me.  Donald, the truth might be tough.  The polls all project.  We've all had enough.  Donald, don't stand there and scoff.  With all due respect, please kindly fork off.  I'm not going to do that.  I hope we choose right.  The future's so dark and unknown.  There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together.  But there's no deciding.  I'm riding with Biden.  I'm voting for Patti LuPone.  Yes!  Queen!  O'Donnell!  Oh, Donald.  Oh, Donald.  Just leave us alone.  Patty, I'm scared.  Girl, just vote. ",
