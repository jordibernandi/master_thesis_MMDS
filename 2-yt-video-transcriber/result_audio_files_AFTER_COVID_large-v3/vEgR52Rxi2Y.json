Ben also applies this brainwashed, liberal idea to Hollywood in a book he wrote in 2011 called Primetime Propaganda, The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV.  Snappy title, Ben.  Now, Hollywood is very liberal, predominantly so.  But there are also a surprising amount of celebrities who were conservatives, like some big and influential ones.  Adam Sandler donated to Giuliani.  Arnold Schwarzenegger went sledding with George H.W.  Bush once.  Also, he was the Republican governor of an entire state.  His career has been just fine.  And I need to point this out, because the thesis to Ben's book rests on a pretty hilarious anecdote right in his introduction, like some kind of dark origin story.  Are you ready?  Ben tried to become a writer in Hollywood. ",
