            "text": "July the 12th, 2020.  Guys, you're looking at an article from this afternoon.  It's coming from Elias Murat via themindunleased.com.  He's talking about there's a tsunami of evictions coming that could make 28 million Americans homeless this summer alone.  And we are in the middle of the summer, guys.  And what they're talking about is a lot of people last month could not pay rent or could not pay full rent.  And we're talking about about 32 percent of households.  That's why it's always been a good idea if you could to build your own home or.  you know get one that you can afford.  rent has always been a terrible mistake.  i know it's not an option all the time but it's something that preppers have been prepping for for a long time and getting a little piece of land building a little place and paying for it as they put the nails in the wood.  But everyone is not paying attention, and it's obvious here, and I know that a lot of people are going to be in trouble.  So what we've got again is it says, with the pandemic continuing to sink its claws into the  U.S.,  economic conditions have also failed to improve for millions of people.  As a result, nearly one-third of the U.S.  households, representing 32%, Think about that.  A third of the nation still have still not made their full housing payments for the month of July this month.  And we're only a couple of weeks away from going into August.  Says according.  This is from a survey from the online rental platform apartment list.  They keep up with it.  and as they're saying here with the public health experts warning people to continue to stay at home.  guys the second wave is way more than what it says on the surface but they're continuing to stay.  uh say stay at home.  the slogan is taking on a perverse new meaning as humanitarian disaster looms for some 28 million people in the u.s who are facing eviction and homelessness in the immediate future.  Let's talk about something else.  Now, we just saw a $10 trillion stimulus put into Paycheck Protection Program, things like that, right?  Supposed to help a lot of people.  We saw families get $2,000 to $3,000, $4,000, depending on how many kids.  But then you see all the big businesses getting millions and millions of dollars.  Some that employ a lot of people.  I can understand it.  But, guys, it was a payoff to the elite.  Dr.  Phil's recording company got $7 million of our taxpayer money.  He's already a millionaire.  But what has happened?  $10 trillion.  It's unheard of.  Socialism just took a large swipe into the  U.S.,  What has happened, the middle class and the lower class, middle class, lower income has been completely wiped out.  As we get into the summer, the U.S.  will never be recognizable again for what we have known it.  Ten trillion dollars.  So how does a socialist work inside a country?  They wipe out the lower and middle class.  They loan money to the businesses.  They cannot pay back because they're going to do a second round.  That's what I'm saying.  The second round is way more than what we think.  But with the second round hitting the economy, many of these upper-end people that got the money, the banks, Dr.  Phil, whoever, restaurants, Robert De Niro, who hates Trump, got millions for his restaurant chain.  Now the government will own all of that.  Because with the second wave, possibly a third wave, these companies will not be able to continue to pay back a loan.  So we will see all the big businesses, the only ones that are surviving, being taken over by a government which could be run by either party very soon.  Now, when you think about what's happening, you've got a party on the left, a party on the right.  And there's a new world order coming, whether we like it or not, it's in the Bible.  Jesus talks about it in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.  The new government, a new world order is coming.  And what the left and right are fighting for is not our freedom or our economic success.  They're fighting over who will control the tax slaves.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Who will control the new world order?  The new world orders here, our gates have been breached.  The walls have been climbed.  Now, they are fighting over who controls.  one thing and it's what the right what their image of or the their image of the new world order will be and on the left what their image of the new world order will be.  we are insignificant.  we will either stand in the way and get run over or we will become tax slaves and there's no way you can put a good light on that.  and no matter what path you look at okay It says 19% of those surveyed were unable to make any housing payment in the first week of the month, while 13% paid a portion of the rent or mortgage.  The numbers represent the grim fact that for four months now, a historically high amount of U.S.  households have been unable to pay their housing bill, either on time or in full.  It also represents an increase from 30% in June to 31% in July.  According to apartment lists, those most likely to miss their payments were younger, low-income, or renters.  Other experts warn that black and Latino families face the highest risk of eviction.  They also may be entering the start of a rapid and vicious cycle, the report suggests, because there's got to be... they're stuck between a rock and a hard place you don't?  you can't get a job you got to stay at home and then the the guy that you're renting from or the company or family whatever you whoever you're renting from they're also in a bind right because they have probably borrowed money to buy rental property so that you can rent them and then they make a few dollars off it and pay it off in the bank.  well so there's a big tsunami a domino effect here.  but let's go back to these left and right powers again.  the walls have been breached.  the new world order is coming on the left side.  it may come a little quicker but all that we're seeing now is a tremendous amount of energy from the citizens of the world.  to be honest with you but let's focus on the?  u s a minute.  we have an election coming up.  we have two powers both on the wrong side that want to control the slave nation bring in their vision again of their vision of the new world order.  the left has won the right has won.  either way we're left out.  So, as we see, and we've seen it since 2016, all of us have done it, put a tremendous amount of energy into one campaign or the other, regardless of who you are, left, right.  We're seeing it on mainstream media, constantly, left, right.  When there is no, it's an illusion of choice.  It's what it is.  And so, as we see this conflict continue, then what do we do?  Guys, the time is short.  The devil knows his time is short.  That's why we're seeing this push.  That's why our walls have been breached.  It was set up a long time ago.  So are you going to put a lot of energy into a doctrine for the left or a doctrine for the right and push that one?  And are you going to leave out the most important one, the one that can save your soul?  In other words, we know that who's in control of this world, and we're not of it.  So as we look to push one side or the other and you leave out Christ in the middle, then what you're doing in this last days when Christ told us to look up and be aware of what's going on, when you could put all of that energy.  either left or right, put it in the center.  The left is a wide path.  The right is a wide path.  But right in between those two roads is a very narrow place.  that is a peaceful place because when you focus on Christ and what you need to do and pray and meditate about it, separate yourself from this battle that we can't win.  Again, the walls have been breached.  Look at what is happening.  then if you put all of your energy behind one of these doctrines, what have you done?  Satan has won either way, guys.  Satan has won either way because he's diverted your energy and time.  And the time you need to get everything right, the time you need to focus on Christ, he's got that attention.  He's won either way, left or right.  With the same result coming regardless.  So he wins.  Don't do it.  Focus on what's important in these end times.  Make a difference.  Take care of your family.  We're watching it guys.  You watch it.  It's a heads up.  Be safe. ",
