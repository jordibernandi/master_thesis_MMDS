            "text": "It came over the news on the closing day of the old year that a Japanese pilot flying a jumbo cargo jet plane from Tokyo over the Arctic, I believe, and he saw a strange light, small circular planes following his plane.  They followed him for 400 miles, which meant that he had these strange objects in his view.  for at least fifty minutes at least.  if he were going a little over five hundred miles an hour I would assume a jumbo jet that he had what he saw in view for approximately fifty minutes which is a long time to look at something and for something to be looking at you.  now he noticed the silhouette of a huge, a very huge object.  Now remember, he's in the sky.  I would imagine that he was between 30 and 40,000 feet in the air, approximately five miles up.  So whatever he saw five miles up looking out of the window of his cockpit was also up at a considerable height.  Mind you, he said it was a very huge object that appeared to be the size of two aircraft carriers.  Now, if you've ever seen an aircraft carrier, then you know an aircraft carrier is capable of having on board it up to 2,000, 7,000 passengers with, of course, a huge number of airplanes.  But now this was not the size of one aircraft carrier.  Seeing something that huge in the sky would frighten me, I'm sure.  Frighten you too.  But something the size of two aircraft carriers.  And an aircraft carrier of the huge type could be over 300 yards long.  900 feet to 1200 feet in length.  Well, I can understand the pilot was shook.  And for the first time, the FAA, the Federal Aeronautics, I think, Aviation Administration, said that they took note of this object on their radar screens.  This man made a picture of it and he put the jumbo jet near it to give you some idea of the relative size of this object that he saw in comparison to the huge jumbo jet, the biggest thing that white folks make.  And the jumbo jet looked like it could fit in this other plane over 150 times.  Now let us stop a moment.  As black people, we are very suspicious of black people.  And whenever a teacher arises from among our own ranks telling us something that you did not learn from white folks, we are automatically suspicious of that person and we believe they have made it up.  As much as black people have suffered and are still suffering, and as much as you go to church and talk about god and talk about jesus and talk about moses.  you are very very hypocritical in your praise of god And in your talk of the prophets.  For evidently.  Deep down in your own being.  You really don't believe.  That a man Jesus ever existed.  And listen I'm saying deep down in your being.  I know what you say out of your mouth.  And what's in your conscious mind.  But I want to show you your actions.  To show that underneath all your talk.  You are absolutely a hypocrite under it when it comes to putting it to the test.  You really don't have any confidence that God is really real. ",
