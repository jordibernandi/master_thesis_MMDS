You know, to a degree, I sort of have a twisted admiration for David Reeves.  He has managed to take his gross misunderstanding of evolution and turn that into a career.  Like how many people can say that their full time job is to misunderstand science?  Snelling, though, he is a legitimate geologist, so the best I can say for him is that he professionally misrepresents science, and people that do that are a dime a dozen.  It pays well to tell people what they want to hear, even if that flies in the face of the truth.  Well, let's go! ",

            "text": "Here's where the book of Exodus gets interesting.  If you want to propose that Exodus was written by Moses himself, which most creationists do, then Moses was not really a great author.  Exodus shows several signs of having been an amalgamation of several different source materials.  As an example of this, just look at the story of the Ten Commandments.  Don't start at chapter 20 and just picture Charlton Heston on the mountain alone with God.  Start back at chapter 19.  The people of Israel have come to Mount Sinai.  They camp at its base, and Moses goes up to speak with God.  God then tells Moses that if Israel keeps the commandments, they'll be his favorite people, because, you know, having a favorite race of people is always a good and moral thing to do.  Then Moses goes down and tells the elders what God just said.  Then Moses climbs back up the mountain to tell God that the people agreed.  Then God explained that he's going to come down on the mountain and show off a bit and gave some rules for the people to follow while he's showing off.  Then God shows off.  Moses goes back up the mountain and God immediately sends him back down the mountain to warn the people to keep their distance.  And it ends at verse 25, stating that Moses went down to the people and told them.  The next verse, chapter 20, verse 1, is the beginning of the commandments, which we all picture is happening on top of the mountain with Moses alone with God.  But Moses, who must have felt like a yo-yo at this point, was currently down, not up.  And this book, which was very explicit about every time Moses went down or up, just missed the last up.  Except immediately after the Ten Commandments, it resumes the story as if Moses was already down with the people and God had just finished his show-off show from before the Ten Commandments.  Moses tells them what God told him to tell them when he went down just before the Ten Commandments, and then Moses went up to where God was, and then we get all the rest of the Exodus laws.  When you finally get to the spot that you're talking about, where the tablets of the law were written by God's own finger, that isn't just the first Ten Commandments of Exodus 20.  There's a reason it's 11 chapters later.  There are 611 more commandments after the first 10 that this is referring to.  Such important things for God to make sure he writes down personally, like the rules about selling your daughter as a sex slave, the fact that you can beat your slave to death's door, but as long as the slave takes more than two days to die, there will be no punishment, that anyone who works on the wrong day of the week is to be executed, and other gems like that.  So yeah, these are the rules that are so important that God had to write them down with his own hand. ",

So our calendar year is 365 days, with an extra day thrown in every four years, making it an average of 365.25 days.  But an actual year, the actual time it takes for the Earth to travel around the Sun, is 365.2422 days, making it effectively impossible to design a calendar that would precisely account for the year while still syncing up with the rotation of the Earth.

So they lined it up with something astronomical, like you just said wasn't possible.  And of course, the lunar cycle isn't exactly 28 days.  It's actually 29.53 days.  So to keep their calendar year in sync, they had to add a few extra days in at the end of their year.  What is the point in bringing this up anyway?

And an agrarian society like the Hebrews might not have been able to successfully farm if their farmers only worked six hours a day for four days a week.  So these data might not have applied to them.  But my point is that this perfect, timeless example is no longer perfect, which calls into question the timelessness of it as well.  Also worth noting is that the standard work week of North America right now is five days of work with two days off, not six days of work and one day off.
