As a Democratic presidential candidate, my next guest, Andrew Yang, had plenty of time on the televised debate stage throughout the first stages of the primary battle.  And safe to say he has gotten to know most of the candidates pretty well.  Andrew Yang left the race after the New Hampshire primary.  But to prove there is life after politics, he's joined CNN as a political commentator.  We're very happy to have him.  I'm happy to discuss tonight's debate with him.  Andrew, welcome to CNN.  We're very happy that you're joining us.  This is obviously the first time that we're going to see Michael Bloomberg on the debate stage.  What are your expectations of that? ",

He's not accustomed to getting his past comments on sex and race dragged.  So it's going to be a real test of temperament and even humility for Mike tonight.

And, you know, it teaches you a certain amount of humility and you're taking questions from all sorts of people and reporters.

Because the big challenge for him is to express\u2014 You wouldn't go for, like, Metallica or, you know, Nine Inch Nails or something?  No, no, no.  He has to try and be presidential and keep his cool through everything.  For him, the pitfalls are if he expresses irritation or contempt.

His electability, his health, the online followers of his that have some bad tendencies, even his family's financial histories or dealings, like anything is going to be fair game because many of the other candidates are being told that it is not acceptable to have an OK debate tonight, that they have to draw blood on.  on either Mike or Bernie, or produce something spectacular in terms of a moment.

Certainly, I'm going to support whoever the nominee is, and I think that both Bernie and Mike have said they'd do the same.  But it's one thing to say you're going to support the nominee, and it's another for your millions of supporters to go out to the polls and fight as hard as they would for you.  So I think this is going to be a real issue for the Democratic Party.  And I think there's going to be a lot of soul searching in the days ahead, trying to figure out how to bring the party together, regardless of who is the nominee.  And of course, you can't rule out the other candidates.  But right now, Bernie's the front runner with Bloomberg coming up quickly. ",
