We're gonna see how they're gonna treat David, walk through here.  That's all we're doing.  They're calling in.  They're calling in.  What is he doing?  Passing through the checkpoint.  Are you coming for inspection?  I'm coming through the checkpoint.  Are you coming to be inspected here?  Am I required to come through the checkpoint?  It says all traffic has to come through here.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  Are you presenting yourself for inspection?  I'm traveling.  I'm passing through.  The highway ends, it comes through here.  I'm coming through here.  Okay, just go to that agent right there and present.  Okay.  Hold on, stop.  I don't wish to answer any questions.  I like to be on my way.  No, no, you're not going to be on your way.  Do you have any idea on you, sir?  Uh, you're a federal agent, so I'm not required to identify myself in the state of Texas unless I've been lawfully arrested.  Alright, so are you an American citizen or not, sir?  I don't wish to participate in your investigation, I'd just like to be on my way.  Okay, well, once you've performed, once we conduct our immigration inspection, you can be on your way.  Okay.  That's about it, right?  Are you going to participate or not?  I don't have to participate.  Okay, take your question.  Am I under arrest?  You're being detained for right now.  What crime do you suspect me of committing?  We're trying to conduct our immigration inspection, sir.  I'm not stopping you.  Well, you are, because you're not answering our question.  Okay.  He's got that left handcuff.  He's got that left cuff too tight.  I'm not going to resist.  I'm not armed.  Oh, okay.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  You just had it the way you were holding it.  Okay.  The only thing we're doing here is an immigration inspection.  I understand what you're doing.  That's the only thing we're doing here.  I understand what you're doing.  And if you do the immigration inspection, you'll be on your way.  But if you don't want to answer... Whatever you want to do.  You don't have to twist my arm.  I'm not going to resist.  I'm not twisting your arm.  I'm just saying, I'm not resisting.  I'm not twisting your arm.  I'm not resisting.  This is a thing.  I'm not saying... I'm not... This is a way to move a person that... That's fine.  I'm just... I'm letting you know.  I'm not going to resist in any way.  I'm not saying you're resisting.  Okay.  I'm not twisting your arm.  This is the way I press for a person.  Okay.  Okay.  For your safety and my safety.  I'm going to turn off that GoPro.  I'm going to take that away.  Okay.  I don't consent to having anything seized.  No, no, no, no, no.  You don't have the right to do that.  You do not have the right to do that.  I don't consent to any seizures of my property.  I don't consent.  You're destroying evidence.  I'm not destroying evidence.  You are destroying evidence.  Get inside and sit down.  All right, they're gonna arrest him.  Put handcuffs on him.  They're detaining him.  Not sure why, what's the reason, but they are.  David is being detained at the Laredo checkpoint.  That was pretty weird.  What was that about?  Oh, my God.  I just wanted to answer our questions.  How's everybody doing?  American Texans?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Anybody else with you?  No, sir.  Y'all have a great day.  Oh, thank you.  You too.  There's news now Houston, he's being detained.  They're searching him. ",
