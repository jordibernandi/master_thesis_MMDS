I've been sent a handful of clips, and there is a group of anti-whites that has cunningly come upon a way to undermine the concept that we use, anti-white, and to revive the concept that they use, which is racist.  Now, their term, their concept, racist, has been dying, thankfully, a very slow death, and we're happy about that.  But what they've done is started using the phrase anti-white racism.  do not use that phrase.  that is their phrase to revive their concept that has been almost single-handedly used to destroy our people.  so let's let their concept racism die and let's not wed it to anti-white which is growing rapidly cunning group of people.  but we're not going to fall for it.  thanks for everybody being over here and i will toss it back.

To use the anti-white concept is to legitimize it, and to legitimize it is to perpetuate anti-white lynchings, just like this one.  Let us continue to be this Little Sisters champion as much as the anti-whites will allow us to by not censoring us when we bring light to these anti-white lynchings.  Good God!  I can't even show the vile anti-white lynching here because the anti-whites at YouTube have given me strikes in years past for sharing videos of Westmen lynched by anti-whites.  because, according to the anti-whites who wrote me from YouTube, YouTube does not permit depictions of violence to be shared on its platform.  Yeah, there are never any videos of violence on YouTube.  It couldn't be that you just don't like us serving white well-being and, in the process, disproving your anti-white narrative. ",
