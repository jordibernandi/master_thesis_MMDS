            "text": "Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  To the 12 tribes of Israel that have been scattered to the four corners of the earth as was prophesied in our holy manuscript.  I say unto you, Shalom to all my father's children.  This is Moray Yoshiyahu Dawid Ben Israel of the Awakening Remnant Coalition with the awesome privilege of speaking to Zion one more time.  And we give Abba Yah the praise, the honor and the glory.  And as I promised, we are here to set the record straight concerning our King, the birth of our King and that which surrounded the birth of our King.  Why?  because these heathens because these uncircumcised european heathens took our holy manuscript and perverted it with paganism the worship of demons devils mythologies.  They messed up our book so bad, messed up our story so bad that many of the true bloodline descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are beginning to reject their own Messiah because of these pagan storytelling.  But hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, the record said that the same Abba, Yah, that scattered his people after the 400 year captivity will wave his hand a second time to gather his people.  And part of the gathering is setting the record straight.  And one of the areas in our record that have been messed up is the truth surrounding the birth of Hamashiach, the promised one.  The promised Messiah.  The prophesied anointed one that is to come.  Let me set the record straight.  To all you my father's children.  Never mind any of that satanic European Christmas folklore and lies.  They don't know our Bibles.  They don't know our scripture.  They don't know our culture.  They don't know how to read it because having eyes they see not.  And having ears they hear not.  And having a heart they understand not.  because it was not given to them.  It was given to us.  And as I have said this several times, Zion, you can't interpret our book unless you're us.  You're not gonna understand these scriptures until you first come to grips with who we are.  How are you gonna study the Bible?  and you don't know the who, the what, the where, the when, the how, the why?  It's impossible, Zion.  Therefore, Moray Yoshiyahu is here to once again expose the truth.  Or like the same time we 100% reject the lies.  Come on, let's get into this.  We're looking at the birth of Hamashiach.  Now watch this.  Go with me to Luke chapter 2.  We've already introduced this.  So we're going to just jump right in.  And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus in the Bible.  That dirty, nasty, perverted psychopath that all the world should be taxed.  That greedy, dirty, nasty dog that can't get enough.  And this taxing was first made when this perverted, nasty, self-serving, narcissistic dog, Cyrenius, was governor of Syria, known to have a blood lust, watching people suffer by starving them to death if they didn't bow down to the powers of the Roman Empire.  He was the governor of Syria and Syria had annexed at this time, Judea, Africa.  Oh yeah, that's what happened.  The Europeans are once again recorded coming down into our motherland.  Y'all know the motherland.  East Africa, where all civilization is born.  You know the motherland, what they call Afro-Asiatic.  All you gotta do is Google it.  So these Europeans from Italy, from Rome, are now occupying our home, Zion.  These are them dark times.  They are commanding taxes and everyone went to his own city and Joseph, which is Yosef, also went up from Galilee.  So Yosef was in Galilee, but he had to go out of Galilee, which is in Africa, out of the city of Nazareth, which is in Africa, unto Judea, the city of David, because I mean, which was called Bethlehem.  Bethlehem.  Beth, house.  Lechem, bread.  He had to go to the house of bread.  Oh, you heathens didn't know we studied Hebrew now, huh?  oh okay you european heathens thought you could hide the truth of the word of yah from us to try to create what you call a new testament christianity.  oh no we gonna smash all that.  hamashiach did not come to this planet to start a new religion.  get it straight you heathens and you slumber brews.  bethlehem is the city of david and how do we know that?  because we go back and we read the Old Testament where it clearly states to us in Samuel that Bethlehem was where Jesse was and Jesse is David's daddy.  So Bethlehem is obviously part of the homeland of Yehudah.  And when these European Dirty dogs came up out of Europe down into our holy land.  They knew these truths.  They knew that we kept these truths, that we kept our land and we kept our lineage intact, Zion.  We knew who we were at this time.  Not only did we know who we were, we knew whose we were.  That's why everyone who went to their father's house during the taxation knew where to go.  Oh yeah, let that sink in.  I say to everybody, now what has happened to us today?  If you were to go to your ancient father's house, where would you go, Zion?  It's a dang shame.  The ox know his owner.  The donkey his master's crib.  But my people, they don't know.  My people don't even consider it.  Yes, we are living in that time again where we have been scattered.  We are under European occupation, but this time we are living in the land of our occupant.  We're living in the land of our captors.  This is the land of our captivity and our lineage has been wiped out.  At this time, Yosef knew his lineage.  He said, I'm from David.  But guess what's happening in the awakening?  we are reconnecting our lineage Zion.  and now if we some of us know if I have to go back to the household of my ancestors that would take me back to Bethlehem.  yes I got to go through Jamaica.  I gotta go.  Y'all catch my point, huh?  If I'm going back to my homeland, oh, I got to go through Ghana.  I can't stop at Ghana.  Then I got to go through Nigeria.  I can't stop at Nigeria.  Then I got to go all the way across Africa.  Got to get through Egypt, across the water, into the Holy Land, Israel, and then to Bethlehem.  Why?  Because I too am from the household and lineage of David.  Get it straight, you heathens.  Let me get a drink of water.  To be taxed with Miriam, talked about this already, his espoused wife, Why is he going with Mariam, who's great with child?  Because these dirty dog Europeans didn't give a dang.  whether or not you old or young, whether or not you are healthy, sick, whether or not you are pregnant, you had to go show up and sign that census and pay them taxes.  I just want you to see, these are dark times.  And it says, and while they were there, while they were there, I want you to understand that Luke is being very, very, very detailed here.  While they were there, they were already there.  If you, and I don't use Greek a lot, y'all know that.  But sometimes I use it to catch the grammar.  That's the only reason.  And what Luke is trying to say grammatically here, you know, as it comes down to us in, of course, in English, is that he was already there.  Yes, we're getting ready to get rid of one of the biggest lies that's been told about our history in this video.  The first thing I want to say, it's going to be a bunch of these short little videos.  I want you to catch this though.  The first thing I want you to get out your head is that he got there like real late at night and his wife was like, oh, baby, I can't take another step.  And then he was like, I'm not going to do it.  Can we stay here?  No, we're not going to do that.  You know, oh, baby, I'm sure we'll find something.  I'm sure we'll find something.  Let's try this with Tucker.  Hello.  Hello.  Can you help my wife?  Please, sir.  Please, sir.  I'm about to have a child.  And then the Israelite, no, there's no room in this house.  Boom.  And they closed the door.  Baby, what are we going to do?  Then all of a sudden it started raining.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I don't have much, but I will share with you.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  My wife, I can see that.  She's very pregnant.  How about you go over there and then let her push the little negro out.  And then, you know, then you get up in the morning and you go, you go, you go.  Boy, you hate this makeup stuff.  You make it up for Hollywood.  You make it up to sell tickets.  You make it up to write songs.  You a lie.  It's not what happened.  So we're exposing the first lie.  First lie.  It ain't the first lie.  I'm exposing the lie today.  The lie I want to expose today is that Joseph got there at the last minute.  It's not what happened.  He was already there.  Let me read it one more time.  So it was, verse 6, that while they were there, not on their arrival, while they were there, the days were accomplished.  While they were there, the days led up.  The days were accomplishment as they were already there.  The last few days of her pregnancy, which she was about to be delivered, happened.  He got there a few days before the baby came.  You European dirty dogs who had our book for over 600 years, you want to try to figure out why you can't interpret it because you're not his.  don't belong to him.  you don't know our culture.  you know you don't know our language.  you don't know our history.  luke was a brother and he wrote our.  he wrote it down for us so that we will not have a negative attitude toward yourself like he got there at the last minute.  that's not what happened.  he was all ready there.  so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.  i want y'all to think on that.  we'll be back to expose more of the lies that the european have told concerning the birth of our king.  one love zion always pray for us.  we'll pray for you.  Consider supporting us because we have already committed to supporting you.  Hallelujah.  Got to go.  Shalom. ",
