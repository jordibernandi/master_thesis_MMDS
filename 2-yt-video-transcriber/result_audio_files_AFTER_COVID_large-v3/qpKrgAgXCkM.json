            "text": "So here we have another lovely young lady trying to tell men what they should do with their lives, and if we don't, who hurt you?  Who hurt you?  You're mentally ill.  There's something wrong with you.  So this chick... Pursuing compatibility company is more of a dating coach kind of thing.  And she's trying to understand men going their own way.  What she doesn't understand, aside from all the other stuff, wherever she's read her other stuff, men are choosing to be free.  Just like feminism.  allowed women to do whatever they wanted to.  Well, men also want the same thing.  Because back in the 60s, with all the societal expectations on women removed, men were still expected to do the same thing as they've always done.  And up until very recently, men have been doing this.  Oh yeah, marry up, have some kids, white picket fence and all that.  And when you don't treat her right, she can divorce you and take half your shit, your kids, and get alimony.  What we've discovered over time, not just men going their own way, but just men, red pill men, whatever, you don't have to sign that contract to get pooned.  One of the things feminism did with the sexual revolution is devalued the booty.  There was a time when men, in order to get semi-regular access to that, was to get married.  Get the ring, get on the knee, sign the contract.  Men don't have to do that anymore.  You've gone and devalued it.  And so there's no reason why men have to sign up for that government contract, which heavily favors females anymore.  We can just go find some or pay for some.  It's everywhere.  Go to a college campus.  If you even got a little bit of game, you've got more than you can handle because she's out finding herself.  So let's hear what this woman has to say about men going their own way. ",
