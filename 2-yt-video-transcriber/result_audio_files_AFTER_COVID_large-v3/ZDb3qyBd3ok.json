            "text": "And after this, I saw another dream.  And I will show it all to you, my son.  And Enoch raised his voice and said to his son, Methuselah, to you I speak, my son.  Hear my words and incline your ear to the dream vision of your father.  You know, many people have stated that the book of Enoch is not a canonical work of the Bible.  In other words, it was not inspired by God.  Inspired meaning That the Bible is not really the word of God, but the inspired word of God.  Do you understand?  And in Ethiopia, they absolutely consider it to be canon.  So which is it?  The truth is, we don't really know.  Because it cannot be proven.  That is the whole purpose of faith.  Knowledge is different.  I want to go through one of the chapters in the book of Enoch to show the similarities of what is written in the Bible and how the book of Enoch is telling the same stories.  This chapter is called The Prophecy of Animals.  And if you listen closely, I will show just how relevant this book is to what we already know.  It begins with the story of Noah, the white bull.  Do you all understand that the book of Enoch was written for the people of this time period?  That is why we understand the book of Enoch better than they understood it a long time ago.  So it was lost and now it is found again.  Before I took your mother Edna I saw a vision on my bed and behold a bull came out of the earth, and that bull was white.  And after it, a heifer came out, and with the heifer came two bullocks, and one of them was black and the other red.  And that black bullock struck the red one and pursued it over the earth, and from then on I could not see that red bullock.  But that black bullock grew, and a heifer went with it, and I saw that many bulls came out from it, which were like it and followed behind it.  And that cow, that first one, came from the presence of that first bull, seeking that red bullock, but did not find it, and then it moaned bitterly and continued to seek it.  And I looked until that first bull came to it, and calmed it, and from that time it did not cry out.  And after this she bore another white bull, and after this she bore many black bulls and cows.  And I saw in my sleep that white bull, how it likewise grew and became a large white bull, and from it came many white bulls, and they were like it.  And they began to beget many white bulls that were like them, one following another.  And again I looked with my eyes as I was sleeping, and I saw heaven above.  And behold, a star fell from heaven, and it arose and ate and pastured amongst those bulls.  Now, this section I just read gave me chills, because it rewrites history, doesn't it?  We assumed all this time that the first man and woman were probably dark-skinned people, given that they were created from the earth, which is dark.  But it clearly reads that the first bull, or man, that came out of the earth was white.  I know I just made a whole lot of you start thinking, right?  But let's just read through and see what happens, okay?  Let's consider what is written in the Bible as we do this as well.  You know, let me tell you all something before I go further.  Something that I want you all to keep in mind that I have mentioned before.  The history that we were told about is only a fraction of the true history of the world.  We dig up the structures and artifacts thinking, This is what the old world was like.  No.  Those things.  Those ruins.  The pyramids especially.  Are just the leftovers.  The foundations.  Not the entire structure.  We look at the great pyramid of Giza and think.  That is what it was back then.  And that pyramid.  Is just the foundation.  Of the true structure.  All the metals, the polymers, that just eroded and disintegrated.  Some of it was removed and all you have left is some stone structure.  But there was another structure that sat on top of it.  Metal.  Industrial.  Cranes, the works.  Machines.  They dig underneath the pyramids and they find things that we take for granted today.  They find drills, time pieces, gigantic weapons, as well as the remains of the giants that wielded those weapons.  They hide all that stuff from us and lock it up in a secret location.  Just something for you guys to think about and consider while I go through this chapter.  So there was first the white bull, Adam.  Then a heifer came out, Eve.  And along with her, two bullocks.  One black.  One red.  Cain and Abel.  Are you with me so far?  Then something happens, right?  A star or angel fell from heaven to live amongst those bulls or men and women.  Okay?  So next.  And after this, I saw the large and the black bulls, and behold, all of them changed their pens and their pastures.  and their heifers.  And they began to moan, one after another.  And again, I saw in the vision, and looked up at heaven, and behold, I saw many stars, how they came down, and were thrown down from heaven to that first star, and fell amongst those heifers and bulls.  They were with them, pasturing amongst them.  And I looked at them, and saw, and behold, All of them let out their private parts, like horses, and began to mount the cows of the bulls.  And they all became pregnant and bore elephants, camels, and asses.  Of course, this part describes the 200 watchers and their descent to earth and how they took women to impregnate them.  And they bore elephants, camels, and asses, which would be the giants or Nephilim.  There are several names for them, actually.  I do like how animals are used to represent men and how the animals born of the stars and bulls are completely different animals.  And all the bulls were afraid of them and were terrified in front of them.  And they began to bite with their teeth and to devour and to gore with their horns.  And so they began to devour those bulls.  And behold, all the sons of the earth began to tremble and shake before them and to flee.  And again I saw them, how they began to gore one another and to devour one another.  And the earth began to cry out.  And I raised my eyes again to heaven and saw in the vision.  And behold, there came from heaven beings that were like white men.  and four came from that place and three others with them.  And those three who came out last took hold of me by my hand and raised me from the generations of the earth and lifted me up into a high place and showed me a tower high above the earth and all the hills were lower.  And one said to me, remain here until you have seen everything which is coming upon these elephants and camels and asses and upon the stars and upon all the bulls.  And I saw one of those four who had come out first, how he took hold of that first star, which had fallen from heaven and bound it by its hands and feet and threw it into an abyss.  And that abyss was narrow and deep and horrible and dark.  And one of them drew his sword and gave it to those elephants, camels, and asses.  And they began to strike one another.  And the whole earth shook because of them.  You can see here that the giants began to turn against man.  And they began to eat them.  Because according to the book of Enoch, they ran out of food.  After that, men began to fear them even more.  And then these giants began to attack each other in what became a very long and extended war between them where they would start to finish each other off.  I mean these giants folks were abominations.  They were like animals.  Their morals, everything was screwed up.  What you have to remember is that all these angels, even the ones that fell, they still are under the rulership of God.  they can still be commanded and used for God's purpose.  So it really isn't clear who these four and three angels that came down as white men.  It could be the four bound at the Euphrates, plus Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael.  Does that make sense?  I mean, the numbers fit, right?  Now, one of them, however, takes Enoch to a high place to show him the fate of those who are upon the earth.  And Enoch explains that the one who took him to this place is the same being who took that first star and bound him and threw him into a abyss.  Not the abyss, but a abyss.  Which means, and you will see later, that there are several abysses.  Also, one of these angels had purposely caused these giants to go to war against each other, which was part of the punishment.  these angels because they would have to stand by and watch their children die.  and as I looked in the vision behold one of these four who had come out casting line from heaven and gathered and took all the large stars those who private parts were like the private parts of horses and bound them all by their hands and their feet and threw them into a chasm of the earth.  And one of these four went to a white bull, and taught him a mystery.  Trembling as he was, he was born a bull, but became a man, and built for himself a large vessel, and dwelt on it.  And three bulls went with him in that vessel, and they were covered over.  And again, I raised my eyes to heaven and saw a high roof with seven water channels on it, and those channels discharge much water into an enclosure.  And I looked again, and behold, springs opened on the floor of that large enclosure, and water began to bubble up and to rise above the floor.  And I looked at the enclosure until its whole floor was covered by water.  And water darkness and mist increased on it and i looked at the height of that water and that water had risen above that enclosure and was pouring out over that enclosure and it remained on the earth and all the bulls of that enclosure were gathered together until i saw how they sank and were swallowed up and destroyed in that water.  and that vessel floated on the water.  but all the bulls, elephants, camels, and asses sank to the bottom, together with all the animals, so that I could not see them, and they were unable to get out, but were destroyed and sank into the depths.  And again, I looked at that vision until those water channels were removed from that high roof, and the chasms of the earth were made level, and other abysses were opened.  the water began to run down into them until the earth became visible and that vessel settled on the earth and the darkness departed and light appeared.  so we have all the fallen angels that were hung like horses according to enoch.  i don't know why he gave us those details but they were all bound and placed in the mounds of the earth.  Now one of the four angels went to a white bull or man and showed him a mystery.  Actually he showed him what would become of the earth.  This of course is Noah.  Who is described as a white male?  or maybe this is albinism but I doubt it.  I just think that was his complexion.  We probably shouldn't try and understand genetics going back that far.  Especially when a great deluge resets everything.  It describes how Noah built a vessel and went into that vessel with three others.  They were covered over, meaning the vessel was sealed.  Then Enoch describes how all the animals that were left outside the vessel were covered by the water.  And they were destroyed, unable to get out.  He says other abysses began to open up and the water drained into those abysses until the earth appeared.  And the light of the sun had shined through.  This is quite fascinating.  Even though we have heard this story before, it does give a few more details to add to the story.  And that is what the book of Enoch does.  It kind of fills in the blanks and answers some of the questions we may have had about the story of Noah and the great flood.  I want you guys to stay tuned for part two of this presentation.
