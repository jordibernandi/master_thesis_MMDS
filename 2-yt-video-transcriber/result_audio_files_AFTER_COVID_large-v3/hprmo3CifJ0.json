            "text": "When I first came out as an atheist to my family, I heard a lot of objections and arguments that were pretty ineffective.  Some were even totally irrelevant to the conversation in my mind.  When I started making videos shortly thereafter, I began to receive a lot more arguments for God and more objections to my atheism, which were similarly ineffective and irrelevant.  Then, when I came out to everyone in my personal life, I received even more of the same ill-informed attempts at conversion.  Eventually, my channel grew larger and the conversion attempts started to really, really pour in.  Still though, nearly every single attempt continued to be as ill-informed, irrelevant, and ineffective as they'd always been.  It got to the point where I started hearing the exact same arguments every single day from people of different backgrounds, some who knew me personally and many who didn't.  I decided to start countering those arguments in videos, And it didn't stop the same arguments from coming in, even from people who told me they apparently watched my videos thoroughly.  After a while, it started to feel really eerie.  No matter how close someone was to me, no matter whether they watched my videos, no matter how many times I addressed the arguments, they just kept coming.  Strangely, a common theme in their presentation was this statement that I'd never even heard or considered their argument before.  Imagine being told something dozens if not hundreds of times every day for years and then being told completely seriously that you'd never heard that thing before, sometimes even by people you know.  It got pretty maddening for a while.  Now when I'm upset about a situation, I tend to try to understand precisely why that situation is the way it is.  I guess if I can't control it, I throw myself into study and get really tediously analytical about it.  Once I did that for this problem, I started to notice a pattern in all the attempts at my conversion.  There was a specific behavior exhibited across nearly every attempt, which drove the individual mistakes within each one.  I want to point out that specific behavior, but I think the best way to do it is to discuss the mistakes it most commonly motivates.  So we'll address four of these mistakes one by one, and I'll reveal their uniting factor at the end, although you will definitely figure it out before then.  Oh, and before we start, yes, I am aware that my quarantine hair sucks.  If I could cut it or style it differently, I would, but I can't.  If you want to be one of the first, say, hundred people to point out the change in my hair, then just go back in time about two months and leave a comment for me then.  Assuming an atheist thinks like you, but in reverse.  Recognizing this mistake was kind of the turning point to my understanding of the mistakes made in attempts to convert me.  That's why I put it first.  This mistake is basically assuming that an atheist uses the same reasoning processes that you do, but that they value the opposite of what you do, so they reach different conclusions.  Here's an example.  After I came out to my Christian family, I heard claims that I followed atheist authors blindly, even though I clarified that I'd never even read an atheist book before becoming an atheist.  It actually took me several months, but I finally figured out why they said that.  So I asked them one day, you think the Bible is infallible and treat it as your authority, right?  They said they did.  So I followed up with, do you think that I think atheist books are infallible and that I treat them as my authority?  To my shock, they actually answered yes.  They thought I reasoned just like them but valued the opposite of what they did.  I had to explain that our epistemologies, the thought processes or reasoning we use to reach conclusions, were totally different.  They admittedly assumed that I believed things on authority because they did.  They thought I wouldn't want to change my mind given new information because they said they wouldn't.  They thought I had total faith in evolution regardless of evidence because they had total faith in creationism.  Things got so much better between us once it was made clear that I reasoned through things very differently than them.  The lesson to be learned here is this.  People use different epistemologies than you.  If you want to change someone's mind on something, you need to know what their epistemology is.  Before you can change what someone does or doesn't believe, you need to understand why they do or don't believe that thing.  Assuming an atheist has never had a spiritual or religious experience.  This one used to make me particularly mad, but now I don't mind it as much because I just realize how much of a litmus test for honesty and openness this discussion often is.  When people assume this about me, I simply point them to a video where I discuss at length the intricate details of one of my many spiritual experiences with what I used to call Jesus, God, and my personal Lord and Savior.  The point there is that I and countless other atheists have had spiritual experiences.  A person can have deep, meaningful spiritual or religious experiences but still be an atheist because those experiences don't have to be interpreted through a religious or theistic lens.  Naturalistic explanations exist too.  I think many religious people believe that true spiritual experiences absolutely must lead to belief in their specific deity or faith.  This is where the discussion often becomes a litmus test for honesty and openness.  If an atheist says they have had spiritual experiences but don't think that God or the supernatural was involved, and a theist just replies, then that wasn't actually a true spiritual experience, that's a problem.  That theist allows their assumptions about atheists to supersede what atheists tell them directly.  If that's done, no progress can be made in converting the atheist because the theist in that case refuses to listen to, much less consider, what an atheist thinks.  If you want to dispute someone's belief or lack thereof, you can't just flatly deny what they say and end the conversation there.  It's necessary that you dig into why they think that way, and then once you understand it, point out where you think they're mistaken.  Don't call an atheist a liar in implying that they've just made up their experiences.  Instead, listen to them and then discuss their interpretation of their experiences.  My final note on this is that when I was a Christian, I thought that people who said they had spiritual experiences but didn't have them with my specific God were just kind of making it all up and didn't know what a real spiritual experience was.  I never investigated any further.  I thought that way because the idea of a spiritual experience which didn't fit within my preconceived notions threatened my theology.  If it didn't fit neatly in my little theological box, I stopped listening and denied its existence.  That was a fearful reaction to new information, which I try to avoid these days.  I'm not saying all Christians, or other monotheists for that matter, do this, but I thought that an explanation for why I used to make this mistake myself was worth including.  Assuming atheists think the way theologians say they do.  So religious theologians and religious apologists, they're just not educated on what makes atheists tick.  As much as they might imply otherwise, they do not have any expertise on how atheists think, act, believe, or don't believe.  They don't perform any research on the topic, they gather no actual data on the topic, and they're not atheists themselves.  They're not authorities on the subject.  That should be enough for us not to take what they have to say about the topic any more seriously than a layperson.  but I'm willing to go further on this issue and say that they not only lack credibility, but that their statements on the subject should be considered dubious.  Religious theologians, those with educations and careers centered around devotion to a faith, often receive education which includes anti-atheist ideas from institutions which were founded on belief systems which upheld or still uphold, that those outside their faith, including atheists, are morally bankrupt and worthy of damnation.  Religious theological schools are institutions of devotion in which students enter with a conclusion in mind and are given information meant to reinforce that conclusion.  They're not the same as educational institutions of academic scholarship in which conclusions are meant to be reached only after data is gathered.  That said, theologians' ideas about atheists are informed by their personal devotion to their religion, not by academic scholarship.  If we want to understand something, it's best to go to sources which actually study that topic academically.  If we're studying atheists and atheism, a reputable psychologist who studies religious belief would be much better than a theologian.  An academic scholar of religious studies who has done at least some study on non-belief or counter-apologetics could also be a good source.  I'll put it this way, if you wanted to understand why people believe in the globe, you wouldn't go to a flat earther.  Don't behave any differently when it comes to understanding atheism.  Now, if you want to convert a specific atheist, the absolute best source of information on what and how they think is them.  Just go politely ask an atheist about what and how they think instead of hearing speculation from theologians and arguing upon that.  If you approach most atheists with one of theologians' favorite lines like, deep down you believe in God but you're just denying it, that will end very badly.  People don't open up upon hearing baseless accusations.  They open up when they're actually listened to.  Making arguments or claims without asking questions first.  Atheists are not a monolith.  We don't all think alike.  If you approach an atheist with the notion that you understand atheists in general well enough to know what would convince a specific atheist to convert, It's not going to work out.  When I first came out as an atheist to my family, the immediate response was a series of arguments aimed at converting me back to Christianity.  Those arguments got absolutely nowhere because most of the arguments contained total misrepresentations of my positions.  It got everyone pretty upset and it didn't do much but just breed animosity and waste everyone's time.  What ended up repairing the damage that all the assumptions and irrelevant arguments caused was a resolution on all sides to always ask what someone else thinks or feels rather than assuming.  The logic behind that is simple, and while I've explained it in a few ways already, just allow me to reiterate.  You can't make relevant or effective arguments against a position you don't understand.  People don't appreciate irrelevant arguments and baseless accusations being thrown their way.  You can't know someone's positions or reasoning without asking them.  So, to avoid adverse reactions and make relevant, effective arguments against someone's thinking or positions, you have to ask about a person's positions first.  It's work, I know, but it's absolutely required if you want to have a healthy dialogue with someone.  Honestly, if you're not willing to ask questions of and listen to an atheist before making arguments against them, then I would just advise against arguing with them at all.  You're not going to get anywhere.  If you're wanting to go as far as converting an atheist, I stress that point even more strongly.  So what's that one specific behavior which drives all the mistakes covered here?  You've probably figured it out by now.  It's assuming rather than listening.  Honestly, it doesn't matter whether you're a theist trying to convert an atheist, an atheist trying to argue against a theist, or just anyone trying to convince anyone else of anything.  To change someone's mind, you first have to listen.  Maybe it seems strange to you that an atheist would make a video giving advice on how to convert atheists, but in my view, it's actually not that strange.  I legitimately do think that if more theists took my advice and intently listened to atheists before trying to convert them, more atheists would get converted.  However, we'd see so much less animosity among friends, conflict among families and toxicity in public dialogues that it'd be worth it for everyone, even me.  Whether you're a person who wants to convert atheists or someone who just wants a more peaceful world, the biggest mistake you can make in working toward your goal is refusing to listen.
