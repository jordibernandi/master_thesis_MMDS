            "text": "Well, hi everyone.  I'm here at the Ark Encounter.  Pretty sad day, really.  I mean, beautiful blue sky, just some fluffy white clouds.  Plants are coming out in bloom, flowers, the Ark in the background and no people because everything's shut down in Kentucky right now.  So we need to really pray the Lord will allow this to open.  But I wanted to tell you what we're working on and will be opened here in july.  it's something really exciting.  so we're going to walk up to this new building that's being built here.  now this is actually done by an outside.  uh an outside contractor feel that wind it's.  This is a ridge here and it gets really windy at times, can do.  Beautiful on hot days.  It just cools you down.  But there is someone who's outside of Anson Genesis, but a supporter of our ministry who's building this.  and this will be an upcharge just like the planetarium.  but it's going to be a virtual reality experience.  this will be the quality of anything you would expect to see at disney.  i mean disney.  they don't have the virtual reality experience in the park.  it's outside the park and in disneytown and you pay extra to go into it.  this is going to be the same sort of professional quality what you'd expect from disney or universal.  it's got these special seats that have these haptics.  they poke you and they move and it'll feel like in a sense a bit of a ride.  it'll be the closest we would come to something like a ride but it's.  but you're stationary you're sitting in a seat and experiencing it and you put on glasses like oculus glasses.  now i saw the rough of this.  actually the day before we are doing this video and it's just absolutely amazing because I put on the glasses and you're sitting inside a time machine and you look around and you see the lights and we have this little robot that comes and talks to you and takes you on a tour and the tour we're going to go on is Noah's ark and you're there at the ark here and you see it and then we go back in time and oh there's a little fun thing that happens on the way back in time and you get back to Noah and his sons building the ark which is quite extraordinary really.  as you look at this and then you actually fly over the top of the ark and you go inside the ark and you see the animals coming to the ark you see the animals walking up the ramp you see all of that which is quite quite amazing.  and then the water comes and you even go under the water you see some big creatures and you finally I come out of that and then go back to the present, see the arc here in the present.  It's an amazing experience.  And so it's a virtual reality experience.  So people will sit in those chairs and you'll feel like you're in that machine writing when you're sitting in the chair and you'll feel vibrations and other sorts of things and you can see this is going to be a really really nice building and they've already got the building up the doors there.  it's going to be a phenomenal experience virtual reality experience And it's just amazing to see this coming on.  And so this will be opened in July this year.  And there's quite a number of rooms inside.  So it's not like a big theater.  They're sort of all separate rooms.  And there'll be three to four seats in a room.  And of course, you know, all the glasses and seats are all sanitized after every showing and you know people can be separated out.  so it's going to be an incredible experience.  I think older people as well as young people are going to go crazy over this.  so it's as far as we know, I believe it is actually, the world's first virtual reality experience in regard to the Ark.  And so we start with this Ark, which is unique in the world, of course.  It's the only one of its kind in the world.  And then go back and see Noah building it and then come back to the present.  So that's gonna be one of those real exciting experiences, a virtual reality experience.  And the glasses are like Oculus glasses.  If you don't know what they are, I'm sure many of you do, but you put these sets of glasses on and then you feel like you're right there.  And it's fascinating to me.  with, these virtual reality experiences, you actually can look around.  So while you see out the front of the time machine, you look around, you see all the lights and the panels and all the controls.  And then this robot that comes down and actually talks to you and just phenomenal, phenomenal.  I think everyone who comes here needs to go see this.  It's just an experience you can't get anywhere else in the world.  This is the first of its kind.  a Noah's Ark virtual reality experience.  and you go back and meet Noah and his sons and you see them building the ark.  This is going to be incredible.  Well, they're really coming on with that building.  And so I trust you can come and visit the ark as soon as we reopen.  And we pray that is soon.  And we'll ask all of you to pray that I'll be soon.  Look at the ark.  Isn't it beautiful?  Look at that beautiful lake today.  Plants are all coming back.  Some of these flowers have already been at their prime.  And you can see now.  these flowers are starting to die off and then they put other plants in here but unfortunately a lot of people didn't get to see them because we were forced to shut down over the coronavirus issue.  so pray that the governor of Kentucky will open this state up again because we really need to the impacting people for the Lord Jesus Christ.  and of course we have 24-hour housekeeping crews here.  they just clean all the time and use all the recommended antiseptic you know disinfectants all the different things that we have cleaning materials.  and then as well as that we have so much room here.  I mean, that arc, actually by fire code, we're allowed to have up to 10,000 people inside there.  Now, you wouldn't put 10,000 people in there, but you can.  That's how big it is.  It's enormous.  And of course, we have 800 acres here.  So it's a big area.  And there's lots of area outside, as you can see.  And of course, our 2,500 seat conference center, which is a beautiful conference center.  And then behind, we have our zoo, the Ararat Ridge Zoo.  And we've expanded that, got some new animals in there.  And then our restaurant over there, well, we have outside food venues.  We have Zophar's over here.  We have some other food places here and funnel cakes.  And we sell hamburgers over there and hot dogs.  and some sandwiches.  And then we have a smokehouse selling, well, like smoked brisket and smoked chicken and so on.  We have a pizza place here.  We make our own pizza and sell pizza.  And then the restaurant is so large.  I mean, it's a two-story restaurant, can seat up to 1,700 people.  So plenty of room for social distancing that will be required once we reopen, of course.  and plenty of places outside to sit.  You'll see some of the tables here, and we have a lot more tables than this too, that we'll be putting out.  A lot of them are actually being repainted right now, but we have many of these tables that people can sit at.  So they can sit outside, be able to sit inside, out on the veranda there on the upper level, the outer level.  You can see the funnel cake place that was, It wasn't finished that long ago, really.  We only just started selling funnel cakes there.  People loved them and then we had to shut down.  But you can see all the beautiful landscaping they put in here.  And we have an ice cream shop as well.  And then we have another takeaway food area over in the Anser Centre.  And you can see over here, the smokehouse.  We have our own smoker there.  So we do have plenty of outside food places as well as this massive restaurant.  There's not many restaurants that size in the whole of America.  It's one of the biggest restaurants in America.  As I said, 1,700 seats on the outside and the inside.  and there we are.  so get ready to come and you know you could be some of the first.  we'll.  we'll announce the actual opening date as we get a little closer but it'll be in july when you'll be able to sit in those seats.  As I said there'll be an upcharge for that because it is so expensive to set up and someone else is funding all that and so there'll be an upcharge just like we have at the planetarium is an upcharge at the Creation Museum.  but then you will be able to experience going back in time to build Noah's Ark and the virtual reality experience, the first of its kind in the world because it's based on God's word and based on the account of the flood.  The first such genesis virtual reality experience.  How's that?  Well, there we are.  Hope you enjoyed this little update and look forward to seeing you here once the Ark Encounter is again open to the public. ",
