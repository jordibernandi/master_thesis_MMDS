Gesundheit.  And I know you're saying, well, I didn't sneeze, but maybe somebody who's watching did just sneeze, and then they turned it on, and that's an amazing moment for them.  Anyways, hi, everyone.  I'm Chris, a.k.a.  Main Man Chris, a.k.a.  MMC, a.k.a.  MMC-a-later, and I'm the host of the Not Even a Show.  I've been told by the top brass that I have to use this intro to get an important message out to the viewers.  This is a serious message.  Please don't call JJ McCartney on your own.  It does not help us.  We don't want it.  It actually makes it harder for us at the channel.  That's not a joke.  I would appreciate it if you please do not call him on your own.  Now let's move on to this episode, and it has lots of jokes in it.  And we've got calls to some of your favorites, Jesse Lee Peterson, Brian Kilmeade, Joe Messina, plus a snap off between Ed Till and JJ McCartney.  First, though.  Ben Shapiro is one of the few hosts who pre-tapes his show, and the reason for that is because he doesn't want to be made a fool of.  Well, that's what happened this week when I pranked him, and as you can imagine, he kept it off the broadcast.  But I was smart enough to record it myself, so we've got it for you now.  Check it out.

The Federalist is selling T-shirts that say that.  I feel like it's sort of disingenuous coming from a right wing outfit that is supportive of the police, presumably.
