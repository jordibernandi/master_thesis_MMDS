            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents... Is this the fallacy fallacy?  How's everybody doing?  Welcome back.  I'm going to try to make this one fairly quick because this started as an exchange that took place on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.  And I wanted to make sure that I kind of had my ducks in a row.  I was also working on other things.  But... There's a few things that I'm going to be doing in the near future on the channel, and that includes going back to some of the foundations about logical arguments and fallacies and things like that.  that can be useful, because I think at some point even a refresher is fine, but also there aren't any Atheist Debates videos that actually go into logical fallacies and cover this in the kind of detail that I think it really needs.  But what happened recently is I saw a tweet from Michael Jones, who I've debated.  He tweets as inspiring philosophy.  And he said, reading comments from physicalists on my newest video really makes me more confident.  physicalism is false.  And I replied that this doesn't seem any more sound than concluding that Christianity is false because of comments from Christians.  Your confidence metric is unsound.  Now, I thought he was joking.  Legitimately, when I saw the tweet, I thought it was the sort of hyperbole that myself and other people have engaged in, that's not to be taken seriously.  And that's the direction I went.  It's the reason I figured I genuinely, when he's like, man, I've been reading comments from physicalists on my newest video, and it really makes me more confident that physicalism is false.  And I expected that when I pointed out, hey, that's some really bad epistemology there, that what I would get in response from Michael was, yeah, obviously, I'm just kidding.  Like, I seriously, seriously thought that that is exactly what was going to happen.  And I was wrong.  He was actually serious.  And so as I tried to explain why he was essentially committing the fallacy fallacy and that his epistemology was somewhat flawed, it didn't go particularly well.  Because I realized right off the bat when he posted his follow-up that he was being serious because he said, you must be trying hard to interpret what I said in the least charitable way.  Nowhere did I say or imply that mere comments from physicalists mean physicalism is false.  I'm obviously referring to the lack of sound arguments in their comments, which merely adjust my confidence.  Now he's defending himself against a charge of committing the fallacy fallacy.  For those people who aren't aware, let's cover that really quickly.  A logical argument is judged basically on two criteria, validity and soundness.  Validity addresses the structure of the argument.  Is this the type of argument where if we put true premises in, we will get a true conclusion?  Is the structure such that no matter what we put in, we're going to have a valid structure?  so the premises naturally lead to a conclusion?  Soundness is the treatment or the evaluation of the actual content, the subject of the argument.  Is your first premise accepted?  Is your second premise accepted?  If it's rejected, then we have an unsound argument.  In either case, if a formal fallacy leads to an argument that's invalid in structure, or something content-wise leads to something that's unsound, then what we're saying is that the argument is fallacious.  But that does not mean that the conclusion is necessarily false.  What it means is we have no way of telling whether the conclusion is true or false.  You can come up with lots of different examples for this, but essentially you could say, I'm the smartest person on the planet, I am superior to everyone in every way, and the sky appears blue.  Now... The conclusion, the sky appears blue, is generally would be viewed as true, or at least it can appear blue at different times.  But the other things have nothing to do with it.  And that's an over-the-top ridiculous demonstration.  Because the problem is if you say your argument contains a fallacy and therefore your conclusion is false, you have committed what is known as the fallacy fallacy.  If you were to construct a separate argument, you would essentially be arguing that because your argument contains a fallacy, I can then conclude that your argument, that your conclusion is false.  But that is, as we just described, a misunderstanding of what a fallacy is.  Because a fallacious argument, the conclusion is indeterminate, not we can conclude it's false.  So I made a mistake in my initial response to him because, as I said, I thought he was just kidding.  I have said things in jest that it's like, you know, I think that a diet without meat does damage to the brain.  And this is based on the fact that a handful of ethical vegans have presented such terrible arguments that I think that there must be some vitamin deficiency or something like that.  You could do that.  And by the way, I'm not remotely saying that, although the vegans are going to come after me no matter what I do, despite the fact that I'm mostly vegan already.  The issue here is that if I were to say, hey, your arguments are so bad that they make me more confident that my position is right, that would be a problem.  That would be a fallacy.  What I got wrong in the response is the word concluding.  I gave Michael the impression that I thought he had just looked at comments and concluded that Christianity is false.  That's not remotely what I was trying to say.  And so I tried to correct it.  And I even pointed out, I said, I'm sorry, I guess I just don't understand English because I quoted him.  And then I said, that sounds like a pretty clear statement that your confidence that physicalism is false was boosted by reading comments.  So here I am trying to correct it.  I initially said concluding.  And then when he pointed out I wasn't reading very charitably, I reread it and rewrote it so that it's what I was saying is it seems like he's saying that his confidence was boosted by bad arguments from the opposition.  So if he says that I'm being unfair and uncharitable, and I point out that what he's written reads like he's saying that his confidence is adjusted, and then he still suggests that I'm misreading it, I don't know what to do.  Because as far as I can tell, that's straightforward.  He's claiming that reading comments from physicalists makes him more confident that physicalism is false.  But he wants to make it clear that he's not merely using those comments to reach this conclusion.  The problem is it doesn't matter.  If a bunch of people show up with really bad arguments against your position, that should not make you even the slightest bit more confident that your position is correct.  Because now your confidence level in your position is based not on the evidence for the proposition, not on good arguments for the proposition, but on a failure of individual people to argue against it.  That should not boost your confidence.  And Michael's, I think, a little wrong here to pretend that boosting confidence is somehow a separate realm than becoming convinced.  Because the truth is, you become convinced, colloquially speaking, when your confidence level exceeds 50%.  So if you're sitting around because of other evidence and you're 49% convinced that physicalism is false, And a whole bunch of people come in trying to argue that physicalism is true, and they're all terrible.  Like, they keep presenting fallacious arguments.  And this boosts your confidence.  Are you suggesting that no matter how many people come in here, your confidence will never be boosted?  that last 1% to get you to the point where you now accept that this is the case?  Because if so, then talking about your confidence being boosted is irrelevant.  Because if I'm at 49%, and every person in the world could present a bad argument for it, and it doesn't move me to 50%, that is what I would think would be a sound epistemology.  That I'm able to consider these things, but they're not going to ever be the tipping point.  They're not going to boost my confidence in my position.  Because no amount of incorrect, flawed arguments against a position will ever, should ever, serve to boost your confidence in that position.  And he tries to come back with this.  There's a point in the conversation where he basically says, yes, that should boost my confidence.  And he says, for example, the more research I read on evolution, as well as replies from ID proponents, the more I'm convinced evolution is true.  So what he's saying is, yes, people making bad arguments against it should convince me.  So Michael is claiming that he's more convinced that evolution is true as intelligent design proponents make more and more bad arguments against it.  And so what he's essentially saying is that he's okay with the fallacy fallacy.  He's arguing right here in the tweets.  It takes a little digging in and understanding it.  But he's arguing that because the comments are attempted rebuttals and the replies are incoherent or flawed, that makes him more confident that his position is sound.  This is flawed epistemology.  This is foundationally broken because we have here a person who's intelligent and well-educated and seems to largely understand logic.  who is saying that bad arguments against a position he holds boosts his confidence that his position is correct.  Which means instead of having his confidence boosted by positive evidence and argument for a position, instead, or in addition to that, he's having it boosted by bad arguments against the position.  As if these negatives, somehow a negative of a negative equals a positive.  And that means that if, let's say, it only boosts his confidence by half a percent, like each bad argument from somebody boosts his confidence by a half a percent, that means 200 bad arguments in the absence of anything else would make him 100% confident.  Oh, wait, is Michael suggesting that there's some other way of calculating this?  That maybe confidence is somehow separate from belief?  Because I don't understand that.  I don't understand how someone can say I believe this and when you say how confident are you, that they're not giving you a measure of how confident they are in that belief.  And if their confidence is being boosted by people making bad arguments against their position, then that means that their confidence is falsely boosted.  Their confidence level, this is one thing about street epistemology and talking to Anthony Magnabosco and others.  If you ask someone how confident they are in their belief, they have a reported confidence level and then they have an actual confidence level.  And whether or not their reported confidence level and actual confidence level line up is a separate issue.  And so you could have a conversation with someone and you could point out, you've been falsely boosting your confidence level in this position.  And you need to consider that.  And then you'll say, oh, yes, yes, yes.  Now that I think of it, maybe instead of being 99% sure that God exists or 100% sure that God exists, I'm only 74% sure that God exists.  But I genuinely thought when we started this conversation that what was going to happen was I was gonna say, hey, this isn't a sound epistemology.  And he's like, I know that.  I genuinely thought that this was, because Michael and I got along.  We had a good debate.  We had a good discussion.  But what happened instead is that he just basically, every time I would say something, he'd say, oh, you're not listening to me charitably.  Here's what you typed.  Here's what I'm reading.  Where am I getting it wrong?  Well, if you're just going to not read things.  charitably, he said it a couple times.  I don't see any other way to understand that.  Because if you're reading comments against your position and how bad they are, serves as something that boosts your confidence that you're correct, that's not epistemology, that's self-deception.  That is a confidence game that you're playing with yourself.  Con artists do everything in their power to falsely boost your confidence using fallacies and other things to get you to trust them so that they can take your money.  And if you're gonna play a confidence game on yourself, And you're going to sit there and say that, wow, look at all these bad arguments against my position.  Clearly, I really must be more confident that I'm correct.  I mean, I was convinced before, but now I'm even more convinced.  Then that means that if you weren't convinced, this could have been the thing that convinced you.  Your confidence level shouldn't be adjusted by fallacies.  Against your position.  They shouldn't be.  your confidence shouldn't be adjusted at all by the number of people Who make bad arguments or how bad those arguments are?  because now instead of addressing the actual subject is physicalism true?  You're addressing a separate subject.  Hey is what people have claimed about physicalism true?  and now you're using that to boost your confidence in the primary question.  So there's a massive amount of stuff going on here.  just in a couple of tweets that demonstrate, hey, You could have just said you were being a bit hyperbolic.  Like, man, every time a Christian calls into the show and presents a stupid argument for the existence of God that's obviously fallacious, I'm now more confident in my atheism.  I would never say that.  Because I understand that no matter how many bad arguments there are, that doesn't change at all what the truth is.  And it doesn't change what is reasonable for me to believe.  The problem is if you have a paradigm that involves forcing yourself in some cases to believe someone who you find trustworthy, which is the case of most theists who are going to advocate that, you know, I believe Jesus rose from the dead because I find the gospel authors reliable.  And so if your epistemology just means that you can make... Intuitive leaps to outlandish claims just because you find someone trustworthy and if your epistemology suggests that If this weren't true people wouldn't have bad arguments for it or if this were false people wouldn't have arguments against it that were bad.  if those if that's the way your epistemology works then yes, you're gonna find your confidence boosted based on how many village idiots you argue with and And none of that gets you any closer to understanding or being able to demonstrate or having a rational justification that your position is actually true.  And this is the case whether we're talking about physicalism, where Michael and I may or may not disagree, I'm not sure, or evolution, where I'm less convinced that we disagree.  This is a sort of bias.  I have my position.  You argued against it.  You argued badly.  Now I'm more confident in my position.  That should never happen.  And it would have been really easy if he just said, hey, I was being a bit hyperbolic.  I was exaggerating a little bit.  Obviously, I don't think like this.  But he didn't.  He doubled down and he tripled down.  And he suggested that I just wasn't reading him charitably without ever presenting any sort of argument for why is epistemology sound.  And, well, I don't have as much interest in that sort of conversation.  So I basically told him to pack sand, although in other language.  The thing is, I don't dislike Michael at all, but if I can't point out a fallacy on Twitter without someone basically just saying either I'm too stupid or uncharitable in my reading and offering no explanation beyond that, even when we've engaged on serious matters... then I guess the next solution is to go ahead and do a video and put it out.  So is this a fallacy fallacy?  Kind of.  It is akin to the fallacy fallacy, because Michael isn't really putting forward a structured argument here, at least not with respect to his belief on physicalism.  But he is doing it in a roundabout way by talking about his confidence level that physicalism is false.  And that means that the fallacy, if we were to put this, his claim here, into an argument structure, the fallacy is there.  And it's a fallacy fallacy to suggest that because people are really bad at arguing against your position, you should be more confident in it.  If that's the case, I would be the most confident atheist on the planet because I doubt you can find too many people who have had more conversations with more bad arguments on behalf of theism than me.  We'll see you next time.  Bye-bye.  This video is made possible by supporters of the Atheist Debates Patreon project.
