            "text": "yeah why rica?  all that?  yeah well we was work we work all of that but we was going towards oregon.  well it was like yeah we just go state to state yeah so we went to meffert.  you know what i mean because they said it's like god's country because it's always raining and it's green.  but i noticed one thing about seattle.  i mean washington state and oregon.  they right next door to each other that it's a press state.  they said it back in the day was like number one for suicide.  what was because washington washington?  because of the rain exactly So that day it was raining.  I'm going to be honest with you.  A lot of salespeople that go door to door, they always fold.  They turn into sugar in the rain.  They don't even, they don't get a best.  They just give up.  You know what I'm saying?  I was already, my mentality is just amazing.  Like when I, like when it's raining, I go to, I'll go, I go to work even extra hard.  Cause I'm like, I know they laying down today.  They ain't about to go to work.  Cause they looking at the rain.  They about to turn into the customers.  They about to be like depressed like them.  You know what I mean?  So, anyway so i knocked on this lady door.  i promise you.  she come to the door negative straight shut me down like oh whatever you selling i don't want to get off my property and slam the door boom and i was like well jesus didn't sell everybody.  god bless you.  and then so i'm walking up.  she come back outside expecting me to be like negative.  you know what i mean because she was still negative and angry.  she's like what did you say?  i said i i just said god bless you.  man i'm sorry we just gonna catch you when you positive but you know uh we gonna see you around like a donut.  and then i just walked off and then She started smiling.  She was like, what are you selling?  And I was like, I'm just selling good looks, charm, and personality.  You sharp, though, because your neighbor across the street thought I was a black Jehovah's Witness.  And then she just like, while she was smiling, a tear dropped to her eye.  And right then and there, I just took my shoes off and put her shoes on.  Then I put my shoes back on.  I was like, OK, for a minute, I'm not even about to steal her because I know that she's probably going through something.  And I remember being a new man when I was new at the door-to-door industry.  When a person was negative, the first thing I thought was like, oh, they racist.  But I noticed if I say they racist, I'm going to think I'm going to run into this all day.  I'm going to think people racist all day.  You know what I mean?  You just got to change your thinking.  And by me having experience, I couldn't think like that.  I was just positive.  I had a PMA, a positive mental attitude.  So I sized her up.  She was like, all right, come on in.  And then I walked in her house and she had like a gun on the table, like a 38 special.  And I was like, I was like, oh, don't shoot.  Just a chocolate kid having fun.  I was like, I ain't come to make you mad.  And then because I thought it was like a setup because she started off being real mad and arrogant and then nasty to me.  And then she told me to come in.  But I knew my personality broke the ice with her.  So when I come in, I see a gun.  I don't know this lady from, you know, a can of paint.  So.  when I walk in there, I see the gun.  She was like, no, no, no.  She was like, sit down.  Let me explain.  She was like, I apologize for being real nasty, which is just that today was just a bad day for me.  I just lost my son in a car accident.  Right before you knocked on the door, I was about to kill myself.  Sales just went right out the door.  Like, I noticed, too, like when I'm not thinking, I tell a lot of people when I'm training them and my salespeople, like when they go door to door, like even sales company, real estate, whatever.  I say when you're not even looking for a sale, you're just looking for a customer relationship.  That's when you automatically get a sale.  But like when you just like trying to pressure yourself, thinking about a sale, got dollar signs in your eyes, that's when you don't get the sale because you.  You know, it's 90 percent mental and it's 10 percent physical.  In order for me to win this person over, I really had to be a friend to this person, you know, because she was going through it.  You know what I mean?  So after that, we just started talking.  She hugged me and then she ended up buying like two bottles. ",
