Rather than committing the crime on US soil, he committed it inside of my imagination.  where neither I nor the US government have any jurisdiction.  This is known as the not breaking the law loophole, which prevents people from being prosecuted for crimes based on our anxious fantasies every day.  But Joe Biden was committed to truth and justice.  He wasn't going to let something pesky like truth and justice get in the way.  So despite the absolute non-existence of any evidence, he ordered the unmasking of Trump advisor Michael Flynn, who was then charged with lying to government officials who themselves said he never lied to them.
