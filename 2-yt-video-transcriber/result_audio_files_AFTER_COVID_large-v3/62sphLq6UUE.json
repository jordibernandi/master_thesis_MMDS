            "text": "Hi guys, this is Hot Off The Press.  I just got a report of an open vision.  This is like an angel that has appeared to one of our church members while he was just walking outside.  I mean, you tell me if this is a normal person.  So the daughter reported, and by the way, this whole family is very spiritual.  They have had encounters with angels and seen the Lord Jesus.  It's quite amazing.  He went shopping.  This is the daughter speaking of the dad.  He went shopping, and everyone was wearing masks, obviously afraid of the coronavirus, and my dad saw a man who entered the shopping center, and he was smiling.  He looked so happy, wearing no mask at all, and he was not afraid compared to everyone else.  And so my dad thought he was mental.  This is the Aussie way of saying that, you know, he's a bit strange.  He's a bit crazy.  But listen to this.  Then the man stopped and shouted, Have faith.  Do not fear.  Hallelujah.  And then he took out a trumpet and blew it loudly.  Now the strange thing is, nobody else seems to be aware of this guy except my church member in an open public place.  Who walks around in Melbourne, Australia with a shofar and blow it?  Wow.  Then, He went back to his car to put the trumpet away, and my dad said, oh, he's just a Christian, not a mental person.  And then they both got into their car to leave that shopping center at the same time.  so is that a normal person that nobody else noticed except my church member?  or is that an angelic minister?  because the bible says that many a times we entertain angels unawares.  they can come in a human form.  they can communicate to us and usually when it captivates your attention like that and there's nobody else that's paying attention.  i've had that happen to me actually long long time ago.  i won't tell you that story now but this is amazing.  so i just want to say don't be afraid.  Literally the words were, have faith, do not fear, hallelujah.  So I want to call for a 20-20, all right, 20-20 during coronavirus.  At 20-100 hour, pray for 20 minutes, praise God, worship God, do whatever it takes, confess the Word of God for 20 minutes with your family.  And I encourage that you also confess and declare Psalm 120, which is the psalm that is associated with the year 2020.  And I'll do that as an example right now.  We're doing it as a family.  But don't waste the coronavirus.  Get close to God.  Get spiritual.  I think actually it's a time where a lot of people are taking stock about what they have been prioritizing.  And a lot of us have been doing things that isn't God's priority.  It seemed really important to us before coronavirus, but now at this time, we really understand that, hey, God has upset our schedule, has changed our routine very suddenly because he's wanting us to change.  He wants us to choose him.  He wants to spend time with us.  So this is Psalm 120 in the 2020 plan.  In my distress I cried to the Lord, and He heard me.  Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.  Boy, a lot of liars around, aren't there?  What shall be given to you?  What shall be done to you, you false tongue?  Sharp arrows of the warrior.  That's judgment.  That's justice.  Sharp arrows of the warrior with coals of the broom tree.  Woe is me that I dwell in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar.  My soul has dwelt too long with one who hates peace.  You see, Israel feels that way about the terrorists and the people who are very hostile against them.  It's been so long.  Maybe you feel that way.  Maybe someone has upset you and someone has been a nag and a pest and someone has been just hostile to you for so long, too long.  The Bible says this is the year.  This is the year God delivers justice because He sees and He cares.  And you know, if you're the one that's doing this kind of stuff, you need to repent in 2020.  We don't want to see anybody hurt.  Amen?  But people are getting hurt.  So, Verse seven, I am for peace.  I am for peace.  I am for peace.  But when I speak, they are for war.  This is yet another reason why I say we need to pray more.  We need to go into the 2020 lockdown plan at eight o'clock, 8 p.m.  or 20 hundred hours.  Pray, you, your family, for 20 minutes.  Confess Psalm 120.  Some kind of war is going on.  I know President Trump has, in a very unusual rhetoric, has said he's the wartime president.  And we are in an active war, but it's a war against an invisible enemy.  Maybe that's biblical.  Maybe that shows even more that it's a prophetic war.  But I actually do believe that there's going to be a literal war.  But right now, I just wanted to encourage you with a very short, brief message to not waste the coronavirus.  So here, for those who are online church members, here now is the message.  Don't waste the coronavirus crisis.  Please enjoy. ",
