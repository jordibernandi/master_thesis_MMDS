Because, okay, he was tied to Putin and the Russians hacking.  Okay, so he declassified a Russian intelligence assessment that was previously rejected by Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee as having no factual basis.  Okay.  Several former senior intelligence officials describe Ratcliffe's moves as incendiary and irresponsible, given the manner in which he was releasing unverified information from a foreign adversary.  Even Ratcliffe, Malcolm, had to say he does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.

You're just like, this is what Bob Seska said, something about like watching that guy going, he has the new codes in his pocket.  I mean.  He would do anything.  He clearly knows he's going to prison if he loses.  I mean, and who knows what comes first?  You said Trump looks like death warmed over, literally like a mortician made him up.

One, campaigning about a poll site is illegal.  The way they were blocking people in Virginia, that was illegal.  Going into the polls, if you're not a registered poll watcher, that's illegal.  You cannot go in there and inhibit the polls.  You cannot inhibit the vote.  And I think people need to be prepared to make sure that they're ready to call the cops, that they videotape these things, and if they have to, to be prepared to stop people from stopping them or intimidating with weapons or attacking the polls.  As far as I'm concerned... Yesterday, Donald Trump essentially told his people when he talked about the proud voice to be on standby means to be ready.  Yeah.  Ready for action.  Yeah. ",
