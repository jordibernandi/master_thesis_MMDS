Oh, I'm confused because President Trump endorsed half of those people and President Trump rallied for those people.  Where the hell are they at?  President Trump supported the House and the Senate Republicans.  He's the reason why some of them got reelected.  Now, where are they at?  They need to help him get reelected.  These Democrats are trying to steal this damn election from the American people.  They are corrupt.  They are stealing.  Where is the Republicans at?  Where is the GOP?  If they want my damn vote next time, they better step up for President Trump.  If you want support from us, you better step up for President Trump.  This don't make no sense.  Why aren't they letting these Democrats do this?  I'm so sick of these damn rhinos.  They need to step up and do something.  They always let these Democrats run us over.  This don't make no sense.  This is not right.  This is not fair.  I'm pissed off with the GOP.  I'm about done with half of them.  After this, I don't know if I'm going to support half of those senators.  I don't know if I'm going to support all of those Republicans in the House.  I don't know.  If they can't support Trump, then I can't support them.  And that's straight up.  And that's just how it's going to be.  I can't get down with those people if they can't step up and defend President Trump and defend America. ",
