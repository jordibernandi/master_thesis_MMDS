There's lots of open space and almost no one puts up fences.  Oh, except what's this?  This big ugly fence wasn't here last year.  It goes on and on.  Spoils the view of the woods.  Who put this fence up?  Oh, my government did.  They took over a campground here.  But something's odd about it.  The signs say the campground's full, but it looks empty.  I see signs directing people to campsites, to group camping, but I don't see any people.  There are picnic tables, but they're upside down.  What a shame.  This would be a great place to camp.  Are there any people here?  Finally, deep into the campground, I found a few trailers and a few people.  So I asked, why is this place so empty?  Everything is sold out.  Sold out?  How can that be?  Maybe these people know.  Why is it so empty here?  I think it's so empty because of COVID, honestly.  Why would COVID make it empty?  Because it's camping.  You've got lots of room.  That's what we're saying.  What makes this empty campground even stranger is that nearby, there's this full campground.  Why is this place full while the state campground's empty?  We asked the Parks Department.  I understand, you've tried them four times.  It was like asking the bureaucrat in this TV show.  Sir, are you listening to me, sir? ",

This summer Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in America.  Yet the state, which offers to pay $25 per hour, can't find any workers who'd work outdoors in this beautiful forest?  No official would agree to an interview about why they couldn't find staff.  But the owner of the full campground agreed to talk.  He's John Gothier.  Not far from you, there's this government campground, and it's practically empty. ",
