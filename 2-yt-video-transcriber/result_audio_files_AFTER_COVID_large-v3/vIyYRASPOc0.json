            "text": "Yo, why am I always subjected to these levels of cancer?  I mean, on the real, this is something that should be done to people who've committed crimes.  So, people have contacted me because something went on with Twitch again.  It's almost as if I'm the Twitch police, except I have no power to do absolutely nothing.  I'm like a sheriff in the Wild West.  Sheriff?  Someone stole my horse, raped my wife, and killed my kids.  What the f*** do you want me to do?  That guy's crazy as s***.  He'll kill me.  Okay, so Twitch introduces... What?  Introducing the Twitch Safety Advisory Council?  What?  What safety is there?  What are they talking about?  I didn't know Twitch was South Central in 1990.  Well, I'll be goddamn.  No wonder everything's so horrible there.  There's so much violence and death and bigotry.  Oh, God, help us all.  Man, 2020 sucks.  Safety?  What safety do you need in streaming?  Maybe someone will call you a homo or a fairy at best.  Is that really what we need safety from?  Oh my god.  Someone called me a homosexual.  I prefer to be called non-binary and sexually ambiguous.  Whatever.  All right.  Twitch introduces a safety and advisory council.  Yeah, we really need that right now.  Twitch maybe should work on actually banning people who get banned three or four times.  Oh, no.  Amaranth.  She makes big money, so she doesn't get to stay banned.  But if a normal person does something backwards on Twitch, you're gone for good.  Twitch buries your body under Yankee Stadium, and your name is Jimmy Hoppa, you bigot.  keeping our community safe and healthy is a top priority for twitch.  yeah sure i don't know how many times i've seen alinity's boobs.  i think i've seen her love box once.  i know i've seen anna rance.  uh who else have i seen?  there's so much going on in this site that this just reans is retarded.  sick camel toe.  thanks i don't give a i'm not wearing underwear My God, maybe, you know, enforce your policies on people who should be enforced upon rather than coming up with new special programs that do absolutely nothing but pander to your own sense of justice.  A justice that is unjust.  You go to Twitch looking for justice, you'll find exactly that.  It's just us.  Drafting new policies, developing products, features, blah, blah, blah.  Well, anyway, since nobody really has time for me to read this verbatim, neither do I. The thing that's brought a lot of attention to people is the fact that one of the community managers or whoever is named Seth has been a full-time streamer since her debut, playing competitive Heroes of the Storm since 2016, yada, yada, yada.  one of the transgender streamers to ever be, one of the first transgender streamers to ever be partnered.  What does it matter?  Still just a person, but I guess like everything that involves, you know, the LGBTQ needs a special sort of branding.  Like it's the first person that's gay to fart in a box.  And you're kind of like, so my brother did it.  And they're like, was your brother gay?  And then you're like, no, my brother wasn't gay.  He just farted in a box.  And then they're like, would you please shut up?  You're oppressing our farting in the box and making about your cis heterosexual life.  Okay.  She brought the transgender flag to the platform.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Merry Christmas.  Thank God for that.  I couldn't sleep at night until I found out this information.  I feel a lot safer now.  Her fight for inclusivity includes creating competitive team composed of marginalized gamers.  Oh, my God.  What's a marginalized gamer?  Color me confused.  But what's a marginalized gamer?  If you're gaming, aren't you just a gamer?  But I guess, once again, LGBTQ, if you're gay and you're gaming, you're marginalized.  And something needs to be done about this.  You're a hero.  You're like Captain America.  Except you're not heterosexual, so that makes you better.  That's America's ass.  Anyway, this person is quite the interesting entity, to say the least. ",

Well, guess what?  That sounds racist.  You're a bigot.  I'm not white.  But I guess I sound white then.  That makes you the bigot because you told me I sounded white and that my voice isn't marginalized.  What the hell does that mean?  You know, I feel like being a heterosexual man is being marginalized.  You know, I'm going to go out and say it.  That's right.  If you're a straight male in today's world, in the Western society, you're marginalized.  If you so much as use common sense.  You're marginalized.  Not only that, you're called a name like Nazi or alt-right or bigot, something terrible.  You're a monster.  Oh my God.  You're oppressing women.  How could you live?  Oh my Jesus Christ.

Well, competition, by the way, y'all, competition requires you to get every advantage possible to become one.  the top point oh one percent.  in any video game you have to you have to get squeeze every amount of advantage you can possibly get.  voice chat is unfair period.

You ever find that most people are really... Social justice or LGBTQ haven't faced any real major hate crimes.  Like someone called them gay or something or, you know, the F word for gay people because they can't say it on YouTube anymore.  You know, they're like, oh, my God, it was like I was beaten up with words.  Words are violence.  It's like, my God, when I was growing up.  Getting beaten up and called a fag was part of everyday life, and I wasn't even gay.  Do you know what it's like to be beaten up and then buried in snow?  Do you?  And when I say buried, I mean the bullies literally dug a big fucking hill of snow and buried me up to my neck like I was in some sort of, like, I don't know, Iranian prison and they were punishing me.  You know, like that... I would say it was a hate crime.  I wish to God that when I was growing up, the most the bullies did was send me an email going, wow, you're a fag.  I would have been like, oh, that sucks.  I'm not a fag.  And then I just delete the email and move off my life.  But then again, if that happened, I'd probably be a big pussy.  So I should be grateful for those multiple beatings I've taken.  They made me a better man.  Hell, I should be on the cover of an LGBTQ magazine.  Remember Carlos Maza was running around screaming about marginalization?  And the dude is like rich.  The dude was rich.  I mean, that explains why Steven Crowder making fun of him was such an accosting to this man.  You'd have thought Crowder came to like Maz's house and put him in the figure four leg lock and then looked at him like Ric Flair and said, woo, and slapped his shit out of him.  You know, with a neck shot or something, it threw him out a window.  Oh, Crowder just made some videos about him.  Jesus Christ.  Mazza's sitting there like, if you join my Patreon, I can get the money and it's really scary right now.  And then you see where Mazza was like registered to vote.  His living room was bigger than my entire apartment.  This is what we're dealing with.  Some privileged people.  And they're telling me I'm privileged.  My God.  Privileged.  I bet you haven't had food poisoning once this month.  Start and come back to here maybe.  Nice and soft.  Down to the back of the head.  Weaving down a little bit. ",

You know, you're out there, you're trying to find something hot for yourself.  You're like, where's the hot chick videos?  And then you find this listed under your hot chick videos.  And you're like, this isn't hot.  This is bullshit.  Then you got to flag the video and everything.  Oh, my God.  What?  I got nothing for this.  Is this not weird?  And it's on Twitch.  Steph is perfect to help us with our community guidelines.  She's not doing anything weirder that could be considered slightly mentally unstable.  No, this is exactly what we need.  We're going to move Twitch into the future and it's all inclusive except for straight men because they're evil.  street men fine i'm gonna have a chick come to my house and rub me like this and i'm gonna go wait and then they're gonna be like.  well i guess he should work at youtube as one of the content managers because he did this.  he's a little forest creature here.
