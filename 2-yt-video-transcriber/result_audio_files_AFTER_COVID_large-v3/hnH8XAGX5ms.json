            "text": "Since I've gotten into reviewing stuff lately, I thought that I'd like to review some popular music, you know, some of the stuff that kids are listening to these days, because I thought that could be kind of fun.  And so I went to the Billboard charts.  And I figured, let me pick something from the top 50 songs that people are listening to.  And sure enough, I found the latest song from my favorite artist, Lil Baby.  Been a big fan of his for years now.  And this one featuring 42Doug.com.  another musician who I find speaks to me on a very deep level.  So I haven't heard this joint yet, as the kids would say, but I'm looking forward to listening to it, and I've got high hopes, of course.  So let's listen to this.  This is a song called We Paid.  Okay, actually, stop right there for just a moment, because, you know, riding on the window of a car is not generally advised, and doing it while holding a wad of cash is also... it seems like a disaster waiting to happen, frankly.  I don't know why he's holding the cash.  I don't know what, are they going to the bank?  Is he going to deposit it in his savings account?  If so, that's responsible, that's good.  But my tip is this, just keep the cash on the inside of the vehicle until you get to the bank to make the transaction.  So just a quick note about that.  I did just pick up there where he said, excuse my French.  Is he actually speaking French?  Because I can't understand.  anything that's being said.  Which is not an insult.  I don't mean to knock it.  It's just, anyway, let's keep listening.  Okay, now they all have their money out.  Like they're all holding wads of cash.  Guys, have you ever heard of a debit card?  It's a lot easier.  You know, you can just fit it in your eye.  Where do you even put all that cash?  You can't put it in a wallet.  Okay.  Sorry.  I don't want to distract from the message.  So let's just really listen to this music.  Okay. ",

All right, here are some of the lyrics.  I want you to really listen, all right?  Before I go broke like Jacques, F with that dog like Vic.  Roof.  Not that rock, that pit.  Palm angels down to my sock.  Can't hold my glock.  Reason, I don't really like that.  Young turn N-word, can't wife?  no bitch.  Excuse my French, don't like no bitch.

But then he also says, I'm bust.  So he's feeling like he's going to combust, okay?  Like he's looking out at this world of pain and misery.  And though he views it from tinted windows, you know, from his limousine, and though he has five cars, and though he's young and turnt, he's reaching, okay?  He's reaching.  He's reaching for something else.  He can barely express it.  He can barely speak at all, in fact, it seems like.  But that's because this truth for which he grasps is inexpressible.

And there is pain.  And I'll tell you why.  Because it's not enough.  He believes he can fly.  He made it to the mountaintop.  He wants to go higher.  And now he's striking out.  He's lashing out.  He's lashing out against gravity itself.  He is pounding against the very walls of reality, not wanting to be contained.  And that ambition, that drive, which has made him so successful, which has made him easily the greatest artist of his generation, also threatens to be his undoing.
