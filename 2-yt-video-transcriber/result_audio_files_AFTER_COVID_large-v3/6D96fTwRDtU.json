She tilted down her glasses.  She looked at me.  And she said, you know what's going on by now.  And I said, yeah, I do.  And everyone else just went, oh, here we go again and shrugged their shoulders.  Does anyone else find this really strange besides me?  It's about time that this whole corrupted, stinking system is brought down.  Seriously.  Because I'm really hating my job right now.  I can't stand this corruption anymore.  Please share. ",
