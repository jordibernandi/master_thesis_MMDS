            "text": "The Western world is in chaos.  So-called rioters and looters, united with people in positions of authority against Western civilization, are destroying the very world we live in, murdering innocent people.  Inexplicable disease stalks and hunts the living.  The governments usurp our rights and annul our hard-won liberties.  They couldn't stop this disease and they won't be able to stop the diseases to come.  They can't stop the violence in the streets and keep us safe.  In fact, they demand greater tribute from us, more apologies, more tax dollars, more self-abasement, more self-effacement, surrender more, give up more, beg more.  It feels like everything is coming apart, like we have entered a new phase of ruin and the destruction of everything we care about.  The sad truth is we have.  Everything and everywhere you have turned to for answers has failed you.  No institution or movement has had the answers or been able to turn back the tide or even been able to make any sense of it all.  until now.  Fairness, truth, and facts can matter again.  But now is not the time to turn to all the old systems and institutions of the past, everything that has failed us.  Now is not the time to get on your knees and beg like an impudent child for God to save you.  Now is the time to stand and empower yourself with a vision that will open your eyes for the first time in your life.  You can have the answers.  You can go free.  And what's more, your and all of our wellbeing depends on you empowering yourself.  It depends on you doing your duty.  I want you all to say this with me right now.  I can go free.  I will go free.  I can go free.  I will go free.  If you spoke those words with me, all you have to do now is turn the key. ",
