            "text": "We're in public, sir.  What's happening?  We're in public.  No, you're not.  It's private property.  Get away.  I'm on tables.  Don't touch her.  She's in medical.  Do not touch her.  Get out of here.  Both of you.  You fucking woman beater.  You're a fucking woman beater.  You have some ID on you?  No.  Why not?  I didn't break a law.  Do you have ID?  Yeah.  I didn't break a law.  Andrew Station.  There's one of the entrances or exits.  To the back of the facility.  There's a couple of turns of cops right there.  He's gloving up.  He's gloving up right now for something.  Oh, there's a woman sitting there against the wall.  That's why he's gloving up.  What do you want to do?  But he can't.  Why?  This is public.  No, this is the MBTA.  Yeah.  Just show them that we're recording, you know, I guess.  I don't care.  I always find it to be the random ones that are the best.  Here comes an ambulance for I bet.  Yeah, that's the woman that, uh, she had her, cleaned out of her mouth.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  I hear that.  There we go.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  We're in public.  We're in public.  We're in public.  We're in public, sir.  We're in public.  Don't touch her.  Do not touch her.  What's your name and badge number?  What's your name and badge number?  What's your name and badge number?  What's your name and badge number?  You just touched her, sir.  You can't come up and just touch somebody like that.  It's not private property.  It's not private property.  Isn't this public transportation?  Yeah, this is public property.  Fucking asshole.  Someone, I think, fell or something.  But we just recorded the police to make sure they don't violate anyone's rights or whatever.  And he didn't like us recording, so he yelled at us.  He said this is private property.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey, hey.  While he's doing that, he's a tyrant.  Watch out behind you.  Thank you.  Oh.  Okay, how's it going?  We appreciate you guys giving names and bad numbers.  That older gentleman didn't want to do it.  He just came over and touched me.  He hit our camera, which is a battery.  No, he touched me, and that's not okay.  Well, listen, EMT is going to do the job.  I don't know what happened.  We weren't given enough distance.  Listen, how far back we are?  I don't know what happened before we got here.  Okay, have a nice day.  Okay, we're going to ask for a report from the public health.  Is that a lawful order to leave?  This is private.  Are you going to charge us?  I mean, you can use the trains, but if you're not going to use the services of the MBTA, well, you would be subject to trespassing.  All right.  Thank you.  Now, are you asking this because we're recording?  Is that why you're asking us to leave and trespassing us?  Because we're exercising our First Amendment right now.  And if so, you're going to be violating our rights under the color of law.  As long as they're on a public sidewalk.  Well, in here, too.  This is not a public sidewalk.  This is a private bus lane.  This isn't public transportation?  No.  It's not publicly owned?  Don't we fund it?  I mean, it's a quasi, but this is a private busway.  If you're not utilizing the services, you have to... Well, we came here to actually catch a bus, and then we started recording this.  You're going to catch a bus?  Yeah, that's why we came here.  Okay.  And, like, the only people he had a problem with recording was us.  Everyone else was recording, too.  We're the only people he had a problem with.  Maybe it's because we have, like, professional-grade cameras.  But when someone's injured in public, we can record them.  It's not a HIPAA violation.  Yeah.  But we do want, we do end up wanting that guy's name and badge number, though.  He, like, straight up battered her.  Well, he took off.  He said, I'm not giving you that.  Which is state law.  You have to.  Chapter 41, Section 98A.  Yeah, and we also have him, too.  Oh, he might have pulled up here.  Hey, guys, we appreciate your professionalism.  The other guy, not so much.  It's the other two guys hitting her with the door and everything.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, thank you.  What's up?  How you doing?  Good, how are you?  Can I get your name and badge on there?  Bonner, 7-Eleven.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, you got it.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  What are you guys up to?  Just filming.  Someone got hurt or something.  so we're just filming them.  Make sure you guys are treating everyone right.  You need to watch the watches sometimes, you know?  I've never done anything wrong to anybody.  That's good.  But the good guys don't care that we're all filming them.  It's the ones that are a little, eh, that have the issue.  What do you mean?  Usually we get confronted either very disrespectfully or whatever just because we're filming.  Like we did here.  We got approached saying it's illegal, you can't do that, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He actually hit her.  The transit officer hit her and nobody seems to care.  So we have it on film.  Unfortunately, you're going to have to go.  We do have it on film.  Yeah, because it's the transit officer.  You just got hit.  No, I know.  No, I know.  I don't even know what you guys are doing.  Yeah, I know.  She was over here and we were saying that's it.  So, yeah, we're not real happy that she got assaulted and nobody cares.  So we just got by.  Oh, let's see.  One, two, three, four, five.  Yeah.  The guy was yelling at us.  He was yelling at her while he hit her.  Yeah, he took off.  He left the scene of a crime.  Huh?  What is that?  What's that?  That's the people that go around and film the police, basically.  Well, I guess if you're filming and you're a cop, that would make me an auditor.  I guess, yeah.  Some people do it for a living because they're trying to get the controversial videos for a purpose because it gives them flakes.  Well, this is the thing, is that?  a lot of people assume things like that.  I was just asking.  Yeah, but what the perception is is twisted right.  there is that People that are filming police, whether it's an auditor or not, are trying to either show the good ones that are doing the job correctly and treating us with respect.  Nobody films us to show the good ones.  Nobody does.  I've never seen it.  Well, that's like me saying to you, no cop is good.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  But that's what I... See how he just walked away all mad?  See how he walked away... I'm not mad.  You're frustrated.  Alright, I'm done here.  That's what you said.  Well, well, well... No, I'm talking about... You're awesome.  This guy... But that's like me... That's like me saying all police are bad.  That's like me saying all police are bad, though.  It's not true.  That's like me saying it.  When you say all auditors are looking for a... You know what I'm saying?  Can you understand what I'm saying?  No, you're not understanding what I'm saying?  You said they're all looking for money.  No, you said they're all looking for a reaction so they can make money in clicks and views.  That's what you said.  No, no, listen.  See, it's this perception.  You won't even come to an agreement.  That's like a cop.  That's like us saying.  Tell me what happened.  And that's what we want.  That's what we're trying to catch.  I didn't say he said all of them are out there doing that.  That's what he said.  But no, no, no, no.  That's him.  That's him.  That's him not understanding what I said.  That's him not understanding what I said.  No, I understood what he said.  That's what I understood it.  And I'm trying to tell him that it's not all people that film the cops.  We're not looking for bad situations.  I said thank you.  I was very respectful to you.  But then all of a sudden when he went sideways, now you're protecting him.  And that's that thin blue line shit that we don't like.  You know what I'm saying, man?  You guys cover each other even when it's not necessary.  We don't make the stories.  We just hold the cameras.  That's it.  So it's what you guys... And then it's the interaction that we have.  What is the story here?  The story is... He was saying that all he has ever seen is somebody create an issue.  So mainstream media... No, he said all auditors are out to make money, get clicks and views.  No, he said some of them, not all of them.  I got it, bro.  I got it.  I got it.  You have better things to do right now.  That's what you just said.  Oh, so now you don't have anything better to do?  This is what I'm talking about.  And the public's going to see this and they're going to say, oh, well, now that he wants to prove a point, I'll sit around and do nothing.  I can't keep filming.  I can't keep filming and show you.  No, I can't do that.  I can't do that, bro.  Because I can't stop my film.  I just can't do it.  What's gonna happen if you stop it?  What if something happens in between?  You got that camera and that camera and that camera?  Yeah, what if... What if by chance you cough us and fucking destroy all of it?  You got that camera and that camera?  And that camera?  It was at the end of... So... I mean... Just saying.  Alright, I thought you were gonna prove the point.  Alright, guys.  So do you guys know Josh Abrams?  Huh?  Josh Abrams?  You don't know him?  You know him.  I'm just asking.  It's not a random question.  Yeah, so you know him.  You guys work for him?  Are you part of his crew or something?  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll tell you one thing.  Because I don't want to be affiliated with that kid.  I hate him, okay?  I do know who he is and I hate him.  I do not like what he stands for and I don't... I am.  I am.  I hate him.  I don't like him.  I don't like what he stands for.  He disrespects, he disrespects, and he only provokes.  He calls you guys pigs and shit when it's not necessary.  I don't agree with that shit.  Okay, okay.  Okay, guys, so if that's what you guys know, I understand where you're coming from, 100%.  All right, all right.  All right, okay.  If that's what you know from auditors... I agree with you.  Okay, there we go.  All right.  See what I'm saying?  All right, dude.  I'm not trying to make you feel bad.  This is what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying, you know.  Sorry, sorry.  I don't want you to apologize.  No, because we... The conversation.  Yeah, exactly.  And I wanted the conversation more than anything.  But it seems as if when opinions are shared, you're like, oh, let's go.  But if you only have seen... No, no, just because we're not doing any good here, it's not possible.  Exactly, all right.  Now, if you, when you said you only see, like, Josh's stuff, I understand where you're coming from.  I get it.  He's an asshole.  You too.  Nah.  He said that same cop had him and cops in Quincy with his. ",
