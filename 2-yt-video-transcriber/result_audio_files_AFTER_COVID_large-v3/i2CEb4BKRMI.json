What else would you do with billions than spend it on the things you want?  This is Global Luxury, and today we're going to be looking at the six most expensive yachts the world has ever seen.  If you're excited about seeing the most luxurious super yachts that the world has to offer, keep watching.  Number one will knock your socks off.  Number six, Motor Yacht A. Market price, $323 million.  There's no other word that can best be used to describe the Motor Yacht A other than unique.

The Motor Yacht A is a 390-foot-long beauty owned by Russian billionaire and industrialist Andrei Melnichenko and shows off every bit of the billionaire's taste for style.  It was ordered in 2004, designed by Philip Stark, and built by Blom and Voss Shipyard in Kiel, Germany.  Not only is it on this list for being insanely expensive, but it also sits comfortably on the list of one of the largest superyachts in the world.  Four years after the order was made, the beauty was completed and delivered in 2008, estimated to have cost $323 million.  A redefined the way the world looked at luxury when it came to superyachts.  Its exquisite engineering design was like nothing the world had ever seen when it was made.  It became the foundation on which many other ships would build on the years to come.  While it is very pricey, it's also absolutely worth it.  And here's why.  The interior features of A are truly remarkable.  It boasts of 24,000 square feet of interior space, with the master suite taking a large chunk of it at 2,583 square feet.
