            "text": "Last night a man stole my Prada purse at gunpoint.  After it happened, I told him, I'm calling the police, mister.  He responded, Mrs.  Bowers, please don't.  That won't promote unity and healing.  And we need to come together after that horrific robbery we both just experienced.  I'm kidding.  That wasn't someone who robbed me.  It was the Republicans who aided and abetted Donald Trump's domestic terrorists who swarmed the Capitol in hopes of overturning our democracy.  Instead, they just posed for selfies in silly costumes while criming.  Yeah, they're that stupid.  Oh, and they also killed some people.  Yes, the same folks who are all about Blue Lives Matter and respect the flag disrespected the flag to end a blue life.  It's almost as if they don't really believe any of the things they say, which is why I side-eye any calls for bipartisanship from them now.  Oops.  Our attempt at bloody, treasonous insurrection failed.  So let's just forget the whole thing.  Bygones and hold hands while they regroup on their latest app for white supremacists.  Remember, after 9-11, when everyone was all, let's not go after Bin Laden for that lapse into terrorism.  If you do, he'll just do more terrorism.  Instead, let's just send him a Gwyneth Paltrow regime candle and work with him towards unity and healing.  Yeah, I don't either.  But the insurrection at the Capitol never would have happened without two things.  One, Donald's and the rest of the Republicans' lies about the election. ",

            "text": "Rigged.  Rigged.  How dare you ask why dead people are voting?  And two, something not getting nearly as much attention.  The election was not fair.  Christian nationalists.  The riot was full of them, but then again so is any gathering of white supremacists.  There were dominionist prayers before, during, and after the capitol's windows were smashed.  The mob was invoking their, thou shalt not kill mascot, while they were killing.  So what is it now?  Render unto Caesar a Molotov cocktail or onward Christian domestic terrorists?  Frankly, I blame in part the gimmick called religious freedom.  It has taught us that the laws that apply to so-called everyone don't apply to conservative Christians.  That makes us, oh, what is the word?  Lawless.  Because when I hear the, well, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley didn't actually storm the Capitol defense, I'm reminded of how popular the, well, Bin Laden didn't actually fly the planes defense was after 9-11.  You know, because Charles Manson never actually killed anyone either.  We will stop the steal.  Let's have trial by combat.  Priming is so much more tidy when you get others to do it for you.  Because pretending to care about pretend election fraud to overturn a real election is inciting real sedition.  And when the Christian nationalists you inspire name drop you while they're committing domestic terrorism.  I think Cruz would want us to do this, so I think we're good.  Congratulations.  You know your reckless encouragement worked.  Domestic terrorism.  It's the Lord's work.  Glory. ",
