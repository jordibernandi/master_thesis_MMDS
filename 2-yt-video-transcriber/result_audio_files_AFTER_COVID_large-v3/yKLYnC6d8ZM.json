            "text": "Hello there, Steve here in Sydney.  The worldwide rush on toilet paper all over the planet is ridiculous.  You never needed toilet paper.  There's something much better to use called a hand sprayer from your garden hose.  You can cannibalise that.  You put on this plastic, this brass reducer which connects to a sheathed hose like this.  It's really simple.  Sheathed hose connects to a double outlet mini tap.  The whole thing plugs into the wall like this.  Can you see this?  Here it is.  Double outlet mini tap diverts your system supply to a hand washer.  hand spray, which is far superior to toilet paper.  So take this video down to your hardware store straight away.  Save yourself a lot of money.  You're also going to smell a bit better, a bit sweeter for the rest of your life.  And you're going to save the forest.  You're going to save greenhouse gases.  You're going to save the world.  This is Mother Teresa stuff, the whole nine yards.  So get down to the hardware store now.  And make up your own replacement, far superior to toilet paper, that is the hand sprayer, which will go a lot to helping people out in their hour of need right now.  As global suppliers of toilet paper run out, you never needed them.  Okay?  Steve here in Sydney, over and out. ",
