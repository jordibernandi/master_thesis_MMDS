            "text": "than race.  This is bigger than a virus.  This is our time.  If we don't do what we need to do now, we will not get this opportunity again because the world is gonna be a lot different.  They're already showing you that.  And there's no room in it for you unless you make room.  You got to push back.  Here's where you flip the script.  After you don't try it their way, do them the exact same way that they do you.  And what I mean by that is this.  Look, y'all, I don't want to see another video of the police engaging civilians and other civilians are standing there, just standing there.  I don't want to see no more of that.  That is embarrassing to us as a race.  And they're laughing at you.  And listen, I don't want to see no more videos of them doing something to somebody.  Whether they're beating them, choking them, holding them down.  And you motherfuckers just stand there and do nothing but watch.  Because if that's where we are, it's going to boil down to this.  We're going to go with the goals.  And we're going to leave your ass behind.  And that's for real.  The last thing I want to say is whatever situation that you're in, just remember this.  They can't lock all of us up.  It's impossible.  But as long as y'all let them cherry pick you, one here, three there, four there.  I saw the videotape on the basketball court where the black cop was talking to the bro and all these bros out there.  All these bros out there.  And yet he knocked the hell out of that bro because he was disrespectful and knocked the bro down.  But it won't be two other cops and 25 bros and you in my neighborhood?  I said this earlier on another cast.  I'm going to say it on here.  If they had been brothers, y'all would have knocked them out, took everything that they had, and they'd have woke up early.  What happened?  Lip swole, everything messed up.  But y'all won't do this to them?  You ain't got to worry about going to jail.  You ain't got to worry about them.  How they going to shoot you when their gun is in the holster?  Let them wake up.  Cause you know, we don't, we don't knock them out.  Took their uniforms, took all their clothes, stripped them down, butt naked, took their gun, took their badge, even took their car and set these motherfuckers side by side on the bus stop.  So when the bus pull up, they looking at each other, they gotta go see their boss.  Come on in here.  What happened?  We can't go down to the black neighborhood no more.  Cause they not letting us come in there like that.  Y'all let them come up in there like that.  If it take everybody coming out the house, everybody come out the house.  Well, what, what it is?  What?  What?  Stop sitting there being scared of the slave catcher.  If you scared of getting locked up, don't worry, we'll get you out.  If the boy would still be alive, if the motherfucker who was standing there would have just really pushed the motherfucker over.  Yeah, he would have got a charge of interfering with the police process.  So at least the brother still be alive.  Bro, that's my word.  That's my word right there, bro.  You understand?  I just want to let you know, my man, that listen, as far as what's next, if you're interested in becoming a member of the Not Fucking Around Coalition officially, if you already have a license to carry, if you already own a sizable arsenal that you're ready to unleash on a motherfucker, and you got some type of military, ex-military training, or you are that good enough that you can pass some of our certifications, come and reach out to me.  at the official grandmaster jay here on ig i'm gonna let you know this and y'all knows what we do.  we are about to stand up our own platform.  all right we're gonna stand up our own platform where we control our own security on our own infrastructure our own web our own everything.  So that's going to be coming shortly, but if you still want to go through our vetting process, and yes, if you have felonies and stuff like that, and we can get it cleared up for you, we'll definitely work with you on that.  But a lot of y'all know your own history.  We're not telling you to put your business out.  Just know that we got legal shooters, and we got illegal shooters.  That's life.  They got legal shooters and illegal shooters, too.  I'm just trying to tell you, we got to meet them where they are, y'all.  Y'all so quick to jump on each other, but y'all won't jump on these people.  Y'all quick, y'all quick to spend money on some stuff that we don't make, but you won't support your own people.  Yet, on the flip side of that, and I'm talking to all you rappers out there that be talking about you bust your guns and you dripping and all that crazy shit.  I don't want to hear nothing else from none of y'all right now.  I cannot take your music seriously right now because the music is supposed to reflect the attitude of the streets.  It's supposed to respect the attitude of the people.  How you think we got songs like Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud?  They wasn't sitting around in the studio and made that shit up.  That's what was going on out in the streets.  That was when the Panthers was running loose.  That's when Malcolm was running loose.  Okay, they talking about what's happening.  Y'all need to change the channel.  I ain't heard that yet.  Y'all got all this money?  Oh, okay.  Do we need to finance a revolution?  Y'all got all this money?  Okay.  I don't need another letter written to another governor.  Stop.  I'm not working with the slave master no more.  Like y'all said, when do we throw off their laws?  When do we say your laws ain't working for me?  When do you say that?  Listen, we just not playing this shit with y'all no more.  That time already done passed.  When we went down to Brunswick, we didn't go down there to protest.  We didn't go down there to hold hands.  We didn't come down there to get along.  We didn't come down there to overcome.  We didn't come down there to have a conversation.  We didn't come down there for a prayer.  We didn't come down there for a speech.  We went down there to kill those motherfuckers.  And two hours after they found out we was coming, they put them in protective custody and called it an arrest.  You damn right.  that third nigga was hiding in his car because we went to his house and knocked on the door, looked in the window, turned the door knob, went around the back, told the dog to be quiet.  We did all that shit. ",

Y'all stop trying to hide the guns, but only bring them out against another brother or sister.  Y'all can put together a drug syndicate.  You can put together a smuggling ring, but you can't put together a neighborhood patrol.  Y'all can motherfucking go out here and work bouncers at strip clubs.  Y'all can go out here and be security at a concert, but you can't make sure that the sisters and the kids is okay in the neighborhood?  Y'all quick to show up with your phones out when it's a big fight at the club, and y'all can go, oh, I got this on tape, girl, I put this online, but you motherfuckers can't run down there when you see the police has definitely got somebody in distress and then say, hey, man, hold my phone, I'm getting in this?  This is how you get started.  And if the shit happens in enough places, I'm going to leave you right here, my brother.  It shouldn't just be rioting in Minneapolis.  They shouldn't just be rioting in L.A.  And that's it.  Like, ain't shit happening where the rest of y'all at.  I'm just as mad as you is, too, but I'm going to do something about it.  And I can't do it by myself.  We can't do it by ourselves.  Listen, that's why they are more afraid of our unity than they are of our rage.  That's why they came up with Operation Black Messiah.  See, sisters, no disrespect.  I love y'all to death.  I just think that there's nothing better that God ever created than you.  You know I'm going to wrap my arms around you.  But God made us for a certain reason.  Y'all were made to give life.  We were made to teach.  Facts.  Facts.  That's my word.  Not fucking around coalition.  We're not fucking around no more.  We fuck with this brother right here every day.  I know I'm going to have to come up with a new disguise.  You know, I told him, you want to look out for the sombrero.  You know, I got it.  I'm going to come back.  I don't know, but I'm going to slip back in.  But, brother, thank you.  Hey, brother.  I'm going to be on your platform.  You know we're going to connect after I come back from where I got to go.  I'm going to make a quick trip real quick.  Y'all just bear with me.  You know, one more thing before I go.  I got to say this because people have been asking me.  You see, this is a game of chess.  It's not checkers.  So if you wonder why you haven't seen NFAC in Minneapolis, it's because we watching the chess pieces move on the board.  You see the usual suspects already showed up.  They already jumped in front of the cameras.  You know, they at the house singing songs.  The policeman came with sticks.  I'm sorry, I hate to use this degenerative word, but nigga please, that's not how we roll.  We just want to see them play their hand.  OK, so love y'all unconditionally.  Love my brother right here.  It's always a pleasure to build with another smart brother who got his third eye open.  And we all need to spread the word to other people.  Don't know that?  people like us are here now.  The black man has stood up and we stand in tall.  And since I'm still sitting here talking to you.  And they must know something that y'all don't.  Love y'all.  Shabbat shalom, my brother.  We'll talk real soon. ",

I would even say I would even go as far as saying if one of our brothers or sisters, one of our kings or queen out here getting beat because they come like rabid dogs, they move like hyenas.  Like a hyena moves on a lone lion, they come in packs.  So what we have to do is come in packs.  You see somebody being disrespected, you already know he didn't call for backup.  If you got guns in the community, bring them out.  Give that phone to that sister so she can report.  Let me tell y'all real quick. ",

OK, buy yourself a gun, buy a shotgun, buy a rifle, but arm yourself.  This should become standard equipment when you see black people.  Why?  We're an endangered species.

I'm not, look, the ACLU, NAACP, Urban League, they can't tell me shit.  They can't tell me a motherfucking thing.  They working with the establishment.  And these are establishments that was set up by the government anyway to come in and be intermediaries and be mediators so that they can stop they asses from getting burnt.  That's all they there for.  We ain't fucking with them.  We shouldn't even be hearing them.  Benjamin Crump, all these bootlicking ass niggas.  We shouldn't even be.  They shouldn't.  We should be giving them niggas our back.  If you ain't talking about guns, bullets in the gun and bullets in the clip of that gun, we shouldn't even be listening to them niggas.  Them niggas is nothing at this point.  They're mediators doing the bidding of white fucking folks.  They're mediators doing the bidding of the establishment.  The talking's over.  Talking's over.  They done declared war.  How we respond?  We ain't going to continue being bodies out in this bitch.  We ain't going to continue that.  There's going to be some bodies on they side too.  It's got to be like that.  Facts.  It's got to be.  There's no other way around it.  And for the cowards, stay home.  Just stay home.  You already know in your heart of hearts if you're going to get involved or not.  Stay home.  I'm out in the street every day.  I ain't staying home.  Because I know that I could be Ahmaud Arbery right now.  I know that my black ass could be George Floyd right now.  We ain't taking no more losses like that.  Niggas afraid to get involved, stay your ass at home, man.  You shouldn't even be grabbing the camera to film it.  You should just be tucking tail and going your ass home because you know you ain't getting involved.  Fuck out of here.  Don't let another brother or sister die on our watch.  Don't let another brother or sister in Michigan get beat down by a cop And the white boy is up there.  The white boy is shoving while niggas is in the background talking about, oh shit, look at this bullshit.  The white boy was shoving back.  Niggas standing in the back.  Fuck that.  Some gonna have to die.  That's just a fact.  Some gonna have to die.  That's just real.  That's revolution.  Some gonna have to die.  Nobody wants to die, but some gonna have to die.  Because guess what?  We dying anyway.  So with that, I'm out.  Peace.  I love you.  This video, yeah, some were asking if this is going to be recorded.
