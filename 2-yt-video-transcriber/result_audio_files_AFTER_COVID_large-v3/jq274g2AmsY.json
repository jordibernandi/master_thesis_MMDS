            "text": "one of the main reasons why men don't understand women when it comes to dating is that men have just such a vastly different experience of dating than women do.  how do we typically understand another person?  how do we empathize with what they're going through?  We listen to their description of their reality, and then we draw upon our own experiences, our similar experiences, so that we can imagine what it's like to be them, that we can put ourselves in their shoes.  But when it comes to dating, men and women have such different experiences that it's difficult for men to begin to even imagine what it's like to be a woman.  I want you to watch this footage.  It's a woman describing a phenomenon that is rare for men, but commonplace for women. ",

            "text": "women have backups.  women have men in the background men who she knows likes her but she isn't sure about.  but maybe she's feeling a bit bad about herself one day.  maybe she's been single for a bit too long and there he is.  she'll keep them around because they serve a very important purpose.  These are the men who have been labeled plan B. Now, this is incomprehensible to most men because it is just so far from their reality.  The idea that there are so many women out there who are just desperate to be with you, that you have the luxury of keeping them around, you know, leading them on so that you can have them as backups is just ludicrous.  I'm not saying that it never happens.  There probably are some really high value guys out there who have a string of female orbiters.  But in those instances, the quality of the women doing the orbiting is never going to be very high.  A high quality woman is never going to orbit some guy and be stuck in the friend zone as a backup.  Why would she when she has thousands of options?  She knows her worth.  She knows she's a high quality woman.  She'll just move on to some other guy.  So even though there are instances where occasionally a man will have some female orbiters, some backup options, it is not a commonplace event.  It's quite extraordinary, quite rare.  This is why it's hard for men to really understand what it's like for women because They have no shared experience.  They don't understand what it's like in the dating market for women.  So even though you may have difficulty believing this because you just have nothing in your personal experiences with which to draw upon to make a comparison, let me tell you something that is an absolute fact.  Women.  even average medium value women all have men in reserve guys that they can call at any time for emotional intimacy love-making even a relationship.  most women have more than just one she has in the back of her mind.  i know he likes me i know he likes me or i know he's always liked me.  she has this list of guys and any one of them she could call and probably be in a romantic relationship tomorrow.  now men just cannot understand that level of abundance.  for them it just doesn't exist.  men's dating experience is not defined by abundance it's defined by scarcity And that's one of the reasons why so many men are vulnerable to one-itis, you know, that disease where you just become infatuated with one girl, obsessed with her, because for a lot of guys, they might feel that that girl is their only viable dating option.  Now, this is not going to be a video where I talk about how unfair the gender imbalance is when it comes to dating, because this is not a channel for complaining.  This is a channel about education.  It's about taking action.  It's about the practical steps that you can take in order to inform yourself about how all this stuff works and increase your chances of getting into a relationship with a high-quality woman.  I want to offer practical advice, and in this video, I want to explain the best way to deal with all of the male orbiters that your new girlfriend might have.  You start a new relationship.  You like her, she likes you, everything's going great, but you discover that she has something that you don't, She has a long list of backup men who she could call upon anytime the relationship goes south.  Maybe she calls these guys friends, maybe they're ex-partners.  Whatever it is, you know the true purpose of why they're there and still in her life.  You know how men are, you know what they're up to.  Even if she's ignorant of their true intentions, or let's be honest, feigning ignorance, we all understand the reality of what's going on.  These are guys who are interested in your new girlfriend, and they may have been a part of her life long before you came onto the scene, and they resent you for having what they've always wanted.  They're going to try and undermine your new relationship.  They may pretend to be her friend, or they may even pretend to be your friend, but make no mistake, these men are your competitors.  If you leave this unchecked, they're going to be a toxic influence upon your relationship.  and I'm going to tell you how to handle it.  First, I want to tell you about my most recent Patreon exclusive content, and it's all about masturbation.  It's about how often men do it, how often women do it, how women feel about men who masturbate, plus a whole bunch of other conversations on that particular topic.  This video was inspired by a question I received on Patreon.  So if you have a question that you've always wanted to ask me, you want me to make a video about, go on over to Patreon and sign up.  You can watch this video, you can watch a whole bunch of other exclusive Patreon-only content.  It only costs $5 a month and you get access to everything.  I'd love to receive your support.  Okay, back to orbiters and all of the men that your girlfriend has kept around as backups and how to handle that situation so that they don't undermine your relationship.  So if your girlfriend is actively leading these men on because she likes the ego boost that she's getting, if she indulges the selfish pleasure of having these guys and toying with their emotions, then that's really cruel.  That's a red flag.  And a woman like that, I recommend you move on from.  The advice in this video is more for men who are dating a high quality woman.  The kind of woman who isn't actively encouraging these guys, but perhaps because they're persistent or because they've never actually made their romantic interests explicit, then she can't really reject them.  Maybe she's just a sweet girl, maybe she's a bit of a coward, that's one of her few flaws, but she's never really had the courage to actually tell these men no.  it's not ideal of course that she has all these orbiters but that's just the reality of the situation.  a high-quality woman a highly desirable woman is likely to have them.  so this is how we deal with it.  let's start with what not to do.  do not confront these guys directly.  that is a terrible idea.  I understand that it's frustrating.  This guy is liking all of her social media posts.  He's texting her all the time.  He's offering to be her emotional support.  All that sneaky male shit.  It's really frustrating.  It's really tempting when that guy is face to face with you, acting like he's all nice and innocent, wanting to shake your hand, to just keep your hands to yourself and say, mate, I know exactly what you're doing.  You need to cut it out.  If you tell him to stay away from your girlfriend, it's gonna feel satisfying for a moment, but very quickly it's gonna start to fade.  The reason is because he has plausible deniability.  He can just say, whoa, man, I'm just her friend.  I've never made a move on her.  And he's probably telling the truth.  It's obvious that he has romantic feelings for her, but if he's never explicitly stated that, then he can easily deny your assertions.  Now, because you said something, you look like the paranoid one.  You look really jealous.  You created all this fuss, this drama, this conflict over nothing.  Now your girlfriend is angry at you because you were rude to her good friend.  And so she's comforting him against the mean new boyfriend that you are.  So yeah, it might be satisfying for a moment to openly call him on his bullshit, but that satisfaction is quickly going to fade because you weren't smart about it.  And when dealing with this, you need to be smart.  You need to handle this one directly with your girlfriend.  And the goal here is to create a mutually agreed upon frame so that the both of you see these men in the same way.  This can be very, very tricky.  So you need to tread carefully.  Eventually, what you want her to do is to explicitly acknowledge that these men are not real friends.  They're orbiters, they're backup men.  These are men who weren't desirable or attractive enough to get into a romantic relationship with her, and so she just kept them in the background.  If you can get her to that point where she openly admits that to herself and then to you, then you've won because the frame is clear.  You are a legitimate boyfriend choice.  they aren't.  the two of you have a mutual understanding about what role these men have played in her lives and at that point the threat has been eliminated.  now there are three obstacles that you need to overcome when broaching the subject with her.  there are three fears that she needs to move past one.  she doesn't want to lose them not as friends and not as potential backups.  Two, she doesn't want to feel guilty, like she's doing something wrong, like she's leading them on.  She doesn't want to feel like you're judging her.  And three, she doesn't want to have a fight.  She doesn't want to feel like you're threatening her or that you're jealous or insecure.  So how do you talk about it?  How do you bring this up in such a way that you don't come across as insecure or jealous?  If you say to her, why do you keep those men around?  Don't you know that they like you?  Well, then first off, you're brimming with insecurity and jealousy.  Two, she's going to feel extremely judged.  And three, she's going to be really nervous that you're going to forbid her from seeing her good friends again.  You need to remember that even though this experience of having multiple orbiters and backups is completely foreign to you because you're a man, this is what is normal to her.  It's always been this way and it's probably always going to be this way.  If she's a high quality woman, then occasionally men are going to take a shot.  You need to get comfortable with that.  You can't be threatened every time a man shows interest in your partner.  If she's desirable, it's going to happen.  So this is important.  You need to show her that you get it, that you completely understand.  She's an attractive woman.  Of course she's going to have male friends who secretly like her.  You expect that.  That's normal.  If you mention it, it's more like, I only think relationships are worth it if it's with a genuinely special person.  That's the only time I would want to be in a relationship.  And we both know you can get in a relationship anytime.  There's always gonna be people out there, but what's really special is if you have a deep, genuine connection with someone.  The framing here is really important because you're demonstrating that you understand that it's an option available to her.  If she ever wants a relationship, she can always lower her standards.  You can even say that to her and laugh about it.  I bet you know a bunch of guys who, if you just call them up and said, let's be in a relationship, you should be my boyfriend, they'd just come running to you straight away.  She'll laugh and she'll say, yeah, I guess I do.  I do know guys like that.  And you'll nod and you'll laugh and you say, yeah, but you know, it's not tempting, is it?  You know, I don't want to be in a relationship with just anybody.  I've never been tempted by backup options.  I would rather be single than be with somebody who's not high quality.  What's good about that framing is that it demonstrates that you're not threatened.  You understand her world.  In fact, you're a part of that world.  The concept of orbiters isn't some foreign experience.  It's a shared experience for the both of you.  By framing it like this, you reinforce that you're just like her.  You're one who is orbited, and you're different from all those other guys.  You mention it casually like it's no big deal.  The existence of people like that is an unavoidable fact of reality.  It's certainly not something worth getting upset about.  now because you haven't made a big deal about it you haven't gotten insecure judgmental or demanding.  you unconsciously.  give her permission to admit to you what she may not have admitted to herself.  yes these men are backups but now the framing is definitely in your favour because it's like thank god she didn't need to settle for those chumps.  Thank goodness you guys found each other.  So that's a really good start, but still, there's a little bit more that you need to do.  You framed it correctly and separated yourself from all those other guys so that she can recognize that you're different.  But still, on a practical level, it's just going to be frustrating to have these guys hanging around when you see them out at parties or social events.  And they're giving her extra long hugs and all that sneaky stuff.  Again, what you don't want to do is confront those guys directly.  Instead, you need to speak to her.  After the evening's finished and you guys are walking home together or in the car You should mention that you feel sorry for these guys.  she'll ask why and you'll say well i want everybody to be in a relationship i want them to be happy and it's sad to see these guys still pining after you when they've got no chance.  i really wish they'd be able to move on and find a partner who's right for them somebody who could make them happy.  you see you're not speaking out of jealousy here.  you're speaking out of compassion.  They're not a big enough threat to actually make you insecure.  You just feel sorry for them.  She'll agree with you.  She'll say, yeah, I feel sorry for them as well.  And then you can innocently ask her, do you ever worry about being nice to these guys, responding to their texts, letting them do favors to you, that inadvertently you might be giving them some false hope?  You're not accusing her.  You're not judging her.  The two of you are just... pondering the possibility that perhaps by her behavior, she might actually not be acting in their best interests.  When it's framed like that, any additional contact that she has with these guys, even if it's really friendly, is suddenly going to start to seem quite cruel.  I want to be nice to this guy, but actually me being nice to him is what's giving him false hope and preventing him from being able to move on in his life.  If she's a high quality woman, her empathy and compassion will kick in here and she'll start to put some distance in that friendship.  starting to limit her interactions with that guy because she recognizes that that's what's right for him.  Now, before I finish up, I just want to preemptively address a criticism.  Someone might say, Alexander, this is not really honest.  This is kind of manipulative.  You're just following a script here.  Why not just tell her the truth?  It is really hard sometimes in these videos for me to get across my point without it seeming as though I am prescribing a certain behavior or a set of behaviors.  But that is just the limitation of this format.  When I'm speaking to somebody in a private consultation and they're sharing their unique specific circumstances, then obviously I'm able to tailor my advice a lot more to suit that individual.  So don't take what I've said in this video as though it's gospel, as though you need to do step one, step two, any things like that.  It's just a vague sort of model to give you an idea of what you should be trying to achieve.  Obviously, don't be dishonest.  Do not share any feelings that you do not actually have.  That is manipulative.  If you truly are jealous of some of these guys, don't pretend like you're not.  You should fix that jealousy, look inside yourself, find out what deficiencies you feel with regards to your own desirability, your own self-esteem and work on that so that you genuinely aren't jealous.  So when it comes time to talking to her about this stuff, yes, take this video as a sort of vague guideline, but make sure that you're being authentic.  The most valuable thing that you have is your integrity and you need to maintain that at all costs.
