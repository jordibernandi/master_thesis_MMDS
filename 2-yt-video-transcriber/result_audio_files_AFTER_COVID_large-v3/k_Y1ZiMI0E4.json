Paula White is dancing like a queen bee and telling someone named Deborah to stir up people's faith.  But I don't think dancing around like this is going to attract anyone to Christianity.  About halfway through, she references yet another declaration of an end to the current situation.  This clip actually came from the site Friendly Atheist and just goes to show that even the unsaved world can spot a phony.  As I said, I don't know what to think about all of this, so let's just look. ",

            "text": "The leader of the bee family is always a female known as a queen bee.  She's the only female that is fertile.  Deborah, you're a queen bee.  Come on.  But here's what's so important.  She is known for her dance.  She is known for her dance.  And it's not like some cute little, you know, this kind of dance.  It's not that, this kind of dance.  She's known for her dance.  Because when she gets ready to notify in the hive of the new source of food, she will perform a dance by vibrating her wings.  Her wings start going into this like almost uncontrollable vibration and the moving of her body around.  And the dance starts to communicate how far and in what direction the food is.  She's the queen bee and it's uphill against the wind.  It will require more energy.  So what she starts doing at the Mount of Food, there is great dance.  The dance will last longer and it'll be more enthusiastic.  So what she starts doing, the longer the dance, the more bees she gets aroused.  So Queen Bee starts going into this frenzy and she starts going around and around and around.  And she goes into vibrations until all the bees get activated.  And all the bees start going forth.  And she leads the way by stirring something up.  I dare you, Deborah.  Come on, stir it up right now in the name of Jesus.  Stir up faith in others.  Do you think I was ashamed to stand on the lawn of the White House in front of the president, the vice president, the floatist, the nation, the press, and declare in the name of Jesus, I declare right now an end to this COVID-19.  What good am I if I pray some cute little prayer?  What good am I if I have some fancy little poem or just talk about the problem?  Everybody knows the problem, but who's going to come forth with the solution?  Stir them up.  Stir them up.  Come on, Deborah.  Stir them up right now.  Stir them up.  There's a whole lot of food.  There's revelation.  Some people are eating ass's head and love's done.  Come on.  Where's my Deborah?  Where's my Deborah? ",
