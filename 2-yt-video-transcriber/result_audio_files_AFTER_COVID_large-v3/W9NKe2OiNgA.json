            "text": "So let me begin by indicating what some of the problems are that a capitalist medical system of the sort we have in the United States presents to dealing with something as big of an epidemic as the coronavirus already is.  30 million Americans have no insurance, no medical insurance.  They have a long history of not going to the doctor when they have something they think is a passing flu, viral or bacterial, because they can't afford to pay the astronomic cost that confronts someone without insurance.  Likewise, for such a person to go to the emergency room, which would be an option under other becomes something you don't want to do in the face of a crisis since all the other people who have no other way of getting health are rushing to the emergency room.  If there are likely to be people infected by this virus, you're going to find them in an emergency room and people figure that out.  And so we have a walking time bomb.  But it would be nothing if it weren't added to by the following.  A hundred million Americans have insurance but with huge deductibles and or sizable co-pays.  They don't want to have to shell that money out because they don't have it.  They will hesitate to be tested and therefore they will hesitate to be identified and therefore they will spread the disease, if they have it, in ways that a properly covered insurance program would be able to avoid.  Millions more American workers have no paid sick leave from their job and they will stay at their job as long as possible because they have no paid sick leave.  And then I come to the undocumented immigrants, afraid of going to any medical facility because it will subject them to dangers from ICE or other immigration authorities.  This is a collection that amounts to at least half of the population, so managed in our medical profit system that they are colluding with this epidemic.  They don't want to, but the system forces it on them.  We have a law in the United States that allows mandatory quarantining of people, but it doesn't cover the costs of a quarantine when a person loses his or her income.  This is crazy.  If you're going to quarantine people who have the disease and you're not going to cover the cost of it, you're giving them an incentive not to be tested so they avoid the quarantine.  I noticed that the Trump administration has made statements about tax relief and aid for airlines and travel companies affected by this crisis.  Once again, we see where the priorities in a capitalist system go, to the corporations and not to the mass of people whose health is threatened.  To give you an idea of how things could be otherwise, I'm going to pick one country, South Korea.  It's handling their situation there, which is more extreme than ours yet in the United States, as follows.  South Korea has a universal health insurance program.  On top of that, corona testing is free for every single person in South Korea, and that includes immigrants who are specifically guaranteed.  no information about their treatment will be shared by any other government institution and you do not have to be a South Korean citizen to get the free testing.  Nothing like that is being done in the United States and I leave it to you to imagine why.  And then we have the market system, our proud market system that is distributing scarce testing kits, scarce masks, scarce equipment to people who can pay.  That's right.  If you have a lot of money, you can go on to the internet and go find these rare health items.  And they're distributed according to how much money you have, not according to what the need is.  For example, for medical personnel to be safe in treating those who come for testing, they obviously should get the equipment, the testing equipment, and the mask, and anything else that might help first, but not in a market system.  No, no, no.  It goes first to those with the most money.  On March 8th, the New York Times regaled us with a list of all the things rich people are doing to escape the virus.  The yachts that they are moving onto, the bunkers they have created on their property to hide in, the expensive masks that they are able to get that cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  It's charming to watch how the system works.  In the United Kingdom, the Competition and Market Authority is monitoring the situation and may ask the government to impose price controls.  In other words, it's a recognition, at least in England, that the market is a failed institution for dealing with such situations.  And as you know from this program, it isn't very good at lots of other things either. ",
