            "text": "So Undead Chronic did a version of this.  I'll put the link below.  Go to his page and sub while you still can.  He's on channel 78, I believe.  You better hurry.  You never know when the censors will pop up.  So there's an article in something called technologyreview.com.  The Manosphere, in scary quotes.  is getting more toxic.  You see, it's all toxic, but now it's getting more toxic.  You see, it's getting more toxic as angry men join the incels.  Men from the less extreme end of the misogynistic spectrum are drifting toward groups that espouse violence against women, a new study suggests.  What you're going to see in this article over and over again, extreme violence, misogynistic, violence, terrorism.  In other words, we're all bad.  We're all toxic.  Man, we're just, we're evil.  We are a cancer on the otherwise female utopia that would definitely exist if our swing and dicks were, I don't know, gone.  So they keep going through this article and basically, I'll give you the gist of it.  They went to Reddit and of all places, and some other sites.  And they did some keyword searching on stuff like toxic, violent, women-hating, violence, blah, blah, blah.  And what they discovered in their study is that more MRAs and MGTOW men are becoming incels and becoming even more toxic and more violent and more misogynistic.  Well, what does that mean?  Well, that means MRAs and MGTOWs are violent, radical, extreme, misogynistic.  All of us.  Now, she lists four groups, MRA, MGTOW, incels.  And for some reason, pickup artists who, as far as I know, the pickup artists aren't having any trouble, you know, having fun with women.  So I don't know why they're in here, but I guess they're part of the evil misogynistic spectrum.  So what this really means, guys, is that every... Man who does not toe the line.  If you don't do what you're supposed to do as a real man, that is get married, get a good job, have a child or two, house, white picket fence, and work yourself until you die.  If you're not willing to do that, you are an extreme misogynist.  Do you see in some ways this is a shaming tactic?  Well, they're saying, well, if you do what we want you to do, that is get married and, you know, sign that contract that guarantees her cash and prizes when she pulls the divorce trigger, alienation from your children, various other things, poverty, suicide, homelessness.  If you don't want to sign up for that, you're obviously a part of these evil, violent, misogynistic groups of men.  When in fact, MRAs and MGTOWs, especially those two groups, we can see through the bullshit.  We've all been force-fed this crap.  Women are angels.  Women are special.  They're perfect.  Blah, blah, freaking blah.  When the chains of societal expectations were ripped away from women, you go, girl.  You can do whatever you want.  Men were not supposed to change.  We were expected to play the same game we've been playing for centuries.  You marry that woman up.  That's your job.  Work.  Bring her money.  MRAs, not so much, but MGTOWs particularly.  No.  Now, I know there's different levels of MGTOW.  You know, some will still date.  Some are even married.  Whatever.  The point is, we see reality.  We don't have on the vagina-colored glasses anymore.  Kind of like vagina goggles, I guess you could say.  We see that women are just human beings.  They're not particularly special.  They're not particularly angel-like.  They're not saints.  They're just humans.  They're flawed, just like men are.  They may be flawed in different ways, but they're flawed.  And they expected society to allow them to do whatever the hell they wanted, and they have.  Earlier today, we talked about divorce laws crafted specifically in favor of women to rid them of any bad decisions they might make in their choice of husband.  MGTOWs know the game.  MRAs know it's not fair.  It's not equal.  It is heavily weighted on the side of women with the backing of the government.  This is not society.  This is law.  And it happens every day to thousands of men.  We see through this bullshit and say we do not want it.  Thank you very much.  I think I'll just do my own thing.  If I want to get some sex, I'll find that.  But I'm not signing up for a lifetime of that.  No.  And so now these propaganda pieces are coming out because a significant, if not huge, but a significant number of men are seeing the reality of the situation.  And some percentage of men are not going to play the game anymore.  At least until the game has changed, the rules change, and that's not going to happen.  So in some ways you could look at these types of articles as panic.  Holy shit.  These men are talking online.  They're exposing our secrets.  We can't let that happen.  What are we gonna do?  We're gonna call them terrorists and scare the living crap out of people who don't pay attention to this stuff like we do.  That's why you rarely see married men calling themselves MGTOW.  They've gotta go through the pain and the horror of the family court system, divorce and all that, before their eyes are opened.  What we're trying to do is open your eyes before you get involved.  It's just that simple.  So call us terrorists, evil, misogynist, toxic, whatever.  I guess in the view of a feminist, since we're saying things that they don't want people to know, I can see where they might think that.  James Maxwell, thank you for listening. ",
