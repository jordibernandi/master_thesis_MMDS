Avraham, A-V-R-A-H-A-M.  And your surname, please?  Yamini, Y-E-M-I-N-I.  Your date of birth, please?  17-10-85.  What's your purpose for being here?  I'm covering this.  You're outside of your 25K.  That's okay.  I'm working in the media.  Do you have your... A copy of my permit.  I don't have it on me now, to be honest.  Okay, you don't have your copy of your permit on you, so I'm going to ask you to leave.  You're outside of your 25K.  That's all right.  I'll get a copy now sent to you here.  I'm not going to move on.  With all due respect, this is my job.  This is what I'm paid for.  You're doing your job.  Nobody's hindering you from doing your job.  You know who I am very well.  We have a current case with Victoria Police in the Supreme Court.  the last couple of rallies, you've understood that, and we've worked really well together.  I'm not here to bother you guys from doing your job, but you're not going to move me on from doing my job.  I can give you a copy of my workers' permit.  I'll get that sent now here, and otherwise I will fill another one out here right now.  Otherwise, you can go ahead and issue whatever fine you want to issue while I'm doing my job with my Commonwealth press card, which is quite obvious what I'm doing here, working.  It's interesting, isn't it?  There's been zero cases for a week now, and they're trying to intimidate me to leave from doing my job because I forgot the piece of paper back at home, which is more than 25 Ks from here.  This is all because of coronavirus, coronavirus.  For your safety at home, right now, this is what's happening.  The funny thing is, every other protest in this state since Black Lives Matter have been met with brute force.  You saw Tuesday, pepper spray deployed on peaceful protests.  But today, for some reason, there's a big police presence and there are some protesters that set up a stand.  Suddenly, COVID is fine.  The problem is Avi Yamini is outside of his 25 kilometers.  We better jail him.  I think that's a good idea.  I need to fill out another work permit.  I forgot.  I forgot.  Oh, I've got an empty one for you.  Can you bring it?  Yeah.  Thank you.  And a pen.  Oh, God.  Guys, no matter what they think about Monica, she's actually all right.  They know who you are, though.  I know.  I know.  They're having a laugh.  Okay.  All right, here you go.  Keep filling.  There's a work permit.  Not a problem mate.  Remember, this is all to save us from the deadly virus.  So will you guys be pepper-spraying the climate change protesters today? ",
