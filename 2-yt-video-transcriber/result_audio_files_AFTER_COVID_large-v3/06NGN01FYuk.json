But today, he could go to jail for publishing government secrets because the Trump administration has issued the first indictment in history charging a publisher for publishing government secrets.  That publisher is WikiLeaks' former editor-in-chief, Julian Assange.  He now faces life in prison for leaks he published back in 2010 from whistleblower Private Manning that revealed war crimes and government lies.  The government says the information was too dangerous to publish, yet can't prove the publications led to a single instance of an individual being harmed.  Woodward's executive editor at the Washington Post, Martin Baron, says the indictment of Julian Assange is criminalizing journalism and undermines the very purpose of the First Amendment.  Pulitzer Prize winner James Risen told the Post, this is unlike anything we've seen before.  This is a serious threat to the future of the country because without a press that's free to shine light on government secrets. ",
