            "text": "Thank you for tuning in my swoops entertainment channel.  This is going to be my top 10 video on black serial killers.  Now in the future, I'm going to do a top 10 video on serial killers overall, whether it be women, men, white, black, but in this particular video, it's going to be on black serial killers specifically.  Now, the one person I'm not gonna have on my list is Wayne Williams.  Wayne Williams was convicted of killing 27 black boys in the early 1980s.  I don't believe he's guilty.  After looking at all the evidence, I believe he's innocent.  I don't believe he committed these murders after looking at all the evidence.  There's not a shred of evidence connecting him to these 27 murders, if you look at all the facts in the case.  but I'm gonna have other black serial killers on my top 10 list that have been confirmed killers where you have all the evidence proving their guilt.  And I want everybody to watch the video and give me your opinion on this topic.  Leave a comment, rate, and subscribe. ",
