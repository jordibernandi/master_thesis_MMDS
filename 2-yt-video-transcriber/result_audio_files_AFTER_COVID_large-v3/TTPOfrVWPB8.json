            "text": "I like doing this before we actually hear the thing.  Thanks for sending this in.  All right, y'all.  Election fraud debunking megathread.  I'm following the claims of fraud and looking into them.  I think I've solved most now.  Nothing is holding up under any scrutiny so far.  I'm trying to make a thread.  So please keep this all in one place.  Retweet it.  by far the most viral of these claims is the video of officials in Detroit pampering and boarding up the windows inside their polling center in Michigan.  this admittedly is a bizarre sight but it's 100% explainable and was the right thing to do.  officials rightly blocked the windows when crowds came inside and began trying to film ballots.  poll watchers exceeded the limit inside.  this is not legal you.  Here's the local story explaining it.  Similarly, there have been lots of stories of Republican poll watchers not being allowed into their polling places.  This is a silly and worth remembering Detroit story.  Being a poll watcher does not mean you can just walk into any polling station.  There's a process to ensure the number of partisan watchers are signed up like in Detroit.  And inside polling places, election officials do not and shouldn't allow any swarm of watchers into their polling place.  That would ruin the balance of the watchers.  It appears some certified Trump-supporting poll watchers filmed themselves trying to enter polling places and then were denied to make a scene.  This is how the system is supposed to work.  Any election official can explain this, assuming they're certified and still stupid.  Next, one of the most popular claims is a video purporting to show a 118-year-old named William Bradley who voted despite dying in 1984.  I'm going to share a video of a viral tweet so you can see it and explain what's happening.  Turns out 118-year-old William Bradley voted an absentee balance in Wayne County, Michigan.  William Bradley died in 1984.  How long has this been going on?  Try it for yourself.  Michigan's Secretary of State already responded to this claim, pointing out that the ballots of the voters who died were rejected outright, so this bizarre scene, even if it were real, would never count in a Michigan election.  Here is their official statement.  In Michigan, this is even true if someone dies between the time they sent in the ballot and the election day.  How much does that suck?  The idea that someone who died in 1984 would have their ballot counted is absurd.  Alternatively, it is possible that William Bradley is real and his birthday is simply wrong on the Michigan Voter website.  Instead of 1902, he could have been born in 1992, a one-digit typo.  This happens all the time.  A clerk will be checking the ballot and the registration records.  It's also true, as an election expert... pointed out that some states use 1900 or 111 as codes.  when they were moved from paper to electronic records to signify a birthday wasn't available.  Something like that could be at play here.  Regardless, if the person is dead, their vote does not count.  That's all there is to it.  And now let's watch Tim Pool. ",
