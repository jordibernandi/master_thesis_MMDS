Because of this, we can only be sure and certain that our own minds exist, which means we cannot in fact be certain that any other minds exist.  it could be quite possible that i am the only mind that exists a truly radical theory indeed.  i think it's worth looking at the history behind solipsism first and the steps that has led certain philosophers to take the solipsist standpoint.  sure it is fair to say that the roots of solipsism began in the 16th century with rene descartes.  In his meditations on the first philosophy, Descartes goes through a process of doubt.  Descartes reasons that he has often found himself in a dream that was indistinguishable from reality.  He was fully in a dream but had no idea and believed everything was real.  If it is possible for one's senses to deceive them sometimes, then it is possible for one's senses to deceive them all the time.  And so Descartes agreed that he could in fact be permanently in a dream world that does not physically exist. ",

During the meditations he reasons that God exists and that God cannot be a deceiver and so he rejects mass deception and accepts the existence of the material world and of other minds.  Now fast forward to the 17th century and we have the philosopher John Locke who made a distinction between primary and secondary qualities.  Locke believed that the things like shape, extension, size all existed in an external physical world.  These are primary qualities.  However, things like colour, taste and smell all exist in the mind.  These are secondary qualities and these are created by the powers of the primary qualities.  So effectively, half of reality solely belongs in the mind and not in the external world. ",

If you want to read over this debate and support the channel, please get yourself a copy.  It really is a great ebook, by the way.  We have the scripts to Locke's Primary and Secondary Qualities, Berkeley's Idealism and Hume's Skepticism.  Definitely worth a read.  The link will be in the description.  But that's all the time we have for now.  Thank you for watching.  We hope you enjoyed the vibe.  And what are your thoughts?  Are there any solipsists out there?  If there are, you're actually wrong as I am the only conscious mind there is.  But still, let us know in the comments below.  If you enjoyed the video, please like and share and make sure you subscribe for more philosophical debates.  Take care, until next time. ",
