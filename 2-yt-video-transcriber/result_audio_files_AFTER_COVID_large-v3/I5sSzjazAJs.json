As a church family right now, we are going to be prayerful and mindful about what we can do to bring honor and glory to Jesus on his birthday.  So as you're preparing an offering, whether online or in person, my father, Pastor Steve Muncy, is gonna take my sons and my niece in just a few moments and present our offering to the Lord at the manger.  So right now, there are multiple ways for you to give.  You can give online.  Like I said, you can give in person through an offering envelope.  Our hosts are in the aisleways.  If you need an offering envelope, just lift your hand, and we'll make sure that you have the opportunity to give your Christmas offering. ",

That's his son asking for money at the Christmas Eve service.  And I'm going to show you a little clip of Steve Muncy.  He's talking about 2021 and especially 2021 for those people that are giving to the church.  And what I want to show you is that the more things change, the more things stay the same.  I did a video on Steve back in the end of 2011, and he's talking about New Year's, which is a good topic to talk about right now, the day after Christmas.  And this is between 2011 and 2012.  So let's see where the emphasis lied almost 10 years ago. ",

There are seven seals and trumpets and seven parables in Matthew.  Jesus said seven statements on the cross.  Or how about 2010?  10 is the number, I suppose, of divine perfection.
