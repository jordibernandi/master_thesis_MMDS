            "text": "Well, here's another hymn.  Isaac Watts lived in the 17th century.  He wrote tons of hymns, some of which are known.  This one is largely unknown.  It begins as follows.  Do you not know, have you not heard, that firm remains on high the everlasting throne of him who formed the earth and sky?  Are you afraid his power shall fail when comes your evil day?  And can an all-creating arm grow weary or decay?  He gives the conquest to the weak, supports the fainting hearts, and courage in the evil hour.  his help from heaven imparts.  Mere human power shall fade and die, and youthful vigor cease, but those who wait upon the Lord in strength shall still increase.  Of course, grounded in the truth of the Bible, Watts writes poetically and I think wonderfully helpfully, especially as we face these uncertain days and turn our gaze to the God who knows us and made us and cares for us.  This is Alistair Begg for Truth For Life. ",
