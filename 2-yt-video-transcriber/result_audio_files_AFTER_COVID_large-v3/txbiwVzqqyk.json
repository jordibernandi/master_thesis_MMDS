Out of here!  No peace!  No peace!  Don't move.  Let's do our best.  Regardless of where you're from, what language and people spoke.  I don't want to miss it.  I mean, y'all know what we want, so I don't want to say anything.  It's clear enough.  It's clear enough.  Are you guys waiting for David Holt or somebody?  He obviously is not coming out.  He doesn't care about what we need or want, so we're not waiting for anyone at the moment.  Police department.  Of course.  Officer, would you like to hold my sign?  Family of color, you need to kneel!  There's a whole squad.  Yeah!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop doing stuff!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Hey, Peck, stay safe, man.  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  We're trying!  We're trying!  Stop!  Give us a second!  Give us a second!  Yo, yo, yo, yo!  Please don't do that!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  If you don't be out here, be out here for my car.  We don't fight.  If you're a black woman, you know that.  There are a lot of young people out here who this is their first time interacting with protests and situations of this sort.  However, they cannot agitate and invoke negativity by throwing things and getting your voice and being loud, that's fine.  But don't invoke them and throw things at them because at the end of the day, they're here to protect themselves and us.  But at the same time, we have to control ourselves.  I've been sitting here for the last two hours talking to these fucking cops and been getting solutions.  I've been here right here.  Hey, shut up.  So if you want to talk, talk about it.  Hands up.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot.  No justice!  No justice!  No justice!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  I just got shot by a B-man.  Y'all niggas got me.  We are peaceful protesters here in Oklahoma City.  They are tear-gassing us for no reason.  We did nothing wrong.  They just shot tear-gassers.  They just shot beanbags at citizens' protests.  This is the Oklahoma City Police doing nothing.  What was that for?  What was that for?  What was that for?  Yeah, get that shit!  You need water or milk, I'll have it back here.  No justice!  No peace!  No justice!  No peace!  I do not have an excuse.  Are you hit?  Am I hit?  No.  My grandmother's been hit.  People are innocent.  They're getting fucking hit.  Hey, watch out!  Hands up!  Don't shoot!  Hands up!  Don't shoot!  We love you! ",
