            "text": "We've done it, guys.  We've finally done it.  We have successfully ended racism.  By getting rid of that damn Aunt Jemima!  I woke up to this, by the way.  The Aunt Jemima brand... is being removed to make progress towards racial equality, they say.  That's what Quaker Oats said.  Unjamama is no longer a thing or will no longer be a thing going in the future because they wanted to.  And I don't know, somehow this works towards racial equality.  Getting rid of a very notable mascot, if you will.  Look, man, if it ain't no black lady on that damn syrup, I don't want it.  I'm just going to tell you like it is.  I don't even want it.  So whoever wants to... Jack the idea, by all means, go for it.  I'll consider purchasing it.  Because if it ain't no damn black woman on it, I like exclusively.  Put your mama syrup on whatever I'm eating, pancakes, wops or whatever.  If if if if it ain't no black lady on it, don't give it to me.  I don't want it.  I don't want it.  But I'm telling you, man, this goes to what I just said and was my last video that I just talked about this, right?  Yeah.  They're coming for everything.  No, it wasn't my last video, actually.  No, no, no.  Soto, I talked about, I guess, kind of ties into that when I was discussing what happened with Mike Gundy.  But they're coming for everything, man.  And it's funny because this just happens after I saw some video of some light-skinned.  How many times do I have to say it's always these light-skinned cats, man, that be like the most offended?  He's people that would have been passing for whites in the 20s, man.  Be irate about racism.  Think they just just try to do like over overcorrection, man.  If I see you from 15 feet out, man, I'm assuming you white, man.  You ain't got nothing to worry about.  But I saw some light skinned chick, man, griping about.  About syrup or people's calling people's moms or not.  No, she said something about not making racist pancakes or something.  I don't know.  It was some stupid like that.  But.  Here we are.  Here we are.  The next day after after I saw that.  They announced that.  It's racial stereotype, so we can't have happy black women.  And I don't even care about the etymology because I don't even know it.  I don't even care.  I don't care.  It's like I was going to make an analogy, too, but I ain't gonna make I ain't gonna make an analogy.  Look, man, I feel like I don't know anybody that I've ever been.  Obviously, I've been black my entire life.  OK.  It was Aunt Jemima and our household, every black household that I had been in, my family's, my mom's, grandma's, aunt's.  Everybody got Aunt Jemima.  That was where it was at, especially the buttery one.  They were showing the original one, but have y'all tried the one with extra butter or something?  Oh, man, I'm trying to tell you.  I'm trying to tell you, man.  Nah, I don't trust it because it ain't no black woman.  I just don't trust it.  I don't trust it.  I can't be trusted.  But they're coming for everything, guys.  They're going to go out of their way to be offended.  Now they know that they can do it.  Now they got some leverage.  Never let a crisis go to waste.  So once that George Floyd unfortunate murder was caught, after that, they realized that the corporate entities and so forth, they're coming for everything.  And because these corporations, now you guys are seeing, right, that they aren't... they're in the business of trying to look good at the end of the day.  most of them some of them just want to put out a good product.  um but it's funny how these leftists they don't realize no they realize they have to realize now they're all on their side right.  they've been lecturing guys like myself the libertarians all about corporations evil and racist and i can't turn on any damn video game.  i can't get on any website without seeing black lives.  and That's such a racial problem in this country where every single corporate entity is saying black lives matter.  Anyway.  But yeah, people are going to go out their way to get offended.  And that's just what's going to happen.  They're going to go out of their way to get offended.  And.  It's just going to continue to get more weird and more odd.  Here we are.  But if it ain't no damn black woman on that on that.  On that syrup.  I don't want it.  Simple as that.  If it ain't a black woman on the syrup.  I don't want it.  I don't trust it.  Anyway.  Apple.  iTunes.  The new single.  The Great Equalizer has finally went live.  So you can check that out.  Please go check it out.  Well, let's climb some charts.  Let's get to the real.  And man, it's going to be a good day today.  Probably by the end of the day, there's going to be someone else getting that got canceled or there was something else that got adjusted that nobody asked for.  And I'll do a video on it. ",
