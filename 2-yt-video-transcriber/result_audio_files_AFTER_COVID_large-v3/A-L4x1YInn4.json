I'm going to put this online and show how petty you guys are.  Hit my truck, ain't got license or nothing, and it's not my concern what you do with her.  You're not even going to tow the truck, you're going to let somebody come and get it.  But yet if it was me, you'd tow it.  I used to sit over there and schemed on how they could get me to quit recording.  This one cop failed to identify.  Hey, I already filed a complaint.  I know how to file complaints.  You don't want to give me your badge number.  I'll be filing a complaint on you, dude.  Mr.  Honest Cop.  I'm glad people's got cell phones and cameras now.  You guys can't get away with that dirty shit.  Make it up.  Yeah, I come out of the doctor's office.  His cop's going around my truck.  And I asked him what was he doing.  He didn't tell me my truck got hit until after we done got into it about him looking all over my truck.  Then he told me it got hit.  And then he act like he wasn't going to do nothing for me because I done got on him about looking around my truck.  So how's that work?  They're driving with no license.  You guys ain't going to tow her truck?  17 years old.  It don't concern me, but yet she hit my truck and it don't concern me.  That don't even make sense.  I'll be filing some more complaints.  And I will find out if I'm allowed to record here when the cops has got me hemmed up.  See, I was talking about how dirty you guys are.  You're out to get me now and my truck got hit, but yet you're out to get me.  You're wanting to give him a break, the people that hit my... No, it's going to be the opinion when people see this online and see how dirty Indianapolis cops are.  Oh boy, act like cops don't steal and... They steal, they do drugs, they plant drugs, they beat their wives.  Yep.  If I didn't, it wouldn't be on my license because I'd go down there and get it changed.  That's the law.  Look at them over there.  Dirty.  They're dirty tyrants.  They're tyrants.  My truck got hit and yet they're on me.  because I don't take their shit.  Because I don't worship them and think just because they got that badge there's something special.  Just because they wear a costume.  I can go buy a costume.  Don't tell me they ain't got insurance either.  So why wouldn't they tow that truck?  There's a driver driving it with no insurance, no license, underage, and yet they're not doing nothing to them.  And I ain't supposed to say nothing about it.  I'm supposed to just bow down and bootlick.  Not gonna happen.  I worked hard for that truck.  I saved money.  I did without them.  people just run into it.  And then the cops take up for them.  Can't even go to the doctor's office.  They tried to get me to quit recording.  How is that?  We don't want them to see how dirty we are.  Put the camera down.  That one still ain't identified himself.  I believe that's your policy to identify yourself.  Which one thing good about Indiana, it's easy as hell to file a complaint.  You just call this number, I got it logged in on my phone.  You call this number and they'll do it for you.  That's the only thing we got going for us here in Indiana, or Indianapolis.  I've had an in with these hit and run people before.  They hit my truck I had on camera, they didn't even want to see it.  Luckily this guy caught the guy, I will give him that.  Why?  Do they belong to you?  You think Power and Light's worried about this cable?  See how much of a tyrant he is?  He's a tyrant.  Trying to tell me not to grab onto this cable right here.  He's a tyrant, look at him.  I bet he's been doing dirty .  How long you been on the force?  How long you been doing dirty?  people that won't lick your boots?  I'm not a bootlicker.  Ain't gonna be.  Yeah, they're trying to hem me up.  My truck got hit and these are trying to hem me up.  Any little thing they're trying to get me on, ain't you?  Boy, you just wish it.  Look at this dude.  He's wanting to do something bad.  Thank God for cameras and cell phones.  Thank God.  Fat boy over there, he's a joke.  I wonder if he's going to identify himself.  He told me I had to get off Eskenazi property because I'm filming, but yet I'm filming the police in the course of their duty.  Matter of fact, I know from YouTube videos, I could go inside and film in the lobby.  How much you want to bet?  They do it every day, dude.  They do it at the V8.  It don't matter.  Ask him now if he's paid by tax dollars or not.  Is it tax funded, some of it?  These are just dirty tyrant cops.  They're gonna tell me I can't film out in the parking lot when legally I could go inside and film in the lobby.  They're just dirty.  They want me to put the phone down so they can do something.  Guarantee you.  Been through this before.  Yeah, it's all joke to them.  He tried to say cops.  Well, I'm a cop.  I wouldn't steal, really.  That's some of the thievinest bastards I've ever seen.  Lying.  They make a living out of lying.  Then they go to court and lie on people.  Judge lets them do it.  Prosecutors encourage it.  We'll get a conviction if you can throw a few lies out.  I know the system.  Who owns this guardrail?  I can't touch it either, can I?  That won't either.  Them wires will.  This cable that keeps the pole stable ain't going to do nothing.  You ain't worried about my safety anyway.  You probably wish it would electrocute me.  Then you get to see somebody else die.  He said he's seen a cop die and was torn.  I've seen people die.  It ain't nothing.  People die every f***ing day.  People dying today in the hospital, heart attack, whatever.  He acts like it's really something called the cop got killed.  Like I ain't never had anybody I work with die.  All them old lines they throw on people and normal people believe it.  Oh, you do got a dangerous job.  Yeah, 14th dangerous.  Oh, you are a hero.  Yeah, the nobody.  to some idiot that believes your lies.  What's odd, I recorded this cop earlier.  He didn't say nothing about me recording.  His buddy gets here, all of a sudden.  I can't record.  Which is to all be, I might have to send this with the complaint form.  You know, like I said, I come out and there's cops all over my truck.  I don't know what he's doing.  He didn't tell me what he was doing until later.  I think he's trying to plant drugs or something when I seen him.  I know how dirty they are.  It's how they treat citizens, though.  If you don't bow down, they try to get you.  I wish she could have been in court when I proved that cop was lying and that judge got all in his ass.  Told him she wanted to see him in her chambers after court was over.  He was in there lying like hell.  I proved he was lying like five times before she ever even went for it.  It was just one lie after another.  swearing it's the truth.  I got nothing to lie about.  I got nothing against this man, but yet he did it.  He lied and lied and lied.  Finally, the judge got tired of hearing his lies.  At this time, I can prove it.  Other times, I couldn't.  Your word don't mean nothing.  That's why you record.  Because a cop wears a costume, you're supposed to believe him.  You see I ain't going to identify?  Hey, I always see you guys speeding on the highway too.  How come you do that?  And then pull another person over for speeding.  I see it every time I'm on the highway.  Speeding all around town.  Ain't got lights on or nothing, but yet you want to pull somebody else over and give them a ticket.  You going to identify? ",
