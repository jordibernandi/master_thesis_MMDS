            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  We're gonna talk about the Battle of Armageddon.  With everything we see happening in the world today, some people are wondering, are we at the doors of Armageddon?  By the way, that statement about being at the doors of Armageddon comes from a little excerpt in history.  General Douglas MacArthur, when he was making his farewell speech, speaking of World War I and World War II that had just concluded and then they were in the midst of the Korean War, He said, we have had our last chance.  If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, Armageddon will be at our door.  And since that statement, everybody's understood that Armageddon meant World War III or some great battle between the U.S.  and China and Russia or Europe.  And it's a sobering thought when you consider in the news today that tensions between China and the U.S.  and part of the Western world has never been greater.  Matter of fact, in 2020, China has the largest active military force in the world with about 2.18 million soldiers.  But it's not all soldiers.  Some of what makes warfare successful these days is the technology.  And when it comes to sophistication and power of weapons, just consider this.  In 2020, the United States has spent more on national defense than China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil all combined.  Do not add up to the $732 billion that the United States spends on military equipment and soldiers.  And so I'd hate to think of what the world would look like if the U.S.  went to battle with China or any other country.  It certainly is the world's superpower, and I don't think even any other country will disagree with that.  But when we think about Armageddon, are we really thinking about a battle between earthly powers?  You know, Jesus said there will be wars and there's going to be rumors of war right until the end.  Now, let's start out by reading the verse about the Battle of Armageddon.  You find this only one time in the Bible, and it's in Revelation chapter 16.  I'll be reading verses 12 through 16.  Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates.  These are the seven last plagues.  The Battle of Armageddon is found in the sixth plague.  It says, And right in the midst of this passage, before it announces the battle of Armageddon, you have red letters in your Bible.  If you have a red letter edition, because the words of Jesus come in as an invitation.  Behold, I come as a thief.  So Christ comes right after this battle.  Behold, I come as a thief.  Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, lest they walk naked and they see his shame.  Then it goes on to say, and they gather them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.  So what is this battle of Armageddon?  Is it a battle between Russia and China or Israel and some other world power?  I remember one time that I went with a group of ministers from many different churches on a tour of Israel.  And at the various locations, different pastors would do a devotional.  And when we got to the Valley of Megiddo, the Hill of Megiddo overlooking the Jezreel Valley, one of the pastors said, yes, soon the armies of China and the armies of Russia will come against Israel.  And there'll be a great battle in this valley.  And the blood will be as deep as a horse's bridle.  And I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, no, that is not what Revelation is talking about.  For one thing.  You could not fit the Chinese army in that valley.  It's not that big.  Now, it is true that the word Armageddon does refer to the hill or the Mount of Megiddo.  And that is speaking of a battle in the last days.  Matter of fact, the word Armageddon, it means Korama.  It means the destruction of their army.  The Valley of Megiddo was a place of many battles in the Bible.  In the Bible, when you hear proper names, they're all symbolic.  So in the Bible, when it talks about Babylon, it's not saying that this former city that's been destroyed in Iraq is going to somehow conquer the world in the last days.  That's symbolic.  It's not talking about Egypt conquering the world in the last days when Egypt is mentioned in Revelation.  Egypt today is a very minuscule power.  It's talking about, but in the Bible, they were great powers and they represented the enemies of God's people.  And the Valley of Megiddo was a place in the Bible where there were numerous battles where it looked like God's people were going to be overcome, but God fought for them.  You have it happening in the story of Deborah and Barak when they fought.  against Sisera and their armies, and God fought for them, and they were victorious.  You have it happening during the time of Jehoshaphat.  God fought in a miraculous way for his people.  You have it happening during the time of Gideon.  Matter of fact, some scholars believe that there is a connection between the word Armageddon.  Again, it only appears one place in Hebrew literature, so we have to look around and do a little guesswork to find out what does that word mean.  When God spoke to Gideon, a matter of fact, that phrase of God speaking to Gideon, it says, And you find that in Judges 7, verse 7.  It says in the Hebrew tongue.  And it's talking about Gideon means feller of trees.  And you remember in the story of Gideon, which was fought in the Valley of Megiddo, you've got this threefold union of of the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east, and they come against God's people, and they are so outnumbered.  Gideon's got 300 soldiers against hundreds of thousands of enemy troops, and yet God gives them an amazing victory with a trumpet, symbol for the Word of God, and with pitchers, we are pitchers, where the lights are lamps, another symbol for the Word of God.  and these broken pictures have the light shining out of them and the trumpet blows and it says the sword of the Lord.  in Gideon, the sword, another symbol for the word of God.  God's people overcome through the word against these vastly massive outnumbering forces.  and he gives them the victory.  Now in Revelation, just like the story of Gideon, there's a threefold union of the beast, the dragon, and the false prophet.  And they all assail against God's people in the last days.  When you talk about the battle of Armageddon, just keep this in mind.  It's a battle spoken of in Revelation.  What is the war in Revelation?  Let's look at the verses.  Revelation 12, 17, the dragon goes to make war with the woman.  That's the battle of Armageddon.  It's a battle between the dragon and God's people in the last days.  You read in Revelation 17, verse 14, these will make war with the lamb.  This is a war that the beast, the dragon, and the false prophet make with the lamb.  That's Jesus.  And the lamb will overcome them.  for he is Lord of lords and king of kings, and those who are with him are called chosen and faithful.  His church, his people.  Look at Revelation 19, verse 11.  Now I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.  There again, you've got Christ coming.  It is a war between Christ and the devil to rescue his people.  Then you look in Revelation chapter 20.  Verse seven, I'll read through verse nine.  Now, when the thousand years have expired, Satan is released from his prison and he'll go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle.  the number... Battle, right there, you've got it again.  By the way, this is taking place at the end of the 1,000 years.  So the battle of Armageddon technically begins just before the second coming and... and it ends just before the last judgment when Satan launches his final desperate attack on the New Jerusalem, the city of God.  It says, they gather them to battle.  The number is like the sand of the sea.  Gog and Magog represent the enemies of God's people.  You can find them mentioned in Genesis chapter 10.  They're just the ancient enemies of God's people.  So in the last days, it's telling us that this is a battle between those who serve God and those who serve satan those who have the seal of god and those who have the mark of the beast.  you can read something interesting in the seventh bible commentary page 982. listen to this.  the two great opposing powers are revealed in the last great battle.  on one side stands the creator of heaven and earth.  All on his side bear his signet.  They are obedient to his commands.  On the other side stands the prince of darkness with those who have chosen apostasy and rebellion.  Battle of Armageddon is a battle between Christ and his followers with the devil and his followers.  But it also says in this battle, there's a threefold power.  You notice in the battle of Gideon, it was the threefold power of the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the people of the east.  In the last days, it's the beast, the dragon, and the false prophet.  Who do they represent?  The beast is the papacy.  You find that outlined very clearly in Revelation.  And all of the Protestant reformers were united on that one point, that that beast, that little horn that you find in Daniel, that beast that persecutes God's power.  during the 1,600 years, years of the dark ages there was the papacy.  The dragon is, the dragon technically is another beast also, but it's working through, you get those 10 kings.  It's talking about these pagan kingdoms.  You've got the dragon manipulating the kingdom of Rome.  You see in the Old Testament, The dragon is manipulating the kingdom of Persia.  It's manipulating the kingdom of Babylon.  The dragon is working through all these different empires to persecute God's people.  So in the last days, it's the dragon working through those ten heads, which represent the ten kings that ally with that apostate woman, which is Rome, the papacy.  And then you've got the false prophet.  Well, the  U.S.,  which is this other beast.  in Revelation chapter 13, it arises, starts out light with two horns like a lamb, but it speaks like a dragon.  This second beast begins like a lamb, two horns like a lamb, but it speaks like a dragon.  And it is the false prophet of apostate Protestantism, sometimes also manifesting itself with the spiritualism of the charismatic movement, claiming false miracles.  This threefold union is going to work together in the last days to fight against God's people.  You can also read in that great book, The Great Controversy, The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their hands across the Gulf to clasp the hand of spiritualism.  They will reach over the abyss to clasp the hands of the Roman power.  And under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome, trampling on the rights of conscience.  And then it says from the beast, the dragon, the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs come out of their mouth.  And what do they do?  You know, why a frog?  What's a frog represent?  Well, a few things.  A frog is a symbol of loud, empty, repetitive complaining.  You ever camp by a lake where the frogs are ribbiting from the muck?  And so it's going to be the false prophecy.  A frog has its origin in the mud.  A frog is an unclean animal.  A frog swells itself.  It can blow up its cheeks and it can swell itself.  It's a symbol of pride.  Frogs are slippery.  They're unclean.  They've got big mouths and their power is in their tongue.  And you know, one of the most poisonous animals in the world is a frog.  It is the poison dart frog there in Central America.  and South America.  And so it's representing this poison, deadly message in the tongue of the frog, this unclean message that is going to destroy the world.  Now, why does it say to gather the kings together?  It's talking about a battle.  You look in the last chapters of 1 Samuel, you'll see that King Saul, all the Philistines gathered against God's people and And many of God's people were being deceived by a bad king back then, King Saul.  And King Saul consulted with a witch and that witch brought up this apparition of Samuel the prophet that deceived him and they were destroyed.  The Israelites were defeated in that battle because they listened to a false prophet.  and speaking of these unclean spirits.  And so the Witch of Endor is a symbol of that.  And so in the last days, through spiritualism, speaking to the world leaders, you'd be surprised, friends, everybody from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan to Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were consulting spiritualists and astrologers, getting information, and it happens in Europe as well.  And you'd be surprised in the last days, some of these world leaders, I think, are gonna turn to spiritualism to get information and they're going to be misled and they'll be great destruction on the side of the beast power.  So what is it that we do then to prepare for the battle of Armageddon?  Do we store away food and stockpile ammunition for this final battle?  No friends, we need to be storing the word of God in our hearts.  We need to be having the Holy Spirit in our minds.  so that we can prepare for that final conflict.  It's about a relationship with Jesus.  Remember what it says right in the middle of this passage about the battle of Armageddon.  Behold, Christ is speaking.  I am coming as a thief.  Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, lest they walk naked and they see his shame.  It's about maintaining your relationship with Jesus, living a life of righteousness and holiness and faith and trust in him.  So why is discussing the Battle of Armageddon relevant right now?  Well, friends, with everything happening in the world today, through fear and through economic problems, I could really see these powers of the beast, the dragon, and the false prophet coming together to try to form an alliance to save the world.
