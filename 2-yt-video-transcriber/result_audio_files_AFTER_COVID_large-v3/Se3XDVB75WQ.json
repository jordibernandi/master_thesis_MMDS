            "text": "Hello everyone.  So I'm here with Bob Marley.  I'm just kidding.  This is Sunny.  And I want to show Sunny this Chinese dating show episode.  This is Chinese Couples Therapy.  And I just thought this would be a good episode to analyze together.  The story is pretty simple.  So basically this is the girl.  She's 33.  And she's been kind of dating, putting a lot of time into this guy.  This guy, by the way, looks a lot like a friend I had in college.  He's 22.  So 33-year-old put a lot of time into a 22-year-old.  He is not feeling her, and he wants to break up with her.  He even at first, in the beginning of the episode, he didn't even admit that they were dating.  He was like, you're just a sister to me.  Like, you're just an older sister to me.  And then eventually they keep pressing him.  He's like, okay, fine.  We were dating, but I'm just not in love with her.  Yeah, it's kind of funny, like, hearing their story.  That's why you heard me earlier laughing.  Basically, to summarize, she's already put in 200,000 Chinese RMB.  So, like, that's about... wow dollars into him and um.  but then one of his excuses for not feeling her is that like one time she got jealous and then she took a knife and like cut up a cucumber and put it in his bed.  it's like if you ever make me jealous or you ever betray me i'm gonna do this to you.  So that was one incident And then the second incident.  one time she came to try to find him and she forgot which door he was at.  So imagine our apartment complex.  She went to every door and knocked to try to find him.  So that's what I wanted to bring you on because, like, on one hand, she did spend a lot of money on him, but that doesn't justify this kind of crazy behavior. ",

But like you said, Sonny, my thought about this is exactly how a lot of guys do the same to a woman.  Like they'll spend so much money, spend so much time.  And it's interesting, refreshing to see it.  The opposite way.  It's like you're seeing the opposite of it happen here. ",

And then whatever the case was, you know, afterwards is like, oh, like I see her with another guy and it makes me think.  you know malicious thoughts and you're just like what is happening to me.  so i get it because on a small scale i've been there before.  so i can only imagine like you know um people going the extreme.

So the guy's thinking of it like that.  And one of the panelists.  So at the end of the show episode, what happens is the panelists kind of like give them some advice.  And this lady was saying she was like, you could say talk like that.  But ultimately, love's not about that.  Love's about like, you know, love.  Right.  It's about your heart and all that.  So like if you really want to break up with her, you just have to tell her, sorry, I don't feel you.  I don't love you anymore.  You can't just like, yeah, you know, you.  You just care about the money.  I'll give you back the money. ",

It just may not be to your liking, but overall, like the yin and yang of it.  Is is is a full package, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, he's right, man.  And it's impressive for him to be like, I'll give you your money back in interest.  I was like, yeah, most guys won't even do that just by him saying that.

And it seems like some of the panelists were kind of... critiquing this woman for being a little bit controlling too.  So I think that's another thing.  if you date someone who's at least 10 years older, I think they tend to be a little bit more controlling.  So I had a roommate in 2015, he was 35, he got into a relationship with a 45-year-old woman.  And eventually he had to break up with her too because she just got so controlling.  It was good initially, right?  She knew how to cook.  Let him do a lot of sexual acts.  maybe younger women wouldn't let him do.  So he was enjoying it.  But then eventually she just used that almost like bait him in.  And then it's like wouldn't give him the freedom, wouldn't give him the space of being a human or being a man.  To her, it was like the boy toy, kind of like probably how that woman treated you. ",

Like a guy spending a lot of time or money or stuff on a woman and the woman can't acknowledge that... yeah we were kind of in a relationship.  so if there's one thing you learn about this people communication communication and try try to empathize.  i know it's hard but try to empathize like sometimes it's good like um you know he gave another perspective and i'm empathizing with his perspective and stuff like that.  so yeah neutral yeah exactly So, this is the Chinese couples therapy show.  It's called In Protection of Love.  And this looks like a pretty old episode.  This is from 2012.  A 2012 episode.  April 2012 episode.  If you guys like Sunny, I'm sure you guys do, we're going to bring him back.  We can analyze more of this stuff.  so guys let me know if you like this way because I didn't really kind of watch it with you guys and kind of like react to it.  instead I summarized it and then you guys can watch it yourself just because I'm so tired of trying to fight fair use battles And so if I even decide to put a little bit of the clip in here, I don't even know if I will.  But if you guys like this way, where it's just us analyzing, you guys can take the analysis and then watch the episode yourselves.  Let us know.  I know some of you don't speak Chinese, so you need the translation.  slash my dubbing.  But if you want that, let us know too.  Either way, this was an analysis episode of In Protection of Love, the Chinese couple therapy show.  And this is Jerry and Sonny.  Leave a comment guys. ",
