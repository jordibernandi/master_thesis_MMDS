            "text": "So given the fact that there's probably more chance of this little finger winning the men's 4x400m relay at the next Olympics than there is of Nathan Thompson or Flat Earth Millionaire actually explaining what the second law of thermodynamics is, I thought I'd challenge myself to see if I can explain inside 30 seconds a little bit about thermodynamics, entropy and how our atmosphere is involved in that.  Absolutely can't wait.  Start the clock.  The second law of thermodynamics says that in a closed system, when energy changes occur, entropy must increase.  And at a very basic level, what that means is the energy just gets spread out a little bit more.  Now, the Earth isn't a closed system, but still, let's crack on anyway.  Here's the sun.  When energy from the sun is absorbed by Earth, it is re-emitted, but it's re-emitted as a higher number of lower energy photons.  So therefore the energy is being spread out, entropy is increasing.  And this process repeats itself as energy travels through the atmosphere from one layer to the next, absorbing and then re-emitting the energy as a high number of photons.  By the time the gas particles get to what we would call the edge of space, they have done so much work against gravity and radiated off so much heat that they don't have any energy left to cause any sort of significant pressure.  Amazing.  Thank you.  So, what that means is, as we all knew anyway, there is no high pressure next to the vacuum of space.  It is a gradient that fades off to zero and that in no way, shape or form contradicts anything to do with thermodynamics or entropy.  Give us a second.  Hello? ",

I think you missed the word pressure.  See what I mean?  Then this is a good one.  The put a vacuum doesn't suck or have pressure.  That's why a space, not space, that's why a space is 10 to the negative 17th torsion.  If it's actually nothing, they should just say it's zero.  See what I mean?  I'm like, I'm putting words together, but screw the order, that doesn't matter.  This next bit's good too.  Even the strength from one tour, what kind of tour is that?  And atmospheric pressure will crush a rail car, right?  So that will crush a rail car, but that isn't strong because you can crush a rail card just by looking at it.

You are either A, so scientifically illiterate and academically weak that you just can't understand that there is no high pressure next to a vacuum of space and it is in fact a pressure gradient that fades off to zero.
