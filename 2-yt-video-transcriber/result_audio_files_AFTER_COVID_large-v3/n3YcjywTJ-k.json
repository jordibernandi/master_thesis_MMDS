            "text": "Homeboy comes by in his car and say, hey, man, get in.  Let's go somewhere.  Go somewhere and do what?  Remember what I said earlier.  All problems are solved through the process of questions and answers.  So you ask that question.  Go somewhere.  And do what?  Well, you know, we're just chilling, man.  OK, it's six of you all in a car.  Four of you got guns.  You want me to get in the car?  to go somewhere and chill.  Well, this, fellas, your buddy's a man, does not look like it may have a constructive result.  This looks like some type of recipe for everybody, meaning basically us, all of us, feeling sorry for what's going to happen if I go somewhere in this car with you.  So, I tell you what, we're still buddies, but call me tomorrow.  after all this is over, if you all are still around.  I'll see you.  Now, they will argue.  They will say, oh, man, I mean, you're too square, you're too uptight, you this, that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  I have to have a prescription.  that sounds like it's going to be constructive, fellas.  It has to at least sound like it's going to be constructive.  It doesn't sound like it's going to, you know.  be anything constructive.  It sounds like something I might be sorry about, and I won't have nobody to talk to about being sorry, you know?  And if I do talk to you all about it, being sorry, I mean, you all will be in a sorry situation, I think.  I don't think you're going to be in a real happy situation.  So, you know, I'll talk to you later.  You know, it's not that I'm breaking off with you or anything like that.  I'll just talk to you later.  Now, The reason I say all of this and I laid out that type of scenario, I've seen that happen.  I've seen somebody actually do that.  And the person that didn't go was the person that all the rest of the people who was in that car were trying to get in contact with after everything that happened happened.  Trying to get that one person that didn't go to come and help them.  Why?  Because that's the person that didn't go and got involved in the mess.  That's why.  See, it's one of the best things you can say when it looks like you're headed for trouble or people that you are around are headed for trouble.  You want to be able to say, I wasn't in that because I wasn't there.  That's one of the best things you can say on a stand in a court.  When you are asked, well, then what did you do?  And you say, I didn't do anything because I wasn't there.  I was not present.  At the scene of all those things that happened, I was not present.  Oh, then most likely the judge say, you weren't there.  You weren't present.  Say, no, your honor.  I was not present.  And the judge say, well, what are you doing in here?  Say, that's what I'd like to know, your honor.  Say, you're dismissed.  You weren't there.  Don't be where there's likely to be some non-constructive activity going on.  That's a part of the code.  Always be the person that leaves early before the mess begins.  Always.  That's code. ",
