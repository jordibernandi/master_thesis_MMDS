            "text": "so i've got maya here.  she was born on the 7th.  seven pounds seven ounces seven seven seven.  i love it but i want to talk to you guys just for a little bit okay.  so um while we were like in the birthing center there was a lot of women you know just having their babies and they were travailing.  and You know, I'm listening and I was so tempted to go live and start preaching about the sound, you know, and the atmosphere before you burn something in the spirit.  But I decided to talk about something else.  So I posted a video yesterday on YouTube of me just holding my beautiful, gorgeous baby.  And can you believe that?  And I'm not surprised by this, that a lot of people Not a lot of people, but like 20 people disliked it.  And I've always meant to do a sermon about this, right?  Because you have to realize And I didn't realize this when I was younger.  I used to think you could always win people over.  No matter what you do, there's always going to be somebody that criticizes.  There's always going to be somebody that can't receive it, that doesn't like it just because it's you.  And one of the biggest freedoms God gave me was not caring what people think.  And you got to realize that oftentimes the biggest critics come from the cheapest seats.  But the reason why I wanted to also talk about this is was think about that for a second.  I posted the video with the young lady.  Her father was a police officer and he died.  and people have no compassion.  And the Bible says this.  So we have to realize that there are people out there like this.  They have no compassion.  They have no love.  They don't mind being hateful.  They don't mind, you know, being spiteful and disgusting.  So as believers, we have to be liberated and kingdom and just know that God has our back.  You know, a lot of people making fun of Noah when he was building the ark.  So just know that people are not going to celebrate everything that you do.  People are not going to cheer you on.  People are going to hate.  That comes with the territory.  And if you can't handle it, you're never going to be able to go to the next level.  Because you can't even fight the enemy if you can't get over what people think.  You're never going to go into that next level of spiritual warfare if you can't get over what people think.  Because whatever God wants to elevate and take you to, whatever he wants to birth in you, whatever he wants to bless you with, You got to realize that the enemy, he's just not going to let you have it.  The enemy wants to abort what God is trying to birth inside of you.  And this baby right here is a result of intimacy.  Me and my wife.  OK, and so now we have this beautiful baby and it's the same thing with God.  OK, when you get intimate, you're going to birth something.  And so the enemy is going to do whatever he can to try to abort that.  Think about it as like the devil's birth control as well, but trying to prevent the pregnancy.  Some of us were on the devil's birth control.  We might not even realize it.  The birth control that we could take.  it might be bitterness, unforgiveness, worrying about what people think.  So we can't birth anything.  what God wants to birth because we're taking the devil's birth control.  And so we got to be free from that.  You got to be free from what people think.  You got to be free from your past.  You got to be free from that fear, that depression, the things that are keeping you bound.  And the way that you do that is by getting intimate into the presence of God.  And you're going to birth something beautiful.  Now it's going to come with some pains.  My wife has some pains.  And, you know, she was, man, she was tough, man.  She was, what was it, like 23, 24 hours?  28.  28 hours she was in labor and so realize that you have these beautiful moments with God where you're going to be intimate.  but when it comes time you know to give birth to that thing there's going to be some pain there's going to be some hurt there's going to be some people that don't support you don't like it don't cheer you on but you got to push through and she had to push through and that's not always easy but the end result absolutely beautiful absolutely gorgeous.  So you got to know that, all right?  Know that there's people in this world.  And that's why you got to be very careful about just flowing and moving with the ways of this world.  Because there are people in this world who are evil.  There are people in this world who will take advantage of you.  This is what the Bible says.  Acknowledge God in all your ways and he will direct your path.  In everything that you do, acknowledge every step that you take if you want to be blessed.  And realize that one of the biggest tricks of the enemy is to keep you in your feelings.  If I can distract you from the promise by getting you in your feelings, then you'll never get to the promised land because you're just so focused on your feelings instead of being focused on what God has called you to do.  I just wanted to share that with you guys and just know that if you feel some kind of opposition, if you feel some things coming against you, the devil, he's not going to mess with people that are not a threat to him.  He's going to come after somebody who's a threat.  Like I said, you go to YouTube, you see everything that I post.  Somebody's going to dislike it.  You got to get used to it.  if you want to do something great in this life.  Don't let anybody... abort what God has put inside of you.  Don't let anybody steal your joy.  Don't let anybody steal your peace.  Don't let anybody steal your dream.  And the way you keep that thing birthing is just by pushing, pushing no matter what.  I'm pushed with praise, pushed with worship, pushed with hard work, pushed with being committed.  And I'm not going to let the devil uh interject just like they do with abortions.  i'm not gonna let him interject anything in my life that's gonna kill what god has put inside me.  i love you guys.  be blessed.  get another look.  she's chilling.  she loves daddy.  she loves the belly.  it's comfortable.  it's like a water bed.  i pray for my beautiful amazing gorgeous wife over there.  she gets some rest all right.
