            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  Today we're going to examine the book of Jonah and how it reveals Bible prophecy fulfilled.  It's an amazing mystery foretold in the biblical account of Jonah.  We are now using this here in Israel to witness to Jews and to Arabs to bring them into faith through the Holy Spirit that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  We are now going to examine the biblical account of the book of Jonah and see how it unfolds history exactly like the Bible says.  Let's begin with Jonah.  Around 7060 BC, Jonah became a prophet of God.  So the biblical account begins with God calling Jonah to deliver a message to the sinful city of Nineveh.  But Jonah, he doesn't want to preach to Nineveh.  So Jonah decides to run away from this calling.  And he goes in the exact opposite direction of where God wants him to go.  So Jonah gets on a boat with people he doesn't even know.  And he sails away, running away from God and running away from the calling.  You can't run away from God.  God will find you wherever you are.  If God has a calling on your life, it will come to pass.  So God sends a huge storm and the boat is about to sink.  And I'm paraphrasing this account in the book of Jonah.  The passengers that happened to be very superstitious realized that Jonah is the reason that this storm is happening.  So they asked Jonah, how can they be saved from this?  And Jonah says, if he sacrifices himself, and I'm paraphrasing, and is thrown overboard, that they will be saved.  So Jonah lets them throw him overboard, and Jonah then begins to embrace death.  But again, you cannot run away from God.  When God has a calling on your life, it will come to pass.  So out of nowhere, a big fish comes and swallows Jonah.  And Jonah is in the whale for three days.  After that, God makes the big fish, the whale, spit Jonah out.  And Jonah ends up on the land.  And at this point, Jonah agrees to deliver God's message.  to the city of Nineveh.  So Jonah approaches the city and this is the message Jonah gives to them.  Repent or your city will be destroyed in 40 days.  There is a biblical mystery parable hidden within this account.  He doesn't deliver a message.  He doesn't say anything.  That's all he tells them.  And what's really amazing is as soon as Jonah says this, all the people in the city, even the king, they immediately believe Jonah.  They really don't ask any questions.  This is a supernatural event.  They just stopped doing evil.  They even went on a fast, the Bible says.  and because they repented and listened to the message that jonah delivered from god's prophet because of this their city was not destroyed in 40 days because they repented.  now let's examine this and see how it all ties in and proves that yeshua jesus is the messiah.  yeshua is god.  the whole bible all the accounts in the bible Point to Messiah Yeshua, Jesus, who said it with his own mouth.  Tehillim Psalms 40, verse 7.  Then I said, Here I am.  I have come.  It is written about me in the scroll.  What is the scroll?  The scroll is the whole book from Genesis to Revelation.  And the word for scroll in Hebrew is Megillah, which means to reveal.  It's a revelation, a mystery.  In Yeshua, Jesus wanted those that he was speaking to to understand that during his ministry here on earth when he walked in the flesh.  John 1.14, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us.  In Hebrew, the word became flesh and tabernacled among us.  Not only is Yeshua within the account of Moses, Joseph, but he is also in the mystery of the book of Jonah.  When Yeshua, Jesus, was teaching the crowds, many believed in him.  But many also rejected him, especially the Jewish leaders, the Pharisees.  Many of the religious leaders demanded that Yeshua, Jesus, would do miracles and signs to prove who he was.  And Yeshua answers this to them in Matthew 12, verse 39 and 40.  He answered, A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.  For just as Jonah was three days in the sea monster's belly, so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.  And we know that Jesus, Messiah Yeshua, rose on the third day.  So basically what he's saying is, just as Jonah sacrificed himself and was willing to lay down his life and then spend three days in a big whale, in a big fish, I will sacrifice myself for the world and will be buried for three days.  And we know, according to the Hebrew text, and on the third day he rose.  And on the third day, just like God raised Jonah out of the fish, God will raise me out of the grave.  And he tells them that will be the greatest sign that they will ever see.  Praise Yeshua.  When he, on the third day, comes out as Jonah did.  Now we're going to start to get even deeper.  Because right here, Yeshua actually gives two huge clues about Jonah.  Number one, it reveals that Jonah is a prophetic parallel of Yeshua, Jesus.  Just as Jonah was in the big fish and the whale for three days, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days.  So we can see here that Jonah is a type or a parallel of Yeshua, Jesus.  That's clear.  And number two, that it involves a prophetic warning that involves numbers.  And remember I said that the account of Jonah, the story of Jonah, is all symbolic.  meaning the account happened, but the mystery of the numbers is symbolic.  And we've seen that very clearly with the three days parallel.  When we look at the story of Jonah, the account of Jonah with spiritual eyes, we can really see that Yeshua is all over the book of Jonah.  Remember how Jonah sacrificed his life To save the people on the boat from the storm?  That is an obvious foreshadow of what Yeshua, Jesus, would do for the world.  He would sacrifice himself once and for all.  And he would be in the heart of the earth for three days and then rise on the third day.  Just like Jonah was in the whale, in the big fish, for three days.  But notice what it says here.  in jonah chapter one verse fourteen.  then they cried out to the lord please lord do not let us die for taking this man's life.  do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you lord have done as you pleased.  that sounds very familiar.  just like they asked god to forgive them for killing an innocent man.  Jesus, Yeshua, asked the Father.  Luke 23, verse 34, Yeshua, Jesus said, Forgive them, for they know not what they do.  Crucifying an innocent man, just like the account in the story of Jonah.  It's a parallel.  Let's get even deeper.  When Jonah was in the whale's belly, the fish's belly, he prayed to God.  And notice what Jonah said in his prayer.  Jonah chapter 2 verse 2.  He said, Now this right here is amazing because we know that Jonah was in the belly of a whale for three days.  But here in this prayer, he says, he says he's on the earth in the realm of the dead.  So here we have a direct reference from Jonah himself that his three days in the whale is a parallel of someone being in the realm of the dead for three days.  And this is why Yeshua said, Jesus, for three days, I will be in the realm of the earth.  which is the realm of the dead.  There is a lot in the story, in the account of Jonah that parallels Yeshua, Jesus.  I just gave here a few examples.  What I want to focus on right now is the numerical sign in the book, in the account of the story of Jonah that provides solid historical evidence direct from the Bible proving that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  He died on the tree on the cross for our sins.  He rose on the third day, and by his blood, all who call on him and repent shall be saved and have eternal life.  Everything that I've showed until now was to lay a context and a foundation.  to what I'm going to show you right now.  So we can see that Jonah provides a numerical sequence of how long Yeshua would be in the heart of the realm of the dead.  Three days, we've seen that.  There is another great numerical prophecy in the account of Jonah.  Now that we understand that Jonah is all about Yeshua and the future, remember when Jonah finally agreed to go to Nineveh.  What was the message that Jonah gave them?  Repent, or in 40 days your city will be destroyed.  Well, this here is a parallel with what happened with Yeshua Jesus through an historical event.  when Yeshua, Jesus, was in a heated discussion with the Jewish leaders, the Pharisees, who were criticizing him and persecuting him.  Notice what he said.  in Luke chapter 11 verse 30.  For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.  So here he compares to how Jonah went to the Ninevites to how he is coming to them.  Let's have a look at Luke 11 verse 32 and look at what he says.  The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it.  For they repented at the preaching of Jonah.  And behold, something greater than Jonah is here.  So Yeshua, Jesus was telling them, just as Jonah went to preach to the city of Nineveh, Yeshua himself was sent to preach to a city as well.  If you remember the people that Jonah preached to, they listened to him.  And because they listened and repented, their city was saved.  But the people who Yeshua, Jesus preached to, rejected him.  and sent him to be crucified.  We know that this is all God's master plan, but it happened.  If Jesus, Yeshua, is a parallel of Jonah, that means that we should see in history something that happened to those who rejected Yeshua, Jesus.  And we know that that city is Jerusalem.  In Matthew 24, verses one to two, we read, Jesus, Yeshua, left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.  Do you see all these buildings, he asked?  I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another.  Every one will be thrown down.  Yeshua is God.  He knew that the people that He preached to, that He would call to repent, would reject Him.  And since he knows that he is a prophetic parallel of Jonah, he knew that if they rejected him, their city would be destroyed.  What Yeshua was saying, and I'm paraphrasing, repent, or the same thing that would have happened to Nineveh will happen to you.  But they didn't listen.  They rejected Yeshua as the Messiah.  Now, when Jonah was preaching to the Ninevites, he said to them that if they don't repent, their city will be destroyed in 40 days.  40 days, very, very important mystery.  40 in the book of Jonah represents the time until destruction would come to the city if they don't repent.  What we're going to see, as this is what the Bible sometimes describes as day to year prophecy.  Day to year prophecy is a parallel where the number of days that something that happened in the past relates to the number of years that something will happen in the future.  In Hebrew, it's called Shana Layom Nevoah, day-to-year prophecy.  Let's look at an example.  Ezekiel 4, verse 6.  I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.  And also in Numbers 14, verse 34.  For 40 years, one year for each of the 40 days, you explored the land.  You will suffer.  These are just a few examples, but all through Scripture, we see, especially with the number 40, that days can point to years.  Day-to-year prophecy.  And especially pointing to something that will happen in the future.  Yeshua, Jesus, went to preach to those in Jerusalem.  And unlike the people in the story of Jonah, They rejected Yeshua.  That means that we should see something that happened to the city of Jerusalem because they rejected Yeshua.  40 years after Yeshua was on the cross and rose from the dead, most scholars agree that Yeshua was crucified in 30  A.D.,  That is also the conclusion I reached after researching the Hebrew text.  One of the biggest events in history was the fall of Jerusalem by the Romans, when they came, threw down its walls, and annihilated the temple.  This is an historical, biblical fact.  And the date that Jerusalem was destroyed was 70 AD.  This is huge because this here is historical evidence that exactly 40 years after Yeshua was crucified in 30 AD, Jerusalem, their city, was destroyed in 70 AD, exactly 40 years.  Day to year prophecy.  Now, this is an eye-opener, and we're using it here in Israel to preach the gospel to those who don't believe in Yeshua.  And it's shaking the people here in Israel when they see it, because you cannot deny the historical fact, and you cannot deny the Word of God.  The book of Jonah foretold that, first of all, that God's messenger would be in the grave for three days.  And then it foretold that if people reject God's messenger, their city would be destroyed in 40 days.  Exactly what happened in the Bible.  Yeshua Jesus was crucified in 30  A.D.,  And exactly 40 years later, 70 AD, Jerusalem was destroyed.  It's so important that we study the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation in order to understand this.  The only way to understand the back of the book is to go to the front of the book.  The Bible didn't directly say that Jerusalem would be destroyed.  in 40 years.  The only way that someone can see this is by digging really deep in the Old Testament and most of all by the power of the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.  Because only the Holy Spirit can reveal the truth.  God is bringing these type of revelations to the forefront in these last days.  I don't set any dates.  Jesus said no one knows.  But there are biblical accounts in the Bible that show the fulfillment of prophecy.  And the book of Jonah is one of them.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Preach the gospel, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem, and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  Ah Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Great I Am, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
