When they're spoken over us by someone that has authority, like a parent, a coach, a mentor, they can determine our destiny.  And the reason some people aren't reaching their potential is they've never had the blessings spoken over them.  They've never had anyone declare what they can become, who God says they are, and how they have seeds of greatness. ",

On this day, January 3rd, 2021, it's going to be the authority of none other than Joel Osteen speaking words of blessing and reminding all of us that we have seeds of greatness on the inside.  It's interesting how themes or Bible passages keep recurring as I stumble across various videos, and such is the case with this one.  Joel begins with a passage we've just discussed in a recent video.  It's Isaiah 61. ",

These are Bildad's words, and he is telling Job to repent of the sin that must be there in Job's life, or these things wouldn't be happening to Job.  And in verse 5, he tells Job, if you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy, if you are pure in heart, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation.  And then he says to Job in verses 20 and 21, behold, God will not reject a blameless man, you know, one who isn't guilty, nor take the hand of evildoers.  He will fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouting.  Repentance is the context of Job chapter 8, not favor.  Now, back to a few more you's. ",

Instead of talking themselves out of it, they got in agreement.  Yes, we're the light of the world.  Yes, we're going to leave our mark.  We're going to impact our generation.  Jesus spoke the blessing.  He declared favor and influence, and because they agreed, they saw it come to pass.  They're still affecting us 2,000 years later. ",

They were more concerned about saving their own skin when it came to it.  Mark is most likely relating to what happened to himself when the Lord Jesus was arrested in Mark 14, 51 and 52.  We read there, and a young man followed him, that is Jesus, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body.  And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.  Now that doesn't sound like Mark was experiencing his best life now or much favor or influence, now does it?  We are only the light of the world and the salt of the earth to the extent that we Christians reflect the good and true light of Jesus the Christ.  Jesus said in John chapter 8, I am the light of the world.  Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.  This baloney that Joel spews out could only be swallowed and digested by consumer-oriented, entitled, self-centered Americans, mainly, who don't have a clue as to how rich they already are compared to the rest of the world and what true suffering is all about.  You know, I have a friend who used to work at the airport where I work.  His name's Michael.  And he became an ordained minister and felt the call to be a missionary in Russia, with which he has affinity because he comes from Russia.  And so he went to the hinterlands way up north to a city I don't know about, and I don't even know the name of.  But he's an aviator.  He's a great mechanic and also a pilot.  And they've been working, he and the people that, I think it's called the Slavic Gospel Association.  They've been working on two aircraft and one's a 182.  And he relates in a letter I just got from him that they finally got one of the aircraft flying.  And there is a town that's, I think he said, by boat, if the water isn't frozen, it takes about eight hours to get there.  If the rivers are frozen, it's about a six-hour drive over the ice.  that's quite dicey on a good day and freezing.  or it's a 30-minute flight with an airplane to this little tiny town.  And they went there just recently, he and two other missionaries, to a little town that has a church of about 10 people, including children.  And Michael went there and preached the gospel to these people living in this small town, barely eking out an existence.  and worshiping the Lord in this tiny little room with very uncomfortable chairs.  Friends, we in America are so blessed to have so much that we forget about the rest of the world, that we are not the 1%.  We're the one-tenth of 1% compared to the rest of the world.  Now, of course, there's a spectrum with all of us as to how much God has blessed us.  But, you know, for people to fill or even partially fill now with this COVID business and the arena that is now the Lakewood Church, to hear Joel say the same thing over and over and over again, it's just, it's shameful.  Friends, if this type of stuff still enthralls you at all, you're missing the point of Christianity completely.  Find a church where Jesus Christ and Him crucified for sinners, Him living a perfect life for you, where the gospel is proclaimed as something outside of yourself and something that you need.  For the forgiveness of sins and eternal life with God.  Find that church and you will find true riches and eternal life. ",
