            "text": "Hello there and Happy New Year!  You join me from an undisclosed location somewhere in Eastern Croatia.  It seems I'm still alive despite a last-ditch attempt by 2020 to kill me.  But more about that in a live stream I'm going to be doing shortly.  So 3pm Eastern, I'm going to be jumping on the live stream and talking all about that.  Because I have a lot to say about it and there's been a lot to process over what has been a very distressing and nerve-wracking 48 hours.  But I thought, what better way to start... 2021 than with a leak?  because while all this was happening while I was out running earthquakes I had a contact.  reach out to me a Bethel insider and they have let me know about a development that will soon become known to everyone.  basically the Bible teach book is being retired, replaced by a 256-page book that will contain 60 lessons.  Each lesson will obviously be training the person about a certain aspect of how to be a Jehovah's Witness or how to think like a Jehovah's Witness, but each lesson will have an accompanying video that the person studying needs to watch.  So please watch this video and then let's do the lesson.  And I can only think that has to backfire because presumably they're just going to dip into their old footage or maybe they'll keep changing and switching around which video it is that people ought to watch for a given lesson.  But of course what they don't know is that many of these videos are appalling if viewed from the perspective of someone who isn't already indoctrinated into the religion.  So if they're using these videos as an indoctrination tool for people coming into the religion... I can only think that's going to backfire, but hey, what do I know?  So that's one piece of news.  Another thing is that there will be apparently a series of live action videos produced about the life of Jesus based on the stories from the Gospels.  So yeah, not quite sure what that's going to look like, how that's going to work.  But apparently we're going to get someone playing a live action Messiah.  I wonder who got that privilege.  And they better be super tight when it comes to their spirituality because you do not want that person waking up and then turning around and slamming the organisation.  Anyway, this is information that's been passed to me, again, by a Bethel insider.  I have reason to believe it's genuine.  It's always possible that this has been misinformation and I can always take this video down if that proves to be the case.  But yes, if this turns out to be true, what a great way to start 2021 with a leak.  So yeah, that's all I had to share really.  Thank you to everyone who's been sending messages of support, messages of love and solidarity.  It really does mean a lot to all of us.  It's been a very stressful experience.  Again, we're still trying to figure out what's happened, but we're safe, and that's the main thing.  And I will see many of you, if not all of you, hopefully, for the live stream later, where I'll go into all that in more detail.  But that's all I have for you.  Don't forget to subscribe to the Lloyd Evans channel for more such videos, and as always, thank you for watching. ",
