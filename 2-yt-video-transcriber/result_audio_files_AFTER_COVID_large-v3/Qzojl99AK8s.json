            "text": "So in the Johnny Depp vs.  The Sun trial, we have seen A.H.  on the stand for two days, and she has given some interesting conflicting testimony.  In two instances, she flat out lies to the judge on the stand, and you can see it in the transcripts, and that's what we're going to be reviewing today.  Additionally, we're going to showcase how the entirety, and I mean the entirety of  A.H.'s  defense, it's predicated on a lie.  We're going to tear that whole sucker down.  So hey there, now before we get started, this is our second comic book, link is in the description, and we are three sales away from 2000.  This after the mainstream media locked us out because we cover things like this, you know, because due process makes you a bad guy.  That's okay though, we don't need them, we need you.  So if you want to check this out, Help Us Hit 2000, we definitely, definitely appreciate it.  So the first thing to understand about A.H.  and ultimately confront is that the entirety of her defense is predicated on a lie.  And that lie is that she had no control within the Johnny Depp family.  a h relationship.  here you can see her being cross-examined by miss laws.  again.  that's going to be a lawyer for johnny depp person.  answering is a h miss laws.  i'm going to ask you a few questions about your presentation of yourself in this case as having been controlled dominated in abuse for three and a half years.  What I'm going to suggest to you and give you the opportunity to deal with is the fact that you had the ultimate control in your relationship with Mr.  Depp.  Do you agree or not?  A.H.,  no, absolutely not.  You took the important decisions in that relationship.  No, I had very little decision power in that relationship.  Now, part of her statement is that Johnny Depp, he isolates her.  She's all alone in this.  And yet, when you look at the living situation by itself, she is surrounded by friends.  Here you see a discussion about the Eastern Columbia building, which was a group of penthouses.  We've already heard about that.  Were they not?  Yes.  And within that short time period, in fact, you moved in some friends and your sister into various times to live in those penthouses.  Isn't that right?  So they talk about different friends in here.  Raquel Pennington, for example, her best friend, moved into the lot.  Her husband, Josh Drew, moved in with her.  Her sister also moved into one of the places.  Now, all of these people, they are invited at  A.H.'s  request, and none of them actually pay rent.  so did any of them pay any rent?  no they did not and they were all either friends or related to you.  is that right?  they were all my friends.  it was you who invited them there.  pardon it was you who wanted them there was it not?  yes i love that they are there and none of them paid any rent.  no johnny would not let them.  Hmm.  Sounds like somebody living in seclusion, right?  Now, during this time of quote unquote isolation, A.H.  is also seeing multiple practitioners.  And one of those practitioners is David Kipper.  Now, David Kipper has a nurse.  Now, that nurse, Erin B., actually talks about A.H April 22, 2016, where A.H.  goes to Coachella and makes this statement here.  Clyde admits to illicit drug use during the trip and states she ingested mushrooms and MDA simultaneously.  while also consuming alcohol.  Client reported that her husband was not aware of male visitors nor her illicit drug use.  Hmm, male visitors and illicit use.  Interesting.  So A.H.  is asked, can I ask you, is that entry correct or has Aaron B. got any of that wrong?  A.H.  says, I do not think she had anything wrong.  Hmm.  Now that, that's confirming what went on, right?  Now again, to hammer that home, question, she did not get anything wrong this time.  Answer, it does not look like it.  So the judge asks, sorry, the entry is correct, is it?  Witness says, it looks like it's correct, yes.  Now, as you go forward with this, talking about what happened, again, you can see this stuff mentioned in here.  You have her saying, yeah, you know what?  Who were you taking this stuff with?  I don't recall who those male were there.  She's still alive.  not denying use of anything, not denying the males being there.  But, as the discussion about substances moves on, huh, now it's not taking them anymore.  She very rarely took stuff, but they were present.  I think both of those substances were in my home.  There were several people in my home for a small dinner party.  I remember that.  I do not remember who came over to join us.  I do not know if it was an actor or someone else who was high profile, but it did not mean I used both of those.  So, I didn't use both of those.  I do remember that they were both present.  I do feel at the time of my birthday, I particularly had quite a bad experience.  As you can imagine, I realized that my relationship was coming to an end, and that did not mix well with mushrooms and MDA, and I had an awful time and spent the rest of the time in a hotel room.  huh so i didn't take both of those.  maybe i took both of those but again there's nothing wrong with the note.  right now after a h thinks about how this looks for a moment the story changes up again.  i have no idea what i told aaron or what she understood.  But in looking at the date, I think it is fair to say I did not partake in both of those, so shortly after having such a terrible time.  Just a moment ago, you said that the note was correct.  Do we take it now that you would like to say that the note might not be correct, yes or no?  With reference to particular detail, yes.  I do not know if that is correct.  So, Aaron B. made a mistake in that regard.  Yes, it seems to be.  But everything else, it's correct.  So, I did it.  I didn't do it.  Maybe I did do it.  It's all correct.  It's not.  Hmm.  Lie.  Flagrant lie.  Now, not only is Aaron B. a liar, but also the bodyguard that is assigned to A.H.  during that time is also quote-unquote.  wrong about what they saw.  Here, Starling Jenkins is mentioned.  Moving on to drinking.  Just for a moment, sticking with Coachella in 2016, was Starling Jenkins lying when he saw you vomiting in a parking lot?  He was mistaken.  He was mistaken.  Yes, I think he got my sister and I mixed up.  We were wearing very similar outfits.  She was pregnant at the time.  Hence the request for ginger ale and crackers and such.  Whitney was vomiting.  I suggest he knew full well the difference between the two of you, and it was you that was vomiting.  I've never vomited in a parking lot in all my life.  Now you see Aaron B. brought up in this association as well.  do you remember saying that to aaron b that you had vomited over the weekend?  i remember telling her i felt awful and remember you know the judge cuts in and says you remember telling her that you felt awful.  i did feel awful not a good time with those substances.  I remember saying that, well, we were all talking about my sister, also who has morning sickness or stomach sickness.  She was pregnant at the time.  Whitney was pregnant at the time, you say?  Yes, my lord, yes.  Now, ignoring the foundation for the entirety of the case for a moment, you know that she's isolated, and yet she's partying with her friends at Coachella without Johnny Depp.  You see, this is Erin B's entry on that statement.  Client admits to illicit drug use during the trip.  She states she ingested mushrooms and MDA.  Reminded client illicit drug use will not be tolerated.  So this goes on to add into not only tolerated there, but you can see this farther down that she was also high for at least 24 hours straight.  Erin B is quoting her own words.  AH says, I did tell her I felt like vomiting.  I said I felt like vomiting.  I was not high for 24 hours.  I laid in bed for 24 hours feeling the effects of that horrible decision to take both of those while also going through a breakup.  So again, she's taken substances.  But other people are wrong, you know, because I did, I didn't.  You see the problem here.  Bold-faced lying.  Lying to the judge about what transpired and saying people, multiple people, are wrong about this.  They all were wrong about the deed.  Now on top of that, our isolated friend here tells us that they have a personal friend that they're always around, Samantha McMillan, who is in fact not their employee, but they admit.  also that they're their employee.  they admit lying to homeland security.  you can see them bring up this conversation in here.  i am writing a letter.  this is to homeland security in response to a fraudulent report made against my english friend savannah mcmillan.  savannah was eighteen at the time.  is that right?  that sounds about right.  you were ten years older.  that sounds about right.  so later we hear a little bit more about savannah mcmillan.  do we take it from that?  you were trying to say that she never worked for you unlawfully.  she never unlawfully worked for me.  It is just that you have referred to her several times as your friend rather than your sometimes employee, have you not?  I never employed her directly.  She was employed through a production company.  But you have never said that she had sometimes worked.  She did not work for me unlawfully.  Forget that for a moment.  Who paid her?  Sometimes she's your assistant.  They are working, are they not?  She was employed through a production company abroad.  To do what?  As a PA.  To do what?  To work for you.  She worked for the production company.  To do what?  Assist.  Who?  Me.  Personally.  Thank you.  I mean on set.  Now the friend part alone train wrecks the narrative that she's cut off and isolated, but it goes further talking about her because she wasn't just a friend.  Here, answer.  Yes, she was an intern at times and a companion at friends.  Who was she an intern with?  Me.  Hmm.  What's an intern?  Oh, that's somebody that works with you.  Then you have Kate James mailing back and forth with Miss Slim, a.k.a.  H.A.H.  And they're talking about payments to that quote.  unquote friend.  that doesn't work for her.  Hey there.  Hey there.  Hope you had a good flight.  And it's beautiful on the island.  Savannah just asked me to write a check for her pay.  Just checking in to see if you want me to do that.  And if so, how much?  Did you receive that email?  I believe so.  And did you reply?  Yes, please.  $1,300.  Yes, I did.  Sorry.  Yes, I did.  So they're paying her here.  Hmm, but she doesn't work for her, right?  Now later, Aaron B. comes back into the mix, talking about this, where we have an admission that Savannah, she actually was an assistant.  So Aaron visited Klein at her home in downtown.  L.A.  Klein is visiting with assistant Savannah and friends Rocky and Josh.  Is that an accurate note of Aaron B.?  of what you would have told her.  There's an argument about the accuracy of dynamics within those words, but is that an accurate record of what you said?  Yes, she was at times my assistant.  Now this, it becomes an argument about when she was an assistant.  She was an off and on my assistant.  when I worked outside of the U.S.  She worked as my assistant.  She was at the time when you were saying you were traveling to New York, your assistant.  No, she was not my assistant in the U.S.  She was my friend and my companion.  You know, when I'm cut off from everybody because I'm under Johnny Depp's thumb.  This goes on.  So she did not work on a film with you called Magic Mike.  No, she traveled with me.  she did not work with you as your assistant when you were filming the adderall diaries.  no she traveled with me.  she helped me out.  you are working long hours.  you need someone to.  it is helpful to have someone help you get the groceries when you do not have time in your long hours or prepare the home or help you find a rental or whatever.  was savannah mcmillan ever paid by you when you were in the united states?  No, not when I was in the United States.  I did loan her money when she was in the United States.  I gave her money for expenses.  Hmm.  It was just a complete lie.  Is it not to suggest that she was not working for you in the  U.S.?  She was.  Was she not?  No, ma'am.  Thank you.  She wasn't working for me.  She would just go fetch my groceries, set up my house, find my rentals, travel with me, and I would loan her money that no one would ever pay back.  You know, because I was cut off and isolated, but I had jobs, I had friends, I was surrounded by them, I saw practitioners, and on and on and on.  You can see two distinct lies told to the judge in here.  In this, you can see not only that, but you can see the foundation of the entirety of the case undermined, and we haven't even gotten to the good bitch yet.  We'll do that in another video.  But anyway, you tell me what you think about this.  In closing, I first want to mention the comic book, and I want to thank everybody that made such a stellar campaign.  It's in demand right now, meaning we're working on it, and while it's in process, you can still pick it up, and we're two sales now away from 2,000.  That number, it can roll beyond, but that is an industry standard.  And isn't that interesting that the industry, they bad guy us.  But again, you don't need the industry.  You need people like yourself.  So thank you for being here.  That's something I want to say too.  Thank you for being here thank you for making these endeavors possible.  not enough people remember to thank you.  in that too you make this stuff work.  so thank you.  i do appreciate you sincerely and until next time we do this buckle up because this stuff it is just going to get crazier as we go forward.
