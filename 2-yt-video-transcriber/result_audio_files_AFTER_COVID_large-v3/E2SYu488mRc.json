It's almost unprecedented in all of weather history.  Let me show you an article about this.  California viral fire tornado has scientists searching for answers.  Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California, had spawned the equivalent of an EF3 tornado on July 26.  And for good reason.  Fire tornadoes are among the rarest weather phenomena on Earth.  And this vortex had the added distinction of possibly being the strongest tornado-like thing in California history.  Now, I've lived my whole life in the Midwest of the United States, and I've had to deal with tornadoes, and they are terrifying.  Any size tornado is terrifying.  An EF3 is very severe.  It does incredible damage.  But that's not what happened in Reading.  It was an EF3 tornado combined with up to 2,700 degrees of fire.  This was truly horrifying. ",

So I wanted you to know that we are looking forward to you coming and we're looking forward to you being safe while you're with us.  It's going to be an unusual year, a little smaller than usual because COVID.  I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's kind of making a mess out of things.  But our class size is going to be a little smaller than usual.  We are treating that as a positive because we're going to be able to have an intimacy in our classes that we haven't had in years and years and years.  So that's going to be a real plus.  In the weeks ahead, we'll be giving you some instructions about what we expect for you coming.  The priority, of course, is safety for you, safety for our staff, and then safety for our city.  We are going to be doing social distancing, which, you know, six to ten feet or so.  We're going to be wearing face masks most of the time in class.  I prefer the paper.  I cheekily start calling everybody doctor now and we all feel like that's great.  I also have this more fashionista one that I wear from time to time for dress up events.  Again, we'll be doing all these precautions with social distancing and wearing our face masks and just keeping each other safe from the transmission of disease and then just sending an overall message that we're taking care of one another in this environment.  So if you come, we're going to be using lots of the precautions that the county's been asking of us.  We're just going to be doing them as well as a student body.  So if you have significant health issues like, I don't know, having a positive COVID test or being sick, get on the plane, get better and come here when you get a chance, when you're feeling healthy and strong.

We've got.  we are learning to pivot and pivot and pivot again.  It's like an NBA basketball game happening here or like fabulous ballet, whichever metaphor works for you.  We're constantly kind of trying to move to adapt to what's happening to keep everybody safe.  So we're staying on top of regulations.  And so, again, just in reiterating, your safety is absolutely important, as is ours, the safety of our city.  And all to this end of God being glorified by your life as a revivalist and all that you're going to learn, all that you're going to deposit because you're carrying something we need in this environment as well.  So look forward to seeing you checking my watch, my fake watch, in just a couple of weeks, really.  Maybe a month or so.  It depends on it.  But you're coming.  We're going to have a great time together.  I look forward to it.  I'll see you then. ",
