            "text": "Welcome back, you're here with Dr.  Goldberg, and today we have to deal with a matter of some importance.  Before we get into the bulk of the video, I just wanted to highlight this comment by a self-described PUA life coach, you know, astonishing icon of existence.  And I took the liberty of blotting out the name because, as you know, POAs always talk about being masculine and being in control of your emotions and maintaining frame, which is why if they get referenced, they throw a tantrum.  And I don't want to hurt his feelings.  We'll just respond to this.  Any man has the capacity to get himself to at least a seven in attraction.  Do the work, brah.  What else can we say, my friends?  I sense it too.  So, let's stop and consider that.  Obviously, if everyone were to do the work, and we were all sevens, that wouldn't mean much.  If everyone's super, no one will be.  But, okay, not everyone's going to do the work.  However, that does not detract from the reality of your appearance, your height, affecting the way you're being perceived.  So, sure, building up muscles, dressing better, working on your social skills, taking a shower, it's not going to hurt you, it can be beneficial.  But if you're falling short of that, well, it's good that you have done all this work, but it doesn't fundamentally change the reality.  These PUAs seem to believe, it's like the Disney thing, everyone special in their own way, or this thing right here.  That's about the way you have to perceive all the snake oil salesmen and what they try to peddle.  Because, hell, it was just recently on Tinder, I saw this chick, her height, 5'4\", which is not that tall for a woman.  And she said minimum 5'10\", preferably over 6 feet.  Women are very clear-cut on this.  And trying to pretend that it doesn't matter because I need customers is really just dishonesty.  Plain and simple.  Hell, there was a girl on MD's stream last Saturday, and she rated Jeremy frickin' Meeks.  She rated him a 7 out of 10.  Most women, when they saw the mugshot, they were like, oh yeah, he's really hot.  But even that, that's pretty harsh.  7 out of 10. regardless of what your personal opinion might be.  So you really think that by working out and combing your hair, you're going to get up to being a seven?  You're delusional.  At best, if a really short guy puts on a ton of muscles, he's just going to become one of those short man complex dudes who's constantly trying to pick fights and then he goes hog hunting for a girlfriend, which if that's what he wants, good for him.  But the idea that you're going to be this winner with women is kind of laughable.  Now, I suppose if he finds a girl who's much shorter than his own height, perhaps he'd be lucky.  That traditional feminine type, who was the daughter of Elrond?  She was in the Star Wars movie.  I think Daisy Ridley's the name.  Fairly feminine and attractive.  I think this is a picture.  Yeah, that's correct.  So, if he does not get that, realistically, what's he going to end up with?  Well, we can just take a look right here.  It's a please.  facts, you know, you can end up with a bigger girl.  But even the bigger girls, their standards have gone up because of the state of the romantic dating market and, you know, sexual preferences.  So we have to be very realistic on this.  And that gets to the main point of the video, where when these guys who are earnest and well-intentioned, they spend money and they follow, they buy the books, they buy the courses.  And the idea is if you put in enough work, you're going to be able to get X quality of women.  Now, yeah, I understand most PUAs don't even have pictures with attractive women.  They have a lot of pictures with men, or with men that have become women, but not with actual women.  Most of their websites, like the blogs, it's some generic model picture, and they say, well, I'll get sued.  In reality, women don't want to be near you.  That's the fact.  But Some other POA said, oh, you guys, no one's saying you're going to get a model.  Well, forget about a model.  Most guys, unless they have some delusional expectations... They're thinking, okay, like a solid 6.57, a cute girl who is, you know, not grossly overweight.  Because there are women who are curvy, but actually are in shape.  And then there's the land whales.  We know that, correct?  No offense to you if you like land whales.  You know, I want to be kind, especially to my brothers, because sometimes the brothers, they get offended and they get angry at me.  no, no, no harm.  No, no, no hate.  Um, but the truth of the matter is that, so you're trying to say that we're not seeing her and get models, but what about just decently attractive women, right?  Okay.  Looking women.  And so if a guy puts in all that effort and it doesn't work out, the POA will say, well, you need to try harder.  You're not committed.  You're not dedicated enough.  So he tries even more.  And then finally, when he's exasperated, the POA says, well, you have unrealistic expectations.  You need to lower your standards.  But think about that for a second.  You're a marketing game.  You're saying this applies universally, but now you're making exceptions because the dude's short or maybe not that good looking.  So you're basically saying, Looks are everything.  And this game stuff is really just relevant depending on the way the guy appears.  Let's be perfectly clear.  The last girl I had, she approached me and she said, because you're tall and good looking.  I didn't do any game with her.  The fact of the matter is that when women want something, they will go for it.  And all that you're doing by peddling these lies is you're saying, oh, make sure you don't get cucked by a woman.  Now, so that you can cuck them, Right?  It's like that country song that's really popular now.  It goes, I'm in love getting cut by you.  This is what we have devolved into.  And you would think they'd be more honest, but they don't care.  It just reminds me of that crazy garbage piece of movies.  They came out some years back with my cousin, Mark Whaleyberg.  And, you know, they go back in time, and King Arthur's black, and Lady Guinevere is a BBW.  And you've got the Chinese coronavirus robots, and they transform into the Chrysler.  Of course, it doesn't work.  It's dead.  You replace the transmission for two grand, and your girlfriend drives off to... to spend time with her her actual boyfriend and you raise her kid and you know anthony hopkins is insane seriously horrible horrible script.  this is what we've gotten to though people.  just I'm totally okay.  You want to make money online, fine.  But why do you have to do it at the cost of the truth?  You're just lying, flat out lying to people, okay?  If game actually works, then it works for everyone.  If game doesn't work because you're short or because you're less attractive or whatever, then you need to say that.  And you need to tell these guys, look, your best bet is go on TikTok, try to become a celebrity, make a lot of money.  And stop thinking, because ultimately, if you're saying, lower their standards, and they're like, I hate to rate people because it's harsh, but let's say they're a 3 out of 10, and you're saying, lower your standards.  Well, without knowing game, he can probably nice guy his way into a 1 or a 2, but he wants something better, and you're not able to provide that because ultimately, you are a fraud.  You just are about money, money, money by the pound, and nothing else.  And it's a sad testament.  Being red-pilled, being enlightened, you'd think these guys would say, okay, I'm going to give you the truth and not just the truth that benefits my bank account. ",
