Why every single time that there is a police involved situation that y'all got to go and support the dumbest of the dummies, the lowest of the low, the criminal of the criminals.  I don't understand.  99.9% of police involved shootings can be completely eliminated.  If people would just do a simple thing called not resist arrest, follow directions.  How hard is that?  Now let's talk about Mr.  Jacob Blake because people are literally burning down their city in the name of Jacob Blake as if he's an innocent man just getting in his car.  He wasn't even doing nothing to nobody near him.  No, yeah, he was.  What do you think he was doing when he was going to his car after they had yelled at him and told him to stop?  Mind you, they showed up to the car for a domestic violence situation.  But let's talk about his history.  Because some of y'all need a wake-up pill, need to understand what you're really protesting about and rioting and looting and burning down your own community about.  So let's start, first things.  first, let's start with his criminal record.  So you can put this in perspective.  This is not Joe Schmoe, your kid, walking down the street getting gunned down for no reason.  Let's go with the criminal record.  All right.  First and foremost, Mr.  Jacob Blake had a active warrant at the time of this situation.  Right.  Arrest warrant issued for this gentleman here.  This is official documents.  Let's go to the next thing.  2016.  What is his criminal record look like?  This is what it looks like, ladies and gentlemen.  Battery, which is a misdemeanor.  Strangulation, domestic violence.  You got bail jumping.  I'm assuming that he skipped bail.  Felony, felony crime, disorderly conduct.  These are criminal behaviors at 25 years old.  in 2016.  Let's go to the year before, 2015.  What is Mr.  Blake doing?  endangering safety by use of a dangerous weapon while intoxicated.  That means he was using a firearm or brandishing a firearm while intoxicated.  Ladies and gentlemen, endangering the safety by use of a dangerous weapon, intentionally pointing at people, carrying a concealed weapon in a public building, and then resisting, obstructing Causing substantial bodily harm or soft tissue injury, disorderly conduct.  Now, this situation that I'm talking about here, I think he got into it at a bar or something where he pulled a gun on patrons in the bar.  Ended up getting in a resistant arrest situation with the police.  All of the above.  This is criminal behavior, ladies and gentlemen.  This is kind of the articulation of what that was.  him getting attacked with the canine, all of the above is right here.  Y'all can freeze it on that later on and you can watch it for yourself.  This right here is another conviction.  It's kind of blurry, but in his realm of convictions, third degree sexual assault, domestic abuse, felonies.  Ladies and gentlemen, these are felonies.  And this is pretty much what he had the warrant for.  felony crimes.  All of these were what he was wanted for at the time that the incident happened.  So I want to go further and show you the video.  We got two angles.  I wonder why people won't show you the first angle.  I'm about to show you.  I can probably predict why they won't, but I'm telling you right now, they won't show that angle.  Let's go to the first video with the first angle.  I'm going to make it full screen.  Let's watch it.  I took the sound off.  This one doesn't have sound.  I took the sound off because I don't want to deal with the cursing and them in abandonment.  So if you watch it, you can see clearly the noonday sun.  Mr.  Jacob, the police officers are here behind the car.  They're getting into an altercation behind the car.  Family all outside.  Now they're on the ground right here.  Look, they fight them.  I heard that they attempted to tase him a few times.  Taser did not work.  Now, I cannot verify that because I wasn't there.  But that was what was reported.  He's fighting.  He gets up.  He gets up off the ground.  We're going to go back.  He gets up off the ground after a fight with the police.  He walks around the car, goes to the driver's seat.  Now, I'm not a rocket scientist and never professed to be.  But it don't take that much knowledge and understanding to realize he's not going to the car to get a lollipop to get a police officer and say, thank you for your service.  That's not what his MO is.  That's not what his criminal records show.  So let's keep watching it.  He goes around the car.  They chase him around the car.  They tell him, stop, stop, stop.  He opened the door.  They grab his shirt.  He reached in the car.  Boom, he gets shot and killed.  Now, he didn't get killed.  Now, will he die?  I don't know.  That's up to God.  But he got shot.  He's still alive.  The last time I heard of his conditions.  Now, let's look at the other viewpoint.  This is from somebody, I guess, at their house.  They're looking at the incident here.  I'm going to make it full screen for us.  So you got the gentleman arguing with the police officer, getting into an altercation with the police officer behind the car.  They make their way to the side of the car.  Everybody's yelling and screaming and cussing and acting a fool.  As you can see, there's stuff all on the floor over here.  Something happened.  They didn't just show up for nothing.  This is domestic violence, ladies and gentlemen.  He gets up, walking around the car.  They got a gun pointed at him.  They tell him to stop.  They tell him stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  He goes for the car.  The officer tries to grab him.  His baby mama is out there screaming.  Stop.  Stop.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Please stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Because they know he's going to go to the car and do something stupid.  So he goes just like just like you would think.  He goes in the car.  Boom.  He gets the first shot.  Boom.  You shot again.  Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.  He's still reaching.  He's still reaching for stuff.  Shot, shot, shot.  She jumping up and down, going crazy because she know that that's what he was going to do.  And she know that's the results.  So he got shot.  They go on just like officers should do.  They render aid to the gentleman right here on the ground.  They were able to render aid to him.  He got airlifted to a hospital and he's still alive today.  He's still alive to talk about his criminal behavior.  I don't know if he's talking, but he's still alive.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Why are people protesting and rioting over this?  Why?  Can somebody explain to me why?  It's very simple.  He's a criminal.  He is behaving in a criminal manner before the police get there.  That's why they were called.  Once they're called, what does he do?  He don't comply.  He don't do what's right.  He fight the police officers.  And after he's fighting, they attempted to tase him and all of the above, which is what was reported.  They attempted to tase him.  He's walking around the car, still defying the police.  Then he goes in his car to do what?  we always, the police don't have to wait for him to get a weapon or anything to do anything to him.  They told him to stop, they pulled on his shirt, they attempted to stop him and they used deadly force against him to protect the public and to protect themselves.  Did he die?  No, he didn't.  This is what you call a use of deadly force.  Now, that deadly force is justified based on what I saw.  It's justified.  It's very clear.  And now if he subsequently died as a result of what happened, then that is what it is.  That has nothing to do with whether the use of force was justified in its inception at the beginning.  But y'all need to stop.  Y'all need to stop this.  Y'all need to stop this.  Every time a brother gets shot, right or wrong, y'all protesting.  Screaming, burning down your own community, going to jail, acting a fool, being stupid.  And let a little kid, 5-year-old, 12-year-old, 15-year-old, get shot in the head while dummies doing drive-bys in the community.  Y'all don't burn nothing.  Y'all haven't burned nothing.  Little kids, innocent.  I'm completely innocent.  No criminal record.  They never did nothing wrong.  Straight bullet to the dome.  Y'all won't even burn down a stop sign.  Y'all won't even protest for 35 seconds.  And 80% of the time in Chicago, and I think it's around 70% to 80%, some of you think they never get solved.  Nobody's snitching.  There is no justice.  But y'all won't do nothing but you're screaming and you're putting the names of all these thugs on your shirt.  Thugs.  Thugs.  Can you name me somebody that wasn't resisting arrest?  Even Laquan McDonald, high on PCP, running around with a knife in his hand, pointed at people, stabbing at officers.  Unfortunately, an officer, I don't know why he shot him at that point in which he shot him, unjustifiable.  But you had no business on PCP running around acting stupid in the first place.  I mean, where's accountability?  When does accountability step in?  You had no business doing that in the first place.  Michael Brown, Eric Garner.  Bruh, you shouldn't be selling loosies.  I don't care if it's legal or not legal.  You know what I'm saying?  If the police are confronting you, I mean, I don't care if you feel that it shouldn't be legal, but if the police confront you, bruh, do what they tell you to do.  This ain't your first rodeo, 40-something arrests.  Eric Garner got arrested 40-something times.  It's not his first rodeo, some of which were selling loosies, some of which were resisting arrest.  Not his first rodeo, ladies and gentlemen.  Where do you want to go?  People ask Sandra Bland in here.  Sandra Bland ain't got nothing to do with nothing because she killed herself.  But even if you want to talk about Sandra Bland, You kicked the police officer in the leg and you were acting like a nut.  That's what led you to the point in which you got into a physical altercation with a police officer and led you to jail.  Who you blaming, cuz?  Who y'all blaming?  Who y'all mad at?  Be mad at yourself.  B Tatum will never get killed by a police officer in the manner in which these fools are getting killed or shot by police.  Why?  I don't care if I'm right or wrong.  If a cop tell me to do something, you know what B Tatum doing?  I'm doing what the cop says.  I don't care nothing about my emotions.  I don't care about my feelings.  I don't care about nothing.  I'm doing what the cop says.  You know why, Brandon?  Because I don't want to get shot on purpose, on accident, or maliciously.  I want to live to get that lawsuit.  Because if you arrest me for no reason, I'm suing all y'all.  I'm suing everybody.  Nobody's safe.  I'm suing everybody.  That's how you should be playing the cards.  But ladies and gentlemen, these people are conflating good law abiding citizens, good black folks with these nut jobs.  These people are nuts.  For you to fight a police officer, you are nuts.  You're crazy.  You're deranged.  You want to get killed.  You want to get seriously injured or killed in front of your kids.  They keep crying about his kids.  If your kids are there, why are you acting up?  That should be more of a reason for you to comply just for the sake of your children not having a witness.  You either beat somebody up or you get beat up and killed yourself.  But they don't care about their kids.  That's why they live a life of crime.  That's why they just killing and dealing and stealing and willing.  They don't care nothing about their kids.  They don't care nothing about their family.  care about mine.  That's why I'm not committing crimes right now.  I don't care how poor I am.  If I didn't have no money to my name, I'm not going to commit crimes.  You know why?  Because I don't want to go to prison.  You know why?  Because I got a kid that's depending on me to feed him.  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.  This is not rocket science.  Y'all need to quit tripping.  Get your stuff together.  Stop resisting arrest and you ain't got to worry about dying at the hands of police officers that are doing their job.  And there was a black guy on the scene, just unfortunately he wasn't there in enough time to shoot the guy, because he probably would have.  Anyway, I could talk about this for three or four more hours.  I could talk about this all day.  This is a subject that needs to be expressed upon.  But I'm going to let y'all go back and review it, look at it, look at the details, look at the evidence.  All of this stuff will be on tatumreport.com.  The link is in the description section.  Comment, let me know, is B. Tatum tripping or is this unjustified?  And I just fell off a rock and bumped my head.  I don't know what's going on.  You let me know in the comments section.  Visit TatumReport.com.  Like I said before, The Officer Tatum Story.  Y'all know what it is.  I'll see you on the next one.  I'm out. ",
