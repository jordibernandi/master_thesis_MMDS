            "text": "Hi guys, what's up?  Welcome to my channel.  I'm Kim Cohen and I'm so grateful to have you here.  Welcome!  Today is a very interesting topic.  It's something that has been a challenge for me and a very hard decision to make.  This is not something that I wanted to do, but as I'm going into the 10th week of dealing with this, just something has to change and I can't continuously have my work being thrown to the trash.  So I kind of want to elaborate with you guys on what's happening because I will not be making any Q related, Q deep state, cabal, all of that shenanigan, Trump videos on YouTube anymore.  And again, like I said, this is a very difficult decision to make.  um but i just wanted to kind of explain to you guys where i'm coming from and what's been going on.  i'm going to be moving to patreon which is a platform.  um Patreon is kind of like, how do I explain it?  It's a website to help support, it's kind of like a fan website to help support influencers or artists or whatever.  it is where you buy like little memberships and on there, I will be uploading my video.  So I'm going to continue uploading and creating this type of content, but just not on here.  Now, here is the whole situation and the reasoning and what's really been going on the last 10 weeks.  I didn't want to elaborate on this because I didn't want to give the hacker and YouTube the benefit of the doubt.  But I just need you guys to understand where I'm coming from.  So, as many of you guys know, I started this channel, I mean, well, I started this channel six years ago, six and a half years ago, but I started speaking about Q, I believe at the end of March.  I think around March, maybe, Yeah, I think at the beginning of March, I started talking about this topic and my channel blew up and in two weeks I got over 10,000 followers and everything was amazing and I was so grateful and I just kept wanting to go and share everything that I know.  Well, YouTube slash The Hacker, which I highly believe that The Hacker works for YouTube.  I don't doubt it.  That's just my personal opinion.  after a few weeks of craziness.  One day it all magically stopped.  So everything was going great and then all of a sudden it stopped and I was watching my live analytics and I would see 10 followers and then I'd lose 10 followers and I gained 15 followers in two minutes and then I'd lose 15 and it was driving me freaking crazy.  I understand that people don't want us to talk about this stuff.  and i kept fighting the fight and i'm not giving up on the fight.  i am doing it on a private platform.  that way the content is private.  therefore none of the shenanigan is going to go on on there because i think that youtube has a lot to do with it and i don't want to continuously support youtube in this sense where they're censoring my words and not giving me freedom of speech.  so what happens when i get hacked is this So this is how it goes.  Before I got hacked, I would get 20 to 30,000 views in 24 hours, which was incredible.  And since the hacking started, it stopped.  So the way that it goes is I'll upload a video.  And the moment I upload that video, the hacker slash YouTube will start, I will start getting, and I post this in groups too, so I know that I'm getting new followers because people are waking up every single day.  The moment I click publish, all of a sudden, in the snap of a finger, I lose, the moment I click publish, not even a whole minute goes by, and I already lost, boom, 20 followers, and then it just keeps going down and down and down and down and down, and then I get, somebody adds me, then it gets deleted.  The blocker literally has deleted thousands and thousands of subscribers.  When I say thousands, I, Kid you not, I'm supposed to be at 50,000 followers.  And they have deleted thousands of people from my channel because they obviously don't want this to come out.  My voice, the truth.  So they'll start hacking my subscribers.  They'll unsubscribe people like my freaking aunt, my family members, like hello.  They'll hit subscribe.  A few minutes later, they'll hit refresh and the subscribers are gone.  They're not subscribed to my channel anymore.  This is an ongoing thing.  People don't get notifications.  People that turn on the notification bells don't get notifications.  Comments are being deleted.  Thousands and thousands and thousands of comments.  When I say thousands of comments, thousands.  This person is messing with my search engine stuff.  So when people type in things that are related to Q, my videos are being blocked from all search engines.  My emails have been hacked and I don't get emails anymore related to YouTube and who knows what else they have been deleting.  This has been going on for 10 weeks on an everyday base.  I haven't had a single day of rest from this.  It's literally... out of control, it's insane.  It takes up so much of my time each and every single day that I can be learning stuff, creating stuff, but instead I'm dealing with trying to get rid of the hacker, trying to contact YouTube, talking to the police.  This happens on an everyday base for 10 weeks and I just can't continuously go on and do this.  So what ends up happening is I take a lot of pride in what I do.  I don't know if you guys are aware, but I'm a social media influencer.  I'm a travel blogger and a lifestyle blogger for six and a half years.  For the last four months, I have put my entire career on hold.  I have not accepted any jobs.  because I've been focused on doing this.  I also need to pay my rent and buy food and be a normal human being, but Instagram, YouTube, social media is my career and is my job for the last six years and I just moved here.  So anyways, so for a while I was willing to put up with this, but I'm just not anymore because it's not fair to me.  It wastes so much Hours of the day, every single day that I have to deal with.  There's days that I had to deal with this for 24 hours.  Now I've done everything in my power to stop the hacking from happening.  When I say I've done a lot, I have done a lot.  I've spent over a thousand dollars of my own money just to share the truth with you guys so that I can save the world.  I have had to delete my entire computer seven times.  I lost a lot of really important stuff on there.  Completely delete, seven times.  That also takes like hours upon hours.  I've involved the police.  I've had to change passwords.  I've had to delete my freaking phone, delete all my apps because I thought that they're hacking my phone too, which I still strongly believe that they are, that there was like a tracking device on there.  I had to delete all my apps.  I had to change my freaking phone number of 10 years, okay?  I've got a VPN system.  I've hired three professional computer geniuses slash hackers to solve this.  I've bought a new router with a higher firewall.  I've gotten different virus stuff into my computer that I had to purchase as well.  Um, I've done a lot.  I've done a lot and it's all for you guys because I love you and I want, you know, to help.  you guys know what is going on in the world.  And I'm so passionate about this, but at some point it just, it has to also make sense to me as me, because I don't know if you follow me on Instagram, but I go to sleep every single day at like 9 a.m.  and 10 a.m.  and 6 a.m.  because I'm constantly researching, learning, sharing, dealing with hacking.  So there was a point where it was worth it to put my career on the line because I was helping waking up all these people and you guys and sharing the truth.  But I can't also jeopardize my career.  Meanwhile, I'm doing this and meanwhile, it's getting hacked and YouTube can't seem to figure it out, which is, I don't know.  That just makes me really, that just makes me, I don't know what you wanna call it, but I feel like YouTube has a lot to do with this because if they can't figure out their own system, and they say that the hacker's gone, and then the hacker comes back a few hours later, and it's just this ongoing thing, and it's just not right, you guys.  It's not right, and I love you guys so much.  I do, and I hope you know that, that I've literally, there's things that I share, there's things that I don't share, but I've sacrificed so much to be here to create these videos.  These videos do take a lot of time to create, I mean, I do endless research from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep.  Yesterday I was watching, I was building furniture and listening to four hours of X 22 report, four hours because I've missed it this week because of all the hacking situations that I've been dealing with.  I do research literally every single day from between 17 to 24 hours of the day I do research.  I know that's insane, but like literally I do.  So learning the information is one thing.  Doing my hair and makeup, getting the right lighting filming it uploading it to my computer editing it takes hours and then putting it on youtube takes a while too.  then you have to write all the description all the keywords all these things and then sitting and commenting on everyone's because i really want to engage with you guys and answer all your questions commenting on every single person's question and um comment takes hours upon hours just on a single video and I do it with so much love.  but again, literally my work is being thrown to the trash and it's really really really disheartening.  It's really really really upsetting.  So I've decided to take things into my own hands.  And I have to say goodbye to YouTube.  for the time being, as long as there's censorship, as long as I'm being blocked, I cannot continue to make these videos because I don't wanna get an anxiety attack over this or a panic attack or get sick over this.  I wanna invest time educating people that are interested.  And I know that some of this comes with it.  Yes, censorship, but the hacking is a whole other crazy.  Now on top of all of that, I used to be able to make money from Google AdSense.  So those commercials that you see in the beginning and the end of the video, sometimes in between.  But what ends up happening is with all this stuff, my videos keep getting demonetized, which means that If I upload a video related to the deep state, to Q, to anything, they automatically demonetize it.  It means I don't make any money from it.  They delete my videos.  They have done this numerous times, as you guys know.  And it's just, it's so upsetting.  It's so upsetting.  It's not okay.  I still wanna be able to speak the truth and say my voice.  You know, even if you write the word QAnon in your title, your video, boom, this monetized.  You can't even appeal that.  So I don't wanna drain my energy into a place where it just continuously, this continues to happen.  So after a lot of thinking and I asked my followers on Instagram on what they think I should do, we have agreed.  And they actually asked me to join the Patreon website, which I said, like I said earlier, it's a website to support influencers and artists.  They're basically working for free full time and the way that it works is there is I'm going to be able to upload content.  So the same exact videos style of videos that I would post on here.  I'm going to be posting on there, which is like a private platform for me and my followers.  And so I can have more freedom of speech.  There's a lot of things that I censor myself from staying on here because I don't want my videos to be flagged or deleted, but regardless, they are being flagged and deleted anyways.  So I've just kind of had enough and I hope that you've had enough.  And I really, really, really sincerely hope that you would help support me and join me on Patreon.  I wanted to make this really affordable for everyone and I think that it's fair.  I've done like a poll on this.  And so it's going to be $7 a month and I'm going to be uploading two to three videos a week on there.  Sometimes more now that I'll have more time than dealing with YouTube constantly.  And there's also going to be live Q&A's on there.  There's different tiers that you can get.  I'm also going to be doing a giveaway.  So the first 100 people that sign up, I'm going to be giving away a QAnon cup.  You get to pick red or black.  I'm going to be sending it to you.  I'm going to do an anonymous, a random, what's it called, raffle.  And then I'm going to be doing another giveaway when I get to 500.  And when I get to a thousand, they're obviously going to be bigger and better.  because I just really want to show you guys my appreciation.  And I really hope that you guys help and support me on there and continue to follow me.  I didn't want to have to make this decision, but it's just come to a point where it's literally out of hand, where Google and YouTube aren't helping.  And I just can't keep doing this.  Like, it's not fair for me.  It's not fair to you.  I wanna be able to speak the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  So I really hope that you guys will continue to support me on there.  I've literally given my heart and soul to waking up the world in the last four months.  I mean, I've done it my entire life, but like when it comes to this topic, I literally spend so much time every single day educating myself and trying to spread the word and the love.  I really hope that you guys will help support me on Patreon.  I'm going to leave a link below.  I already have a few people that subscribe there.  And I already have two videos that I filmed that I was going to put on here, but I'm just not anymore.  Because literally the last video was my last test.  And when I see my views... My views, my comments, my subscribers, my engagement getting messed with and my videos getting demonetized.  I have to make a living too.  And yeah, you know, it's kind of like if you made a beautiful piece of art and it took you a week to make and then somebody literally, you find it in the freaking trash.  It's disheartening and this has been happening repeatedly.  Anyways, you guys, I love you so much.  I love you so much.  Whatever decision that you choose to take, I completely understand.  That's where I'm gonna be sharing my content and it's gonna be uncensored.  So I won't have to be careful with what I'm saying anymore.  And I really hope again that you'll join me on there.  I will continue to have this channel.  I might sporadically, I don't know yet how and when and like whatever the details of it.  I'm going to be investing most of my time on this website, on the Patreon website.  I'm also starting my coaching one-on-one, which I'm going to be investing more time into that too.  This week, I already have a few people signed up and space is limited.  So if you are one of the people that wanted to do coaching one-on-one when it comes to influencers and social media and living your best life and your best dream, definitely leave me a comment below and let me know if you're interested in that because space is limited.  I said I was gonna do it earlier, like, I don't know, a couple, two months ago or a month ago, but then I couldn't focus on the Coaching 101 when I was dealing with like my security being compromised.  I mean, people having access to my emails means that they have access to my home address, my baking information, My where I go, it's kind of really crazy.  This is why I had to involve the police in it because I have to make sure that I am safe.  My safety is obviously important.  So anyways, guys, I love you so much.  I really hope that you understand where I'm coming from.  I hope that you will help support me on there.  It would literally mean the world to me because I honestly never wanted to have this happen.  But I'm just like, I'm just, I feel very stuck.  in this situation.  So anyways, I will continue to use this channel, so don't unsubscribe from this channel.  We will see what the future holds.  Right now, for the next month, I'm gonna be on there.  Probably for the next two months, I'm gonna be on there.  That's 100% guarantee.  And I'm gonna continue to make content on there.  Also, please don't forget to follow me on my social media platforms.  On Instagram, Khufid Kim Cohen.  and on Facebook, Vanilla Sky Dreaming, where I can give you guys more updates.  And so eventually I will be creating more spiritual healing things for the future, for after this is all over, and things also for you to use now for ascension.  I'm gonna be creating more content on that.  Anyways, guys, love you so much.  Again, I hope you understand where I'm coming from.  I really pray to God and hope that you'll join me on that platform.  Because I really, really, really do work really hard to get this information to you guys.  And I hope that you'll continue to help and support me.  Love you guys so much.  Give this video a thumbs up.  And bye-bye YouTube for now.  I love you guys so much. ",
