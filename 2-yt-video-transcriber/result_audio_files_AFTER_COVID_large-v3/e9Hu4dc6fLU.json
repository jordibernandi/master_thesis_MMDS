            "text": "Hey, everyone.  Welcome back to my channel.  In today's video, I'm going to share my opinion about OnlyFans.  And it's a bit of an unpopular opinion, at least insofar as the mainstream is concerned, which likes to promote OnlyFans as a platform that empowers women and offers them a route to financial freedom.  For the few people who don't already know, OnlyFans was launched in 2016 and is a subscription-based social media platform where users can sell and or purchase original content, typically of the pornographic variety.  When utilized as an adult site, users will post Not Safe for Work videos and photos to their accounts, which are protected by a paywall.  To date, OnlyFans has 450,000 content creators and 30 million users who pay for their content.  First of all, even if I can't personally relate to the feeling, I do understand on some level why so many women nowadays are drawn to OnlyFans.  Not only is OnlyFans promoted by the mainstream media, but many influential celebrities such as Cardi B and Bella Thorne as well, which makes the platform seem a lot more palatable.  Prostitution or sex work as many call it is presented as an empowering lifestyle.  Women are told that they can have complete control over their bodies and their lives with the potential to secure for themselves financial freedom.  And this is particularly tempting to those who are currently struggling due to the COVID pandemic.  However, the negatives of OnlyFans in my opinion far outweigh the positives.  Personally, there actually aren't any aspects of OnlyFans that I find positive, but there are many who do, so with that in mind, and leaving aside any moral arguments against OnlyFans, here are a few other reasons why you shouldn't start in OnlyFans.  Firstly, you might have read articles about how some women are making $100,000 a year on OnlyFans.  But the truth is that only a small percentage of creators are making anywhere near that amount of money.  The reason for this is because most porn is free, so many people don't feel inclined to pay for it.  And also because there's 450,000 creators on OnlyFans, meaning the competition is brutal.  What's more, for the people doing OnlyFans as a side hustle while in college or while searching for a job, it has the potential to hurt your future career prospects.  There's also the risk that your photos and videos won't remain private and will be published for all the world to see.  Earlier this year, 1.6 terabytes worth of videos and images from OnlyFans were leaked online, primarily comprised of women's accounts, specifically those who use the site to share pornographic images.  And then there are less discussed negatives, such as the fact that OnlyFans creators, some men but mostly women, are being reduced as human beings solely down to what they can offer sexually.  not just by those who consume their pornographic content, but through their own choice as well.  Of course, on its face, a person's sexuality is extremely valuable, but much less so when it's made available to the entire world for five to ten dollars a month.  Not to mention, out of a person's entire set of talents and skills, their genitals are what ultimately they're being defined by.  I can't for the life of me understand why any woman who claims to care about women would encourage other women to join OnlyFans.  For those who want to be valued for their minds and their characters and their positive qualities, OnlyFans obliterates this possibility and instead places all the value on a woman's sexual and physical attributes.  People who look at a woman's naked photos and videos in which she simulates sex acts.  These people aren't thinking about the woman's personality, nor do they care about her.  She's simply one of many outlets that gives them sexual pleasure.  And in many cases, these sexual fantasies requested of OnlyFans creators are horribly degrading.  One creator, Eloise, said, I have been asked to dress as a schoolgirl and pretend to masturbate myself.  Once I was told to tie a rope around my neck and pretend to choke.  There are some real weirdos out there.  Another creator, Claudia, said that she discovered one of her main clients had made a pornographic meme out of one of her topless photographs and posted it on a porn site.  I tried to complain to OnlyFans, but I never heard from them, Claudia said.  I emailed them five times.  In the end, I gave up and deleted my account.  Then there is the girlfriend experience.  OnlyFans offers men the opportunity to pay providers for a day, or however long, to behave as if they are a real date, and via messages and voice notes send instructions as to what he requires of his girlfriend.  It's not surprising that this leads to reports of subscribers becoming obsessed with and going on to stalk the women they follow on OnlyFans.  Recently, it was reported that a 21-year-old woman in Australia who posted explicit content on OnlyFans was followed and harassed by a man who went on to leak her personal information online.  I heard from another woman about being sexually harassed by a subscriber after she rejected his pleas to meet up in real life.  He ended up tracking down my real name and mobile number, she told me, and put up a fake advert on a porn site.  The young woman was soon deluged with dozens of calls and messages from men before she was forced to change her number.  Is money really worth all of the shame, guilt, depression, PTSD, the inability to form healthy romantic relationships that a woman might potentially suffer as a result of day in and day out constantly selling the most intimate, private and vulnerable parts of herself to strangers.  Also, how does OnlyFans affect women's view of men in general?  On the daily, they're surrounded by men who care nothing for them as people, but as fantasies.  Not all men are like this, though.  In fact, many of them aren't.  Many men are loving and honorable and noble, but the women on OnlyFans are never going to know these men because these aren't the types of men that pay women to debase and degrade themselves.  They have far too much respect for themselves than to do that, and they have far too much respect for women in general as well.  I'm not saying all of this to insult women who have OnlyFans, who have had an OnlyFans in the past, or who are considering starting one.  I'm saying it because I genuinely care about the well-being of women.  And for this reason, I think it's necessary to speak out against all of the ideologies and trends that are harmful to them, even if it's unpopular to do so.  Women are worth more than their physical and sexual appeal, and they're sure as hell worth more than their genitals.  They're worth more than being used as fodder for masturbation, and they're capable of much more as well.  Some in fulfilling careers that they can be proud of, some in marriage and motherhood, and some even in both.  Basically, all I want to say to women is please look before you leap.  OnlyFans might seem like a good idea in the moment, but then later becomes something which you deeply regret, but which you can never erase from your past.  If you're being encouraged to join OnlyFans by an OnlyFans creator, and they're only telling you about the positive aspects, you can be sure that they're not being honest.  And if they're not being honest, then perhaps they don't exactly have your best interest at heart.  Perhaps they simply want you to join because it makes them feel better about their own decision to do so.  At the end of the day, we are the ones who determine our own value, not just through how we act, but through the life choices we make.  Money and followers can be gained and they can be lost, but our dignity and integrity, which are infinitely more precious, once lost are in danger of being lost forever.  Thank you so much for watching, everyone.  If you would like to follow me on any other platforms like Instagram, Telegram, BitChute, I can't even remember them all nowadays, but I'll link them all in the pinned comment and in the description of this video.  I really hope you enjoyed.  Thank you so much again for watching and I'll see you all soon. ",
