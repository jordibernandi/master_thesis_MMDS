            "text": "I remember being pretty happy that day.  I'd gotten out of work early.  happy with the job that I'd done and I was calling my sister at the time and somewhat distracted by looking at my phone when two men approached me, stepped toward me off the curb and said, you know, hey, who are you?  I said, I'm James.  And they said, oh really, is that your real name?  I was kind of thrown off, you know, I was getting a weird vibe from these guys immediately and I'm a pretty pro-social person that I would consider myself as such.  So I started engaging them, but then one man stepped behind me and I felt very uncomfortable.  And they asked me, is that your real name?  I said, yes, that's my real name.  And then they were wearing these lanyards and one of them asked me to step aside and they sort of had an air of authority, so I started to comply.  One of them stepped behind me, boxed me out and took my wallet out of my back pocket and at that point I realized I was being mugged.  So I went to run to flee and I was tackled and ultimately beaten pretty severely.  After some time in this altercation and I had been blacked out and it's hard to recall some of the details, but the police came and then that was when I realized that they weren't muggers, but they were just acting outside of what they ever should have done in their roles as a police detective and an FBI agent.  As I was being physically assaulted, I was screaming for someone to call the police because I was scared out of my mind.  I was trying to get away, trying to get out of this situation, trying to survive.  really fighting with everything that I could to flee as I was yelling for help and for any bystanders that might be near to call the police.  When I was being choked I feared for my life truly and it was a moment where everything went black and as far as I know that is as close as you can get to being dead without being dead and I truly really thought it was over in that moment.  I discovered that the men that did this were police when the other police came over and didn't arrest them. ",
