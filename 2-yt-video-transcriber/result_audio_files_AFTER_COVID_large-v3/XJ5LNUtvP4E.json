No, why?  What do you need?  Oh, nothing.  I'm fine.  I appreciate it.  What?  Oh, these are probably police cars or something close to.  So I think she just called for backup.  So I'm going to sit here and wait for him as a. I don't need anything.  For what reason?  But I can, though.  So this is in the police department?  I don't need anything.  So how can I help you?  Oh, I'm recording.  For what?  I'm an independent journalist.  Appreciate it.  Okay.  From where?  I'm independent.  Do you have your ID with you?  I don't need it.  For what?  For what reason?  Well, I don't want you standing here recording on the police department for obvious security reasons.  Well, you just told me it was private.  Okay.  You just told me.  What's your badge number?  I do need your badge number.  You just engaged with me.  So if anything else, call your superior.  I would.  Cause you're supposed to give me your name and badge number when I asked for it.  Okay.  We will see.  We will definitely see.  Hello.  All right.  How about yourself?  That's good.  Can I have your name and badge number please?  No, not right this minute.  You can't.  Why are you here?  Because I'm asking you, why are you here?  I don't, it's the public.  I don't need a reason to be in public.  Really?  I don't.  All right.  Is it coming up here?  Yeah.  Is it not public?  I just want to real quick explain to you.  When I'm on the phone right now, I'm talking to somebody from the courts, right?  I'm on the phone with the judge.  That's fine.  And you walk up to my car.  And I said, pardon me.  Okay.  So then you asked if you can go back there.  I said, was it publicly accessible?  Correct.  It is not.  Okay.  And that's fine.  But this is.  So what's the problem?  I have the freedom of press.  Sorry.  You're going to get your education today.  So you're a journalist and then you're a. I am an independent journalist, and I don't have to tell you my name unless you have reasonable suspicions that I've committed a crime.  So I don't have to tell you my name, right?  Okay, so why are you engaging me, asking me?  Well, I don't want to have curses.  I don't need elections.  Yes or no, right?  So now I had to get off the phone with the judge.  You didn't have to.  Well, yes, I did, because you're coming over here.  Right, and I'm coming over here and doing what?  So I'm on the phone with the judge right now.  What am I doing exactly?  You're not understanding what I'm saying.  So I'm on the phone with the judge.  You come over to my car.  And I said, pardon me.  I said, pardon me.  So the lady's in the car, I'm recording, I come up, I say, hey, excuse me, is this area publicly accessible?  The fenced area, which is open.  And she says, no.  I said, okay, sorry about that.  She said, what do you need?  I said, I don't need anything.  I continue to walk off and continue to record.  There's nothing wrong with what I'm doing.  thing I'm doing right now is constitutionally protected.  It's the first time I have the freedom of speech and press, so I don't see what the problem is.  If this is a public area, which it is, since it's the police department, what's the problem?  She claims she doesn't have to state her name and badge number after she engaged with me.  It's not like I came up and had a problem or anything like that.  So now you're saying that you don't have to... And said, pardon me.  Hey, hey, so are you from Indianapolis?  I am, actually. ",
