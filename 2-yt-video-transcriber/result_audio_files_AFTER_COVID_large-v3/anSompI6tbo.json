            "text": "Good damn morning, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again.  The sweet and sour sniffles gear has dropped.  I got a hat on the way and a hoodie on the way.  I will show them as soon as I get them.  The design looks fucking sick on a black or white background.  I like the white background because it looks like an actual Chinese takeout container.  25% off, offer code ALLIN for 2020, all caps.  Link will be in the description box.  So many things, so many things.  Number one, the riots in Philadelphia, Philly.  In West Philadelphia, I saw a report last night.  I was like, Will Smith didn't tell us about this shit.  No wonder his mom sent his ass to Beverly Hills.  So the other day, officer involved shooting.  It's on camera.  The guy had a knife.  What the fuck?  But riots and police shootings are the new burgers and fries.  You get one, you get the other.  It's automatic.  No evidence, no proof, no nothing.  None of that matters.  Like I said, it was on tape.  The dude, his mom called the police.  He has a history of mental issues and violence.  He was arrested before for punching his mother in her face.  This dude was a monster.  He was one of the people loose in society that nobody wants, needs, or should have to deal with.  He was a fucked up individual.  So they called the cops.  The cops showed up.  But why do they send the police?  Why don't you send a fucking social worker?  The guy had mental illness problems, right?  He had mental issues.  Send a coworker, right, Joe?  Send a coworker.  Send a social worker.  They can show up with their case file and their clipboard or their iPad these days.  And that social worker could have talked him down, right?  That social worker could have said, hey, man, come over here.  Take one of your pills.  Sit down and talk to me about it, man.  Put the knife down.  No.  By the time that suspect is wielding a knife, the time for social workers is over.  It's time for the police.  You send a social worker.  They get stabbed and killed.  Then who are you going to call?  The police.  Cut out the middleman.  The cops had their gun drawn.  I don't know how many fucking times they told him to put the knife down.  The cops are backing up.  The guy's coming around this way.  The cops are backing up this way, trying to give the guy space.  There's a woman trying to stop the guy.  I believe it's his mom.  Could be somebody else.  The guy goes toward the police very aggressively with a knife in his hand.  What are you wanting to do?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Shoot him in the leg.  The cop should have went for an ankle or kneecap or something.  But then you got that femoral artery, so they can die from that, too.  But yeah, go for the leg.  The cops need to have more training.  You should all be like Riggs and leave the weapon too.  when he shot that smiley face into the fucking target.  Sorry, guys.  A torso is bigger than a leg.  There's a better chance you're going to hit that.  We're going to go ahead and go for the body and put this dude down.  Let's say you do shoot him in the leg.  You still got to take the fucking knife from him.  You think you shoot this crazy ass fool in his leg?  He's going to go, whoops, and throw the knife up.  Like, my bad.  You guys are serious.  But of course.  There's people on the scene.  There were people gathering around the scene who said that to the cop, but she was some higher up.  I don't know if she was a chief or what.  Some higher up in the police department was there taking people's questions.  And some idiot said, why didn't you just shoot him in the leg?  Who said that about a week ago?  Biden is perverted.  These people believe this shit.  They swallow these fucking pills of stupidity.  Why didn't you shoot him in the leg?  You get out there with a gun and you're adrenaline pumping and shoot this dumbass.  who's going to kill you in the leg.  So, of course, the police shoot him.  Philly burns in three, two, go.  A thousand people looted and robbed a fucking Walmart.  How does stealing baby wipes and flat screens from Walmart... Help your cause.  You're supposed to be mad that another black man got killed by the police.  Why weren't you down at the police station?  Airing your grievances.  That's where the killers are, the murderers are.  So the murderer is in the fucking police station, but you go to Walmart.  That does not compute.  Your house is on fire.  and you go to Home Depot.  That doesn't make any sense.  That does not compute.  You're having a heart attack, but you go to the beach.  That does not compute.  So you being mad at the police for killing another one of your soul brothers Doesn't make sense for you to go to Walmart and steal shit.  That's not your brother.  That's not your sister.  You don't give a fuck about them.  You're just using it as an excuse to act like a jackass.  That's what that is.  Why did you go to Walmart?  You're not serious about this shit.  They're not worried about the lives of black men.  Black men aren't worried about the lives of black men because we're the one that keeps taking them from each other.  Standard, riot, burning shit, stealing shit, destroying shit.  Now it's over.  Smoke clears.  What's changed?  I don't know why these stores don't start putting tracking devices on all their products in these fucking inner cities.  So when it's done, you can go find your flat screen or your bottle of Hennessy or the other stupid shit these people take.  that have nothing to do with why they're supposed to be there.  Philly, another lost city, another destroyed city because of some bullshit.  So all you guys, you're kneeling.  You got the names on there.  You got the names on your jersey.  You got bullshit painted on the court, on the field.  For what?  You haven't done shit.  If you're doing the same thing, getting the same results, but you expect different ones, what's that called?  So change your approach if you want change.  They're not fucking serious.  Anyway, so... 50 Cent, remember he came out saying, if you guys vote for buying you out of your mind, because it's going to be 62% tax, and I'm not trying to be 20 Cent instead of 50 Cent.  I gave him props for that.  Thinking with his wallet, using his mind, that his over-emotional heart.  So then Chelsea Handler, that disgusting, childless wench, came out and said that she needed to remind him that he was a black person and he couldn't vote for Trump.  So when someone tells you you can't do something solely based on your race, what's that word?  It's one of their favorites.  You know what it's called.  I don't need to say it.  Textbook.  So after the backlash from that, she said, because that's her ex-boyfriend.  They dated like 10 years ago.  So she said she was willing to back that nasty clam up on him if necessary to change his mind.  So I don't know if she did do that.  I don't know if she got some pictures, maybe 50 Cent doing some foul shit, having some foul shit done to him.  I don't know.  But he changed his tune.  Now he's saying, oh, I never liked Trump.  He don't like black people.  Fuck him.  What a bitch.  That's a bitch move.  If you believe something, stick with it.  Who gives a fuck what people say?  I'm sure people told you you couldn't make it as a rapper.  Did you listen to them?  Were you scared to lose some street cred?  You don't live in the street anymore.  You got millions of dollars in gold-plated sports cars.  The fuck do you care about the streets?  You're not there anymore.  But he couldn't handle the pressure.  Couldn't handle people talking shit.  So now he's back against Trump.  Who gives a fuck?  Either with us or against us.  But on the other side, let's do a quick 180.  There's this other little rapper named Lil Pump.  Lil Pump, he's one of these face-tattooed little mumble rappers, right?  Can't stand his music, can't stand what he stands for, you know, as far as his message and the way he just... You'll see, I'll put a link in the description box.  It shows him on his Instagram or whatever.  He says, Trump 2020, fuck Joe Biden, I'm not trying to pay more tax, MAGA, right?  Straight up.  Supporting Trump, no innuendo, he leaves no question unanswered, he is a Trump supporter, says fuck Joe Biden.  Now, right after that clip, there's a series of clips of just fucking nonsense and gibberish, him showing his money and his jewelry, that kind of shit I'm not a fan of.  But it's good to see another entertainer.  Now, hopefully, this dude will stick with it and he won't flip-flop like 50 Cent's bitch ass.  But it's good to see entertainers and people in the younger generation who are trying to use their minds.  Who cares how Trump makes you feel?  I don't care if he's mean.  I don't care if he's crude, crass, lewd, whatever you want to call him.  Unpolished, brash, sophomoric.  Frat boy, I don't give a shit.  I got friends.  I got family.  I got a dad.  I don't need none of that shit from him.  What I need is for you to make sure we are taken seriously on the world stage and that my interests and wants and needs come first.  That my right to opportunity is preserved above all else.  You play for Team America.  America, fuck yeah.  If you haven't seen the movie, just YouTube.  Team America song.  That shit is hilarious.  But anyway, you're the quarterback for Team America, not Team China, Team Mexico, Team Russia, Team Canada.  Team whoever.  None of the other 196 countries.  However many left after the ones I listed.  Fuck them.  America first.  What that dude say in that Chris Rock movie, Head of State?  He said, God bless America and no place else.  You play for us.  We come first.  You are merely our mouthpiece.  You're there to take our concerns seriously.  to the government, to  D.C.,  and make sure that it happens.  That's all I need you for.  I don't care if you say mean words about people.  I, unlike some, can find the truth, especially when there's audio and video evidence of what you really said.  But I could give a shit how nice you are.  Be a good president.  That's it.  And it's good to see that some young people, especially in the entertainment business, are seeing that, are seeing through the bullshit.  But like I said, I hope he sticks with it and doesn't flip like 50 Cent's weak ass.  So, Kamala, the Ugandan... Awkward ass, no conviction nightmare.  She did a 60 minute interview.  I'll put a link in the description box of a clip of her, all her awkward ass cackles.  God, that woman sucks.  Especially if you're over 65.  So, she does the 60 Minutes interview, and the lady is asking her a series of pretty easy, straightforward questions, all related to this pesky little election we're going through.  So, she asks her, what's your stance on, are you a socialist politician?  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.  Oh no, I am a person who grew up in this country as a black child, so you're black now.  So when your mama stood up there in her Indian garb, when you were sworn in as the first Indian American senator, you were Indian then.  Fast forward to today, you're black.  You were a little black girl growing up in America.  Anyway, she's all, I was a black girl growing up in America, and I did this, and I did that, and I love hip-hop.  Shut the fuck up.  We all saw the video of you, the girl, and that stupid-ass idiot, Angela Rye, asking you who's the best rapper alive, and you said Tupac.  Now take it from a fan of hip-hop, of somebody that grew up listening to rap, if you are a so-called fan of hip-hop, you know good and fucking well that Tupac is not alive.  And in that same interview, she asked you to name other rappers.  You couldn't name one.  So stop this bullshit.  You are not a fan of hip hop.  You did not grow up a little black girl in America.  You grew up a little half Indian, half Jamaican girl in America.  And since your pops wasn't there, I'll lean more toward the Indian side.  What the fuck?  It is so awkward to watch this woman try to be authentic.  You'll see.  Don't take my word for it.  Watch the tape.  That is some awkward shit.  And how somebody can vote for her and Joe, I don't know.  I really don't.  Take the feely feels out of that shit.  Look at what's on tape.  Look at what they said now versus what they said then.  Look at it.  It's on tape.  How can you vote for these people?  The only way you can is by using your damn feelings.  Because you don't like the way that Twomp makes you feel in your little hearty heart.  Fuck that.  You're an adult.  Toughen up.  If you don't have a daddy, I'm sorry.  The president ain't it.  Go to somebody else to make you feel good.  Go to someone else to finger your ego.  Not the president.  I like my president rough around the edges.  It lets the rest of the world know, don't fuck around.  I'm not playing.  Does my name tag say Hasbro or Mattel?  No, that means I'm not a toy, so don't play with me.  You want to be America's friend?  Fine.  You won't have a better friend.  But if you start tripping, I'm going to have to open this 55-gallon drum of fuck you up.  Period.  If you can respect that, we won't have any problems.  You have issues, we will be the first ones there sending aid to you, help to you, rebuilding your city and your country.  But if you act up and break rule number one, we're gonna have to hurt you.  That's what I need the president for.  Everything else... I got it.  You see these shoulders?  They're broad.  I got it.  Raising my kids, shaping my city, shaping mine and my family's future.  I got that.  Keeping them safe.  I got that.  Get the fuck out of my way.  Let me get the things I need and or want to protect myself and said family.  I can handle this.  You come and take the report and take the carcass out of my living room.  I can handle this.  Stop relying on the government for unnecessary shit.  They can't handle it.  They can't.  We've tried.  We've given them more responsibility.  They fuck it up every time.  They can't handle it.  So let's leave it with us because we can.  Let me tell you what I can do.  I can get back into the rest of this damn state-mandated meal period.  The only good thing California's given me.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please, subscribe.  Hit that notification bell because every time it rings, a piece of shit.  liberal cries.
