Jesus paid the fine.  That's what happened on the cross.  That's why he cried out, it is finished.  In other words, the debt has been paid.  If you're in court, even though you're guilty, if someone pays you a fine, the judge can legally let you go.  He can say, Sean, you've got a stack of speeding fines.  Someone's paid them.  You're out of here, even though you're guilty.  You can do that, which is legal and just.  Well, God can legally dismiss your case, forgive your sins, commute your death sentence because of what Jesus did on the cross and still do that, which is just and right.  Beautiful.  because of the death and resurrection of Christ.  Yeah, look, a parachute is a beautiful thing, but if you're not wearing it, it's not going to help you. ",
