            "text": "hey y'all trey here coming to you from my own personal hubble out here in california i normally like to do these videos outside but i value my life.  so no i ain't going out there get stabbed over some pure ale.  no thank you.  people lost their goddamn minds.  man some suburban hellscape out like some middle american mad max movie.  just gangs of marauding karens going from pharmacy to pharmacy, cutting a swath of entitled ignorance through disinfectant aisles everywhere.  They can't be bargained with.  They can't be reasoned with.  They know but one God and his name is Charmin.  And the worst of these assholes is unfortunately a fellow Tennessean that motherfucker that stockpiled all that hand sanitizer so he could price gouge it.  trying to use Amazon Marketplace and some storage units to fuck over people that they're most vulnerable, like some kind of white trash Purdue pharmaceuticals or something.  Fuck that guy.  I gotta say, though, being from the rural South, I look at this guy and I see this short-sighted, heartless asshole who will gladly fuck over a desperate populace to further his own goals, and I... I just... I look forward to a Senate campaign.  Oh, but people are freaking out.  I don't know why, since this is clearly just a liberal conspiracy, right?  Yeah, a disease created by liberals in order to undermine Donald Trump because he was doing so good.  We all got together and we were like, man, this dude's crushing it, y'all.  We're never going to be able to win an election against such a competent, universally revered incumbent.  We're going to have to pull out the big guns.  You thinking what I'm thinking?  Armageddon play, right?  Yeah, okay, here we go.  Put them in right there.  Kill babies on three.  One, two, three.  It's hilarious to me seeing people call this a liberal conspiracy when this is clearly some God shit here, right?  I mean, a literal plague?  It's got God written all over it.  Y'all know damn well that if a Democrat was president right now, these motherfuckers would be hollering from every corner of Facebook about how coronavirus was clearly divine retribution sent by the Lord to punish us for all these gay sex food stamp parties we've been throwing.  But since they're in charge during this particular disaster, well, they're in mysterious ways mode.  Maybe they could just ask the Lord about it during this national day of prayer that Trump has just called for.  Yeah, that's right.  You know, let those other countries respond to this highly infectious disease with stuff like rigorous testing protocols if they want to.  But this is America.  And in America, when we got a viral contagion, we all join hands, whisper it to sky for a few minutes, bring our hands to our face, finish it off with one of these.  And we'll see how it plays out.  We feel pretty good about our thing.  As with most things where Trump is concerned, his attitude about this whole situation would be fucking hilarious if it wasn't so abjectly terrifying.  After he took office, he closed the division that Obama had set up specifically to deal with a pandemic like this.  I guess because he needed room for Space Force.  Why waste time on a hypothetical future disease when you could be combating the real threat, moon Muslims?  He also just tried to get the rights to a potential vaccine so that only America and no other country would have access to it.  Presumably because he heard there was a shred of goodwill left somewhere in the world for this festering husk of liberty and knew he had to snuff that shit out.  he just so clearly don't understand anything about this shit.  like he had direct contact with that brazilian dude who tested positive and when he was asked about it he was just like look i meet lots of people.  i don't even know that guy.  it's like you.  you know this is a disease and not a spurned lover right like it.  don't need to get to know you to harm you you fucking pylon.  he's just sitting in meetings with actual experts.  like is it true that The coronavirus cannot harm you if you do not invite it in.  No, sir, those are vampires.  So yeah, we have literally the worst possible person to have in charge during a plague, which is really saying something considering the guys who were in charge during the actual plague were like fucking inbred syphilitic dudes in capes who would have thought dental floss was witchcraft.  Like, the bar is really low for plague leaders.  And I think I would take one of them over what we have.  Like, if we brought one of those guys... forward in time put him in charge soon as he gets on there and starts hollering about like burn the dead salt the earth greet the pestilence with fire.  we're all just gonna be like.  well you know he's taking it seriously.  So yeah, we're not in a great spot, but I do think ultimately we'll be okay because it seems like everybody else who's in charge sort of collectively realized that Donald Trump was the president was just like, oh shit, we're going to have to do something.  And now we're all locked in our houses for a little while, you know, but we'll be all right.  Just hunker down, you know, stay safe.  Try not to panic.  Start a hobby.  If you, if you want, you can do what I've been doing.  Start watching people make cakes on the internet.  Y'all know how many different cakes are out there?  A shit load, man.  And the people that make them these days, fucking wizards, dude.  My favorite ones are the British ones because, like, they call the cookies biscuits and stuff, and when they fuck up, they say things like, well, that'll be the dogs that have finished in it.  And it's great.  It's so charming.  And they can take fucking flour and eggs and turn that into a goddamn edible dragon on the moon with sprinkles in its heart and shit.  It's fucking wild.  So, yeah, lock your door, turn on the cake show, hunker down, stay safe, we'll be all right, and I'll see y'all on the other side. ",
