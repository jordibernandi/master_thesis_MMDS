Listen to this.  In many ways, a big part of your calling, of your purpose, is beginning to tell you that you're ready.  You couldn't focus on your gifts before because you were too busy trying to stabilize the ship.  Rightfully so.  There was too much noise and confusion in your life.  But now the balance has been instilled, making room for the greater good of what was always meant for you.  Can you feel it?  You have many reasons to be here.  The next level is opening.  Wow.  I hope you believe that.  I hope you receive it.  I believe you will.  Love you. ",
