            "text": "Well, howdy there, Internet people.  It's Beau again.  So today we're going to talk about the first presidential debate, because that happened last night.  If you didn't watch it, I'll give you a quick recap.  But at the end of the day, there was really only one takeaway, one thing that mattered.  Everything else went pretty much as we would expect.  No real surprises.  A couple of moments that everybody was like, yep, knew that was going to happen.  But nothing really shocking.  Okay, so quick recap.  Yeah, as far as Biden's mental faculties, they're there.  They're there.  That wasn't true.  Big surprise.  I think we all knew that.  Trump attempted to bully and interrupt Biden at every opportunity.  I think we all knew that was coming.  No big surprise there.  Biden didn't take his bait.  No big surprise there.  Biden's been around a long time.  He saw that coming.  Trump floated a bunch of baseless theories.  No big surprise there.  That's who Trump likes to keep as his base.  Those who are easily influenced.  It's not a shock.  Didn't get a whole lot of pushback from Wallace on that, but more than expected, to be honest.  Um... Trump did refuse to condemn a certain group of people.  That was, I mean, it's not really a surprise.  We all knew it, but it was still kind of shocking to see it play out.  But I would suggest that if it is a surprise to you that Trump loves his racist fans, that, well, maybe you're not informed enough to be going anywhere on November 3rd.  That's a pretty well-known fact.  At the end of the day, the only real takeaway, the only real divide, the only real thing that we saw that I don't think anybody expected was how stark the difference is when it comes to encouraging people to vote.  Trump actively attempted to undermine the election and suppress the vote.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we know he does that, but it was pronounced.  Biden wanted to encourage people.  So why did Trump want to suppress it?  I think that's one of the most telling things in the debate, to be honest.  Because he knows his policies cost people their job.  He knows he's unpopular.  He knows his indecision and ineptitude.  led to the loss of family members.  He knows he destroyed the economy.  He knows he's a failure.  He knows that people don't support him.  Therefore, he's going to try to cast doubt on the election, undermine it and suppress a vote so he can say it's rigged.  So he can blame somebody else for his failures as he has done his entire administration.  Biden wants a high voter turnout.  He wants people to vote.  Why?  Because he knows Trump's policies cost people their jobs.  He knows he's unpopular.  He knows Trump's indecision costs people family members.  He knows he destroyed the economy.  He knows he's a failure.  He knows that people don't support Trump.  So he wants high voter turnout in the hopes of making the vote so lopsided that any legal challenges that Trump might push forward are... moot because the turnout is so high and it is so in Biden's favor that we can get this resolved quickly.  We don't have to wait months, as Trump kept saying.  Other than that single takeaway, it was the dumpster fire everybody expected.  It was the perfect debate for 2020.  I don't... I don't foresee these being very productive.  I don't think anybody's mind is really going to be changed by these.  It's a bunch of Trump interrupting, trying to display dominance with somebody who literally doesn't even care that he's on the stage, to be honest.  Biden was very dismissive of his attacks.  Biden... I think that there's a part of Biden that is embarrassed to be on the stage with Trump.  I can't say I blame him, to be honest.  That was the least presidential thing I've ever seen in my life.  And I don't really have a lot of high expectations for the behavior of presidents.  But Trump failed to meet any of them.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  You all have a good day. ",
