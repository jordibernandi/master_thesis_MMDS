Today, we just want to talk about the topic of healing in the church.  What is the role of divine healing, especially as we face a global pandemic?  Mic Response.  My name is Moira Widboom.  I'm on staff here at the International House of Prayer.  Today, we just want to talk about the topic of healing in the church.  What is the role of divine healing, especially as we face a global pandemic?  You know, Mike, I woke up this morning with the pain of the news that 5,000 more people had died in our country.  Overnight, 4,000 died last night, the night before.  Over 2 million people worldwide have been infected with the pandemic virus.  It just seems like if there was ever a time for healing to be manifesting in the church, it's now. ",

Matthew 11, 20-26 This is the main point of this passage.  It's right there.  In spite of Jesus, God himself, performing miracles, the people did not repent.  A really good question to ask is this.  If performing signs and wonders is the key to causing people to repent and believe, why did it fail when Jesus himself did it?  And if performing even more signs and wonders is needed, why didn't Jesus go back to all of those towns and just do more miracles?  Woe to you, Corazon!  Woe to you, Bethsaida!  For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and  ashes.\".  Jesus is condemning them for their unbelief.  And to drive home the point, he's saying that the most awful people that they knew about from the Old Testament days weren't even as bad as them.  Jesus is not saying, if everybody would just conjure up some more miracles, we could get everyone to believe.  This is so obvious.  He just did a whole ton of miracles and the people refused to repent and believe. ",
