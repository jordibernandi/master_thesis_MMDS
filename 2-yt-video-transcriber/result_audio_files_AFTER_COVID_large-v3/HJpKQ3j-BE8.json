            "text": "Here are some of the police audio of the Blake call, the Jacob Blake call.  It turns out that the police were called to the situation knowing there was a man there with an open warrant who was apparently harassing a woman and stealing her keys.  So no, he was not there apparently by the police audio to break up a fight.  He was not a good Samaritan.  He resisted arrest.  We don't know what was in his hand.  You don't walk away from the cops while they're pointing guns at your back and then reach into your car unless you want to get shot.  That is an idiotic move.  It doesn't mean that this is a fully justified shooting.  It means it's going to be very difficult to prosecute police officers when literally you buck the police officers off your back Walk away from them while you're under.  There's an open warrant for his arrest, right?  They're arresting him.  He bucks the police officers off his back and then he walks around the side of his car and reaches into the car.  Hey, there's an open warrant out for domestic abuse and he's got three kids in the back of the car.  What are they supposed to do?  Let him go.  Explain this to me.  Seriously, explain this to me.  But apparently this is worthy of burning down the entire city of Kenosha and every major politician in America claiming that this is an incident of police brutality and police racism.  Here are some of the radio scanner audio of the Blake call that caused the police to show up in the first place.  13707, 2805 40th Street, 2805 40th Street.  Complaint says Jacob Blake isn't supposed to be there and he took the complaint to.  Okay, within 40 seconds, the rescuers were on their way.  That's why Jacob Blake is still alive.  Okay, so they knew that he was a felon.  There was an open warrant for him.  The 911 was called because he had stolen keys from a woman.  This was not the case of innocent black man being pulled over by the police for no reason, complying with all police orders and then being shot for his trouble.  That is not what this case was.  Not from the beginning.  Not now.  But it doesn't matter because our media and our politicians have an interest in polarizing the debate and suggesting that America is systemically racist.  And thus, every flashpoint shooting that is caught on tape is evidence of police racism.  This has driven piece of human debris, Sean King, an absolutely awful human being, to tweet out and Bernie Sanders delegate, by the way, to the Kenosha Police Department.  If you do not name the officer who brutally shot Jacob Blake on Sunday, we will simply begin naming officers from your department who may or may not be him.  F it.  Your protection of his identity is unethical.  What's his name?  Well, maybe they're not naming him because pieces of crap like Sean King are then going to activate a bunch of people to harass the police officer in the absence of evidence and the absence of an investigation.  Maybe because this mob justice is no justice at all.  It's just garbage people doing garbage things.  Maybe it's that, Sean King.  And by the way, the fact that Sean King is doing this is unbelievable considering that there is a person who actually committed suicide not all that long ago because Sean King misidentified him as a particular criminal.  According to ABC13.com, this is just last year, Robert Paul Cantrell, 49, was found by staff at the Montgomery County Jail early on Tuesday, July 29th.  He was found dead in his cell.  He was hanged in an apparent suicide.  Staff tried to revive him and perform CPR.  He was in jail on a charge of robbery evading.  He was wrongly accused in the shooting death of a seven-year-old earlier this year.  Why?  Because Sean King put up a Twitter post of his picture.  It was the wrong guy.  So definitely, I want Sean King to be in charge of mob justice in the United States.  Great move, everybody.  Really, really strong stuff here.  Mob justice is no justice.  Social justice, by the way, is also no justice.  Individual justice is the only kind of justice that matters.  But have you noticed that people are studiously avoiding individual justice?  We don't look at the individual circumstances of cases.  All we do is we look at the color of the people involved and then make a snap decision on what exactly happened.  I don't know what happened in these shootings last night.  You don't either yet.  We'll find out.  I don't have all the details on Jacob Blake, but I'm happy to wait until all the details come out.  You know what nobody else is happy to do?  Wait until all the details come out.  They have a preexisting narrative by which mob justice and social justice matter more than individual justice.  The minute you add any modifier to justice other than the word individual, you are now part of the bad guy crew.  You are the problem, not the solution.  Individual justice is the solution, not collective justice, not social justice, and certainly not the mob justice that we are seeing right now.  Jamal Bowman, who is a person who's about to enter Congress.  He just took over Elliott Engel's seat in the primary.  He's one of the new members of the squad.  Here's what he tweeted out.  We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to condemn the armed militias that killed two people in Kenosha yesterday while working in tandem with local police.  These militias are domestic terrorists looking to incite a race war.  Protecting private property is cover for their agenda.  So in other words, if you showed up and you protected your own private property, according to Jamal Bowman, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden should condemn you.  But if you're there to burn down somebody's store, well, then you're a member of the good guy crew.  Solid, solid stuff.  We're going to get to more of this.  Honestly, the Republican National Convention should just show this crap on a loop, on a loop.  Just forget the convention.  Two hours tonight should just be dedicated to showing this stuff on a loop.  Because this is the choice right now.  Cave to this mob or don't cave to the mob.  As we'll see, the mob is coming to your suburb soon.  Again, there are real consequences to this sort of insanity.  consequences on a life basis.  I mean, people were shot last night in Kenosha, not by the cops.  And they were shot last night.  There are consequences to business.  There's a place called Gravity Gaming Lounge that posted this on Facebook last night.  Quote, for those that heard, we got looted.  Everything in the store was taken.  The place was destroyed.  For a business that was struggling to get back to normal and pushing through these hard times, we will not be able to come back from this.  The damage to our building, the cost to replace the exterior damage and to top it off to replace everything stolen is going to be catastrophic.  As we look to see the total cost at this point, we'll be closing down completely.  This is what happens in cities when you allow all of this crap to happen, when all of this crap is allowed to run roughshod.  Where the mob rules, again, chaos follows.  And that is what you're seeing.  And you're seeing it spread into the suburbs.  This is not relegated to high crime areas anymore.  You're starting to see people being harassed in public places.  Remember that time when it was just about.  if you're a Trump official, we're going to yell at you at a restaurant?  Well, no longer.  Now we're just going to yell at you no matter where you are.  There was an unbelievable tape yesterday of a crew of people harassing a woman at a Washington, D.C.  outdoor restaurant.  She's just sitting there.  By the way, she says that she's repeatedly marched with Black Lives Matter.  She just was not going to be bullied into doing anything by a mob.  So good for her.  Good for her.  Well done, everybody here in the crowd.  Apparently, one of the people who was doing this crap was a writer for Deadspin.  His name was Modiano.  His name was Modiano Modiano.  And this Modiano character, Chuck Modiano, he decided that he couldn't understand why she was the only diner in the area who wouldn't comply with the demand.  What was in you?  You couldn't do this?  And Victor, who's an urban planner, the woman's name is Victor.  Her name is Lauren B. Victor.  She said, I felt I was under attack.  She said that there was something wrong about being coerced to show support.  She said, I wasn't actually frightened.  I didn't think they'd do anything to me.  I'm very much with them.  I've been marching with them for weeks and weeks and weeks.  But here's Captain Deadspin over here, bullying a woman and getting in her face and screaming in her face in the middle of a COVID pandemic.  So solid stuff here from your BLM crew.  This island is violent!  This island is violent!  This island is violent!  This island is violent!  This island is violent!  So we get malice shaming mobs.  This is really exciting stuff.  So now the law is on the side of the mob.  It's on the side of the bullies.  Some of the great heroes in American history are people who withstood the mob to stand up for their rights.  People like John Lewis literally withstood a racist mob to sit and just take a milkshake at a lunch counter.  That is great American heroism.  Now the same people claiming John Lewis's mantle are trying to shout people into submission and bully them into putting up a fist.  If you're trying to claim John Lewis's mantle and you're doing that, you're a piece of crap.  Meanwhile, more people were being threatened at dining yesterday.  Here's another tape from Washington,  D.C.,  where people were being mobbed and shouted at for the great crime of not raising a fist in solidarity with this Marxist BLM organization.  Here we go.  How delightful.  Apparently, the people being bullied here also work with people who have mental instability.  I'm not kidding.  Mental instability issues, disproportionately minority.  Those are the people being screamed at here.  That is what social media has found.  So, again, incredibly, incredibly well done.  And, of course, things have not let up in Portland.  Last night in Portland, things continued to be riotous.  There were more riots in Portland last night.  The governor of Oregon was like, you know, it'd be great if you stop this violence.  Oh, has that occurred to you?  We're now three months in.  And in Seattle, according to my friend Jason Rant over at KTTH, Seattle rioters used a substance suspected to be quick-dry concrete to seal shut the door to the East Precinct, the Seattle Police Department has confirmed.  And then a rioter attempted to set fire to the building after concreting people in the building.  Now, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives is working with the Seattle PD on this investigation.  Rioters assaulted Seattle's East Precinct on Monday night.  This marked another night of violent criminal activism against police officers unconnected to anger over a recent police shooting in Wisconsin.  According to KTTH, as some in the crowd vandalized the building and tormented police, others brought quick-dry cement to seal police officers inside the building.  So just wonderful, wonderful behavior all the way around.  Good thing that they slashed the salary of the police chief in Seattle, Carmen Best, forcing her to quit.  The black female police chief of Seattle was now quit.  So all of this, it turns out, is not redounding to the benefit of Democrats, which led Don Lemon to say the quiet part out loud, which is, guys, the rioting and the looting were all fine.  And, you know, the beating of people in the streets and the bullying, all of that was fine.  But now people are starting to become aware.  So probably Joe Biden should say something about it.  Here is Don Lemon saying, oh, you know, it was fine until it started to affect the Democrats poll numbers. ",

And so unless someone comes up with a solution over the next 73 days or 70, so however many days, 68 days, 68 days.  So it's not going to, the problem is not going to be fixed by then, but what they can do.  And I think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it.  I'm not sure.  Maybe he won't.  Maybe he is.  He's got to address it. ",

            "text": "He shouldn't.  He should address it, not because it's bad.  You see, he should address it because it's going to affect his poll numbers.  You see, the narrative must always be maintained.  When Joe Biden addresses it, what he should discuss is systemic American racism.  Of course, that's the real problem.  He should discuss systemic American racism and why it's leading to rioting and looting.  So there are no words for the media are complicit in this kind of crap, by the way.  I'm going to get to that in a second because the media are absolutely complicit.  They are pushing it.  They continue to push false narratives about police action in the absence of evidence.  They've been doing it for literally years.  Every major incident of the last five years probably has been misconstrued by the media originally without waiting for any of the available facts.  actively misconstrued by the media.  Every single one.  I'm struggling to think of one that has not been misconstrued.  Maybe the only one I can think of is Philando Castile.  That is the only one that I can think of that has not been actively misconstrued or miscovered by the media.  The Freddie Gray situation in Baltimore was considered an act of police racism.  The autopsy found that the police did not, in fact, beat Freddie Gray to death or purposefully kill Freddie Gray.  The Eric Garner incident was considered an act of police racism, despite the fact that the sergeant on duty and who was watching over all of it was black.  And the fact that Eric Garner died of the fact of his preexisting conditions.  He did not actually die of being choked out in that particular situation.  I mean, he should have died.  But the original details are not the original story.  The Rayshard Brooks shooting is a situation where a man took a taser, tased two cops, wrestled them to the ground and then was shot for his trouble.  The Michael Brown shooting was not a situation of a black man surrendering to police.  Hands up, don't shoot.  It was a lie.  It was a lie from the beginning.  The media went with it anyway.  It's difficult to think of a situation where the media did not miscover the situation dramatically and in the wrong direction from the very outset, declaring that it was a symptom of deeper underlying American racism.  And we're watching that right now in a variety of cases, in a variety of cases.  I'll get to more details on that in just one second.  The deep irresponsibility of our media that have one job, and that is to actively report the facts, not to report a narrative, not to report the 1619 Project's lies about America, to report the fact.  And their abject irresponsibility and refusal to do so is leading to what we are seeing in the streets right now.
