I'm going to tell you about that here in a moment, but just to show you where we are, I'm going to get our videographer to sort of turn around, and you'll be able to see, oh look, in Kentucky.  It's not on the mountains of Ararat, it's in Kentucky, and it's the life-size Noah's Ark.  So we're at Ararat Ridge Zoo and I know kids love these animal programs and we have a really, really special program today.  We like to do some different things.  I mean, we show you animals on occasion just to for you to understand from a design perspective and a biblical worldview perspective, something about the animals we have here at Ararat Ridge Zoo and also the Creation Museum.  And then we also want to do a lot of behind the scenes stuff too to tell you what goes on, to look after all these animals and to enable a zoo like this to operate.  But today, well, have you ever seen on television, they have those vet programs like the incredible Dr.  Pohl.  They have those sort of exciting programs where they follow the veterinarian around and he goes and there's a sick cow and then there's a sick horse or something or other and then he has to go.  you know, deliver some animal or whatever it happens to be.  Sarah Jo, you know what I'm talking about, right?  Yes, I do.  Okay, so you're going to be our Dr.  Pohl today. ",

So on top of different medications and different specific diet for Sheba, she also gets acupuncture.  So what that does is help promote blood flow to that area to help it grow.  And I can take Ms.  Jeze.  so she's out of the way.  Come here, Jeze.  Good girl.  So like I said, the acupuncture is gonna help her heal from that foundered situation.  But when we first introduced acupuncture to Sheba, she wasn't a huge fan of it.  So what we do is some desensitizing.  So Brittany has a toothpick in her hand and she's just gonna lightly poke her everywhere where the acupuncturist would put those needles in.  So he puts those needles in and then they stay there for 25 minutes.  And that stimulates that area to bring that blood flow and relieve some pain.  So right now we're not causing any pain at all.  She's just getting a couple toothpicks to her feet.  and then she gets treats. ",

There's some new people in here, so she might be a little weary, but we'll see.  Hey, Miss Neftali, would you like your medicine?  No?  Here.  Good girl.  And see, she just grabs onto that herself and takes it.  And that's really easy for us to be able to take care of her in that way. ",

And Miss Zakana had a reoccurring issue of laying too many eggs.  Oh, really?  And what can happen is they can get a blockage, which will make them really sick.  And when they're laying those eggs that constantly, they're basically immunosuppressed.  So they're more prone to developing other issues because of that.  So what we did with her is we actually had her spayed.  So just like you have your dog and cat spayed, she was spayed.  And if Rudy wants to pick her up and show you guys, she's soaking in a bath right now.  but you can actually see this line on her tummy.

So if you guys can see her, Miss Zilla is a leopard gecko, and she doesn't look like most other leopard geckos because of her tail.  So these guys normally have a really long tail like you might be able to see in this picture.  and they store all their fat in that tail.  but it's a really cool adaptation because if a predator were to grab onto that tail they can actually voluntarily drop it and a lot goes into that.  vasoconstriction has to happen.  so that way they don't bleed out that undetached tail can continue to wiggle around for a good 30 minutes to keep the predator distracted while they make a quick getaway.  So that's really awesome.  They can do that up to five times.  Now, Mozilla unfortunately came to us with an infection in her tail, and we were trying everything.  She was even getting antibiotic injections, which on an animal this small is pretty hard to do.  But we tried everything we could to save that tail, and unfortunately, we just couldn't.  So the same vet who did our surgery on our other two bearded dragons anesthetized this tiny little leopard gecko and had to amputate that tail because it was infected.  And now since that tail was artificially removed, the vet wasn't sure if the tail would regrow.  But you can see she's actually got a little nubbin of a tail growing back.  So it's not exactly the same as a normal tail would be.  She's still storing a lot of her fat in there.  But yeah, it's probably going to stop right there.  It's been like that for about two years now.  Yeah, so it's reached its limit. ",

But we have a lot of animals behind the scenes.  You call them ambassador animals?  Yes.  And we have workshops for kids.  For instance, we have overnights at the Ark and the Creation Museum.  and then you have other special programs where they'll see these ambassador animals.  and now with our new animal actor stage here too you'll be able to use some of the ambassador animals there as well.  so there's a lot of animals that you won't necessarily see when you come to our at ridge zoo but if you go to the workshops or the animal actor stage you'll see them.
