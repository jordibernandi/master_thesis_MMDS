            "text": "Bye.  Hello everyone and welcome to the Vortex, where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  I'm Michael Voris.  Let's cut through all the garbage and the platitudes about a nation mourning a trailblazing jurist.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a stone-cold killer who sent tens of millions of children to their deaths before they ever saw the light of day.  All this talk about her nice, sweet demeanor is nothing more than talk.  And from a theological point of view, consider this.  A few days ago, when she closed her eyes on this life and opened them up on the next , she would have been met, in part, by that throng of millions and millions of children she was instrumental in executing.  She went from being a judge to being judged.  And unlike what she wielded, the divine judge deals strictly in justice, not agendas which pervert justice.  This evil woman conflated women's rights to include murdering a child in the womb.  She twisted the dignity of the feminine to open a door for the demonic.  And while we can't know for certain, there's only a few reasons to presume she is not a slave to that demonic now for all eternity.  Hell, Satan, the demons, they have no regard for whether you were once on the most powerful court in the land.  But since we're talking about a justice and her own personal judgment and trial before the divine judgment seat, let's think about a few things, shall we?  First, as will be the case for all of us, every last one, Satan, the accuser, will be there, as he was with RGB, accusing her.  Ponder for a moment what the diabolical prosecutor would have been accusing her of.  child murder by the tens of millions, the perversion of natural law, the law of God the Creator, who uncomfortably and inconveniently for her was also the same Creator sitting on the judgment seat.  It's one thing to sin, to even embrace sin.  It is something of an entirely different magnitude to create an environment and sustain that environment where an entire nation, hundreds and hundreds of millions of people over decades embrace that sin, all as part of your own twisted worldview.  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.  And for the record, woe is not the word any of us wants coming up at our individual judgments before Almighty God.  As in any court or trial, evidence is presented, testimony and so forth.  Let's return to that multitude of witnesses to her evil, the victims of her ideology.  Children torn to shreds in their mothers' wombs, ribboned into little pieces in a swirl of blood and gore, sucked out through a vacuum hose with thin razor blades on the end.  Those souls had only a moment's existence compared to her nearly 90 years, yet she saw fit to keep the wheels of the child-killing factory turning, well-oiled, with no exceptions.  Not one single child in the womb was safe from this megalomaniac's monstrous contortion of natural law.  The Marxists can go on and on all they want in this life about her legacy, but before the divine judgment seat, this would have been her legacy, testified to by tens of millions of victims.  She pronounced judgment on their bodies in this life, but they were there in the next as judgment was pronounced on her soul.  Let's go even further into this.  Of course, we do not know with certainty what her judgment was, but that does not lift the duty of pondering about heaven and hell for every human being who has ever existed will be in one or the other.  Pay attention, Bishop Barron.  For a soul to be saved, that soul must die in a state of grace, of sanctifying grace.  No exceptions.  That means they must have the life of the Blessed Trinity in them.  If you love me, you will keep my commandments, and my Father and I will come to you and we will make our home in you.  A state, an existence of having Father, Son, and Spirit living in you, dwelling in you.  But this state has not just stumbled upon.  It doesn't just happen after a person has achieved the age of reason.  It must be acted on, chosen, desired, cooperated in, and with.  And its purpose is to increase, to grow in holiness until we are brought at last into perfect holiness.  in the beatific vision, the beholding of God in the face.  No one stumbles or trips into heaven.  You must carry your cross, suffer, die to your passions, forsake evil, struggle to cooperate with the life of Christ in you so that you can move from a state of fallenness to the heights of the supernatural.  We are, in short, fighting for heaven .  Part of the fight demands a rejection of sin, even though it still frequently holds an attraction for us.  That's why confession exists.  But note, absolution and confession in the sacrament, being forgiven of your sins, of our sins, requires a turning away from, a pronouncement from us that we detest them because of how abhorrent they are before God.  Such an acknowledgment is a movement toward holiness, toward God.  It also requires a promise that as we leave the confessional, we will strive not to sin again.  So, forgiveness is conditional.  Of course it is.  God's love for us is unconditional, but salvation is not.  Salvation comes with many conditions, and the rejection and walking away from sin, at least the sincere promise to, is one of those conditions.  So it becomes a point of contemplation in light of Ginsberg's death, indeed for all of us, that at our judgments, one factor weighing in the balance of our eternal destiny is, given the opportunity to have continued living, would we have changed?  The good thief certainly did.  We know that from our Lord's own words.  Had he been taken down from the cross by some last-minute act of mercy by Pilate and nursed back to health, would he have amended his life and turned from his sins?  Yes, he had a true deathbed conversion.  Amen.  But what about the soul who's brought before the judgment seat by Michael, the angel of death, who, if she had been given more years, would not have turned from her sin?  Precisely in what divine calculus could such a soul be saved?  Is it reasonable to assume that had Hitler been granted another century of life on earth and was somehow spared over those ensuing decades of the breakdown of the body that he retained the vigor of youth or middle age, that he would somehow have turned from mass killer and bringer of war to a spokesman for peace?  And likewise for Joseph Stalin, even more so, in fact, for Joseph Stalin.  Had our Lord extended his life and likewise extended his physical strength for another hundred years, would he have abandoned his plans for world domination by godless Marxism?  Would he at some point have donned sackcloth and ashes and made reparation for the killing of tens of millions of people, for the enslavement of whole nations?  The proof, as they say, is in the pudding.  Why would we assume that someone who dies in a state of sin with blood on his or her hands, who probably because of the killing sent others to hell before they might have repented, why would anyone assume such a person might be saved?  It isn't enough to say, well, we don't know, even though we don't.  We do know the sum of their lives, and in some case, we know their dying wishes, at least their last expressed ones.  Just before he died, pro-abortion Senator Ted Kennedy, fake Catholic, dictated a letter from his deathbed, or so we are told by family.  In that letter, he expressed his desire that the U.S.  Senate pass Obamacare with all of its provisions for abortion and contraception and the payment for abortion by taxpayers, even over their good conscience objections.  His letter, in fact, became something of a rallying cry for his fellow child killers in the U.S.  Senate to pass Obamacare, which of course they did.  As far as the world knows, that is the state Ted Kennedy died in.  Possible he changed his mind, repented in his heart with his last breath.  We can only hope.  But emphasis on hope.  We may not think it because there is not a thing to suggest it.  There is nothing to inform our intellects with that any such occurrence happened.  Turning back to the matter of RBG, we are told, as is the case with Kennedy, that she too expressed what amounts to a dying wish that her seat, it's not really her seat, be filled by someone other than Trump.  With, of course, what everyone understands to mean, and she certainly intended to mean, someone who would keep the child killing going.  This is, after all, all about abortion.  Nowhere was there any remorse for her crimes against God, not a breath of repentance for the millions, tens of millions of young lives she crushed and snuffed out beneath her murderous ideology and the ideology of those who celebrated her in life and now in death.  But those tripping all over themselves to praise her cannot see her in her likely present state.  And let's be honest here.  She was either saved or damned.  And no one who is spiritually honest can lay their odds on the former.  We can hope, without reason, she was saved.  In fact, some members of the staff and I were out eating when the news hit our phones.  And after the first few immediate seconds of shock, we did exactly what good Catholics do and our Lord demands.  We prayed for her.  Ginsburg was ultimately an enemy of truth in this life.  The tens of millions of hers and others' victims were brought before the throne of God at her judgment so she could see the fullness of her evil choices in this life.  She would not admit or confront her evil in this life, so she was made to do so in the next.  Those others will likewise face their own judgments, and when their time comes, that same cloud of witnesses will be assembled, called upon yet again to appear and be a living testimony against their evil.  What a horror.  all of this is to even think about, even briefly.  But justice and truth demand this all be said.  The godless have the media, and they want no talk of things divine, and certainly not of the next world of actual justice.  Ginsburg lived a life fundamentally opposed to the truth, even if every now and then she did manifest some small modicum of judicial restraint or even handedness.  When it mattered, she sided with evil, against truth, meaning against Christ.  Well, now she has stood before Christ, as every single human being will do, including Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry, Dick Durbin, John Roberts, AOC, and the hordes of other power-hungry politicians and jurists who will see their role model, King Herod, in the fires of hell if they do not repent before their deaths.  But the truly earth-shaking reality is that many of these people do not believe they have anything to repent from.  At some point, some point, way back, earlier in their lives, they might have, somewhere back up the road, they knew somewhere inside themselves what they were doing was wrong, that they were slaughtering good on the altar of evil for their own careers.  Somewhere later in their lives, because of the monstrosity of their sins, they killed their consciences or so nearly killed them.  that truth, God, no longer has access to them.  He knocks.  He never stops knocking.  They simply refuse to open.  So be it.  In what should be taken as a terrifying message, consider chapter 11 of Ecclesiastes.  Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, wherever it falls, there shall it lie.  Things go the way they go, and where they go, according to their natures, regardless of the accolades of those who still on earth, who will nevertheless shortly follow them down below.  If Ginsburg did indeed go to hell, she has barely concluded her first hundred hours of torment.  That will never end.  For the damned, the horror of that reality comes crashing back on them.  No matter how intense the torment, no matter how tremendous the agony, there is no escape.  However, accepting of the pain or accustomed to the pain a soul might become, we're speaking figuratively here, It suddenly intensifies at the repeated realization that 100 hours means absolutely nothing because there is no time and there is no relief.  This never ends.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.  Do everything you can do in this life.  Endure whatever you must, but escape those fires of hell.  Nothing in this life, nothing is worth eternal damnation.  God love you.  I'm Michael Voris. ",
