I feel that my rights have been completely removed.  On Twitter, the police declared, protesting is a non-essential activity.  And they arrested this woman.  But wait a second.

The jury's still out on Sweden's experiment.  More than a thousand Swedes have died, five times the deaths per capita as in neighboring Norway.  But if Swedes acquire herd immunity, their death rate will be the first to drop.  Other European countries have also concluded that lockdowns are not sustainable.  Germany just freed retail stores from the lockdown.  Denmark reopened classrooms.  Norway's students will return in coming weeks.  And Austria is reopening shops to people who wear masks on May 1st.  That seems smarter than the absolute shutdown promoted by many American authorities.  If we see continued noncompliance, they'll wind up facing misdemeanor charge.  and DWP will step in and shut off their water and power.  Shut off their water?  Let's be sensible about this.
