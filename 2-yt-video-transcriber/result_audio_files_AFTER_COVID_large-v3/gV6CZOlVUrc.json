            "text": "Hey, it's Aaron, and today we're going to be continuing a little bit more with my How Anarcho-Communism Works series.  And today we're specifically going to be talking about abolishing the state and hierarchy.  So, with all of that being said, let's get into it.  Okay, let me stop you right there.  Isn't being an anarchist and a communist an oxymoron?  Isn't that basically impossible?  I mean, how can you have communism without a state to implement your policies?  How can you be against all government?  well actually i'm not.  anarchists make a distinction between the state and government.  the state is seen as a centralized body with the monopoly of force that often solely controls the military education and laws.  it works as a tool of domination for an elite class to gain and maintain control.  Anarchists see the state as an unjustified hierarchy and want to abolish it.  Government, on the other hand, is not rejected by anarchists, but in fact embraced as a form of organization of the people.  And leftists and anarchists are often highly organized.  We just desire to use a form of organization that doesn't function from the top down, but rather from the bottom up.  as an individual named thought slime once put it an anarchist believes that authority does not justify itself and must meet the burden of proof required to demonstrate that it is both necessary and beneficial or else be dismantled and replaced with a more egalitarian alternative.  And we can do this by looking at all of the examples of hierarchies that we've had in the past, and seeing what is beneficial and what isn't.  I mean, we've been doing this hierarchy thing for a long time, so we have a lot of examples to choose from.  And we can even use something called dialectical materialism to critically analyze these modes scientifically.  In this way, anarchy can be used as a type of scientific dismantling of power structure.  Hmm... But I thought the idea of anarchism was no rules, basically everyone does whatever they like, and nobody's in control.  Well, yes and no.  Typically the word anarchism is used that way, but historically, and in economic terms, it's just not the case.  Think of the word theory.  We generally use the word theory to mean an untested hunch or a guess without supporting evidence.  But scientifically, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can incorporate laws, hypothesis, and facts.  It basically means the complete opposite of what you think it means, and the word anarchism is the same way.  The word anarchy comes from the medieval Latin word anarchia and from the ancient Greek word anarchos, which essentially means without ruler.  And anarchy, as a political ideology, falls in that same vein.  Think of it more like without a king, not without rules.  When we abolished the feudal system and got rid of kings and queens, we transferred the power that they had to the people through the use of democracy.  The people basically wanted to be without rulers.  Anarchia.  Okay, but then why do we consider anarchy to be chaos and violence nowadays if it's actually an ordered system that goes back to ancient times, basically explaining how the people can function without anybody controlling them?  Hmm.  Well, that is interesting, isn't it?  That an ideology that could explain to the average person how they could function without some sort of ruler or owner telling them what to do would be drenched in so much misinformation and confusion.  It's almost as though if we lie and talk disparagingly about political ideologies and systems that can genuinely help the people, it can help to manufacture the idea in everyone's head that it's actually a bad thing and shouldn't be considered at all.  Almost.  Almost like that.  But the fact remains that anarchism is not and has never been a lawless, chaotic society.  It's quite the opposite.  Anarchy can be highly structured and is extremely organized.  The only thing is that we happen to organize things a little bit differently.  Let me give you an example.  An American business.  An American business is a perfect example of an unjustified hierarchy.  In a typical American business, you have a person at the top that makes all of the decisions, usually the owner or a general manager or a CEO, and that person dictates his orders to middle management, supervisors, or the foreman.  Then those people dictate their orders to the workers.  It's a clear pyramid-shaped hierarchy, something that we are fundamentally used to in our daily lives.  But if we look more closely at this structure, you'll notice that it's identical to the same sort of system that we had with kings and queens in feudalism.  You have the CEO and his board of directors, or king and his court, sitting at the top, with his middle management lords and ladies following the orders and dictating to all of the employee serfs who do all of the actual work.  But why do we do things this way?  I thought that we got rid of the need for kings and queens and royalty when we abolished the feudal system.  But here we are.  We have this little kingdom in every single business with a little tiny king at the top stealing all of your wealth.  It looks like this situation needs a little bit more anarchia.  So anarchists propose instead of having a boss or a CEO or a king, owning all of the land that you tend to work on, making all of the decisions and dictating orders at you every single day of your life, we believe that you, the worker, should own all of the land that you work on and make all of the decisions that affect your everyday life.  We want to finally remove that king.  And then we will live all happily ever after.  After the end.  Anyway, that's my show.  My name is Aaron.
