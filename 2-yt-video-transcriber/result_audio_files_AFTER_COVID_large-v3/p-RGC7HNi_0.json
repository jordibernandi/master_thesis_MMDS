            "text": "Hey, welcome to Viking Preparedness.  I am Pastor Joe Fox.  Let's get this angle great.  Sister Kate is using my tripod to do a live stream.  I want you to really think about something.  And I'm interested in your comments.  I'm interested in your thoughtful thoughts.  Agreement disagreement addition to that kind of thing.  Let's discuss this shall we?  OODA loop.  We're not discussing OODA loop just setting the stage.  observe orient decide act.  We're observing a lot of things, but I don't think we've truly oriented on them yet.  I Don't think we've put the pieces together as clearly and as sharply as perhaps we should.  Normalcy bias.  Things have always been this way.  They're always going to be this way.  This has never happened.  It's not going to happen here.  Refusal to contemplate the unthinkable.  Antifa.  was forms in nineteen thirty two.  they were part of the communist movement in germany and they were anti-fascists and they were street fighters.  and so there are communists based organization and the communists have had their fingers in it starting with stalin into antifa from the beginning.  i've got notes here So I want to make sure I cover everything.  Think about what Antifa has been doing here in the last couple months.  They have had, they've been conducting and have had coordinated attacks throughout the country.  Protests, and they're organizing them, they're directing them, and they're coordinating them.  There has been massive destruction.  in dollars, in areas, and industry, things like that.  Interesting, isn't it?  They're a communist organization, and so many mom-and-pop shops and things are being destroyed.  Capitalism, right, at its core.  They are threatening... And, you know, a lot of people got breathless about it, about coming out into the countryside and killing rural people's animals and burning down, you know, farmhouses, isolated farmhouses.  I believe this is a psyop for now to get buzzed, to get people thinking, to get people afraid.  But they are threatening to do that.  And latest reports... is that, and they're saying they're doing this, and other people are saying they're afraid they're going to do it.  I don't know if anyone said they've actually seen them do this, but canvassing neighborhoods for where the police live, noting where the police live so that they can attack the police and their families, which, by the way, is an awesome tactic.  But we're going to get to that.  But think about that.  They're saying we are creating dossiers.  to go and kill policemen's families and destroy their homes and things like that.  Put that on the shelf for a second.  Black Lives Matter, not an old organization, formed by three strange women, what, 2013, something like that.  They are have been deeply involved in these protests.  They have attacked, attacked police stations, burnt them, trashed cars, you know, again, lots of violent destruction of property.  They're behind a new movement which is gaining legs to defund the police, which means eliminate the police, get rid of the police as an institution.  And now, because a lot of people are like, well, in the last week, well, what are we going to do without police?  Because they do form, excuse me, provide an important service.  They said, oh, we're advocating the formation of armed community policing groups.  You know, some people call those vigilantes.  The press would call them vigilantes or militia.  And I guess we're going to switch gears there.  I told you about Antifa and what they've been doing and what they say they're planning.  Imagine, reimagine the police, right?  Imagine if you will.  Seriously, I want you to imagine this.  I want you to try and this is where I want your thoughts.  I want you to try and imagine this.  What if... The American Nazi Party, a contemporary of Antifa, right?  They formed at the same time.  Antifa was basically formed to fight against them.  was organizing huge riots all over the country, was targeting businesses and destroying them and looting them, was threatening to create dossiers on police and we're going to kill the police and the, what do they call them, ZOGs, Zionist Occupation Government.  We're going to go after the agents of ZOG.  And what else did I say they were doing?  Oh, and if they said, we're going to come to the countryside and get all the race traders, you know, whatever, the people in the countryside, we're going to burn their houses and kill them.  And they were having success on the level that Antifa has been having success over the last couple months.  Imagine if something like that was actually happening.  What would the government at all levels response be?  All we've done is change the name of the actor.  It's not Antifa, it's the whatever, the American Nazi Party or whatever they call themselves.  But they're doing the same things.  What if?  What do you think the response of the government, local, state, federal, What do you think the FBI, the ATF, and Homeland Security would be doing with those groups and that information at that point?  Again, advocating in this scenario the same results as Antifa doing the same things Antifa is doing.  What if, imagine if you will, some white power organization.  You know, the skinheads and the Nazis and the KKK.  White Lives Matter.  But if they called themselves White Lives Matter.  What if they were burning down police stations, staging huge riots, participating in it, putting people up front while other people ran amok in their formation, again, looting and burning.  What if they advocated doing away with the law enforcement in this country and replacing it instead with white power armed patrols?  in the neighborhood and they were having the successes that we've seen BLM have heretofore.  What do you think the government would be doing about that?  What actions do you think the government would do?  Think about that.  The system is allowing this.  They are allowing it.  Some might say they're facilitating it.  Because all you have to do is change the names of the actors, but put the same outcomes, the same words in the other side's mouths, and you know that this would be different.  Again, do not take this video, and I'm not saying anyone did the last one, and run with it and say, Pastor Joe's a white supremacist skinhead.  Well, I am a skinhead, sort of, by nature.  Nazi, whatever.  I'm not.  I'm just saying I'm trying to draw a contrast, a strong contrast, and I think I've done that.  And some of you have already knee-jerked, I'm sure.  But all you got to do is look at the two and say, this is how they're dealing with this, but they're not, this is how they would deal with that.  They had one guy living up on his own in the mountains of Idaho.  They tried to entrap him into infiltrating Aryan nations because they were so afraid of this little group of people that met up on a compound in the Idaho wilderness or whatever.  And that didn't go the way they thought it would.  And they ended up shooting his wife in the face.  From 70 yards away.  Because the FBI had done a psychological profile on that family and decided that Vicki Weaver was the core that held that family together.  That's why they took her out.  That was for one little dude, man.  Way to go, U.S.  Marshals SOG and FBI HRT.  Right?  One person.  What do you think they would do if these people were all over the place burning stuff and shooting stuff and advocating killing cops?  It would be totally different response.  I'm telling you, I think not only are the powers that be allowing this, they're facilitating it.  Now, I had a discussion the other day.  We can call it a discussion.  a back-and-forth of communication with John Mosby, who has an article coming out soon, and we were just bouncing ideas off of each other, and I agreed with him on almost everything.  I don't... Well, whatever.  It doesn't matter.  I agree with almost everything.  But what we do agree on is because we both went to the same schools, we've had the same experiences, we know... Insurrection, insurgency, counterinsurgency, how to fight it.  We have both participated in programs on both sides of that coin.  That's kind of a pun.  On both sides of that coin.  Working with the insurgents, working with the government to counter the insurgents.  We understand what's going on here.  There is an insurgency going, not brewing.  in this country.  When you remove the forces of the state, the security apparatus, When you make them look inefficient and unable to protect the populace, one thing gorillas will do is they will go into an area and they will blow up the water and they'll blow up the electricity and they'll drop the electrical lines and they'll just create misery for the people in that area.  Now you would think, and these are tried and true techniques, you would think that the people would turn against those bad little dirty gorillas that came out of the jungle and did all this infrastructure damage and side with the forces of the state to fight them so that we can get our nice comfortable life back.  But that's not what happens because at the same time they got guys doing that, they have the non-violent guys, right?  they're legal.  uh they're the front of the political aspect of what's going on.  uh they're going around telling the people look these forces of the state cannot protect us.  you need to let us come in and we will make everything right.  the grass is greener on the other side.  help us see.  these white cops are killing all these black brothers totally innocent and uh We need to get rid of them and we will take care of what's going on.  It works.  People do it.  You show how the state is ineffective, how the state is weak, how the state cannot do what we can do.  And here in America, we have police chiefs lying on their face in front of these insurgents.  What a propaganda coup.  People were in an insurgency and the organs of the state are facilitating it.  They're not doing squat about it.  I'm telling you, I'll answer my question.  If you had flipped the script and it was the whatever, again, the American Nazi Party and some white power organization doing these things, if it took it, they would be flying A-10s over top of the crowds and mowing them down.  They would stop it.  They would have already undercovered, arrested everybody involved.  They'd be in the... They'd call them domestic terrorists, and they would deny them the basic rights of criminals.  And I'm not saying they'd be wrong in that, but I'm saying they would.  They'd be in some... probably based in CONUS version of Gitmo, and they would probably do some kind of facilitated secret trial thing, and they would be attacking them.  Delta Force would be attacking their headquarters.  Yes, already at this point, if the script was flipped, they would be.  And again, the results are the same.  They want to overthrow the government.  They want to change the system of America.  And I'm telling you, it's communist.  It is totally communist.  And here's the thing.  There's all kinds of different organizations, but one kind of organization is a front organization.  And a front organization is formed by the communists.  They can also be formed by us, on the other hand.  It's formed by the communists to do their bidding, but the people in it, except for certain key leaders, have no clue that it's being used by the people.  The Israelis are really good at doing this, too, by the way.  And so they create an organization, and they're steering it, but the people don't know.  That they're being steered.  Doesn't matter.  They're useful idiots.  And as I think Kevin said, when they get what they want, those useful, useless idiots, useful idiots, useful idiots get taken care of.  Because they're not part of the real plan.  And they feel betrayed, but they're dead, so who cares?  People, the country's in trouble.  And it's being aided and abetted by our elected representatives.  It's huge.  Orient on that.  It's huge.  It's gonna get so much worse.  And this is totally not a call to action.  as far as go join a side.  This is me telling you to be smart.  The wise man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself.  People, you need to get away and get set up and just be as remote and rural in your little bolt hole as you can.  Because again, these things are going to focus on the cities.  That's where the people are.  That's where the infrastructure is.  That's where the power is.  Not in flyover country.  I was going to say it's about to get real.  It's already real.  Most people just don't realize it yet.  What really horrifies, that's not too strong of a word, me, is our government's reaction, non-reaction to it.  They want this.  And again, you're not going to restore the Constitutional Republic.  That's gone, folks.  It's gone.  You better see to the new way and what's coming.  I think the best we can probably hope for is some form of balkanization.  And I don't think that's good.  Because then we'll be taken apart piecemeal later by greater powers.  Alright, I know I'm just the font of happiness and putting a pep in your step.  But my pep in your step is, people, it's past time to wake up.  Come out of her, my people.  Lest you partake of her sins and receive of her plagues.  Better get out and get set up.  You better get a group of people.  I haven't hit that theme for a while.  You can't do this by yourself.  Bummer, I know.  Maybe I'll see you out there. ",
