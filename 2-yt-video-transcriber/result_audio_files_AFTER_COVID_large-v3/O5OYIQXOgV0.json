            "text": "Welcome to another dumb things people say to atheists.  The series where we make a good faith attempt at understanding the unconstructive, mean-spirited, and frankly, well, dumb things people somehow think is acceptable to say to atheists.  Not only breaking down what's wrong with them, but trying to maintain insight into what brings often good, reasonable people to say them and how we can best respond.  Today we're going to have a look at one of my very favorite types of dumb thing.  Statements about why people are atheists.  Because, you know, it simply can't be just because we don't see evidence for God.  In this case, it's one that beautifully mashes up two different insinuations about atheists.  One being that we just want to sin, which we've already covered, and the other being that we're full of pride.  And that is, you just want to be your own God.  Well, I guess one plus side would be.  I could always make sure to answer whenever I prayed to myself.  But otherwise... Why would we want to be our own thing that we don't believe in?  Huh.  Now I'm sure we've all heard some version of this at some point.  But why would Christians say something like this?  And what does it even mean?  Your first inclination may be to see it as a basic insult, because, well, it kind of is.  This isn't to say all Christians consciously conceptualize it as an insult, and as always, part of dealing with dumb things people say to atheists is to empathize with the people who say them, to recognize that it doesn't take a dumb person to say a dumb thing, and it doesn't take a willfully insulting person to say something that functions as an insult.  No Christian you're likely to encounter came up with the phrase, atheists want to be their own god from scratch.  They've likely picked it up from people around them, and since they didn't construct it themselves, they've probably never deconstructed it and aren't totally aware of its implications.  It's important to remember that they're the victims of bad ideas, often the same bad ideas.  most of us were once victims of ourselves.  And while what they say may be exasperating, they're operating based on preconceptions and religious frameworks that are deeply rooted in their minds, and that's especially the case with this one.  So while it might be tempting to feel the sting of these insults and snap back, we should be gracious and gentle in helping unroot these bad ideas.  To elevate the conversation and build understanding between us and others so that one day we can help them along to a better place as others have done for us.  So that said, where does this idea come from?  Why do Christians have this assumption that there needs to be a God in the picture and that if an actual God weren't there, he'd leave some void for humans to step up and fill?  What does it even mean for humans to be their own gods?  And most fundamentally, why can't there be a godless universe in which humans just figure out how to respectfully coexist without it being a sin of pride or stolen godhood?  Now there's a bit to this, and to be clear I'm just relaying my own understanding of the Christian mindset based on my past experience in the faith, but at least a large part of evangelicalism has trouble seeing anybody responding to their idea of god based purely on actual belief or disbelief.  at least the same kind of belief or disbelief with which we react to most propositions.  Instead they see us all, Christian or not, responding out of some attitude of obedience or disobedience.  They see Christianity and a response to Christianity driving everybody's behavior, to the extent that even evolutionists go into work every day dug in against God and formulate their theories out of some form of rebellion against Him.  The idea that they just do what they do in a way that doesn't involve God and that he never even enters their heads as they arrive at findings that incidentally make him obsolete is totally foreign to Christians, which is a big obstacle to their ability to understand others.  The cold hard fact is, their religion is just one among many systems of unverified supernatural claims.  It means nothing to most people either because they don't bother with unverified claims or they grew up acclimated to other kinds of unverified claims.  And thus Christianity sits on the periphery of their minds the way Hinduism or ghost stories might sit on the periphery of Christians' minds.  But too many Christians haven't empathized with others well enough to develop this sense of perspective.  God is so firmly planted at the center of their thinking that they assume he's at the center of everybody's thinking.  He's ever-present, always knocking on the door of all of our hearts.  It's just that a lot of us choose not to answer, to disobey him.  From this perspective, most of the world, following geographical and cultural boundaries somehow, decides to reject him and then puts false gods in his place.  This mindset, of course, has become a deeply ingrained part of how Christianity understands pagan religions.  So of course you can imagine that when more and more open atheists started appearing on the scene, walking away from God yet not replacing him with another god, Christians saw there being a piece missing from the puzzle.  Which god are they worshipping now?  To whom do they ultimately bend their knee?  In whom is their moral obligation grounded?  If there's no replacement God, then all that's left is\u2026 themselves.  See, this last one reveals a whole other part of this picture.  Because just as they only see people's response to God in terms of obedience or disobedience, they only see morality itself in terms of compliance with him.  So when a fundamentalist looks at an atheist, there are a few things they might see at work.  One, the person knows about God, in fact has God at the center of his or her thinking, yet chooses a life of disobedience.  Two, the person hasn't replaced him with the God of another religion, and since we all center our lives on obedience to something, that person is apparently choosing to obey only his or her own whims.  And three, without a God to obey, this person has no source of moral accountability and is thus free to do whatever he or she wants.  Of course, two and three are pretty similar and are in fact somewhat redundant expressions of the same basic idea, that the person ends up, in fact wants to end up, with him or herself in charge.  I mean, that's the whole idea, right?  Nobody tells me what to do or how to think.  I define what's right or wrong, and thus I become lord over myself.  It's a sin that's even older than humanity, first committed by Lucifer himself, which yes, I know is not the name of the devil and none of this is actually in the Bible, but that's another story, as the very first act of rebellion against God.  In fact, this is the fundamental idea of sin according to many Christians' theology.  I grew up being taught that whenever we sinned, whenever we disobeyed in any way, especially deliberately, we were essentially, like the devil, throwing off God's restraints and telling him that we knew better.  Even if we still called ourselves Christians, in that moment of sin we were still choosing to rule ourselves because we thought we knew better than God.  So how much more an atheist who disavows God altogether?  How do you interpret his actions other than those of a person who has permanently and deliberately committed the ultimate act of pride, the core act of sin, by trying to elevate himself to the place of God?  It's hard to overestimate how deeply this is woven into a Christian's thinking.  Not only do they view sin this way, they've lived their lives in a constant battle against their own pride, trying to bend it to the will of God in the face of daily temptation to do their own thing, and mentally flogging themselves for their own failures.  Think of how this struggle absorbs them.  Think of how the accompanying stress and shame eats at them.  Think of how deeply this must work its way into their view of the world and human behavior.  After doing so, you might imagine how, after magnifying every tiny little failure of their own into an act of treason, punishable by hell against the perfect holy god of the universe, they might view an atheist by comparison.  In light of this, it seems pretty inevitable that they would see us committing the same magnified version of their own sin that Satan did, in essence trying to become our own gods.  Of course, while we can understand where this thinking comes from, let's be clear that it's short-sighted and makes little if any attempt to understand the mindset of people outside their own religion.  We all have a responsibility to live alongside other people by recognizing that, while we might not agree with them on everything, they might have reasons for their beliefs and behaviors that we don't understand and that might be something other than a response to our personal religion.  I do, very sincerely, sympathize with a neurosis that digs at Christians and might inform their understanding of atheism.  But if they can't get past that, it's a failing of their own personal journey toward self-awareness.  And if it inhibits their ability to speak respectfully to others, then they ultimately bear the responsibility for their self-imposed marginalization.  Ultimately, telling someone they want to be their own god, along with all the implied accusations of pride and disobedience that accompany it, is an insult.  and while it may have some misled justification in the Christian worldview, the person saying it is directly and knowingly telling you that you've made a worse choice than they have in this regard and is doing so in brash language that people would find totally unacceptable in any other social context.  You might think this way, and that's bad enough in itself, but if your head is so far up the ass of your own religion that you feel entitled to talk to people this way, that's kind of your fault.  On top of that, surprise surprise, the idea simply makes no sense.  Because yes, it may feel like pride when someone declares the kind of self-determination that lets them come to their own conclusions about right and wrong, and when you've been trained to think only God should make this decision, it sounds absolutely horrible.  But here's the question.  What's the alternative?  Because everybody is reaching their own conclusions about right or wrong, since, guess what, God never comes down and says anything about anything.  And before you assume I'm just being snarky, stop and think about it for a moment.  When a person demeans you for coming to your own conclusions about right and wrong, they're really chiding you for not instantly and without debate deferring to their idea of right and wrong.  They, through some process of absorbing a lifetime of Christian teaching, reading the Bible, and somewhere in the back of their head filtering all this through their own personal sensibilities and preferences, arrived at a personal understanding of what they think God wants.  And when a Christian tries to guilt you into doing what they think God wants, you need to keep in mind how tenuous, subjective, and open to abuse their understanding is.  If you ask any two Christians enough questions about God's will, they'll eventually start giving you different answers.  Answers that will always reflect something of their own personal experiences and preferences.  So without question, even assuming God exists, it's inevitable that Christians who tell you what he wants will at some point be mistaken and, consciously or not, start telling you what they want.  Functionally, if not deliberately, what they're trying to do is circumvent the normal process whereby you and they, each having come up with ideas of how people should behave, compare thoughts, reason through which behaviors are harmful or disruptive, and from there come to agreement about which actions should be prohibited, which should be subject to negative social pressure, and which just aren't anybody else's business.  A secular person can and should approach this conversation with the humility of knowing they have a limited understanding of morality and ethics.  That when they converse with others, they're adding but a minute drop into a huge ongoing social debate that's taken place over the centuries.  And if they're to be taken seriously, they can't just march into the room and start shouting commands based on what they think off the cuff is right and wrong.  They need to understand the history of the conversation that's already taken place, to absorb the wisdom of others.  And, most of all, they need to justify whatever they add to the conversation in terms of the human and social impact of whatever they suggest, patiently being ready for their suggestions to take their small place in the ongoing conversation.  So I would ask a Christian, how in this process is a person trying to play God?  Where is the pride in this?  Because once we remove God from the picture we still have other beings, an entire planet full of them to whom we must answer.  And answering to them from the honest perspective of one person among many who's trying to make sense of the world and our place in it leaves no room for pride.  You know what does leave room for pride, and is in fact the most prideful way to enter this conversation?  Approaching others with the demand that they accept not only that the idea of God you formed in your head exists and is the one true God, but that you have such a clear understanding of what he wants that whatever comes out of your mouth represents his will.  Your interpretation of scripture, or whatever you have distilled from your lifetime spent in the faith, is divine dictate, and as such it must be followed.  Rather than accepting your rightful place as one more person, adding one more humble voice to the conversation, and having to justify your own opinions every step of the way, you strut into the room and tell everybody that discussion can go ahead and come to a full stop, and that they should all just obey whatever part of your ego you call God, and then throw accusations of pride at them when they don't instantly bow to it?  No.  Get off your high horse.  Not believing in God doesn't make me my own God any more than not believing in ghosts makes me my own ghost.  This is just silly.  Becoming an atheist doesn't absolve us of responsibility, doesn't elevate us to a place of divinity, because whether or not there's a God, we are all responsible to other people.  I would just compare how an atheist approaches this responsibility to how a Christian approaches it.  And based on that, I would ask, who's really trying to be their own God?
