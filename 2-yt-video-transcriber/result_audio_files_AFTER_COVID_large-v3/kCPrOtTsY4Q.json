            "text": "What is up, family?  It's your girl, T, aka the nappy-headed jojoba.  Not nappy, not jojoba.  The nappy-headed jojoba.  You have to say the whole thing or just call me T. And in an M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist, I'm doing a hair video today?  Truth be told, there are some of you guys who do want me to continue making hair videos as much as I used to, and I get requests for them pretty frequently.  So you may be wondering, what finally changed?  Why is today the day that I'm finally taking a break from social justice and commentary to do what has become my annual hair video?  The answer, this is sponsored.  So shout out to the Pantene Gold Series for partnering with me on this video.  So this is going to be a style my hair with me as opposed to a get ready with me.  I shampooed and deep conditioned my hair yesterday and I slept with it uncovered on a satin pillowcase.  So it's pretty much dry by now.  I'm just taking down my hanging Bantu loops that I do to keep my ends stretched.  And I'm going to be turning these twists into braids for a braid out.  I don't think I want quite as many braids as I have twists right now.  One, because I braid really slowly, and two, I tend to prefer more of a chunky braid out.  And I'm going to be using this Gold Series Curl Defining Pudding infused with argan oil as my styler.  This defines curls and reduces frizz, and it's for curly and coily styles.  The instructions say to start with damp or dry hair.  As I said, my hair is pretty much dry at this point.  Apply a nickel-sized amount of pudding into palms to emulsify, section hair, and distribute evenly from root to tip.  Reactivate product by spritzing hair with Gold Series Curl Awakening Spray.  And wouldn't you know it, I have that too.  I'll let you guys know right now, this does contain silicones.  The second ingredient is dimethicone.  I personally have no problem with silicones, and in fact, I prefer to make sure that I use them.  if I know I'm going to be heat styling.  I don't think I'm going to sit under my hooded dryer for this.  I'm probably just going to let this dry overnight, let the braid set for a day or two.  That seems to be how I get the best results for me anyway.  And I'm just going to be taking down one to two twists at a time and turning them into a braid all while we talk.  I will say the smell of this, it doesn't smell exactly like that classic Pantene smell, but it does remind me of that classic Pantene smell.  And I actually really like that.  it reminds me of that classic Pantene smell because it really takes me back.  I remember when I was in sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, my best friend Nancy, who we are still friends today, her sister worked at the local drugstore as a cashier and she would always get Pantene and share her Pantene products with Nancy.  And I could always tell when Nancy had used Pantene because I could smell that Pantene smell and it smelled so good.  It just really takes me back.  I have such a nostalgic, fond feeling for Pantene.  So yeah, my hair feels 100% dry from my little wash session last night.  You can probably see some of my gray hairs on display in the front.  Why are they always in the front?  All of my grays are in the front.  I'm actually gonna go in with a little bit of this Curl Awakening spray, just a light layer before I go in with my styling product.  this also has argan oil infused into it.  that's basically kind of the premise of the whole line.  it's a very argan oil focused line.  now at this step many people would just use water which is fine.  water is perfectly fine if you're just trying to get your hair to be a little bit easier to maneuver.  but what I sometimes see people do is just stop there.  they stop at the water and it makes me want to talk about a hair myth that I see and hear from people a lot.  I'm now gonna go in and with the pudding.  It's got a very like jiggly jelly texture, but it feels creamy to my hands.  So I'm going to take some of that.  Just emulsify it.  I gotta tell you guys something.  This is my first time trying these products out, but this already feels like my hair is saying thank you because she was feeling parched.  I didn't really put anything on her because I wanted to make sure my hair would be dry by today.  And sometimes if I go in with product right on top of sopping wet hair after my wash day, it can take days to dry.  When people go in with just water and they call it a day, I think this is largely the fault of a very popular method for girls who are curly.  And some of y'all may even remember when that water only method, like water only method was trending here on these natural hair YouTube streets.  Don't get me started on that one.  My hair is feeling much happier already and I'm going to seal, know what we do, moisturize and seal.  And I'm going to use the intense hydrating oil, which again, has argan oil in it.  This has almost a serum type of texture.  Let me show you guys.  It is dripping down my hand relatively quickly, but yeah, it's a clear, yeah, it's definitely thicker than just oil.  It's more of a serum.  I feel like this would be a good heat protectant because this also does have silicones in it.  Anyway, there's this myth that all you need to refresh your curls or your coils is water.  Bob's your uncle.  But the truth is water, especially if you have hard water like we do here in Cali, Water has all sorts of minerals in it that can, over time, actually break down the proteins in the hair and cause oxidative damage.  If you're not sure what that means, you know that word antioxidants, you know how antioxidants equals good.  Well, oxidative damage equals bad.  That's why we want the antioxidants.  And that's why it's important to incorporate antioxidants into your diet, your skincare, and even your hair care routines.  While water itself is critical for our hair's care, we do know this.  Water is what provides the moisture that our hair needs to be supple and to be imbalanced with its protein, and water also makes our hair more pliable and easy to manipulate.  That's why I went in with this first because this is a water-based product before I went in with my styler and my oil.  But our hair is also at its weakest when it's wet.  Adding just a little bit more product from my ends.  This is just something that I usually like to do to make sure they're nice and smooth.  Anyway, our hair is also at its weakest when it's wet.  The reason it becomes more pliable when it's damp is some of the bonds in our hair are temporarily broken once we wet it.  The wetter it is, the more of those bonds we're breaking temporarily.  So more pliability for our hair also means that it is able to break more easily.  This is why it's important not to rely solely on water to refresh and to moisturize our hair.  we need to follow it up with something that has slip and emollients to actually nourish the hair.  And ideally, get you something that also has some antioxidants in it to help protect against oxidative damage, like I was talking about earlier.  When Pantene first approached me about partnering with them, it was actually a good while ago, and I wasn't even sure if I wanted to get back into the hair game even for one video just to do a review of a new launch or a new product line or something like that.  but when i learned more about this gold series line the line that i'm using right now i saw that it was actually created by black scientists And in a nutshell, that's what made it a yes.  Bringing on Black scientists to create a line for Black people for our hair, this is exactly what needs to be the standard across the board when it comes to formulating products for our hair.  Everybody should be doing this.  The fact that big brands weren't even talking to us when creating products for our hair for far too long is partly why it's always been so difficult for us to find products formulated properly to care for our hair.  We weren't even in the room to give input.  And that is honestly what made me excited to try this line, to try the gold series.  And shout out to Pantene for coming correct from the jump, honestly, and giving us a seat at the lab.  Those of you who have been riding with me for a while and actually remember hair videos from back when that was all I actually did, you'll know that my objective from day none on this channel was only to share information, tips, techniques that I had learned about or discovered through my own trial and error looking after my Afro textured hair.  Sharing things that I wasn't necessarily seeing addressed or discussed elsewhere in these YouTube streets.  And some of y'all also know that your girl is on a budget.  And one place where I avoid spending a lot of money is on my hair care.  I gotta tell you guys, this pudding has really nice slip to it.  I feel like if you are a wash and go lover, I don't do wash and go's, I like to keep my hair stretched.  But if you like wash and go's, this would probably be a good one for you because it is labeled as a curl definer as well and it's supposed to give a light hold.  Anyway, a lot of us are not necessarily balling out the way we were maybe a year ago, maybe even as recently as 2020 BC.  BC is before Corona.  But we still need our products to work.  I've got an orphan section here.  I think this was meant to be in this braid and I just accidentally left it out.  So I have to put it in somewhere on this side of my head.  I learned a long time ago that caring for my hair does not need to be expensive.  I stick to products that are affordable, effective, and easy for me to get.  To be able to tick all those boxes, you know, available, on the ground, easily, affordable.  effective, created by us for us.  We love to see it.  All right, you guys, we are nearly at the end.  I have three more twists and I think I'm gonna turn these into two braids.  So I'm gonna BRB simply because it is like 100 degrees.  Like right now it is super, super hot.  and i'm schvitzing.  i'm a schvitzer.  so i'm gonna go ahead and pop my fan on so i can have a little bit more comfort while i finish up braiding my hair and i'll be right back to show you the braids and then probably after that you guys won't see me again until tomorrow for me to actually take them down.  i'm going to take some more more of the serum the hydrating oil.  it's called an intense hydrating oil but it really does feel like a serum because it's nice and thick and y'all will know my ogs will know how much i like to put heavy products especially on the ends of my hair to help weigh them down and prevent single strand knots from forming.  And this is what we're working with.  So here I am looking like a 12 year old with gray hairs with my Pusha T. Push a T. Braids.  So, okay, we're all done.  I have six braids in total.  I already told you guys I don't like super defined.  I like more chunky, voluptuous braid outs and twist outs.  So this is a good number for me.  I'm gonna leave these in at least overnight, possibly for another day.  I shall see.  I'll probably decide tomorrow if I feel like taking them down or if I wanna leave them one more day.  And the next time you see me, we will be at the takedown.  hi again friends it is now the next day as planned.  i kept these braids in overnight and i was thinking i have not done a braid out in well over a year.  so i'm wondering do i still have it?  we're about to find out because it's it's time to say bye felicia because that is who i look like right now.  so let's take these braids down.  i'm gonna take a pump of the intense hydrating oil just have a little bit of lubrication on my fingers and make it a little bit more slippy and easy to take my braids down without friction.  so just put a little bit of that on my fingertips And as usual, as I had done with my twist that I started with, I did hanging Bantu loops on the ends of my braids just to give them a nice little curl without even needing a roller.  As well, I forgot that I wanted to try out this Gold Series Edge Tamer.  It's pretty much what you would expect from an edge control, but as many of you guys know, I don't have edges, but I do have some pretty hefty sideburns.  I've got like some pretty long hairs in my sideburn area.  So I like to use edge control products to just smooth those out and give them a little curl.  And here you can see this did a really nice job of that.  I have some that I've tried that make my hair so stiff and hard that they just stick out straight from me smoothing the product through, which is not the desired look.  So I really love that this one gave me a nice curl with some hold.  It's exactly what I'm looking for when I do that method on my little sideburns.  Now again, this product here that I used to style, the Curl Defining Pudding, is supposed to have a light hold, which is also what I prefer.  I hate crunchy hair, so we go see.  We go see how this turned out.  I'm thinking I'll take down this first braid and show you guys the definition, and then I'll probably just kind of jump ahead to when all the braids are taken down and come back to show you guys me actually fluffing out and separating.  Okay, first braid is down.  Here you can see.  I've done zero separating, but I really, That's some good definition.  And hair does not feel crunchy.  It does definitely have that soft hold like it boasts on the jar.  So living up to what it claims.  Let's carry on and take the rest of these braids down so we can start fluffing and really see how this turned out.  All right, y'all, I have fluffed to my desired fullness, which is not quite as full as I could go because as we all know, if you have Afro textured hair, it's gonna get bigger on days two and three anyway.  So I think this is pretty good volume for day one.  And because it is currently 89 degrees here in LA, I went ahead and pinned the front back because I cannot have hair all up in my face right now.  It is just too hot today.  But I am looking cute, feeling cute.  It has been so long since I've just worn my hair down and free.  So I'm really excited.  I can't believe that I've gone this long without wearing a braid out or a twist out.  So I'm just going to go on about my day.  But let me know if you guys have tried the Pantene Gold Series or if you're going to try it.  Kudos to Pantene as one of the biggest brands out there for partnering with Black scientists to actually formulate these products for our hair.  But that is going to be a wrap for your girl tea.  So I'm going to get up out of here.  Thank you for watching this one all the way to the end.  Thank you to Pantene Gold Series for sponsoring this.  And I'll just remind you of one last thing before I go.  Never trust anyone with a Morphe code.  Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed hose there.  I'm going to tell you that now. ",
