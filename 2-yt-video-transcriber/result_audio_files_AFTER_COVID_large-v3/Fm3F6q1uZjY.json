            "text": "Hey there internet, my name is Luxander, I just got out of the shower, and now we're gonna talk about politics.  And I guess enjoy this rare view into what femme lux looks like, uh, don't count on it becoming a regular thing, and if you're confused as to why, uh, I would like you to tell me what you think nonbinary means.  That is, okay, we're done acknowledging this now.  I could have played this up and made it funny and made it, like, about.  Oh, this is my last coming out!  Because I've already talked about being left-leaning politically on the channel.  If you didn't see me take the quiz, I took the quiz about your political alignment, and basically I'm a socialist.  If that's a surprise to you, now you know that I am a socialist.  But within that, I thought it would be funny to come out as a Bernie Sanders supporter, because that is the person who I am interested in becoming the nominee on the Democratic side.  So I wanted to talk about that, because I have been interested and engaged in this political cycle, And because I am a socialist and that's been a fairly recent thing.  as far as me being comfortable claiming that political label, I would also like to talk about just how life is different and how certain topics of conversation become very difficult when you're like, wow, there would be an easy solution to this, and it's fucking single-payer healthcare.  Yeah, so obviously, as someone who supports Bernie Sanders, I'm pretty stoked about the couple- well, I'm not- I wouldn't say stoked about Iowa, because that was a shitshow.  However, I'm pretty stoked about New Hampshire, which just happened.  I have no idea when I'm gonna actually get this edited and uploaded, so GG's.  I'm not gonna go in terrible detail about Iowa situation, but I'm just gonna say that that seemed sketchy as all hell, and I am suspicious of everybody.  But it turned out okay?  Question marks.  We'll find out.  The reasons that I am interested in supporting Bernie Sanders, a lot of it is policy-based.  I think obviously somebody who identifies as a democratic socialist is going to probably be most politically aligned with me.  since I'm actually further left than Bernie is on a lot of issues, but he is the closest thing to representative of my views currently available right now.  Things like healthcare, things like getting rid of student debt and getting rid of student loans, like making education more accessible to people.  I think he's the only candidate for the abolition of ICE.  And generally I think that he is a good thing for working class people.  there is a great structural inequality in this country.  I would say that I think perhaps Bernie focuses too much on class sometimes, and that some of these issues are more complex.  He does seem like he has been sort of mixed on whether he's been willing to listen about those other issues, so I will say that that's not perfect.  But overall, policy-wise, I think that he is the best choice for moving forward in America.  As a trans person who needs access to certain kinds of healthcare, I'm really good with having access to healthcare.  That's really important to me.  And there's just a lot of other ethical things that I think we align on, and those are the kind of reasons why I support Bernie.  I was initially kind of a fan of Warren, but as things kind of have panned out starting about like a month ago, I guess I really started to lean much further with Bernie.  policy-wise.  I like them both, I think they're both good people, but I do think that their approaches are just different, and their policies, obviously, are different to each other.  Warren is still my second choice, though.  If Bernie doesn't get it, I would go with Warren, although it currently doesn't look like she's going to end up getting very many delegates.  It seems like Klobuchar and Buttigieg are both up there and warren is sort of languishing down there with biden which question marks.  i really thought that she was more popular than that and i also didn't realize that pete budaj was as popular as he is.  no i'm not going to support a gay just because he's a gay.  he's not queer.  thank you very much although if he were to get the nomination i would I would inevitably vote for him because I am definitely, again, as a marginalized person, I can't deal with more Trump.  That would be bad for my civil rights.  I do want to talk a little bit about just some frustrations I've been encountering in my life recently that I didn't think I would experience and that are directly the result of my moving further left politically.  The main thing that's on my mind right now is the idea of workman's comp.  So if anybody doesn't know, I'm currently in a program training to be an electrician.  It's a like a trade program kind of thing.  So recently one of my teachers was just sort of talking to us about workman's compensation, how it works, why it exists, how much you can expect to get paid in different parts of the country, like all kinds of stuff.  And I legitimately had to leave the room to go use the restroom at one point, just to sort of clear my head.  I did, I also needed to use the restroom, but I used it as an excuse kind of to just sit for a minute in the hallway, because it is wildly frustrating to me that these really fucked up, complicated systems exist, and all of these sort of extraneous middlemen sort of positions have been created.  And it's like, it would just not ever be an issue if we had proper healthcare that didn't depend on health insurance and wasn't profit motivated.  It is intensely distressing.  I don't know how to describe it, being like, so much of your life is controlled by your access to medical care, like your need to access to medical care.  People choose their job based on whether they have good benefits, whether they have affordable benefits.  And you lose your insurance if you lose your job.  And like, even if you were consensually quitting and moving to another job, you're gonna start a new job, and they're not gonna insure you for like two or three months.  You're just going to have a gap where you have no healthcare.  for paperwork reasons, I assume.  I assume that when you started a new company, they don't want to, like, start all this paperwork and do all this stuff.  if you're, if you're going to have turnover, which I kind of understand, but at the same time, it wouldn't be an issue, literally at all, if we just had socialized healthcare.  What a concept.  You just pay taxes and get healthcare.  That's it.  And we also talk about safety stuff.  in some of my classes, like, the trade-offs of being perfectly safe as far as, like, OSHA standards, compared to, this is going to take too much time, and like, like, working in an inherently unsafe sort of environment like you do when you're an electrician, and knowing from, like, years and years of working in retail and other not-great kind of situations, like, people want to take advantage of you.  They want to get the job done faster, even if it's less safe for you because the profit motive is there.  It's just continually so obnoxious that Like, if workers owned the means of production, they would be able to prioritize safety over profits.  as far as, like, moving quickly or needing to shut down a system in order to do maintenance on it.  Like, so many of these things are, like... designed the way that they are for the purpose of maximizing profit, and like, for the purpose of being as expedient as possible.  And while I think that efficiency itself is not a bad thing, I also think that people get abused in situations where profit is the motive.  So basically, uh, I'm very annoyed at the system that we live in, and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to deal with the number of injustices that I see in the system, and now I'm tired and I'm gonna shut up about it because I'm super depressed.  Yeah, I don't know, let me know if you want me to talk more about politics on the channel.  I don't have a whole lot of trans stuff going on right now, so it's basically like school and sleep and mental health and socialism, so.
