One of my favorite people to interview, Brandon Smith, he's the founder of alt-market.com and they also have a great paid letter.  It's called the Wild Bunch Newsletter and it's all about survival.  and obviously with everything that's going on, it's very interesting.  And Brandon's background is extremely interesting as well.  If you haven't checked it out, I really suggest that you go there and give it a look.  Brandon, thank you for joining us. ",

They found a new breed of frogs in the Amazon basin, and everyone in the world is talking about it.  No, I'm just messing.  Let's talk about the coronavirus, of course.  So I've been hearing very concerned voices.  of Americans talking about the fact that FEMA has been invoked, that federal bailouts include two checks of $1,000, so helicopter money, the Federal Reserve launching QE5.  And actually, if they wouldn't have done that, then the financial system would have been toast.  There was so much selling going on, stocks, bond, everything.  Everyone was just moving to cash.  there was a short squeeze on the dollar for about $12 trillion.  Insane.  And obviously the National Emergency Declaration, these all seem like deja vu.  for, you know, after 9-11 we saw the Patriot Act, after 2008 we saw TARP, all these draconian restrictions.  Is this abuse of power?  Or is this legitimate use of all government tools, in your opinion? ",

It does seem to be affecting at least mortally affecting 3% to 5% of the population.  However, I think the response so far is unacceptable.  The idea that... martial law which is essentially what we're going into martial law will somehow solve this problem or is a commensurate response is absurd and you know.  for a long time I've said that the global elites need a major distraction event in order to institute number one more political and economic centralization, and number two, remove as many freedoms and civil liberties and protections as possible from the public.  They need some kind of event to do that.  And now we know what that event is, and it's the Wuhan flu.  It's COVID-19, whatever you want to call it.  This is a perfect distraction event.  That's not to say that I want to downplay the effects that this might have on 3% to 5% of the population.  I think it's a mistake to do that, and I think the people in the liberty movement that are downplaying this like it's nothing are making a big mistake, and it's going to make them look foolish down the road.  It is a serious issue, but it's just not an issue that we need martial law to solve. ",

Should we do this every year when we close the economy?  Those are the minimalists, and the maximalists obviously show you these mathematical models of how the entire world will be affected and we'll have a Spanish flu repeat.  I do understand exactly what you're talking about.  And I followed Brandon.  I follow daily the task force and what it does and what it says.  And I don't know that I yet agree that it's an abuse of power, but it's definitely rules as we go along.  You know what I mean?  If there is no rule that lets them do something that they want to just go to Congress and legislated that they move the rules.  And that's at least what I'm seeing that everything is so flexible.

Once it really got going, once the snowball got halfway down the mountain, it really turned into an avalanche, and that's what's happening now.  We're seeing the avalanche.  In terms of on the economic side, I don't think the general public yet understands how bad this is going to get.  I think a lot of people still believe that this will be gone in two weeks, four weeks, maybe six weeks.  They think that this will be over with and things will upright themselves and solve themselves, and that's not going to happen.  This is going to be a long-lasting economic disaster.

As a survivalist yourself, where you live and obviously in other parts of the US, people are always awaiting an earthquake in California or something else to hit them or a bank holiday and boom.  A virus is something that nobody's prepared for.  It's an interesting time, obviously, and I want to talk to you about what's happening where the virus started.

I think they continue to lie about the extent of the damage and how many deaths they've had.  I mean, if you look at Italy... The infection numbers in Italy are half that of China, and yet they've already surpassed the number of deaths that China reported.  And their death rate is hovering around 6%, which China still claims they had a death rate of 2%.  In a country of a billion people, which most of them are packed in like sardines into these cities, I find that really hard to believe, and I think they've continued to lie about the effects of the virus.  Also, they continue to hide the economic effects as well as they can.  There's a lot of factors that you can look at, including air pollution and things of that nature, that show that they are still mostly shut down.  Also, I think the Wall Street Journal reported the other day that China, initially they claimed that they were going to reopen factories on the 20th of this month, and then now they flip-flopped and said they're not exactly sure when they're going to reopen everything, while at the same time they claim, oh, yeah, the economy is back up and running.  So we can look at China.  It's hard to use them as a model for where we're headed because they lie so much about the data, but if we read between the lines, we can kind of see some indicators of what's about to happen here.

What I've heard is and what I've seen is that the vaccine will be here in 12 to 18 months and it will not be mass scale.  So they obviously in a democracy like the  U.S.,  you cannot put people in their houses for months and quarantine them.  And it's not only will not.  everyone do it, but it's not doable.  So obviously you need to really speedily find drugs that might help and make sure that the healthcare system is ready for an onslaught of people and Jen start releasing people back into society.  when, when you feel like the healthcare system can, can take it.

That's the minimum amount of time.  So sometimes it takes many years if they don't have all the resources they need.  It could take three years.  It could take five years.  With this, minimum one year.  So the people that think there's going to be some kind of vaccine or cure in the next month or two, I think that they've been given false hope by the mainstream media.  And the mainstream media has been reporting stories like this often, And I think the government has also been hinting at narratives like this.  Well, we may have a vaccine in a month.  We may have a vaccine in a month and a half.  I think that's all designed to kick the stock markets back up or to slow down the crash, which obviously it's not working.  But as far as a timeline for some kind of treatment or a vaccine, I think a year minimum is that they may come out with something, some kind of makeshift drug cocktail or something in the interim that may have some results for some people, but I don't see anything substantial for another year.  Economically, the timeline is very interesting.  My primary concerns, I have two of them, One is the supply chain collapse, which is happening right now.  And I've received several emails from readers who have ties to certain corporations and inside information, corporations like Walmart, others who have told me that essentially the stores, all these box chain stores have been told that by court the corporate office that they cannot order from warehouses anymore.  um the ",

So what that means is the supply chain is breaking right now and it'll probably get a lot worse soon.  So that's my first concern.  My second concern is a possible credit freeze or liquidity crisis leading to a bank holiday.  which, for those of you not familiar with that, a bank holiday is basically when the entire banking network nationally shuts down for an undetermined amount of time, and you have no access to your bank account.  You're not able to pull cash out.  The ATMs are all shut down.  I think that is coming, actually.  From what I've seen so far, I think that we're lucky if we have a month before we do have a bank holiday, and I think that they'll just blame it on virus.  They won't call it a bank holiday, but everything will shut down, and you won't have access to your cash.  And they'll say it's because of coronavirus, but it will actually be because... Well, I think, in my opinion, it will be a credit crisis.  It'll be a lack of liquidity in the system.  A lot of these corporations and banks have massive debts, and that's why they're... locking into the Fed's repo market so aggressively, and it's still not helping because they have these massive debts.  And the more losses that they have in the financial sector, the tighter that liquidity gets.  So ultimately, I think that they will have to have a bank holiday because they won't be able to deal with the cash flow anymore.  to regular account holders. ",

He has a long time history with the banking elites, specifically the Rothschilds.  In his cabinet, he's surrounded by banking elites and CFR members.  I think that Trump does as he's told, and I think he plays a role, and his role is to be the bumbling conservative that screws everything up.  I think that's his role, and he seems to be doing it pretty well.  I mean, I don't know how many times he's tweeted \u2013 that people should buy the dip on the stock market over the past month, and he's on multiple occasions told people that this would burn out by April, which it's definitely not going to do that.  So it makes him look ridiculous, but I think that's by design.  I think this is a bigger agenda.  I think this is about making conservatives, nationalists, Sovereignty champions look like villains, look ridiculous, or look dangerous.  And the solution that they're going to come out with after all of this is to say, well, we can never let these people run things again.  We can never let conservatives, nationalists run things again.  What we need is a globalist-type system, and that's the solution that they're going to offer once the ashes settle on this. ",
