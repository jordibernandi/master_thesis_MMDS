            "text": "We are living in a world in which right-wing media, if they get one fact wrong, they are thrown off the platform.  But if left-wing media spouts straight up lies, verifiable lies, like you're about to see in this video, they don't even get a warning.  Hey, what's going on?  My name is Nathan Lawyer, and welcome to my YouTube spot where you are the jury of today's content.  Now, I was going to say, I take a lot of crap, right?  When the QAnon people and the right says, you know, the election was stolen, I'm all, you know, no, those are lies, you know, so I call all that crap out.  And I do it also for the left, too, especially when it comes to these police-involved shootings and the crap that the left say.  that's just factually incorrect.  I take it, too.  So it's funny because you can see what happens with my subscriber count.  It goes up, then it goes down.  It goes up, it goes down because people don't want to hear that their guys are out there spouting lies too.  Today you're gonna hear the left extremist spouting lies here on YouTube and no one's saying anything about it.  Why?  Because it's okay.  It's okay for them to lie, but it's not okay for the people on the right to lie.  And that's what people who are right-wing talk about when they talk about censorship.  If you can just allow one side to just lie, right, just objectively lie about facts that we all know are lies, but the other side has to walk this fine line between lies and truth, then there's no way that you can say this is fair.  So here with the Breonna Taylor situation, We are going to expose the Young Turks in a five-minute video.  Spout off every lie that has been debunked.  Why?  Because they are into disinformation.  Now, I like the Young Turks.  I watch them.  And when I saw this video, I was honestly shocked.  I was shocked that they would spout off this many lies in only five minutes.  And you know what this tells me?  You can't trust anybody.  So for those of you who are going to watch this video, don't trust me when I lay out the facts that I'm about to lay out.  Don't trust me, right?  Go click on those links and look at the warrant and see it for yourself.  Don't trust the stuff that I'm saying.  Go look at it for yourself because I don't want you to think that now you can just trust me as some ultimate source of truth.  No, I'm going to put the link in the description to the warrant and everything I'm about to show you is going to be in the description and you go check it out yourself.  What happens is that we rely on these people.  to give us factual information so we can make informed opinions.  And that's not what they're doing.  They're lying to us so we can have their opinion.  And I'm ashamed to say this, but the Young Turks have been lying to you.  Now, the video you're about to watch is from the Young Turks.  It's a broadcast from January 3rd, 2021.  And this was investigators searching for a Breonna Taylor statue.  They're going to try to now emotionally manipulate the audience by spouting off facts about the Breonna Taylor case.  So let's go through this together and let's see how accurate their reporting or quote unquote reporting is.  Here's clip one. ",

Matter of fact, the address listed on the first page of the warrant is Breonna Taylor's address.  So to say that the cops were at the wrong address is factually incorrect based on the warrant.  They had a warrant to search that address.  So this has obviously been debunked.  Here's the next clip. ",

They wanted to make sure that you're totally emotionally vested on their side.  The things that they're saying are horrible, right?  They just came and shot it discriminatively.  It was the wrong address.  Everything the police did were wrong.  And these are factually things that are not true.  So here's the last one.  in the last gasp to get you emotionally invested into these lies that they're spouting, here's their other host, the ultimate Breonna Tiller lie.  Every source that you're going to read is going to say this, what this man's about to say is a lie.  It's fake news, but he's gonna say it anyway.  Check it out.  For it, etc.  But with Breonna, they killed her in her sleep and she hadn't done anything wrong and she's an upstanding citizen.  For it, etc.  But with Breonna- They killed her in her sleep.  Now, this is the biggest lie out there.  Breonna Taylor was killed while she was asleep.  Now, here is Kenneth Walker telling you that she wasn't asleep. ",

Clearly they are lying to you.  This is not even like a fact.  The people who were there, her boyfriend, the one that's suing the police, the police, everybody agrees she was not asleep in her bed.  She was not killed while she was asleep.  One of the things about her not being asleep is that Kenneth Walker says that she's the one that actually shot at the cops.  You don't believe me.

I just shot her.  Was she asleep in her bed and just murdered by police?  Or do you believe Kenneth Walker that says she had a gun and she was shooting at police?  Or do you believe him when he says that we both got up, we were watching a movie, we answered the door, she was next to me, and then he shot, right?  So every version of the events say that Breonna Taylor wasn't sleeping in her bed.  She was up.  She was up next to this guy.  Matter of fact, he says that she shot at police.  And they returned fire.  So I'm just going to ask you guys.  I know I'm going to lose a lot of liberal viewers, right?  Because the Young Turks were the Young Turks.  But if we're going to do this, we got to be honest with the facts here, right?  I don't care what your opinion is on the Breonna Taylor issue, right?  If you want to watch my full video breaking all this down, it's up here.  But we have to have our opinions driven by the facts.  Not by lies, not by propaganda.  And this purge of quote-unquote right-wing disinformation, if we're going to be fair, you have to purge this left-wing disinformation.  Because this is what's causing people to go out there and protest in the streets.  This is causing people to burn down other people's property.  That's what this is causing.  These lies that they're perpetrating.  And if you're going to blame the right for inciting violence based on lies, the lies that the election was stolen, then you have to blame these left-wing pieces for exciting violence when they're telling lies about police shootings.  It's only fair.  But what do you think?  Am I some crazed man who's just online looking at this the wrong way?  Or do these facts matter?  Because that's what it's all about, facts.  For those of you who are going to be your last day here, so long.  But for those of you who are going to join me on this journey for truth, hit that subscribe button and let's keep moving forward.  Because at the end of the day, it's not about what the opinion is.  You have to be able to discern what are the facts.  Because facts matter.  Peace. ",
