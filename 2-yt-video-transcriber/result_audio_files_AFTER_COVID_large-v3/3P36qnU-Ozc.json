            "text": "If all this wasn't enough, in Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates.  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity.  Antrim County had to hand count all of the ballots and these counties that use this software need to closely examine their results for similar discrepancies.  The people of Michigan deserve a transparent and open process. ",
