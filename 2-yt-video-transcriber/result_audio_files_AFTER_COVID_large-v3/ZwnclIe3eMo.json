When you try to appeal to jingoistic sentiments, he's working for the enemy, he's working for the Stalinists, that's McCarthyism.  People know that.  The government has nothing to do with socialism.  Well, that's nice.  But around the world, historically, when workers have risen up, the main thing that they've tried to do is take control of state power.  You may not agree with that.  And I respect your right to disagree with that.  But if you read Lenin's book, The State and Revolution, you read Marx's writings where he talks.  I mean, I just read you angles.  The proletariat seizes the public power.  I mean, that's that's generally what the understanding of socialism is.  Your definition of fascism seems pretty fluid.  I mean, you say it's when the government is controlling corporations, then it becomes what's authoritarianism, then, well, no, I mischaracterized it.  Your definition of fascism seems quite all over the place. ",

Well, it turns out her child is alive and the hospital records completely contradict everything she said.  But that was broadcast on CNN.  Hashtag still no info, which was this popular hashtag listing people who'd been disappeared.  Investigations showed that a number of those people couldn't be identified.  However, there were a number of those people on that list who actually had never even been detained and were in their homes, right?  Now, I'm not saying China never did anything wrong, but at a time when our government is trying to whip up suspicion and build a case for war, I take what they say with a grain of salt.  I know that the war makers lie.  I know about the Narya testimony where they had the daughter of the Kuwaiti monarchy or this Kuwaiti royal family member crying in front of Congress saying, oh, they're taking babies out of incubators to build a case for the war against Iraq.  It turned out to be a total lie.  When our government and our media is trying to demonize countries, they often say things that are not true.  And that's just the reality.  So I'm suspicious of some of that.  The social credit system, there's been a lot written about how the way mainstream media in the USA portrays it is not completely accurate.  The Washington Post has run articles.  There have been many, many sources, even within the mainstream press, that say that that narrative that you get is not completely right.  One of the main reasons the social credit system was set up is because there are people in China who've been convicted of crimes have been levied fines by courts and the government has no way of collecting that money.  so it bans them from traveling and it says you can't book a flight until you get on a plane.  well in the united states if you get fined by a court and you're convicted of a crime you're fined by a court and and and you don't pay it you can go to jail.  um the idea that that people are barred from getting on planes simply because they tweeted something critical of the state i think based on what I've read, is not completely accurate.  That's not to say they haven't done anything wrong, okay?  Again, I am an American.  I love my country, contrary to your McCarthyist accusations.  I love my country.  I want things to get better here.  And I don't want to impose the Chinese system here.  I simply want international cooperation and friendship, not McCarthyism, not war hysteria, not polarization. ",

Okay.  So often when defending an authoritarian regime against a genocide accusation, it's more optically and rhetorically efficacious not to outright deny its existence, but rather to draw up some questions like, hey, there is a lot of propaganda here.  Yeah, You know, maybe possibly there are some state actors who have... And then by doing that, you introduce the seeds of doubt that allow other people to then engage in outright denial.  Now, I feel comfortable in making that comparison here because as Nazi Germany was a fascist society that engaged in a genocide, by every reasonable economic definition, China is also a fascist society currently engaging in a genocide.  Though the societies are not exactly the same, there are many, many differences between the two, when we talk about a top-down, authoritarian, xenophobic, ethnostate-like society that imposes state's will on the people but then promises that the glory of the people will be brought about by the sovereignty and the power of the authoritarian, unelected state, I think a little bit, maybe.  And that's kind of the argument that you've made as well, my dude.  You haven't really made any arguments about the autonomy of the worker or the abolition of the commodity form.  Every word out of your mouth to defend China has been defending authoritarianism, which makes me think you're not really a socialist.  I read you this passage from Karl Marx on the Third Address in May 1871.  But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes.  The centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicator, organs wrought after the plan of a systemic and hierarchical division of labor, originates from the days of absolute monarchy, serving nascent middle-class society as a mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism.  Or in essence, the worker seizing the state is not nearly enough.  It's not even close to being nearly enough.  All you're doing is replicating the previous system of government, except with different people in charge.  So we need a more substantive change, which China has not engaged in to any extent whatsoever.  All right. ",

You have painted me as somebody who is in favor of war between America and China, which is patently false.  You have painted me as a McCarthyite for wanting China to be more socialist.

You walked there on your own.  So I didn't even expect it.  I didn't think, like, it was that bad.  But I guess it is.  I guess we are at that point.

I don't think you give a fuck about them, their well-being, their autonomy, their freedom, their alienation from the means of production.  I think you give a fuck about some little cult personality cult you're trying to build while working in tandem with other non-communist states that just happen to dislike America.  And I would like to remind that you, and everyone else who is listening right now, that hating America, while based, is not an ideology.  And if you want to be a real socialist, you're going to have to substantiate yourself a little bit more than that.  Funny that you're the person who assigns, I suppose, the tanky label to himself.
