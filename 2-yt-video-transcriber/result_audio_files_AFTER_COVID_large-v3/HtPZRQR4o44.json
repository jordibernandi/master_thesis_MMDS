And it was my job to help the Department of Homeland Security to keep our country safe.  What we saw was terrifying.  The president told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down because California didn't support him.  He said he wanted to have a deliberate policy of ripping children away from their parents.  He was unfocused, undisciplined.  I have to support Joe Biden for president.
