            "text": "As a humanist, I believe that we only get one life, so we have to make it count.  And I think it's equally important to support other people in making the most of their lives too.  Now we can do that while we're alive, but we can also do it in death as organ donors.  That's why I'm really pleased to hear the new law in England now means that most healthy people will be assumed to be organ donors unless we opt out.  As a humanist, I believe we can't take our organs with us when we die, and I'm sure most of us would agree.  But even after they've stopped being of any use to us, being an organ donor means you can save or improve the lives of people on the waiting list for a transplant.  Organ donation is one of the easiest, kindest things you can ever do.  And it's not just humanists who believe that.  In fact, most people are happy to be organ donors, but too often we just don't get around to opting in.  Now, without making any special effort, most of us will save a life someday.  That's why humanists have argued for this law for years and why we're thrilled to see it finally happen.  You can find out more about the new organ donation law on the NHS blood and transplant website. ",
