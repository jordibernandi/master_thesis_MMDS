For we know that our Abba, Yahuwah, is at this moment waving his hand a second time to recover the house of Israel.  And so we give him praise, honor, and glory.  We are continuing our short series of messages concerning the truth surrounding the birth of our King.  We're also taking out time to expose the lies and the fairy tales and the mythology that have surrounded the birth of our king.  We're going to get rid of all that garbage and perversion and throw it in the trash.  And then we're going to hold tight to that which is true, Zion.  And once again, I stand to defend our holy manuscript.  And to defend the writings of Lucas, who was one of our kinfolk, do not let the heathen tell it.  Luke was a Hebrew Israelite.  He was a doctor.  And yeah, I know people want to try to attack his writings.  Let me tell you something.  You start attacking Luke's writings, you're going to have to throw the whole New Testament in the trash.  Then after you throw the New Testament, you're going to have to throw Isaiah in the trash, Jeremiah in the trash.  You're going to have to throw the Torah in the trash.  You're going to have to throw Micah in the trash.  You're going to have to throw Joel in the trash.  Because all of the books that you hold dear to your soul, Zion, when you look at Luke's writing throughout the Bible, Luke put pen to paper according to his own testimony and eyewitnesses having a perfect understanding of those things which took place.  Oh yes, oh yes.  And let me tell y'all something.  I will take the writings of Luke Over any heathen.  Alive today.  Breathing oxygen. ",

That's your problem.  I read it.  and compared his writings to the writings of the rest of the holy manuscript.  And it does compare 100%, but you have to do Zion.  You have to become a student of the word.  You have to become dedicated to understanding.  And all you're getting gets you understanding Zion.  And in these last days, there's no excuse.  When you're told to study to show yourself approved.  And so we're going to be looking at Luke's account of the birth of our king.  And as we really examine his detailed account, we get a chance to get rid of a whole lot of this garbage that has been put into our minds.  that's not in our manuscript.  Some of these things we've been hearing so long, we automatically assume it must be in the writings and it's not.  So it is my privilege to address once again the honorable 12 tribes of Israel, the apple of Abba Yah's eye, the very sheep of his pasture, his chosen people, you Zion, the 12 tribes of Israel.  let us look at let's continue our story study about the birth of our king.  all right when we look in luke chapter 2 and remember primarily ",

Got to get that picture out of your head that he was, you know, searching around in a strange land he had never been to.  No, this is his homeland.  Got to get the picture out of your head.  There's some weird like manger out in the middle of nowhere where there's just a bunch of animals and stinking feces and all that all around him.  It's not the picture either, Zion.  And I want to prove it today that it says, and while they were there, I want to prove the fact that the pivotal word here that allows the heathen to misrepresent is this word inn.  And I told you this on yesterday that the inn, the inn, I-N-N that they were staying is not an inn like a hotel or an inn or a motel.  That's not the picture when it says no room in the inn.  The literal word is guest room.  There was no room In the guest room.  The guest room was too small.  The reason that.  We find that Miriam.  Is not born in the guest room.  Is because the guest room is too small.  So.  Let me.  I told you yesterday.  I was going to try to find a picture.  And of course. ",

            "text": "When we were in our holy land, we were living in three and four story buildings.  So let me situate this chair over a little bit.  I want to show y'all something.  So what are we looking at here?  This is a cutout.  so so this is what they call a cutaway.  this right here you see it.  so in your mind they're expecting you to know that this wall went all the way up here.  okay the this wall right here went all the way to the top.  this wall right here comes all the way across the front.  Okay, so understand that this is just not showing like.  this is the way the floor was.  This is just like a picture of how the floor, but you see these black, these cutaways mean that this floor right here would go all the way across to here.  This wall right here will go all the way across.  This room right here will go all the way across.  So then you have the picture of this ancient house.  Now look, there's several pictures.  I just tried to find one that was the most clear for the video.  And of course, as I told you, there's a lower floor.  Then there's the floor where people stayed.  Then there's rooms for storage and all that.  There's other ones that will show how they actually heated the house with certain furnaces and things.  Then you have either the roof here, and there's a, in the Bible it talks about, it's better to dwell in the corner of a rooftop than dwell in the house with a cantankerous woman, right?  So the idea of this rooftop, right?  We didn't know this back then, but the rooftop was an actual room.  It was not something that was like random.  Solomon was not just talking when he said that.  Like, oh, man, you just go up there and just sit on top of the edge of a roof.  No, the rooftop is an actual place that it was used as another room.  Remember, these walls would have gone all the way up, right, and created a top.  So what would happen?  as the family expanded, sometimes they would then build what's called another roof on top of this one.  And then this would become an inside room.  So the question is about this end then.  So they will say, well, Maury, so where is the end?  In this type of a room, when Joseph and Miriam got here, no doubt they were greeted.  Remember, once you go inside here, this is all walled.  They were greeted and then led and take these little weak ladders out because in reality, there was probably a stone wall pathway and other video and other pictures.  they had it pretty plain where uh there was brick or stone stairways to every level.  so you had a stone stairway here had a stone stairway that went to the second one and another stone and then sometimes around the back of the house like if it was a three-story house they would just have one long stairway that started down here and it would go all the way up around the outside of the house to the very top of the house.  okay So what would happen in the homes is remember this wall goes all the way across.  Now it's not just from now we see it right here but it goes all the way across the house.  When people would come over they would have living quarters and they would most likely stay in this level right here.  Then you had doors and passages to like where you see these, they put here like little storage containers, but, um, this could also be used if they wanted to for a makeshift room or whatever.  But then you would have on this floor, let's just say that, um, this was a, instead of this being like a one, two, let's say there was three and this was a third one.  What they would do is that they would then divide these into little small sections.  And this little bitty small section that they would cut this off, they would call that the inn or the guest room.  And so a person would come, they'd visit, hey, how y'all doing?  Fine, fine, fine.  They'd go inside the actual house.  Remember this wall would be, there would be another whole floor right here that covers up all this stuff.  And they would chill out right here and they would talk or whatever.  And then, of course, the people that when they got ready to retire for the night would go into the rooms, wherever the bedrooms were, And then if they happen to live in a place that had a guest room, it would most likely be on the next floor.  And it would just be a very small room that could fit maybe like one bed inside that room.  And that would then give a person, you know, the guest would then have privacy from all the activities going on inside the house and on top of the roof or down below.  Don't sound like no hut, does it?  Don't look like no little barn or little stable that you're going to see all over the world.  You're going to see this picture that is weird looking.  This is what you're going to see.  Let me show y'all what you're going to see.  In just a few days, Zion, y'all are going to see this picture everywhere. ",
