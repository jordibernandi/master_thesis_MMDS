            "text": "Hello there, my friends.  Chris Marcus here with you for Arcadia Economics.  And today a video I'm quite excited to finally share.  I've been wanting to do this for a while because I have some good news.  And that is that the big silver short is finally available in paperback form.  We've had the audio version out there for a couple of months which people have really seemed to be enjoying.  Fortunately, now the paperback version is out there.  It's on Amazon, the big silver short, how the Wall Street banks have left the silver market in place for the short squeeze of a lifetime, which whether you're an investor who watched the big short, the movie or read the book and thought, wow, it would be cool to do something like that.  or if you're just trying to protect your family's wealth, or anywhere in between, or you're just looking for an incredible story.  that to me is really the big short part too, It's been stunning to watch this unfold over the past decade.  And especially with so many events indicating that we could be close to the resolution, really wanted to get this book out there before that happened.  So people really wanted to go one place and have it all really put in context.  The book was done through interview format.  You see down here, Ted Butler was in it, Andrew McGuire, the Bart Chilton interview where he confirmed that JP Morgan took over Bear Stearns position.  He confirmed that it was over the allowed limit.  He gave them a temporary waiver to reduce it.  They made it bigger.  This was the exact same time when silver dropped from $21 to $9.  In the midst of 2008, when Bear Stearns was failing, Lehman Brothers was failing, and to top that off, there was a physical shortage of silver.  Dealers could not get product as the price was tumbling, which to me... is perhaps the most blatant smoking gun evidence of the manipulation yet.  That's covered in the book.  Rick Rule talks about silver in the book.  David Morgan, the silver guru, talks about it.  It looks like we even have a couple of reviews down here if you want to read them.  One is Andy Sheckman, so if you want to say he doesn't count, then... fine i mean he was in the book talking about the retail level as well and uh anyway you can find out plenty about it.  just wanted to make a quick video to let you know that it is out.  if you pre-ordered a book they are starting to make their way out there.  appreciate your patience but uh if you haven't gotten it just yet don't if you're not But they're coming.  Thank you to everyone for your support along the way, for watching the channel, which has allowed us to keep going and get this book out, which I think really can make a difference in preparing for what the Fed has coming next.  So with that said, go click on the link below, get your copy now.  And if you'd like to see a preview of what was in here, just stay tuned for the video coming your way.  The land of Arcadia. ",
