            "text": "A while ago, I made a video about Rosa Diaz's coming out arc on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but now I want to talk about basically what happens after the coming out.  Queer stories so often revolve around coming out because it's such a big moment in the lives of so many queer people.  But it's definitely not the only part of our stories.  After every coming out, there's an entire life that follows.  And what I think Brooklyn Nine-Nine has done well and continues to do well is portray its queer characters in a realistic, funny, relatable way beyond their coming out.  These characters don't just spend one episode having their coming out arc and then never talk about it again.  Just like real people, they continue to live their lives, something that, if you're queer, involves a bit of queerness.  But they also don't become just stereotypes.  Their stories don't only become about their queerness.  That kind of representation can be exhausting, because that's not all we are.  These characters on Brooklyn Nine-Nine are given the space to just be normal characters who happen to be queer, which is refreshing and heartwarming.  It strikes a good balance between no queer representation, which sucks, and the full-on only-ever-give-them-storylines-that-have-to-do-with-being-queer kind of representation.  This middle ground is what I'm calling, in this video, casual queer representation.  But really, it's just well-done queer representation.  So first, let's go over Rosa and her girlfriend Jocelyn, and then we can talk about the queer couple that's been in the show since the beginning, Captain Holt and Kevin.  Let's do this.  After coming out as bisexual in season 5 and having some brief things with women, season 6 is when Rosa gets a girlfriend.  In episode 6 of that season, we learn about her because Rosa has some wacky hairstyles throughout the entire episode, and she explains that her girlfriend is in cosmetology school and practicing on her.  Is it bad? ",

That's solid, casual queer representation, if you ask me.  It fits into the plot, it's not forced, it just makes sense.  Can we find a segue? ",

There's conflict between two main queer characters, even if it is really just an issue of miscommunication.  You see, Rosa and Holt's relationship is fun to watch not just because they're both queer, but because they're the two emotionless main characters.  Emotionless in quotes, because they both definitely have emotions.  Holt just hides his behind a nearly unreadable poker face, and Rosa tries to act too tough for emotions.  And so seeing them have any sort of emotional reaction when interacting with each other makes it that much more emotional for the viewer, since they normally don't outwardly express those feelings.  And when you add on top of that the fact that Holt has been out for decades while Rosa only came out recently, you get this incredibly sweet relationship where Rosa looks up to Holt, and Holt wants to make sure that Rosa is happy.  Holt has blazed a bit of a trail for Rosa.  His coming out as a gay man was definitely different from her coming out as a bisexual woman, but he was still the first out queer person in their precinct, and he comforted her when she came out and was scared.

            "text": "So now that Rosa has a girlfriend, you can see why she would be nervous about having her meet Holt.  Holt means so much to her and has helped her through a lot, so if he doesn't like her girlfriend, that would break Rosa's heart.  Thankfully, at the end of the episode, Holt meets Jocelyn and does like her.  The next episode to feature Jocelyn is episode 14, where Rosa has to choose between helping her coworkers catch a hacker in the precinct, or talking to Jocelyn to stop her from breaking up with her.  This episode manages to extract some emotions from Rosa, and has her admit that she really loves Jocelyn.  Here, we see that queer relationships have ups and downs, just like any other relationship.  Jocelyn feels like Rosa prioritizes her work over their relationship, which is a problem that many people face in their relationships, and Rosa has to do something drastic to prove that she will prioritize spending time with Jocelyn more in the future.  It's a really cute moment squeezed into a hectic episode that nails the casual queer representation.  This is Rosa's life, girlfriend and all.  It's not any sort of statement, it's not about her queerness per se, it's just her life, and her life definitely involves her girlfriend.  It's real and genuine and casual the way good queer representation should be.  In between these episodes, Rosa does all sorts of other stuff.  She fires a flaming arrow into a pile of stuff that the squad has thrown away as a part of a Norwegian organizing technique called Munchensmat.  She helps Amy realize that she did the right thing by pursuing a difficult case.  She goes undercover to get the name of someone's supplier.  She solves a murder.  And towards the end of the season, she ships Boyle to New Jersey and opens a door with her chin.  She's got quite a bit going on.  that has nothing to do with her being bi, but she is given the space to date people and talk about them and have them be a part of the show, just like any other character.  And importantly, she doesn't become any kind of stereotype of a bisexual person.  She's still the same Rosa, it's just that now she dates women sometimes.  Then there's Holt and Kevin, also known as Jake's father figures. ",

            "text": "Outside of their relationship together, Holt has all sorts of other plans and ambitions.  He wants to be the commissioner of the NYPD, and when that fails, he goes on a solo vacation to Mexico where he accidentally interrupts Jake and Amy's honeymoon.  He's a complicated character who isn't defined solely by his relationship to Kevin, but who's allowed to have a partner who is a major part of his life, just like any straight captain would.  Kevin even has his own relationship to many of the other characters, like Jake and Gina, and doesn't exist solely as Holt's husband.  When your queer characters are allowed to be their own people with motivations and troubles and relationships just like any straight character, that's when you're nailing the good queer representation.  We don't need more stereotypes, and we don't need more half-second long kisses between nameless queer background characters.  We need fleshed out main characters who just happen to be queer.  We need more Holts, Kevins, Rosas, and Jocelyns.  Hell yeah.  And bonus points if the actor you get to play the character is queer too.  Rosa is played by Stephanie Beatriz, who is out as a bisexual woman, and Jocelyn is played by Cameron Esposito, who is an out lesbian.  I don't think it's necessarily wrong for a straight actor to play a queer character.  I mean, kind of the whole thing about acting is that you're pretending to be someone or something that you're not.  But when a queer character is played by a queer actor, it just means so much more.  That representation exists not only in the character, but also in the actor.  They get to be the representation that they needed growing up.  And people looking up to that character can also look up to that actor in a similar way.  Watching interviews with Stephanie Beatrice is incredible because she's able to talk about what this representation means to her personally, and I think that in itself is powerful and important.  People often ask, why does this character need to be queer?  And it's kind of an insulting question because nobody asks, why does this character need to be straight?  There doesn't necessarily need to be a reason.  Some characters are straight, some are bi, some are gay.  Your characters don't need a reason to have brown hair or be tall, because that's just a part of who they are.  that's chosen by whoever wrote them.  The same goes for their sexual orientation.  But at the same time, queer people exist in the real world, and if you want your show to reflect the real world in some way or be relatable for the people watching it, then it may sense to include queer characters.  It would be weirder to just completely ignore the existence of queer people.  So don't ask, why does this character need to be queer?  Just make queerness a normal part of some of your characters, because it's a normal part of so many people's lives already.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine understands this lesson, which is why the queer representation on the show is so good.  With season 7 coming out so soon, I'm excited to see where it takes Rosa, Holt, and the rest of the cast.
