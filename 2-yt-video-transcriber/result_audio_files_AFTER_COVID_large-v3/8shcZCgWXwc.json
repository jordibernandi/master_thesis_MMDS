            "text": "Hi everyone, Sandman here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Krampus, and here's what he briefly has to say.  Hey Sandman, the great emancipator of men.  Could you please give your thoughts on how men like myself are starting to play the exact same games that women play when dating?  Why is this happening, and what impact do you think it'll have on relationships if this trend continues?  Well, Krampus, thanks for the donation as well as the topic.  I hope that you spoil some slut's Christmas out there.  Playing psychological games is not strictly something that women do.  But in an increasingly gynocentric world, men don't have the ability to confront women directly about their misdeeds.  So we're increasingly forced to become like politicians when it comes to women.  We're learning how to lie and keep a straight face.  Whenever I've done this, I've seen shock and horror once women realized what I was doing.  Not lying directly per se, but behaving normally when you plan on ending a relationship when you're already planning your escape and she has no idea.  Then when you spring the news, there's shock because they never saw it coming.  Only when looking back can they finally see the signs.  A couple of women did this to me and I decided to return the favor.  But the question is, why would I inflict the same pain women inflicted on me onto another woman?  I'll discuss this and more in just a moment.  But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, the MGTOW Book Collection.  Tim Patten has written five MGTOW books.  MGTOW is Forever is the latest and is a great introduction to MGTOW.  If you've been injured on the job and need help, Disabled and Unable to Work is for you.  MGTOW Building Wealth and Power helps you empower your finances.  Masculinity is Our Future is about how the world sees masculinity as toxic and what it means to be a man.  Finally, MGTOW Why I Cheat.  When a woman named Marcia read this book, she wanted to scream out loud, why is MGTOW a real thing?  Thanks for pushing your buttons, Tim.  All five books can be found at the sponsor link down below.  Anyways, now back to clown world.  So why are men taking on more feminine modes of thinking and behavior when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex?  Camille Paglia explained this best in a video that I put in the description when she had a conversation with Jordan Peterson.  She said that when two men would have a dispute, they would step outside the bar and fight it out, and then come back inside as buddies as if nothing had happened.  But when a man has a dispute with a woman in the workplace or his own personal life, He can't hit her like men seem to do in every television show set in the 1950s and 60s.  So men now have no choice but to gaslight, become passive-aggressive, and learn to do what women have had to do to get their way with men throughout the ages.  I've read articles where women would complain that men were being mean and nasty to them by mentally and emotionally manipulating them, and they wanted men to stop and not be allowed to behave that way.  But the thing is, if men were forced to stop behaving like this, then women would also be revealed as being evil puppet masters pulling the tampon strings behind the scenes.  I'm thinking that by complaining, they're just hoping that the individual males reading such articles change their behavior, since most men's biology is all about making sure that the world is safe and comfortable for women.  But I'm seeing men increasingly taking on feminine traits like gaslighting, where wives and girlfriends would ask them to do something and they would do a terrible job, and their significant other would lose their minds while the man was laughing inside at all the emotional abuse he was causing.  I've said it before that the secret to a happy relationship is to make sure that your partner is more miserable than you are.  But the secret to a happy life is also not to get into a relationship in the first place.  So men are now gaslighting, for example, mowing the lawn in a terrible way.  And then when the wife complains, the guy says, well, if you're not happy with the job I just did and appreciate all the hard work I put in, then mow it yourself.  But the guy intentionally did the bad job so he would make that statement.  A wife that's spiteful about having to cook dinner all the time back in the 1960s might make the same statements after her husband complained about how the food was prepared for dinner and it was terrible.  I've been the victim of gaslighting before, and I've learned how it works, and instead of not doing it to others, I decided to use it.  Women don't seem to understand that if they eliminate men's ability to fight back using traditional masculine behaviors, then we're going to fight back using the female ones.  The first few times I fought back in trying to manipulate women with their own techniques, you could see them grinning back like the Cheshire Cat knowing exactly what I was doing.  But as I got more practice doing it, it became more seamless.  I learned how to believe my own lies while still knowing that they were lies in the back of my mind.  When I would call women on their lies or potential lies, they would typically giggle like giddy little school girls because I'd caught them doing something bad.  But when they would try and call me out on what I was doing, I wouldn't laugh and I would just keep a straight face all the way to the end.  Another game that women play is also using sex on a first date or quickly into the relationship to make men fall in love as fast as possible with them.  But many alpha chads figure this out and are going around banging as many fives and sixes as they can.  To many inexperienced women, they look too good to be true and they want such men to fill them with their goo.  The more time she does it and gets burned, she adds emotional mileage.  And women's response to chads gaming them like a Pac-Man is to treat lesser quality men on dates like human garbage.  Experiences like that are at least partially responsible for me going my own way.  Women's response to men going their own way is complete and utter sexual starvation for a little less than half the male population, making them thirstier than ever.  Eventually women having to maintain constant control over men is going to drive men to technology that completely replaces them.  Why do you think that red pill and black pill philosophies are spreading and showing up at this point in history?  The obvious reason is because of the internet making men anonymous, but also because men need their own Cosmo magazine to teach each other about women.  MGTOW is the greatest of women's tricks used against them.  Women always talk about us and we're powerless to stop the gossip of girls' night outs.  Now they're powerless to stop men sharing information about them online.  Men using PUA techniques to get into their pants was just the start.  I made a video a while back called, My Wife Cheated So I Arranged a Divorce, which was a story on Reddit.  The guy in it did all the things to his ex-wife that we typically hear wives doing to their ex-husbands, and yet his wife is still having sex with him after the divorce, hoping that he falls back in love with her and that she can take his house, money, and kids that he ended up winning in the divorce.  Of course, he's learned to completely emotionally detach from her, and that's another potential great trick.  Women not loving us the way we love them.  Now many men, including myself, have banished love from our hearts.  Two souls that feel nothing for one another are entering a relationship.  Gee, who do you think is going to win?  The man that gets sex up front or the woman that gives sex up front so she can get cash and prizes and financial assets on the back end of the relationship?  The man can bang and be gone and make a trophy out of her thong.  The muff magician doesn't like it when you use the same magic on her that she uses on you.  Krampus asks for how this is going to affect relationships.  Obviously, relationships will become an endangered species, as more and more men with self-respect choose to eject.  If you've been disrespected and you're mentally healthy, then you'll leave instead of taking all that abuse.  But as you know, there are probably tons of soy boys out there that enjoy being humiliated with a broom shoved up their schwing-schwang.  women have started dominating men in greater numbers than ever.  And many men are turning into passive 1950s housewives.  But the men that play the games back against women, they're forcing women to up their game and start to see even the least threatening soy boys as a potential threat.  What really bothers me is not men treating women the way that women treat them, but instead men treating other men the way that women treat them.  All those so-called male feminist allies out there are just men with feminized minds.  They think that they're part of the female collective or something, and have own group preference when it comes to women.  So when you criticize women, they take it personally.  Sure, men can use women's tricks against them, but women are creating new tricks to trick men into manginas and fight for their side.  Of course, the women doing this don't want these men for relationship material.  Dominating over them is simply a short-term pleasure, but in the longer term they still want a man where they can slowly break his spirit instead.  I've said before that first it takes a village to raise a child, but today it takes the village people with things like Drag Queen Story Hour.  After the village, then it was extended families that raised children.  Then the nuclear family, and we're now starting to see that breakdown as well.  Eventually we will atomize into individuals, and future generations will wonder how we ever lived unhappily with the opposite sex.  After all, I'm going to repeat what Al Bundy said for the millionth time.  Don't try and understand women, because women understand women and they hate each other.  The more that men understand women, the less likely we are to tolerate their BS in relationships.  The more we behave like them and understand them, the more we will back away from relationships and family formation entirely.  red pills, black pills, purple pills, they're all waking up men to female nature.  Maybe cultures that keep men and women segregated figured out that if we have contact with each other too much at the time, then we'll see the magic behind the meat curtains and the relationships won't be desirable anymore.  Another technique that I've seen men using recently is cutting off women from their female friends.  In the past, a man might have been doing that by threatening to dump her or hit her.  I've known women that told me secrets about other women, so I would use those other women and use them as a pawn in a proxy war between the two of them.  I've begun to use the information they share to my advantage, by making women question whether or not I know something secret about them, but I won't tell them for sure.  This drives them crazy because women need to know what's going on, or they end up becoming mentally ill.  The female collective shares everything regardless of who it hurts, but as men we can know something about a woman and only hint that we know something, but they don't know what we know.  I don't think women are prepared for this.  I don't think they understand that we're going to compete with them, and if we can't do it physically, we're going to do it psychologically.  If you don't believe me, then just look at that Jordan Peterson interview on Sky News.  Women better be careful what monster they release in men as a result.  My experience is that when I first tried psychological manipulation techniques on women, they thought it was cute.  Because they could see right through me as if I was a pair of 10-year-old underwear.  But as I became better at it, they had no idea what I was up to.  Five years ago as I was finishing up dating, I used a woman to get a discount on a television.  Picked it up and never saw her again.  Just like the way a girl lied to me after Christmas.  After I bought her a gift and she said that she was being busy and then a friend of mine saw her at the mall.  So I decided to never speak to her again because she lied to me.  I just cut things off and didn't feel any heartbreak at all.  Just rage.  Women always seem to look at a man's bad behavior as betrayal.  But there is only one issue with that.  The more times you're damaged, eventually you just can't bond with a whore anymore.  As many of you know, there are plenty of stories from men in the past where the women that they were with gave them divorce papers and they had zero idea that they were coming.  Funny how I heard a guy say he did the exact same thing to a woman, a woman that probably would have manipulated his children against him and taken custody of them and gotten the house into divorce.  Instead, he did the same thing to her.  I think that men have the element of surprise if we act like typical men, and then when things matter, we use all of women's tricks against them, and they have no idea what just happened.  Anyways, that's it for today.  Thanks again to Krampus for the donation and topic.  Don't forget to smash the like button the way that you smash a woman's sense of reality when you manipulate her the way a woman would traditionally manipulate a man.
