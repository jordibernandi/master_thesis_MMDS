            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  And I did a video last week talking about how some of the laws that cause wrongful convictions are crafted by feminists and there's actually a bit of a logic loop to how this happens.  And so that's what I'm going to focus on exposing with this video series that I'm doing.  In the course of doing research, I check new cases that come out every day.  And today I want to talk about a very fascinating case involving, as Joe Pesci would say, two youths, two young women, a 15 year old who was the accused and a 16 year old who was the victim.  The 15-year-old was convicted, but it's an interesting case to look at because we hear constantly about male violence, but there's an erasure of female violence.  And in fact, in the past when relational aggression, which is typically a female form of violence, was being studied and exposed, it quickly was put an end to saying guys do it too.  But mostly guys start doing it when they're older and they picked up some of these tricks and techniques from their female friends in school.  So it happens a lot in high school and this case takes place in a high school.  The names in the case are redacted.  I'm going to put a link below and I suggest you go read it.  And one of the very interesting things that goes on in this is that the defense lawyer, he's in a bit of a bind because his client is on video assaulting the other girl.  It's potentially an amusing case because the weapon that was used was a cup of hot noodles.  Now, it sounds kind of petty, but the noodles actually had scalding hot water in them.  The accused knew that the water was scalding.  She was in fact waiting for it to cool down.  And she claimed that she blacked out and threw these noodles while she was in a state of automatism.  And this is where it connects to my last videos and this ongoing series.  So there's a case in Canada that's going to Supreme Court and it involves the use of self-induced extreme intoxication.  We're talking about intoxication to the point where their actions are involuntary and they've reached a state called automatism.  And it has to be extreme.  It's very rarely successful.  But that doesn't mean that people won't try to use it.  And so feminists are denouncing this.  They're saying that, in fact, the law that was found to be unconstitutional was feminist designed.  And so they're upset that the law that they helped to craft the wording on is not being allowed to continue.  It took 20 years, though, for this law to get overturned because it is so rare for the defense to be successful.  and so their plan at the beginning was they're going to pass this unconstitutional law and then when it's finally challenged they'll go in and litigate like hell to claim that women's equality rights override the rights of the accused.  and obviously this is going to have to take some unpacking.  and that's what i'm doing in these videos trying to break it down and where i'm starting at is showing how case law successful uses of this defense are extremely rare but feminists are saying that it's rampant and in the midst of putting forward all of their you know case histories and so on they misrepresent what actually happened in cases where it is successful and they also ignore women who try to use this defense.  so in this case the case of the hot noodles I want to break it down and and look at some of the absurdity and the issue and the problem of feminists trying to bar men from using specific defenses that are not only allowed for women, but they're allowed in lesser circumstances.  We have this 15-year-old girl who's referred to as SH, and her victim is MVT.  So at paragraph 125, there's a pretty good summary of the situation.  Whether she asserts mental disorder automatism or non-mental order automatism, SH bears the evidentiary burden to prove on a balance of probabilities that she committed these offenses involuntarily.  So that is actually the case with any claim about automatism from a man or a woman, that as soon as that arises, the burden shifts and there has to be some evidence from the accused that they were in that state.  That can come in the form of witnesses, but who may have actually observed or spoken to the individual saying they were very confused or whatever was going on.  But it generally requires expert testimony as well.  SH testified she suffered trauma in the past, and events which occurred on December 11th of 2018 in the girls' bathroom at their high school triggered flashbacks, resulting in SH throwing the noodles at MBT while in a dissociated state.  After the event, SH sent a text message to SML, this is a friend of hers, asking her what had happened in the bathroom because she had, quote, blacked out.  Although this suggests that she has experience with blacking out, SH provided the court with no medical history of specific disassociated events.  Thus, it is not clear whether the defense is that S.H.  suffers from a recurring disorder, which would fall under the rubric of mental disorder automatism, or a single incident of automatism triggered by a specific event, which was unlikely to recur.  And on this occasion, S. had retreated to a bathroom, which apparently was common because there's no video cameras at the school in this washroom, and she'd taken a cup of hot noodles after somebody in the office had allowed her to use the kettle.  So she's sitting there waiting for her noodles to cool down, and she was skipping class.  She was supposed to have gone back to her class.  Paragraph 159, the defense counsel argues.  S.H.  retreated to the girls' bathroom in search of solitude.  When asked in direct examination, though, S.H.  said she went to the bathroom because she didn't want to go to class.  However this comes about, the two of them are alone in the bathroom and a verbal fight ensues.  And it was essentially an escalation of, you're ugly, I know you are, but what am I?  Just as you would imagine from teenage girls.  But the problem comes when S ends up Instagramming or something like that, causing a friend of hers to say, hey, do you need help?  And she ends up with a backup girl in the bathroom who's just standing there going, oh yeah, oh yeah.  And of course the part that has more to do with whether or not she would have been acquitted had her victim been male.  Section 34 asks about the size, age, gender, and physical capabilities of the parties to the incident.  The defense points out in this case that MVT was older, more mature, in a higher grade than SH, and she also had previous experience in a fight.  Although MBT was nine months older than SH, I do not find there was a significant difference in their physical size.  I have no evidence as to SH's fighting experience, only SD's, another girl.  The fight to which SH refers was one MBT had with TM a year before, which apparently MBT lost.  So M being a year older and a little bit more mature and articulate is winning this verbal fight.  So S ends up on video, putting her cell phone down on the counter, turning to her noodles, taking the lid off and then tossing it, aiming at M's face and thankfully only hitting her chest.  I say thankfully, because even though this sounds really petty, the water was so hot that M ends up needing to go to the hospital and she ended up needing skin grafts.  She'll have permanent scarring from this.  So of course the defense is in this bind where his client is on video taking all these actions.  So one of the things that they consider in terms of self-defense is, is the victim of the current actions, the current assault, was the victim part of the trigger that caused the person to take the action?  So this would be connected to the battered woman's defense.  And in this case, S was claiming that because they'd been at odds with each other in the past and there was this online verbal battle going on, that she had reason to be afraid.  So this is called victim as trigger.  SH declined to testify as to the nature of her trauma, but there's no indication that MVT was its cause.  Historically, SH and MVT had very little interaction.  They'd never fought, and although MVT and SD had swapped unpleasantries on social media, there was little evidence of SH and MVT having done so.  Interestingly, the only evidence of physical fighting that was brought into the trial was that MVT was being taunted by SH for having lost a physical fight in the past.  Now, one of the things I want you to keep in mind when you're reading this decision and every other decision that comes out of court, because judges get attacked all the time unfairly, that if either side, the prosecution or the defense, puts forward a suggestion to them that there should be an acquittal or a conviction on a certain ground, the judge is meant to address that proposal.  in their verdict.  So there's things that the judge may bring up.  These aren't coming out of his own brain.  These are things that have to be put into their reasons.  Juries don't have to give reasons, but judges do.  the very fact that he's talking about some of this stuff is not concerning to me whatsoever.  You also have to keep in mind when you're reading decisions that the decision will go through suggestions that were made and you have to be very careful to separate out what is being said that the defense proposed and what the judge actually finds and also what's being proposed by the prosecutor that the judge may accept or reject in the decision.  So When you're quoting from these things, you have to make sure that you're quoting what the judge actually believes or what the judge found, as opposed to what the judge is saying.  he was told, he or she.  But it is of concern that the judge accepted that S.H.  was fearful of MBT, even though S.H.  had a friend who joined them in the bathroom, so essentially it was two against one at the time.  And this is the part where they look at the difference in size and gender.  Of course, they're both female in this case, but the judge did find that he accepted SH perceived MBT as a threat and that her perception was not unreasonable.  There seems to be a belief that women don't engage in violence unless there's a very good reason.  And in this case, you'll actually see that women are permitted to talk about past abuse And in this case, it's denied, but sometimes even if that abuse comes from a different person other than the actual victim.  Now, paragraph 161, it's argued that it was the victim's fault that she got injured, that section 34, part 2c, the person's role in the incident has to be considered.  Defense counsel submits that MBT was the person driving the conflict and the only act for which SH can be faulted is her December 7th, 2018 comment on Facebook asking MVT the whereabouts of her fight video.  And of course the bigger picture is if all the circumstances remained the same, but were both male, would this case have looked any different?  And nobody's really asking that.  All I can tell you is that in this particular case, I think the judge came to the correct conclusion, even though it took him a long time to get there, that SH was in fact guilty of assault causing bodily harm and assault with a weapon.  All right, so it's a really interesting case and I suggest that you go read the full thing.  It's really fascinating for some of the reasons that I've pointed out, but you may find your own reasons to find this interesting.  In the end, what we need to do is we need to, when we look at law and whether or not the law is functioning properly and whether rights of accused are actually being respected in courts of law, that we have to look at the full scope.  We can't cherry pick cases as feminists do when they're making suggestions about the law to parliament.  And I'm going to explain how the parliament is affected by the input from these groups as we go through the video series.  And I'll be looking at some other cases that were actually used by feminists.  This one wasn't.  There were no cases which involved male victims or female perpetrators that were presented to parliament.  And then that's part of the bigger picture.  So I'll be back next week with more cases. ",
