If something in mathematics didn't match what we experience in reality, then we would change the description.  That description being mathematics.  This isn't done so much with the basics of mathematics anymore, but mathematics still is in flux, and we still change mathematics to help us describe our reality.  I mean, Newton had to invent a whole new branch of mathematics in order to describe the motion of the planets.  That would be calculus.  In 2015, Terence Tao provided a proof for the Erdos discrepancy problem.  This mathematical formula measures local randomness of DNA sequences.  So new advancements in mathematics are happening all the time.  So it's not really that the universe operates mathematically.  Mathematics just describes how the universe operates.

Mathematics enabled astronomers to pinpoint the location of a previously undiscovered planet, and James Clerk Maxwell used mathematics to predict the existence of radio waves.  Albert Einstein, working with theoretical mathematics developed fifty years earlier, formulated his General Theory of Relativity, a pillar of modern physics.  His calculations were later confirmed during a solar eclipse, when Arthur Eddington observed light from distant stars bending around the Sun.  Then, Peter Higgs used mathematical equations to predict the existence of an elementary particle.  It took 48 years, billions of dollars, and millions of man hours for experimental scientists to finally detect the Higgs boson.

Like I've said before in this video, if mathematics fails to describe any aspect of our physical reality, then we change mathematics in order to describe our physical reality.  For instance, When scalar values were found to be insufficient to describe forces, we first invented vectors and then tensors so that we could accurately describe forces.  Those are human inventions, and those are things that we inserted into mathematics to change mathematics on the whole so that we can more accurately describe our reality.

Also, I'm unsure as to why infinite dimensional spaces not existing in physical reality causes a problem for mathematics.  First off, infinite is not a real or complex number.  It's a concept of just a very large number that can't be represented as a real number.  I don't know why that has to exist in reality either.
