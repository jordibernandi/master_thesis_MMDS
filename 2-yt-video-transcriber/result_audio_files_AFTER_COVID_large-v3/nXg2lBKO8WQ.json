            "text": "twister christian.  today i want to give you guys some pretty important information about what's coming we talked about in the past.  um i've always thought that there would be many currencies going at once.  you know the baskets of currencies all these different currencies.  they're all going to go at once.  but as time goes on And I even brought this up in a video that I did in December of 2018 where I talked about the multiple explosions of currencies.  Now, of course, this issue, I'm pretty sure it's been touched on other people and I may or may not have heard their videos, but I was listening to.  Pimpy's Investment Chat.  And he's got a video titled Big Trouble for Countries that Manipulate Currencies.  So he was talking about basically the whole thing about different currencies changing in value maybe at a later point.  So it brought me back to the video that I made and then I began to do some digging and some research on what he was talking about dealing with currency manipulation and these new rules that go into effect.  So I'm going to give you guys a little history, just really, really quick.  Okay, back in February 10th of 2017, the President of the United States, Trump on currencies.  We will all soon be at a level playing field.  Okay, and it says here, President Donald Trump on Friday predicted a level playing field on currencies and trade renewals, promised to take measures to allow America to compete more fairly on the global market.  All right, here, February 4th.  US finalized rules to slap duties on currency manipulators.  And this is coming out of Malaysia, which is important, this news article.  Just to kind of reiterate what the last article said, I'm going to read just one paragraph out of this here.  So they say US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the new rule marked another important step intended to level the playing field for American businesses and workers.  All right, so they're talking about level the playing field, right?  And how are they gonna do that?  So just really quick, I'm just gonna play just different parts of this video of what I said during that time period, right?  This is back December 26th, 2018. ",

            "text": "Hey, this is Jay, Twisted Christian.  Today I'm going to talk about something to do with the currency markets and the upcoming, what some people call, world currency revaluation.  I want everybody to be prepared to be ready to put money into other currencies that do not revalue at this time.  There will be some countries that will not be ready for whatever reason And that's just my opinion that some countries won't be ready.  So my suggestion would be for those who are into currency trading, start looking at the top, you know, the top 20 currencies other than the IRAK DINAR that you would invest in if there's no change in value when the IRAK DINAR changes.  This could be a chain reaction one at a time.  I believe that there could be a chain reaction going as far as maybe even a year.  some of these countries like i said they're just not ready to revalue yet they're not ready to change their currency and it very well could trickle down into a chain reaction where other currencies start taking off ",

But if I feel impressed to say something, I'm gonna do it.  And now it's a marker video, at least for myself.  So before we get into this article, one of the questions I want to ask is if countries are undervalued, then what's their real value if there is a lot of this currency manipulation?  So I'm going to go ahead and read this article.  And maybe that'll give us a better understanding of kind of what's going on down the road when it concerns a lot of these currencies that are undervalued.  Some of the ones that we discussed that Vietnamese Dong and Thai Baht and a few others.  Okay, so this is like a congressional report.  And so this came out.  it says here updated February 13th 2020.  All right is entitled currency manipulation and countervailing duties.  So I'm gonna go ahead and just read pretty quick.  I'm not gonna read the whole entire thing.  I'm gonna read the most important things that you guys might have an a better understanding and this link will be down below in the description.  and On February 4, 2020, the Commerce Department issued a final rule that paves the way for imposing tariffs on imports from countries determined by the U.S.  government to be undervaluing their currency relative to the U.S.  dollar.  Various members of Congress have debated such a policy for years, including in 2013 and 2015, but Congress has refrained from legislating it due to a variety of concerns.  Okay, so they issued a final rule for imposing tariffs on countries that are undervaluing their currency.  The Commerce Department's rule changed during the 2016 presidential debate.  Donald Trump raised currency manipulation, particularly by China, a key concern since assuming office.  The Trump administration has taken various actions to address it.  The USMCA includes enforceable commitments on exchange rates.  The first time such provision has been included in a US trade agreement, the Treasury Department China as a currency manipulator under the 1988 Trade Act between August 2019 and January 2020.  The first-time deflection designation has been made in 25 years, and currency commitments were included as part of the U.S.-China Phase 1 deal.  President Trump has also expressed concerns about the exchange rate policies of the Eurozone, Brazil, and Argentina.  Alright, so I find that interesting there.  So this right here, the rule change, right, dealing with currency manipulation.  Alright, so you got an agreement between Mexico and the United States.  So how's that going to relate to the exchange rate in Mexico, right?  The peso.  So you got to look at that.  So if you're an investor, you got to look at that.  Okay, boom, there's one to look at because it's already included in the deal.  And the next one, Brazil and Argentina.  On my YouTube channel, I did talk about investing in the Argentina Peso.  And that's one of the ones that I'm looking at too as well.  After the Denar revaluation, I really believe that the South American currencies would be the ones that would come later on.  not necessarily at the beginning.  It is unclear which countries might be targets under the proposed policy, partly because there is a disagreement among economists about whether countries are able to manipulate their currencies, and if so, the best economic models for estimating currency under valuation.  Treasury maintains a monitoring list of major trading partners whose currencies practice merit close attention.  which in January 2020 included China, Japan, Korea, Germany, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Switzerland.

            "text": "Now, there's a list of countries.  they're saying that they are possibly manipulating the currency.  So when you look at investing, you're gonna look at South Korea, Japan, you're gonna look at Germany, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Switzerland.  When I looked at the rate for Switzerland, it didn't really, it was a pretty close rate, but when we look at Vietnam, we look at Malaysia, we look at Singapore, Look at those three countries or and also Korea and Japan.  Now, of course, I'm not going to include China in this, but you got five Asian countries that are on that list.  I would go ahead and take a look at the exchange rates of those particular countries.  Right.  And then you can say, OK, I can add these to my list because these might be an investment.  Now, some of these countries might be to.  the exchange rate might be too high.  Okay, so now we have the implementation.  The new rule allows commerce to consider whether a benefit is conferred to foreign producers from the exchange in the United States dollars for the currency of a country under review.  Commerce will only make an affirmative finding if there has been government action on the exchange rate and will not normally include monetary and related credit policy of an independent central bank or monetary authority.  when making its consideration commerce has stated that it intends to defer the treasury expertise with respect to the currency under valuation but noted that the treasury's analysis is distinct from the analysis of as to whether there is undervaluation for purposes of a CVD proceedings.  Thus, Commerce will retain the ultimate authority on administrating CVD law with respect to the different existing undervaluation.  This is the big one.  On April 6, 2020, the rules are going to affect and U.S.  industries can begin submitting petitions for potential relief to the U.S.  International Trade Commission and Commerce International Trade and Mission.  So this is one of those things that.  could very well potentially start raising the value of multiple currencies.  okay so the first thing is this rule takes effect on april 6 2020. right that doesn't necessarily mean that all of a sudden currencies are going to start.  they're going to start changing their value but at some point a country that is under that particular watch They're going to have to make a decision either to pay the tariffs or raise their value.  So that's going to be very interesting, you know, and.  I tried to find something on Iraq and currency manipulation, and I couldn't really find anything, just mainly interference from Iran in currency and stuff like that, but nothing that has caught the attention of the United States as far as manipulating it on purpose.  And this is the thing, is this the kind of rule that's gonna force Iraq to do that?  And one of the things, you know, and I know a lot of people, you know, everybody has a different opinion about different gurus and stuff.  And I only listened to really just a handful of, of, of people.  And, you know, you guys know, I listened to currency through 65, uh, ",
