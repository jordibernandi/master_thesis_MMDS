At the bottom, I have the more basic show-offism among the victims of racism.  Yes.  Non-white people.  That's the non-white people, the victims of racism.  Now, what's number one?  Showing off to each other the things that white people have allowed them to obtain.  Yes, sir.  Right.  Number two, showing off to each other the information that white people have allowed them to obtain.  Okay.  Number three, showing off to each other... The ability to belittle each other.  Okay.  I think we mentioned that earlier in the program.  Yeah, we did.  By name-calling and all that.  That's a form of showing off.  We do a lot of name-calling, calling black females bitches and whores and whatnot.  Yes, sir.  That's showing off.  Absolutely.  Number four, showing off to each other their ability to make sexual impressions on each other.  That's the four basic show-offisms among the dark people, the people of color, primarily, on the planet.  And we should stop all of those four.  Stop showing off.  Yes, that's it.  Showing off the things.  We've got a few little trinkets here and there, a car, a house, or whatnot, or something to put in the house, or something to put on the car, or something to wear around your neck.  or go into a hair place and show off.  Showing off?  Showing off to whom?  Who are you showing off to?  And what are you going to get for showing off?  Who is going to give you anything for showing off?  Okay?  We don't ask ourselves this.  We should stop any kind of show-offism.  And those are four of the basics.  Now, I don't know if I answered the question.  I just described what the show-offisms are.  And I said, stop these four show-offisms, all of them.  Why?  Because they're not constructive.  That's why every move that you make on the planet, every day, every minute, is going to be in one of two categories, something constructive, something non-constructive.  Showing off has not proven to be constructive among black people, among the non-white people of the planet.  It doesn't have a constructive effect.  Showing off the ability to belittle each other, nothing constructive about that.  It's going around all day name-calling people.  That's not constructive.  That's belittling.  Yes.  trying to make people feel like they're nothing and whatnot, and that you're something special.  That's showing all right. ",
