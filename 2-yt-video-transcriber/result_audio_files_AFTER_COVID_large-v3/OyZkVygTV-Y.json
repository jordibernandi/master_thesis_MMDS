            "text": "Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  To the 12 tribes of Israel that have been scattered worldwide.  This is Moray Yoshiyahu Dawi Ben Israel.  Having another opportunity and a privilege to talk to Zion to be able to help wake up Jacob who because of our sins and disobedience of our ancestors according to the holy manuscript have been scattered to the four corners of the earth.  and most of you all watching me right now of the bloodline descended you are still living in the land of your captivity.  And of course, according to the Holy Manuscript, this last major captivity would last 400 years.  And 400 years to the day, we know that Yah has waved his hand a second time to recover his people.  we give our praise that he's using us in these last days to help wake up Jacob.  hallelujah Zion 2020 has been.  it's been a crazy year for everybody but we staying strong.  we just came out of our eight day feast of dedication which obviously led us To the truth concerning dedication, it has to do with us.  It's bigger than a temple.  It's bigger than a church.  It's bigger than the Maccabees.  The dedication now is about Yah's people being dedicated once again to him.  It's not the cleaning up.  I'm just going to say it like this.  It's not the cleaning of the pork blood out of the temple in Jerusalem.  It's the cleaning of the pork blood and abominations out of the heart, mind, and soul of the very children of Israel.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  And as we studied that, we noticed, you know, Hula did some research.  I hope you all got that download made available on the word Hanukkah, which took us back to the word dedication.  And we found out through study that our people understood dedication from birth.  Yeah, we didn't need a temple to tell us how we are supposed to be dedicated and separated unto Abba Yah.  And then, of course, that led us to studying that of the birth of Yahakana and then, of course, the birth of Hamashiach.  And so on the Shabbat, we had an opportunity to share.  Which I call like a part one of the birth of Hamashiach and to tell the truth and to set the record straight.  Because the heathen who's had our book has messed this thing up so bad and turned our history into some kind of weird European fairy tale.  No, this is our history and this is our culture.  This is a time right before Hamashiach comes back.  This is the time that he's calling us to set the record straight.  And to tell it like it's supposed to be told.  And that's why we laid out in the very first of these messages concerning the birth of our king.  We laid out with an uncertain turn.  This was no happy time.  These were the darkest days Israel ever seen.  This was a dark time when the Europeans who had no regard for the older or the young were on a world conquest.  And then you had this nasty, dirty dog, Caesar Augustus, who had made himself out to be some kind of God on Earth.  By conquest and Toxa Romana, which is the crushing of any kind of rebellion, the crushing down and stepping down of any type of wars against the empire as the empire began to spread.  And they were so ruthless.  If y'all read it, you read the Acts of the Roman Empire, it'll make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and curl.  It's terrible.  They were some nasty, dirty, evil, dog-faced, satanic people whose thirst for blood And thirst for human slavery and control and power was unquenchable.  And it was during this time that they had taken over the very holy land of our people.  We're going to prove it.  It was at this time also that you had this Quirinius, who according to the, in your Bible, it says Cyrenius, but Quirinius.  Y'all know Quirinius was one of these people.  dirty, nasty dog pigs.  I heard a brother say this.  I didn't say this.  A brother said this.  This is one of them narcissistic bastards who sought to take over the whole world working for the government.  He instituted national taxation.  And again, it was a racket.  I don't want to, I ain't got time for that right now, but it was a racket among our people to keep them oppressed.  to keep them poor never being able to to gain wealth.  watch this not even being able to become wealthy off of their own land Zion.  And then we prove that those those same days are up on us once again.  And I wanted to put this video out right here to tell you that we're going to be getting into the second part of that message.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, because we have to tell the truth.  And I'm going to be putting these up in segments.  So they're going to be because we don't have strong Wi-Fi where we are.  We'll be putting them up in little sections and segments.  And we need you all to catch each one of them.  If you can, you might want to put them together later.  But we'll put up these segments.  I'll be using my iPhone Zion.  So you want to click on each one of these and then it's all going to make sense when it all is put together.  Because we're getting ready to learn in the very next segment a little bit of insight concerning Yosef, hallelujah, and Miriam and what really was going on in holy Jerusalem down in Bethlehem.  Oh yeah, we're going to study it.  We're going to see what was going on in the nation of Judea, our homeland.  And we're going to see that it was no Christmas, December the 25th celebration that was going on down in our holy land.  It was Sukkot.  We're going to see some truth about the birth of our king, that these old nasty Europeans in Hollywood have perverted and got our folk thinking that it's some kind of weird fairy tale.  No, Zion, as the Moray, we're going to set the record straight.  Pray for me as we put up these segments.  Each segment going to run about the same amount of time so that I can then quickly upload them up onto the web.  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  And by the time we finish these quick little segments, the whole world is going to understand that our king is the king.  He's the king of kings and the master of masters.  And told our rabbi to all of you who support this work.  Without you, there's no way we could do what we do.  There's no way we can continue.  And we're committed to you.  As the ark, we're committed to you.  to continue to support you.  And no matter what, Zaya, we got to stay strong in these last days, encouraging each other.  And we have to continue to study, to show ourselves approved workmen that need not be ashamed, but doing what?  Rightly dividing the word of truth.  So y'all make sure you subscribe to the channel and hit that bell.  So when these videos are uploaded, you will get the notification because they're going to be coming out over these next several days.  One love, Zion.  Shalom. ",
