            "text": "We cannot maintain a president who is a pathological liar.  Now he's making up a story about getting arrested in apartheid South Africa.  This is God's truth.  My word is a Biden.  It's weird.  He is a fraud.  At least 31 different lies Biden has told about being an activist in the civil rights movement.  Just flat out lie.  That's disgusting.  Trump said he would provide health care to everybody.  He lied.  Joe Biden seemed very much to suggest that if Medicare for all did come to his desk, he would actually veto it.  We cannot maintain a president fostering sexism.  There was three corroborating witnesses for Anita Hill and Joe Biden did not allow them to testify.  She never got a direct apology from Biden.  He thinks that he's gonna win by dividing us up.  The younger generation now tells me how tough things are.  Give me a break.  No, no.  I have no empathy for it.  Give me a break.  What we need is a new politics which brings young people into our political movement, working class people into our political movement.  You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics.  We're going to beat Trump Because this will become a contrast in ideas.  One of us in this race led the opposition to the war in Iraq.  War would be a terrible mistake.  Another voted for the war in Iraq.  Hundreds of thousands now... dead.  one of us has spent his entire life fighting against cuts in social security.  another candidate calling for cuts.  social security medicare medicaid i'm at every single solitary thing.  we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of the elderly disabled vets or the children.  you've got to put all of it on the table.  One of us led the opposition to disastrous trade agreements.  Another candidate voted for disastrous trade agreements, which cost us millions of good-paying jobs.  The people understand it is our campaign, our movement, which is best to defeat Trump.  And this is what the choice is about.  Bernie Sanders was the only one I didn't want to think about. ",
