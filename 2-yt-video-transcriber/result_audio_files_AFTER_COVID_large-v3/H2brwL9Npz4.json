            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  In this video, I will be talking about the strange relationship between Liza Koshy and Will Smith.  What is happening?  Should we be concerned?  Is the prediction dictated about Will and Jada?  And, well, anyway, I'll play it for you guys.  Let's talk.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is the Truth Show, and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  I mean, this is the Truth Show.  Oh, yes.  Well, here are the predictions for next year.  Will and Jada Pickens-Smith will split, but not divorce.  Finally, after one of them being exposed while in the midst of a torrid affair.  Some of you are wondering who Liza Kashi is.  Well, Elizabeth Shaili Akashi, aka Liza Kashi, was born on March 31st, 1996, and is an actress, television host, comedian, and YouTuber who found success on Vine.  She played in Tyler Perry's horror comedy film called Boo and Medea's Halloween and many more features and TV skits and so on after that.  She also dated David Julian Dobrik, who is Slovakian YouTuber personality.  He also found success online.  He started his channel back in 2014 and is now a millionaire.  And you know, just like Liza.  David and Liza dated for about two years and said they weren't together anymore because they wanted some time to process what was going on.  They've assured everyone that they are still friends and that the breakup was amicable.  and that they had nothing but respect for each other.  In the two days since it was published on their YouTube video, title We Broke Up, has been viewed more than 62 million times.  However, many questioned the validity of their relationship and often wonder, was it all just for publicity?  You know, YouTubers and actors and actresses, they all do this.  It's not uncommon.  We talked about this.  I don't know if their relationship is building or not.  And honestly, don't freaking care.  It's not the point of this video.  Moving along here.  Now, getting back to Will Smith Eliza.  Well, Will fired Liza from the movie Gemini Man, which I did like, by the way.  Here's the story.  As it goes, with making a movie like Gemini Man, Will needed a younger version of himself, and Will Smith decided to choose Liza Kashi as the CGI stand-in for the young Will Smith.  Huh.  I don't see a comparison, but let's continue.  Well, they agreed with Liza Kashi on this because the resemblance they both claimed to have shared was uncanny.  Uh, okay.  Liza Kashi, however, kept making mistakes throughout the shoot of their first scene when she dressed up as a green CGI stand-in looking more like a cross between a frog and Hulk.  But it wasn't that.  It was how she took the dialogues as a direct hit on herself and started fighting back.  Other times, Liza Kashi also kept getting confused and forgetting that she wasn't shooting one of her YouTube videos.  Hint, she kept looking towards the camera.  Then it was how Liza Kashi kept making funny sounds and Will Smith having to continue asking her not to do so.  Then during the shooting of a fight scene, Liza kept getting scared and... And then she later sends a stand-in for herself, who in turn gets equally scared just like her.  So that is the reason why Liza was fired.  However, Will Smith remained cool with Liza afterwards because he knew that Liza had a significant influence online and didn't want to complicate things, especially if she gets bitter and start bad talking about him and Will and, you know, castmates and things of that nature.  Now I can understand a few skits together, but then it was more and more.  Okay, I've heard of love sparking in strange places.  I mean, Brad and Angelina love sparked while doing a movie, Mr.  and Mrs.  Smith, Denzel Washington and his wife, Tom Hanks and his, and so on and so forth.  All of these couples were in a current relationship before their existing relationships and marriages.  Now, I'm not saying that this is going to happen with these two, but these two are getting very close.  Will Smith has had her in... a lot of TikTok videos, and on his YouTube videos, Instagram, and he's following her on social media and commented and liked often.  Now, I know friendship sparks in strange places regardless of gender.  I understand that.  I'm not that biased in sex.  I said that.  It's funny.  I'm not biased at all.  And that she does look kind of like a younger mixed version of Jada Pinkett Smith and his ex-wife, Cherise Apino.  you know but he smells an awful lot around her and the way he looks at her and he posts about her and like her posts all the time just saying Oh, and conveniently, if her relationship with David was genuine, I don't know.  But anyway, They're breaking up around.  the time she started hanging around with Will Smith is eyebrow raising, you know, but I'm just speculating here.  I'm not pointing any fingers.  I think the girl is very talented and a very beautiful girl.  I love her channel, but just wanted to put that in there.  I mean, he's invited her on his boat to surf.  Not sure why.  Probably to get her in a wetsuit or whatever.  I don't know.  Now, usually I ignore this kind of crap because I really don't care.  But I come to know this one person missing and who hasn't been among this sudden, great, hilarious, and, oh, they're just two peas in a pot friendship.  Jada Pickensmith.  And that really set off a lot of bells in my head as a wife, as a woman, as everything.  You know, have you all seen all three of them together?  Another suspect moment is Jada Pickensmith.  upset because she's not following Liza on her Instagram.  Jada, let me just repeat what I just said.  Jada is not following Liza on her social media and isn't liking any of her posts as well.  As far as I know, I ain't go through all of them.  I mean, heck no.  Then it was Jada who posted back in July 2019.  This is around the time where Liza and Will was heavily involved.  She posted in 2019 of her contemplating on changing her hair color.  Well, wear a wig anyway.  She decided against that, of course, but many of you should know of the signs of an unhappy wife is trying to be the girl he likes.  Sounds familiar.  Now, I don't know what's going on with Will and Jada, but I got a feeling that we're going to see a lot of crap coming out this year as we already thus far.  Will need for something different, it seems.  He's starting to show that a lot.  He masks it with comedy.  But we know better.  He seems lonely.  He seems bored.  He seems like he's looking for something.  Maybe that's what he sees in Liza.  She makes him laugh and live and forget and challenges him, among many other things.  You can get lost in work and marriage and life and forget to have fun and smile and just feel something, a spark that you probably lost years ago.  I am so there right now.  This shall continue.
