            "text": "What's up everybody?  It's your girl.  back for another video.  So I hope you all are doing well.  I have a few minutes.  I thought I would go ahead and film a video.  I am waiting on one of those curbside pickup orders and they said it's going to be a few minutes because they're busy right now.  And I have to do this because of the coronavirus being so dangerous.  Apparently it's too dangerous to be in the store picking up your orders.  You have to wait in your car.  But yet all around the country right now, thousands and thousands of liberals are celebrating Joe Biden's victory for the 2020 election, um, standing shoulder to shoulder with no masks in the streets by the thousands, you know, and that's perfectly okay.  I guess the coronavirus just went right out the window.  It doesn't exist anymore.  Um, but anywho, um, Crazy, crazy stuff going on right now.  And folks, let me just say something.  Don't lose all hope yet because Joe Biden is actually not the president-elect just yet.  The media doesn't call the election.  They don't decide who won the election.  That's not how our voting process works.  is in this country?  um you know this happened one other time when i was a kid.  i remember the media calling the election for al gore.  they said that he won.  people were celebrating.  um george bush took him to the supreme court.  it ruled in his favor and bush went on to to serve two terms.  now This is actually happening all over again.  There is a lot of evidence of fraud in this election.  I predicted this.  I said that, you know, the Democrats were going to use this pandemic to, you know, to commit fraud with these mail-in ballots.  That's what I thought was going to happen.  And that's exactly what is going on.  And there's other things going on.  Apparently, a lot of dead people were voting.  A lot of illegal immigrants were voting.  Apparently, the Republican poll watchers who are paid to watch the Democrats count the votes were not allowed to watch.  They were kicked out of the rooms.  They were threatened.  The media, the bought and paid for liberal left media is not covering any of this.  They're saying that Joe Biden won.  Fair and square, there is no evidence of any voter fraud in our elections, even though they were the ones saying Russia collusion for the past four years.  They were the ones spewing hatred and dividing the country for the last four years.  But yet now it's time for healing and coming together.  But absolutely crazy.  But this is going to end up going to the Supreme Court just like it did in 2000.  And so we'll see what happens.  But I feel, in my opinion, that voter fraud was committed with these mail-in ballots.  You know, the Democratic Party always has an agenda with things.  And they kept pushing that coronavirus, that hysteria.  And once I heard them mention mail-in ballots... I knew months and months ago, that's their angle.  They knew they couldn't win the right way, the legal way with Trump.  He had too many, he had too much support.  I mean, go look at his rallies.  Go look at the size of these rallies that he was holding.  And keep in mind, even with the COVID restrictions, he still had so much support.  You can visually see it.  You know, just like when Obama won in 2008, I didn't vote for Obama.  You know, my husband and I didn't agree with his policies, but he won fair and square.  You saw the support.  Joe Biden couldn't even gather a thousand people at a rally.  He spent the last year hiding in his basement.  And I mean, even his YouTube channel has hardly any subscribers.  And you want me to believe that this is the most historic election and he had more votes than any other president, including Obama?  Yeah, right.  This is a joke.  And folks, Fox News is sold out.  They sold out a long time ago.  When the guy that owned Fox News died and his wife took over, that's when they sold out.  She was going to parties with the Clintons and Democrats.  She wanted to be accepted by them and hang out with Hillary Clinton.  They sold out, you know, when, when the husband died.  So, um, that is no surprise to me.  I don't know why so many people are surprised by that, but they were the ones that called the election for Biden first.  They've been bought and paid for too.  All our media are sellouts at this point.  Um, and They are silencing conservative voices on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.  They have what's called fact checkers now.  They go around and fact check and they're fact checking your opinion on YouTube.  Can you believe that?  YouTube was founded on regular people having an opinion in their homes.  You know, not mainstream media, corporate media, not Hollywood celebrities, regular people like me and you.  You know, now YouTube has turned into TheyTube.  And they're just going to go under.  But they're doing this all across these big liberal platforms.  And a lot of people say, well, how come conservatives don't open up a platform?  Well, they try.  And the liberal media, the corporate media, calls those platforms racist and sexist.  So a lot of people are afraid to use them because of that reason.  But it's crazy what's going on.  This country is heading into... socialism and communism.  And it's just really scary.  You know, Joe Biden is not the president-elect, and now apparently he's holding meetings that are completely staged because this guy is so senile.  You can tell that he's been coached on what to say, and he knows what the questions are ahead of time.  And all these journalists, there is no real journalist anymore.  They're all sold out as well.  And, you know, he's holding these meetings in the office for the president-elect, which has never existed before.  You know, these liberal Democrats, these far progressives, they just make things up in their benefit.  And whenever they can't win the right way, they change the rules in their favor.  But this election, these votes, you know, they need to be contested.  That's what the president is doing.  He has the right to do that.  That is what Bush did.  That is what other presidents did.  And the mainstream media for the past four years has been talking about Russia collusion, making up these false claims without any evidence.  But now apparently Russia There's no evidence of voter fraud and you must accept it.  And we're not going to talk about that because there is no evidence.  Really, really sad.  You know, and a lot of people think that.  You know, some of these people on CNN or MSNBC can be trusted, you know, because they're a woman or because they are black Americans.  Folks, let me tell you something.  Don't think just because someone is the same gender or race as you that they can be trusted.  That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  These people get paid very well to sell us out.  They are paid Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to sit up there and spew hatred, divide us and lie.  And they get to live in their private gated communities.  Their children go to the best schools.  They have the best armed security while they're paid to divide us, take our rights away, disarm us.  You know, it's all part of a bigger plan.  Just like George Carlin once said, it's a big club and you ain't in it.  Very, very true.  don't lose all hope yet.  you know a lot of people like to come on my channel and you know they think they know me.  they'll post comments like you didn't vote for trump because you know he was an independent or this or that.  you voted because you're a republican and that's the way you vote.  no i'm not a republican.  um i never voted for any republicans in the presidential elections before.  um I voted for Trump because he's not a career politician.  He was just a regular American.  Yes, he's a billionaire, but he was the closest thing to a regular American.  And he did more in his four years that he promised than any other president.  I don't go by what the mainstream media lies about.  I go by my own research and by what he actually did.  And, you know, President Trump... um is not a career politician.  all my life all we got was the same thing over and over when i was a kid.  you know george bush senior.  um after he ran then came clinton.  bill clinton gets two terms and his vp al gore runs against bush senior's son you know and Al Gore, the media calls it for him in his favor, but Bush takes him to the Supreme Court.  It rules in his favor, and he goes on to run for two terms.  You know, then Obama comes in, and he gets two terms.  And then his VP, Joe Biden, is running against Trump in this election.  But before that happens, I skipped over Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton ran against Donald Trump, and she was Bill Clinton's wife.  You see what I'm saying?  We get the same shit over and over.  It's the same bought and paid for career politicians over and over.  And it's the same old crap.  And they do nothing.  They promise all this stuff.  They do nothing but take more and more of our rights away.  President Trump was not part of the establishment.  He was just a regular American.  And that was the first time that ever happened in my life.  And, you know, I'm just tired of the same old career politicians over and over.  And also when I was a kid, you know.  The sexual allegations, every time there's a Republican Supreme Court male justice, there's always sexual allegations brought forward at the last minute.  When I was a kid, I remember the Anita Hill scandal.  Anita Hill came out with sexual allegations against Thomas at his hearing when he was about to be appointed for the Supreme Court by George Bush  Sr.,  you know, and, or George Bush.  I don't remember if it was the son of the dad.  But anywho, you know, you know who was the head of those allegations, the head of that witch hunt?  I mean, none other than Joe Biden himself.  he couldn't stand clarence and i believe it's because he didn't want to see another strong black american who was off the democratic plantation get up there as a supreme court justice.  and that's exactly what clarence said at that hearing.  he said and i'm paraphrasing i may not say it exact but he said this is nothing more than a high-tech lynching for blacks who dare speak for themselves, something like that.  He said it much better than I just did.  This man is very articulate, educated, and he left the Democratic plantation a long time ago.  And Any black American who chooses to do so and speak for themselves against the Democratic Party is labeled that way.  And they're labeled an Uncle Tom.  They call Justice Clarence CNN.  Black CNN reporters call him Uncle Clarence.  Very, very sad.  That man worked very, very hard.  to get where he was.  But Anita Hill came out with those sexual allegations and Joe Biden was at the head of that witch hunt.  And you can go look up the videos, but I remember it being on TV when I was a kid.  Same thing happened with Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford.  Same exact game, same exact shit over and over again.  And I and other people are tired of it.  You know, it's not about Republican or Democrat.  You know, it's about the establishment and voting against the establishment.  But they're taking our rights away.  And, you know, Fox News sold out.  And people like me, our voices are disappearing because we're being shadow banned, shadow boxed.  And now they have fact checkers going around checking our opinions.  You're not allowed to have a different opinion from the left.  And now... AOC and other far-left progressive senator females are saying that all Trump supporters and anyone that voted for Trump should be put on a special list so they can be essentially blackballed, so they can be fired from their jobs and denied jobs in the future.  Folks, this is real.  This is really happening.  And you should be scared to death, you know, because even if your views align with the left and you think this crap is OK.  If you go along with this, it won't be long until they're coming after you for something.  You know, that's the way it always goes down.  So I'm going to let y'all go for now because this video is getting too long and I need to find out what the hell's going on with my order.  I will post another video very soon.  Y'all take care of yourselves and I'll see y'all later.  Bye. ",
