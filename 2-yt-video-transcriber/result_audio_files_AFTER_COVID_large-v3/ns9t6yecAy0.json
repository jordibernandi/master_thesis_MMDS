Apple looking to India now to manufacture $40 billion worth of iPhones in the next five years.  But is this too little too late?  What kind of progress is this?  Joining us with why the world should have depended less on China In the first place, the Heritage Foundation's Dean Chang.  So thanks for coming on today.  We appreciate it.  What do you think of this move by Apple? ",

But the reality is that our economies are too intertwined to really do a hard decoupling, meaning that all American companies or many American companies will simply up and leave.

Apple's a big player in China.  220 billion in merchandise produced in that country.  185 billion exported.  4.8 million Chinese people employed by Apple.  And then let's go on to one more here.  This is the Indian government that's going to get a nice chunk of this, maybe a quarter or a fifth of the pie.  Apple is actually looking at India as a base to manufacture and export, essentially diversifying its production out of China.  We expect mobile phone exports out of India to cross $100 billion by 2025 or earlier.  So India planning to take about half the business away from China.  My question to you is, how will China retaliate for this?  Because you know they're going to think of a way to get even. ",

I think recently there's been some fist bites, literally, along the Sino-Indian border between border guards.

Here, this is from Indiana Senator Mike Braun on Tuesday.  China doesn't play fair.  The failure to operate on the level regarding COVID-19 has caused untold global devastation.  China must be held accountable.  And if they do not cooperate, they should face the serious consequences.  Could China do something to Apple, like box them out of their market?  Could they say, okay, you want to play this way?  We're not going to let you sell iPhones in China.  That would be devastating for Apple. ",

The Chinese have been pretty clear in the past that there are limits on their foreign market share, foreign access and, of course, the intellectual property theft and diversion.  So if Apple thinks it will just be able to coast along because the Chinese are going to develop competition also for iPhones through state champions. ",
