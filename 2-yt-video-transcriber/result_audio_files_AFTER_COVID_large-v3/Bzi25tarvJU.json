Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence was born on April 16, 1965 in London, England, believe it or not.  His mother was named Clora, who worked several jobs, and his father was named John Lawrence, who was in the military.  He was named after Martin Luther King and JFK.  His family moved to Germany when he was seven and later to Landover, Maryland in Washington, D.C.  area.  At the age of eight years old, his parents divorced and he saw his father less and less, despite later of him becoming a police officer, his father.  While growing up, Martin, he excelled at boxing while attending Eleanor Roosevelt High School and Friendly High School.  And later, while still boxing, he moved to Apple Grove and became a Mid-Atlantic Golden Gloves boxer contender, yes.  He started doing stand-up shows in Washington,  D.C.,  and then odd jobs here and there.  You know, he had to make money.  He was then scouted out by Rich Schneider, who saw and suggested for Lawrence to go to New York.  And there he began to do the improv.  You all remember that?  That got him noticed and he later appeared on Star Search and that got him hooked up with Columbia Pictures Television and he landed a role in What's Happening Now.  And later in his breakout role, Do the Right Thing, and after that he took off and he appeared in House Party sequels, which are hilarious, still watch them.  And many more.  after that, moving along here, Mark was on fire from having his own show to appear alongside other legend comedians and dropping hit movies that always turned into sequels and broke box office records.  This success carried on for many years until 2011, after his last Big Mama's House sequel.  After that, his career went on hiatus, and he had more misses than his.  So when it came for him to do another sequel to Bad Boys, he needed that success.  He needed that to be a hit, and it was.  So on and so forth.  with his many endeavors, he won many awards and things of that nature.  Meanwhile, let's get personal and skits.  now I talked about this in some videos I did about Tisha Campbell and Dwayne Martin and I will leave the link below anyway.  In the video, I discussed the dark side of Martin Lawrence and his marriage.  But before I go deep into that, let's talk about his many relationships.  Like, for example, he was once engaged to Lark Voorhees.  You all remember her, the pretty black girl from the TV series Saved by the Bell?  Well, I hope you all are ready for this.  It has been leaked, and I'm going to read verbatim.  It has been said that Martin Lawrence beat her up.  or at least completely messed up her life through some kind of abuse, be it mental or physical.  He begins by stating that Lark was always kind of weird and detached during the filming aside from the later days where she became sloppy.  thirds due to her faith as Jehovah Witness.  She later claimed that this was false, but here's the thing.  She wasn't the only woman who accused Lawrence of being violent because upon him marrying Miss Virginia Patricia Southall in 1995, she wrote in her book titled Second Chances about their marriage.  We were both very young, volatile with one another.  We just could not figure out how to make it work.  Oh yes, she also admitted in her book that Martin cheated constantly and whenever he gets high and drunk, he turns into a demon.  I'm paraphrasing, but that's pretty much what she said.  They had a daughter together in 1996.  Word was that was the only reason he married her, which doesn't come as a surprise when they divorced a year later in 1997.  In 1997, Martin then started dating Shemeika Gibbs.  Word on the street they were messing around when he was married to Miss Virginia.  Anyway, he had two girls by Gibbs, one in 2000 and the one in 2002.  They later finally married in 2010, and it was high class and star-filled.  I mean, he was on fire at this point.  You would think that after dating someone off and on for so many years and having two kids by them, this would have been it.  Perfect.  No, he divorced her in 2012, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for joint legal and physical custody of the children.  Now, here's the tea.  Martin doesn't like a woman who doesn't have a drive to contribute to the income in some format, because he was raised by a single mother.  He hates a woman who wants to sit on their ass and have kids and flaunt clothes, you know, that he buys.  He wants, you know, a Jada Pinkett Smith, a Beyonce, a Grabio Union, heck, Tisha Campbell at some point, and so on.  Not only that, he was also dealing with some dark crap.  Okay, I'm sure some of you may have heard this rumor during the filming and release of the movie Thin Line Between Love and Hate, whereas Lawrence... in July of 1995, lashed out in a violent rage and was then hospitalized.  Yes, something was wrong with him.  It was told that he was seen talking to himself.  Yes, Martin was dealing with some serious demons.  They wanted him bad.  But he was fighting them, well, at first.  Because later in May of 1996, he was arrested again after he was caught carrying a pistol in the middle of an intersection on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles, screaming, they're trying to kill me.  and he was once again hospitalized with his public relations.  you know pr agents citing exhaustion and dehydration as the reasons for this episode hence the diagnosis of what they give meaning when they're either killed off or cloned or you know brainwashed.  also when martin started looking dramatically different.  yeah you remember that then the following year in january of 1997 t.c campbell dropped that bomb of sexual harassment.  And later in March, Martin was arrested again for punching a man in Hollywood nightclub.  And then in August of 1999, and this takes the cake and give and prove Hollywood selling soul techniques.  You see, Martin has slipped into a three day coma after collapsing from heat exhaustion while jogging in a hundred degree weather.  Okay.  Yeah.  head in preparation for the big mama's house while wearing heavy clothing and a plastic suit.  He later recovered in the hospital after nearly dying due to a body temperature of 107 degrees after elevating his breathing with the assistance of a ventilator.  Then, as you all noticed, Martin came out looking dramatically different.  The old Martin was officially gone.  He's still funny, but we all know he's not the same.  Just like Chris Tucker when he took that trip to Africa or wherever the hell he went.  Something changed in them.  Martin's career hasn't been the same, just saying, and neither has he.  Well, that's it.  Let me know your thoughts below.  On that note, don't forget to subscribe, share, and like.  Hit that bell so you get notifications when I do post more videos.  Love you all.  Bye.
