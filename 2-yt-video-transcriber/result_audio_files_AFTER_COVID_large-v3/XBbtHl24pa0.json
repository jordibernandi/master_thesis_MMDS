            "text": "What was the aim of these articles?  Why would you take up all of this space in such a fine newspaper and give the minister headlines?  I didn't rape anybody, rob anybody, shoot anybody.  I didn't accidentally fall off a bridge or jump off a skyscraper and begin to fly.  But I received headlines, front page, treatment.  What was your motive?  Why are you worried about what I own?  Since no one has charged me with being a thief, why are you worried about what I own?  I know, I know what you're saying.  You said he's taking money from the poor.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I don't take as much money from the poor as the Tribune.  And I'm a lot more faithful to the truth.  Let's be honest.  What are the odds that those of you who buy the lottery will win?  Come on, come on, let's deal with a little truth.  Let's see who's taking money from the poor.  Every one of you who buys a lottery ticket, the odds are staggering that you will never, ever, ever hit the lotto.  And you know this.  But you continue to play because your hopes are maybe, maybe, just maybe.  and somebody is gambling that you are going to continue to hope and play that lotto and poor people are depriving their children of necessary food and clothing because they have a hunch that their number is going to come up right this time.  And then should one or two or three of you hit the lotto, Look at the way it's arranged.  You get it over a 20-year period.  You can't even pass it on to your heirs, to your children.  Think about this.  And they are wagering that the quick money will so alter your lifestyle that you won't be able to handle it and most won't.  So before 20 years passes, maybe within five to seven years, the lotto person that hit is dead and you gamble knowing that they would never see 20 years.  Who's taking from the poor?  Who's robbing the poor to enrich themselves?  How was America built?  Was it built on the backs of the rich or was it built on the backs of the poor?  How is every nation in the world built?  It's built on the backs of the poor, but the poor support Farrakhan, not because I'm a thief and a robber.  The poor support me because they know that I'm just about the only one standing up.  And if I live in Mr.  Muhammad's fine home, it's not mine.  The next leader of the Nation of Islam will live there.  Why do you begrudge me that when I lay down at night in a comfortable bed?  There's nothing wrong with that.  If I drive a nice car, wear nice clothes, nothing wrong with that.  If I were poor, ragged, hungry, naked and out of doors, you'd have something to say about that, wouldn't you?  You'd say, well, what kind of man of God is this?  Hadn't God heard his prayer lately?  I've got a God that hears my prayers and I have never prayed for money.  I have never prayed to live in a nice home.  I have never prayed for things.  I've always prayed to God to increase me in knowledge and wisdom and understanding and power to help my people out of the condition that the bloodsuckers of the poor have put my people in.  What is the motive?  The motive is hatred.  And at the root of the hatred is envy.  For 10 years now, 11 now, you have lambasted me, maligned me, ridiculed, mocked, and slandered me in hopes that my own people would turn aside from me and that perhaps one from among my people or a group from among my people would assassinate me.
