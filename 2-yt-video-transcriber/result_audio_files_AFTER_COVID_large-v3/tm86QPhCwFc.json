They say, Mohamed Nour, who shot dead an unarmed white woman in her PJs, he must have accidentally committed that horrific crime.  The officer that was pinning down George Floyd, who was a violent thug, who just committed a violent offense.  That police officer, while he was pinning him down to restrain him, he must have done it on purpose, even though he was being filmed.  Now, I'm not saying it's right.  Neither are right.  It is wrong and he should be punished.  But these people... They think on one hand, a blatant crime that's obviously perpetrated on purpose, or at least much more likely to be a purposeful act.  They think then, on the other hand, when it happens the other way around, that we've got to excuse it.  It must have been an accident.  Anyway, that's the end of my trip to the protest.  I finally arrived and it was well worth it.  We got to talk to a few people on the way.  Now I'm coming in to the actual event.

Everybody's here protesting for an African American man, somebody that was a career criminal, but there's an Australian woman that had no criminal history, shot dead in Minnesota, and no one came out like this.  Why do we think that happened?  I might give you a hint.  She was white, he was black.  Do you think that says anything?  Yeah, I know this woman.  So you know the woman.  Why do you think no one came out to protest for her?  She never got a big rally for her.  Why do you think that is? ",

They were in support of the cop, Mohammed Nour, who killed her, the murderer.  Just to put that into perspective, think about if today a group of white supremacists started marching in support of George Floyd's killer.  Imagine the outrage, and rightfully so.
