            "text": "These people are attacking my channel.  man coming at me from all angles Neighbors out cleaning up the road.  Alright guys.  controversial video came out a couple days ago.  talked about the NFAC The leader the people.  so we're gonna clarify some stuff about that, but we're gonna talk about real quick The people coming over.  These people attacking my channel.  Who are these people attacking your channel, Chad?  Vikings, man.  Bunch of Vikings.  Pillaging and raiding my channel, guys.  Viking preparedness.  Pastor Joe Fox, PJF.  Cool channel.  If you guys haven't seen it, go check it out.  He posts a lot more on Patreon.  Used to be on YouTube until YouTube messed with him just a little bit too much.  He said, that's it.  I'm out of here.  Going to Patreon.  Rightfully so, too.  We kind of tried to do the same thing here.  I've been slacking on my Patreon.  I've got to up my game.  Joe Fox sent a bunch of people my way.  Guys, we really appreciate it.  Go check out his channel.  To all the Vikings coming over, you guys are welcome here.  We appreciate you having you guys here.  Good group of people, good crowd, good vibe.  I'm going to give you guys a little bit of history.  Viking Preparedness was a video, a channel that I have watched since before I even had a YouTube channel.  uh lots of good concepts.  that sort of drove shelby and i in directions with our homestead.  uh with our community too which is probably the biggest one because when we first moved off grid it was like uh goodbye world right shut the gate See you later.  And I realized the error in my ways by not being a part of community.  So valuable, valuable channel.  Lots of lessons to learn from what I consider a very qualified content creator.  Go check it out.  Viking Preparedness.  Okay, now as far as the video.  controversial video that we posted a couple days ago talking about the NFAC but not not fooking around coalition anymore coalition whatever whatever the name is.  here's the thing guys.  There has been a lot of comments in the comment section.  to clarify some of the comments that I have made based off the assessment I made on the videos that I had seen of, I learned his name too, what is it?  The Official Grandmaster J. Shout out to the Official Grandmaster.  J. Jay came over to the channel, left a bit of a comment.  I actually replied to him multiple times.  I went back and checked and never got a reply back.  I left him my email because he said most everything I said was a lie.  So I sent him my email.  Send me an email.  We'll talk about it, right?  A couple of clarifications that I got from people who are either associated with NFAC or know the official Grand Master Jay himself, clarified some things about him and the way he talks and their objective.  So a couple things that the videos that I have reposted that I had seen did not clarify was the reason the NFAC was marching onto Stone Mountain Confederate Monument.  Apparently the KKK told them not to do it.  Told the group to not come up there.  that they'd kill them, I guess.  I don't know.  This was the report I got.  So, right off the bat, one, we don't give a shit about the KKK, okay?  The NFAC was called out for coming off real racist.  We all know the KKK is racist.  Nobody up here gives a shit about them.  I honestly didn't think they existed anymore, guys, so I think that this is a... A little lost in translation sort of an issue here because we're talking about different cultures.  The South apparently has a presence of KKK in that area.  So one, I respect anyone's right to march, especially armed.  And I respect the fact that the KKK told them not to go and they went.  I like that.  One thing that I saw in the video, in the comments, that I didn't like was the racial divide in the comments section.  I don't like it, right?  The whole idea was to condemn the racistness of Jay's words, okay?  And I'm going to clarify that.  In the videos I posted, Jay was addressing white people.  He did not say white KKK.  He did not say white racist.  It was white people.  Now that is a big issue because there's a big distinction between racist white people, the KKK, and white people in general.  So this is why a lot of my remarks of the racism, it's what it was based off of.  Apparently, when he says white people, he's talking to the KKK.  Now this is definitely an error on his part.  When these cameras roll, they pick up exactly what you say, and that is the message shown to the world.  Now his lack of clarification is what garnered a response from me.  I have no issue with people marching.  I have no issue with black people marching.  I have an issue with the separatist attitude.  And we'll clarify.  Real quick, let me tell you guys.  So I did reach out to him.  I did give him my email in the message.  I pinned his comment.  And then I tried to have a little bit of back and forth with him.  One thing I have seen... Last night, that I have never seen before, is YouTube came in and censored so many comments, so much back and forth, and I'm not sure why.  We don't have filters in our channel, in our comment section, and anything goes.  We've always felt that if you've got something to say, we'll let you say it in the comment section.  So the comment section has always been fair game, free for all.  YouTube not only pulled down the pinned comment, which had a lot of good back and forth, because I'll tell you what, I called him out, he told me I'm a liar, I said, let's talk about it, right?  I think that's all you can hope for.  If I'm misunderstanding something about your group, then set me straight.  I'm assuming, because I did not receive an email and the comment got deleted, I'm assuming he didn't get that message.  So I want everyone to know that, because many people came back and said, yo, where are these comments at?  The comments got deleted by YouTube.  Makes me wonder why, because no video I've ever made has had that much editing from YouTube.  Which brings me to a couple of points.  One, this whole race war mentality, idea, attitude that seems to be kind of creeping up in the media... think is manufactured by media.  what is YouTube media right?  a censorship platform.  now do I think that somebody was sitting there and realizing that two people might have been getting ready to have a conversation?  I don't know conspiracy probably whatever.  That aside, what I do appreciate is this.  Many of the people who are either associated with the NFAC or members of the NFAC came over to the comments and clarified the NFAC does not have a problem with white people in general.  They are about racism.  They're against racism, to clarify.  Now I can respect that, guys, and I would not sit here and continue to call the NFAC a racist group when members are coming over to clarify.  I understand that a leader is the figurehead of that group.  And I understand that sometimes some leaders don't necessarily watch what they say and can maybe misconstrue a message.  So I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because the members that came over that seem genuine are stressing the fact that they are not against white people.  I'll take it because I respect it.  I respect that maybe a leader misspoke, and you want to clarify that position.  I have no intentions of stirring up race relations.  My whole objective in the beginning was to call out what I thought were racist comments, a racist way of addressing people.  And it was a racist way of addressing people.  You address a whole color, a whole race, with your comments, it's racist.  Don't do it.  Don't get on here and say, yo, black people, and then try to say that I'm talking to the NFAC.  If I say, hey, black people, I'm addressing the whole culture.  I'm addressing everyone, right?  And that's not fair.  So we don't do it.  So that's part of, that's the first part of this.  The second part of this is this.  One, whether or not the NFAC was apparently being sarcastic about wanting Texas for an all-black nation, for reparations for the ancestors of slaves.  Some people said that that was tongue-in-cheek.  He didn't really mean that.  Fine.  Didn't mean it.  That's fine.  The idea or the concept of creating a one-color nation or an ethnostate is racist.  If your group partakes in that sort of rhetoric, that makes you a racist group.  If a group came out and said, we want an all-white nation, it's the great state of Idaho.  We want to turn it all white, no blacks allowed.  That is racist.  It's the definition of racism, right?  And racism breeds hate, which makes it hateful.  Can you be a racist and not be hateful?  I don't know.  Let me know in the comments.  Can you be a loving racist person?  I love you.  Let's separate.  Makes you a separatist.  I don't know.  I think we all just tie racism and hate together.  So when I see racist comments like that being made, I feel obligated to call it out.  Now I didn't get clarification on why the three percenters were called out, the white militia, and the boog boys.  A lot of misconception there.  As we saw All of those guys turned out in Coeur d'Alene to protect the rights of the BLM to protest here in our area.  You guys aren't familiar with our area.  We're from North Idaho.  Look up the history.  Deep in racism.  Deep.  But possibly the South, maybe the groups down there are racist groups.  I don't know.  When you call out three percenters, that's all three percenters.  Anyone who claims himself to be a three percenter, militiamen, all of that stuff.  So I think, I think, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt here.  I think that there was a lot of generalization being used in the speech taking place during this protest, during this march.  I think there was a lot of generalization taking place.  I think that is very unwise.  I would suggest to correct it in the future.  Because I think the media is pushing for a race war.  I think the elites want a race war.  Because that stops us from looking up the mountain and realizing where the problem is at on both sides.  History aside... We all have our issues with being told what to do.  We all have our issues with being taxed to death.  We all have our issues with being subjects to the elites in this country.  And that is probably the topic that is going to get this video pulled. ",
