            "text": "So Inuyasha's coming back.  So yesterday a tweet went out saying that there was going to be a Inuyasha sequel series also done by Rumiko Takahashi and it was going to be about Shomaru and Inuyasha's three daughters.  and my initial reaction was like Inuyasha, for all of the things that I think are right that I critique about it, it was a huge part of my teen anime experience.  I literally made friends that I have for life still because of Inuyasha.  It was that impactful to me and to my thing.  You guys know I love Shishomaru.  Shishomaru print.  I love him.  I love him.  I kind of wanted to go through what the premise of the series is going to be and kind of get your thoughts about what we think about yet another sequel series to a beloved product.  The series is called Hanno no Yashahime, Princess Half Demon.  And this is basically the synopsis that I've been seeing floating around.  It's been pretty consistent, so I'm assuming that it's right.  I apologize, by the way, for my one, like, pippy, long, slacking braid that just won't stay down.  So Toya, Setsuna, and Mah... are half demon girls with blood from both yokai and humans.  Toya and Setsuna are twin girls who become separated when caught in a forest fire when they were young.  Toya passes through the tunnel that crosses time and space, traveling from the feudal period to the present era.  Raised by the Higurashi family, she grew up to be a junior high school girl who excels at martial arts.  Meanwhile, her sister Setsuna, who was left in the Warring States period, was raised under Kohaku, who has become head of the Demon Slayers.  Mohora is the daughter of Inuyasha and Kagome.  As a bounty hunter, she has taken on the nickname Monster Slayer Mohora and is devoted to exterminating demons.  I feel like there's a conflict of interest there, but I'm not going to discuss that.  It's been 10 years since they were split up.  The historical tree tunnel that connects time and space has been reopened, and Toya is reunited with Setsuna in the present day era.  However, Setsuna does not remember Toya for some reason.  Together, Setsuna, shout out to Sailor Pluto, Toya and Mohora join to regain their past in Yashihime, Princess Half Demon.  Okay.  So, question.  Alright, so the twins, the twin girls are allegedly Shishabaru's children, right?  Which raises the question, who are the moms?  By process of pure elimination, it's probably Rin and everyone is kind of like freaking out because of that.  And I am also freaking out because of it.  gonna get into that later because i don't want to just like jump into it but it instantly.  what i think is weird is that like okay.  so shishomaru lost two children lost a child uh and then the other child was raised by humans by Kohaku and then Mahora, I'm sorry for pronouncing her name wrong, um, so she is also a demon slayer but it feels, but like from what I'm seeing from the rest of it, it sounds like they have no connection to their actual parents which freaks me out.  I'm like so how did, how, why were these two kids able to get caught out there?  and how are they, Each of the characters has a little image thing.  Again, I'll put it all over here.  And I gotta say, so, Toya, when I first saw her, I deadass thought that she was, um, one of Moroku and Sango's kids.  So, the fact that it's just Shomaru and, like, Shomaru and whatever human he has sex with, kid, probably Rin.  Um, I'm like, first of all, how, how is... Toya even able to go into the well or tunnel to get to the era?  because I thought the whole reason it could happen was because of a specific bond between Inuyasha and Kagome and because Kagome was Kikyo's descendant.  Does Shishomaru have sex with Kikyo?  No, Kikyo's dead.  Kikyo's dead, right?  Yeah, so that couldn't happen.  That's my dream.  The only person I've ever shipped Shishomaru with is actually Kikyo.  So Toya, Higurashi, she has Kagome's last name.  I feel attacked.  A 14-year-old female junior high school student living in the modern era.  10 years ago, she slipped through the tunnel from the feudal era to the modern day.  She was helped by Kagome's brother Sota and raised as a daughter.  So... She's like Kagome's double niece.  Okay.  Excelling at martial arts, she finds herself entangled in fights with delinquents and has had to transfer schools several times.  I love that energy for her, though.  Now she has transferred to St.  Gabriel's, an all-girls school.  In the present, she meets Setsuna and Mohara.  To get back the memories of Setsuna, they must return to the warring states period.  Finds men's clothes is easier to fight in.  There's always one.  Actually, she's the daughter of Shoshomaru who remains in the feudal era.  No mention of the mother who contributed to her conception.  Focus on me, stop focusing on my amazing copies of Proust.  I think my biggest thing right now is like, I'm very confused as to how she's in this time period.  which, you know, we'll figure that out.  I want to know who her mother is.  I don't like how they just say, daughter of Shishobaru.  She has a mom.  Setsuna, love that name.  Love her.  Like, the other girl is cute.  Her clothes are really cool.  Men's clothing.  It's her clothing.  She's wearing them, so it's her clothing.  Setsuna, however, I would die for her.  That's my... She's so cute!  Her little... But she does that as Lexongo.  Like, I would call it Baroku and be like, so... Do you know that this chick look, like?  she looks exactly like Songo but with Shishomaru's like energy.  14 years old, she makes a living slaying demons as part of the demon slayers led by Kohaku.  Why isn't she with her father?  Why is she a half demon demon, why do, Not my business.  When she was four years old, she was separated from her twin sister.  10 years later, along with Mahora, she slips into the present era and is reunited with Toya.  However, she has no memory of her childhood because she was robbed of her reality in dreams.  They return to the funeral era.  She inherited Shishomaru's calm disposition.  Alright, so let's get into the whole like baby mom's Rin thing.  And I'll be perfectly transparent with y'all because I don't like to lie to y'all because I be problematic.  I have read Shishomaru Rin fic.  I wanted to read Smut and the only options you really have for Shishomaru are to either read stuff with him and Inuyasha.  I didn't want to do that, just because I find that... I just find Inuyasha not that interesting, so I didn't want to do that.  Kagome, rebuke it.  For those of you who are new watchers, Kagome is not my girl.  I'm Kikyo Stan.  I don't hate Kagome, I just think that, like, the story did not do her a lot of favors overall.  There were, like, three Sango fics which I read, and I was also into it.  I thought, like, that could have been fire, but mostly it's adult.  written.  is, like, your option.  Also, I hate Kagura.  Kagura's death was, like, when she died in the manga, I don't think I felt... Such joy in my life.  Kagura, never.  Never Kagura.  This is a Kagura hate account.  Problem to me isn't even that Shishomu and Rin would have children and all of that.  What I think is weird is that we're not gonna have any transition between their relationship when we last saw them and this relationship now where they are having twin children that apparently they didn't raise.  The last time we saw Shishomu and Rin, they looked like this.  They were father and daughter dynamic.  She couldn't even come up, she came up to his knee.  The lack of transition from that dynamic to them possibly having been husband, wife, mates, whatever the fuck they wanna call it, is weird to me.  That was never on the table for them.  I mostly read it to show him he was ace anyway.  I don't think he really out here looking for anybody.  But regardless, I think there needs to be a transition and a lot of people have been comparing this to Yusagi Drop and I completely agree.  Yusagi Drop was this anime manga series and the manga had it where like this guy named Daisuke adopted this young girl.  Wait.  Was her name Rin too?  Hold on.  Alright.  Going home to his grandfather's funeral.  30 year old bachelor Daisuke.  Floored to discover the old man had an illegitimate child.  Silent little girl.  Rin.  Fuck.  Woo!  Him and Rin's relationship in Yusagi Drop is that of father and daughter.  They bathe together, they do all these things together, he changes his entire life to make sure she could leave.  He was his wallpaper for a while, that was his cha, right?  And then, all of a sudden, in the time skip, at the ending, she falls in love with him and they get married.  and they do a lot of things where it's like they're technically like before.  you think they're related and then they're not related and a whole bunch of other things.  and it was.  it was really uncomfortable because again even though and even though you do see the time skip part in like I think three volumes which I own unfortunately you never emotionally feel the transition from father daughter to wife and husband.  like it feels like she just wants to take care of him because he old and like there is.  there's no like romantic chemistry between them to build upon in fan fiction for shishomaru and rin.  you spend time in rin's mind having her transition from seeing shishomaru as someone who she's like from daddy to Danny.  And it's not everyone's tea to begin with but I feel like at least in fic you can focus on that problematic aspect of it and like deal with it.  It really bothers me that this braid is like doing what it has to do but this one is just being ignorant.  Stop looking at Proust.  Camera look at me.  So yeah so the main reason why it's like messing with me is because of that and I just think that it just there's something very lazy about it.  because the reason why most people think that it's Rin isn't even because like It's because she's the only woman left.  But let's get to the Inukkag child.  And they're all the same age.  So like, Shomaru and Inuyasha just had kids at the same time?  Were they, like... Okay.  Because Rin is much younger than Kagome.  So like, why would they have children that are the same age?  Is it Sango?  Is it Sango?  Y'all can tell me.  Mohora is a 14-year-old bounty hunter.  Like, she has a sword, which is not the Tensei-ga.  So, uh... Yeah, that's the one that they have.  So she doesn't even have that sword, which is weird.  The thing about her is that her personality is bright and cheerful.  She is the most accustomed to the ways of the world and how to survive compared to Setsuna and Toya.  Actually, she is the daughter of Inuyasha and Kagome, but she's lived alone since she was little.  She hardly knows her parents.  That's where I have to pause, for real, for real.  And I say this, I'm telling you this, my opinion of this, as someone who does not ship, Inuyasha and Kagome, who barely likes those characters, to be honest.  But I have to ask, how does this child not know her parents?  It does not track that Inuyasha and Kagome would have a child and that child would grow up not knowing their parents.  That doesn't make sense to either of their characters.  Inuyasha, who dramatically lost his mother at a young age and lost that influence.  Kagome, who like, well Kagome did dip in her own family, but that's because she was trying to get a band.  Why would their daughter not know who they are.  There has to be some kind of thing where they've all forgotten their memories, because it seems like that's kind of thing, like they don't actually know, actually, they don't actually know who they are, and maybe that's part of the storyline.  Maybe that I'm just missing nugget, got lost in translation.  But if it's just that they didn't raise them on purpose, girl not again.  like.  how many times do we have to have a series where they're bad parents?  why are they?  why are they children getting raised by sota and kohaku and randoms?  i also think what's tripping me up about is that is that all their designs are the same.  to show moose child got the personality and like the face shape is the same.  but where the ears?  where are her ears?  where are the markings?  They don't got no stripes.  They don't got no anything.  And I'm just like... They look like their parents very loosely.  It's weird.  But also, and I will say this too, and this actually sounds very blasphemous to say, when I first saw the poster for it, it was really weird to me that Kagome was not on it.  Because I don't like Kagome, but she's... the lead of Inuyasha.  Like, I know it's called Inuyasha, but, like, Kagome's the reason for this season.  Like, if she didn't drop her ass down that well, like, nothing would have happened.  They would have just been stuck there.  So, she's the main character of the series.  But the fact that it just is, like, Shishomaru's children and Inuyasha's children, I was just like, like, don't get me wrong.  I'm hyped.  I'm watching in the fall.  I'm, like, gonna come in with an open mind, like, as much as I can.  Because I'm grown.  But, it's just funny to me that Shishomaru is so swagged that he got elevated.  His children got elevated to be protagonists.  You know like, cause the thing I loved actually the most about Shishomaru is that he was not the protagonist.  Like he was a supporting character but he was just so boss that everyone just couldn't help but love him.  I also just have a weird thing about these sequel series.  I think that our age group has gotten like so many examples of these sequel series not really hitting it.  I think Trope Talk does an entire video talking about sequels.  I feel like this one is definitely trying to put the main characters from the previous series on the back burner and go full Monty into this new crew, which is fine.  I think that that's totally fine.  We don't need to have Inuyasha and Shishomaru and Kagome out here in these streets with these children.  Although it's weird because that's their parents.  Rubiko Takahashi is an icon.  She's created series that have lasted a test of time.  I think that she's a trendsetter.  She's brilliant.  She doesn't know how to end a series.  And I don't want this series to go on forever.  I'm like, girl, just make three volumes.  Just make it like a very tight one shot.  Like, we'll give you 10.  But like, we do not need to have this go on for like years.  Because I don't think that I could handle that.  Alright, but I'm excited to see what happens.  I'm excited to see what turns up.  Like, they all look cute.  And I like that.  it's a female-led series.  Like, most of the characters in Inuyasha, after a certain point, stop growing.  You know, Kagome stops developing after a while.  She becomes very tedious as a character.  Inuyasha stops developing for a while because he really only had so far to go.  Sango, Moroku, don't even know why Shippo was in the series to be eight.  Like, the only character that, like, and I'm biased because that's my man.  But the only character I feel really benefited, at the end of the story was Shishomaru.  Shishomaru had a very long-standing arc that was very satisfying at the end because, you know, his entire personality changed naturally and it progressed naturally.  So that's why I think, like, he's my boo, but he was the only character that really grew.  And most of the female characters just end up being nonsense.  Like, you know, this is a Kagura hate account.  It is.  I stand by it.  But take it off my 12-year-old bias goggles for a second.  The thing about her that really upsets me more than anything else is that when we first meet Kagura, she's introduced like slaughtering all of Koga's people.  Shout out to them.  But after that moment, that bad bitch moment, she don't ever do anything relevant for the rest of her life except die.  That's more than anything.  what annoyed me about that character, because if she had had bars, if she had really been out here doing something interesting, I'd have been like, yes girl, get it, and get the man too.  But she wasn't like that.  She was just really in the same rut.  And that's how I felt about every character.  I love Kikyo, but they didn't know what to do with her, because honestly, Kikyo or Kagome could have bodied this man, this angsty-ass, toxic male demon, volumes ago.  And I don't want that to happen again.  So I'm excited about this.  Let's see what happens.  Shout out to Rin because she secured the bag.  God no, she's just a child.  Like.  I can't, like.  God no, not my baby.  Why?  Thank you guys so much for watching.  I realize I forgot to say that I'd love to know what you guys all think about this.  Who do you think is Shishomaru's baby mama?  Do you think they introduced a new character?  Do you think that Inuyasha and Kagame are dead and that's why they're not showing up?  Please let me know any speculations or theories that you have about what's going on in the sequel series, and we can have a full discussion down below.  Thanks.  Bye! ",
