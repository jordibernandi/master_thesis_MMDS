But why would China do that?  because china supports the civil war attempt from black lives matter in their militant groups like nfac.  so they're sending parts for them to upgrade their assault weapons to automatic.  i don't know.  is it just a coincidence that they got seized a month before nfac was in louisville?  well after watching my good buddy grandmaster jay again talk about the shooting at the rally in louisville it's all starting to come together.

So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna bang it down.  Do you know what that just did?  That chambered around.  Let me show y'all again.  Okay?  Let me show y'all real quick, okay?

            "text": "i didn't think i'd be giving a firearms training class today but you know i seriously have been starting to think that nfac just can't top the last stupid thing that they did.  but you keep doing it in the video where i talked about grandmaster jay and the sergeant major rank he was wearing on a t-shirt where he threw a fit like a three-year-old who's still on mommy's tit.  I'm starting to question it even more after that video.  One, because he took it off and he hasn't worn it again since I posted that video.  Two, he says that he can provide receipts for everything he's done.  Well, where is it, accountant, if you keep such great paperwork?  And lastly, no real sergeant major is gonna go on the internet, upload a video, and say, the rebel has failed.  I'll be waiting for that receipt, darling.  The only thing you just committed is chambering around.  All right, so let's talk about this for a second because unlike Grandmaster Jay, I do believe in gun safety.  And I think that you should know what's going on with your weapon before you even pick it up.  Okay, so Grandmaster Jay said the gun that went off was a super old shotgun.  What are you doing with granddaddy's shotgun in your militia?  That shit should be hanging on your wall somewhere in a talking point.  Oh yeah, my grandpa had that gun back in fucking 1890.  But either way, let's talk about it.  Yeah, if you've got a super old shotgun, really any gun that is super old, not maintained, not cleaned, none of it.  Yeah, it's volatile.  If you drop that shit, it may go off.  But part of gun safety is one, knowing if you have a volatile gun, not bringing it around people, leaving that shit on the wall to look at and not fuck with.  If you are gonna bring it out, put the fucking thing on a sling so that if it is 115 degrees out and you haven't drank any water the whole day and you haven't worked out in 17 years, if you pass out, it's not gonna go slamming on the fucking ground.  And lastly, if you think you're about to pass out, take the fucking shells out.  Who would have fucking thought?  Man, I'm about to pass out, but Grandmaster J said I gotta keep this shit loaded at all times, so if I just hit the fucking, if I just hit the floor, just watch your head, all right?  Watch it.  You shouldn't even have shells in it in the first place.  You know how long it takes to load a shotgun?  Like, let's say it wasn't a peaceful protest and you needed to have a loaded shotgun.  Do you know how long it takes?  And no, this isn't your granddaddy's shotgun.  Y'all ready?  That was probably not even a second.  And I've talked about this before, but this pertains to this too.  You're letting anyone join the NFAC as long as they show up in their black long underwear and they have a gun.  So guess what?  A lot of those people who you just let join that day in Louisville probably had their granddaddy's shotgun that hasn't been shot since he went bird hunting back in 1984.  And they're sitting there waving it around, have shells in it, and sitting out there in the hot, might pass out, boom, there goes three of your guys.  Amen. ",
