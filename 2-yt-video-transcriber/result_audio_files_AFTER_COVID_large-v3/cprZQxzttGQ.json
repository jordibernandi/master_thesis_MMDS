            "text": "So many more people would go on to be arrested for associating with Trump's campaign and have Trump distance himself from them.  People like George Papadopoulos, who went to Moscow for dirt on Clinton, would be called a low-level volunteer and liar for his efforts.  Then we all just, We always moved on to the next thing, as if the first thing wasn't totally messed up.  The next thing being Sean Spicer, who resigned as White House Press Secretary, not because he tweeted out his Twitter password twice, but because he disagreed with the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci, a longtime supporter of Democrats who turned to the Trump administration, presumably because he believes in nothing.  Of course, Scaramucci would go on to have the shortest career as communications director ever after getting fired 10 days later for randomly calling a New Yorker a reporter and ranting profanely about other people in Trump's White House.  It was during this that the president tweeted out the words, no White House chaos, further supporting the theory that this was all part of some Wayward magic.  Anywho, Spicer would go on to be totally humiliated in multiple interviews before deciding to go on Dancing with the Stars, losing, and therefore prompting Trump to actually delete previous tweets supporting him on Dancing with the Stars.  I know it's like, It's the least important part of all this.  But I can't stress enough that Trump deleted his support of Spicer, a man who has lied to the public for him after he lost Dancing with the Stars.  Like some kind of disappointed stage parent.  Like he could have followed up with, it was great while it lasted, I'm proud of my Spiceman.  Or my baby.  Spice did a great job on Dancing with the Stars, hashtag spicy meat-a-ball.  or something supportive.  But now we know exactly how willing Trump is to throw people under the bus to save face.  He will fucking disown you if you lose a reality show dancing contest.  No compromise, Spice-o.  Who else?  Remember that Priebus fellow?  The prebe, we exclaimed at the time.  After heading the RNC since 2012, becoming White House Chief of Staff, and being ordered to kill a fly that was bothering the president, he was pushed out of the White House after six months and replaced with John F. Kelly.  Kel Kel!  Trump would later call Priebus to complain about Kel Kel, which I'm sure Priebus was very emotionally receptive to.  This is despite endless tweets by Trump insisting that Kelly was doing a great job, all the way until Kelly left the position in 2018, which, according to the White House press secretary, was because he was ill-equipped to handle the genius that is our president.  So that's, you know, an assessment that people might not agree with.  Seems dubious, is what this guy is thinking.  Then there's Rex Tillerson, of course, the T-Rex, who got fired via tweet by Trump.  Like, that was literally how he learned he was fired.  Oh, and Steve Bannon, the melty racist, who helped Trump on his campaign and shaped his winning message and co-formed his travel ban and was his chief strategist, but also, according to Trump, had nothing to do with him or his presidency and lost his mind as soon as Bannon said unkind words about him after leaving the administration.  Or maybe getting fired, depending on who you ask.  Which was oddly right.  after all those Nazis showed up in Charlottesville and Trump gave the both-sides speech that Bannon apparently advised him on doing.  And then Trump distanced himself from Bannon before Bannon left the White House?  Like Bannon was kind of the white supremacist that helped Trump get where he is?  And then it was dumped the moment people were like, hey now, are you guys some kind of white supremacists?  There's much more, of course, like when Jeff Sessions, a guy who supported Trump since before the primaries, recused himself from the Russia investigation.  So Trump called him weak and later forced him to resign.  and Michael Cohen, currently serving three years, who was once Trump's special counsel and fixer who had an office in Trump Tower, who Trump immediately distanced himself from and called a liar the moment he was caught violating campaign finance laws by paying off a woman that Trump had slept with.  FOR Trump.  And of course it wasn't enough to take Cohen down, because the investigation revealed that Sean Hannity was also using his services as a lawyer, further spraying the sh** on more people who had defended the president.  He's like a terrible roommate that talks big at first, tells you he's your best buddy, and then secretly pisses in your shampoo bottles the moment you complain about his dirty dishes.  Everyone who tries to help him either gets fired for not doing the illegal things he wants, or does the illegal thing he wants and gets pushed away the moment you get caught.  Wow!  What a clip that was from the, uh, the show! ",
