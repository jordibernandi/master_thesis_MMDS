I thought, whoa, this is just so exciting.  And as we lay there, and I had my plans, I wasn't a Christian.  She said something that was like a bucket of ice water that was just tossed on me from the heavens.  She said, God is watching us.  And I said, hey, let's go inside.  And I look back, and that was what was called the fear of God.  She put the fear of God in me because I knew in my heart God sees everything.  He knows everything.  And that fear of God saved me from making a terrible mistake.  I could have got her pregnant, caused an abortion, brought shame to her family, brought shame to my family.

            "text": "Well, the Ten Commandments are called the moral law.  You and I broke the law.  Jesus paid the fine.  It's as simple as that.  That's why he said, it is finished.  In other words, the debt has been paid.  Guys, if you're in court and someone pays you a fine, even though you're guilty, a judge can let you go.  He can say, guys, there's a stack of speeding fines here.  This is deadly serious.  Someone's paid him.  You're free to go.  And he can do that, which is legal, right, and just.  Even though you're guilty, he can let you walk because someone paid the fine.  And even though you and I are guilty of a multitude of sins and we're deserving of hell, God can let us live forever legally because Jesus paid the fine.  That means justice can be done and mercy can be extended.  That's why he said it is finished.  That's why he came.  He said, no man takes my life from me.  I have power to lay it down.  I have power to raise it up.  No doubt you've probably heard the Bible verse, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  And then he rose from the dead and defeated death.  And to get out of the way of that elephant, to find everlasting life, all you have to do is two very simple things.  So simple a child can understand it.  You must repent of sin.  You can't say I'm a Christian, but you fornicate, lie, steal, and blaspheme.  That's playing the hypocrite.  All you do is put your trust in Christ.  At the moment, you two are like a man who's going to jump out of a plane 10,000 feet, and this is his plan.  He's not wearing a parachute, so he's going to flap his arms to try and save himself.  I'd say to that man, don't do that.  Trust the parachute.  So don't trust in your goodness to save you on judgment day, because it's not going to work.  You can't save yourself.  Simply transfer your trust from yourself to the Savior.  The minute you do that, you've got promise of God that he'll grant you everlasting life as a free gift.  And the Bible says God is without sin.  It's impossible for him to lie.  That means he keeps every promise he makes.  And I'm 70 years old.  I'll be lucky to finish this interview.  I could just grope.  But I came into this life with nothing, but I leave with my hand in the hand of Jesus.  And I can't tell you the comfort that that gives me, the joy that it gives me to know that I could be snatched into eternity.  and I've got everlasting life and I've got God's promise on it.  And the miracle of conversion when you become a Christian is that God will prove himself to you by giving you a new heart.  so you love righteousness.  Instead of loving things that are wrong, you'll love that which is right.  And that'll be your own personal miracle.  Does this make sense, what I'm saying? ",
