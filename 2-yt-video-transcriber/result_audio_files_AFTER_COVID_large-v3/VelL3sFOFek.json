Nathan and Quantum Eraser are no exceptions to this rule.  We have a line here of about 500 miles from the coast of North Africa to Sicily.  When Nathan looked at this, he made a big point in showing the elevation.  gain or loss is zero feet.  How could this possibly be if the Earth is truly spherical?  The Earth must be flat because relative to sea level, there's no change in elevation from the coast of North Africa all the way to the coast of Sicily.  Let's have a look at his line.  So we're gonna go right over here to this point of land and we're gonna look out at his line.  Now there's a couple of things that you'll notice about this line.  First of all, it's visible all the way from Sicily back to North Africa.  There it is.  The other thing that's quite apparent about it is it's curved.  That's because the Earth's surface that it is going across is indeed curved, and the line is being drawn relative to sea level.  It's clamped to the ground.  So therefore, since the ground is curved, so too will be the line.  Now, here's how you can know that.  Let's have a look.  So we're gonna go ahead and have a look at this line.  So right there it says it's clamped to the ground.  Now let's go ahead and change that a little bit.  How about if we make an absolute line?

Yet you still insist, for reasons or reasons unknown besides trying to stay with your narrative, that that surface is flat.  You're looking at a sphere.  You're looking at a spherical representation of our planet.  Surely you can see this.  If you can't see it, I'm hoping that the people watching this video can see it. ",

So Google Earth has been a flat Earth map all this time by its own measurements.  And they said, but the line is curved.  Well, they put an arc in it, but they have the same elevation the whole time.  You went along that curve.  graph you know that showed elevation over the course of that line.  it never changed but it looks curvy.  therefore it must be a ball earth.  that that's how bad it is in the chat.

People came into their chat to try and correct them, to tell them that these elevations were above mean sea level.  And Nathan Oakley does nothing but point to that little box, the elevation profile, and say, look, the bottom of it's flat.  I mean... How do you counter this?  How do you counter this sub-elementary school level of comprehension with an argument from logic or facts?  You really can't.  But these are the people that presume to tell us what an independent variable is and how to conduct scientific experiments.  These are the people that call astronomy and seismology pseudoscience.  Nathan Oakley and Quantum Eraser are the people the Flat Earth community look up to for scientific knowledge.  Yet this is their level of comprehension.  It's absolutely unbelievable.  The only thing that I can think of is that this is some sort of a joke on the Flat Earth community that they're just trying to, they got together over lunch one day and said, let's see what kind of nonsense we can put out that they'll eat up.  You know, they're all idiots.  So this is them, Quantum Eraser and Nathan Oakley, telling you that you're an idiot because they expect you to go along with this.  If nothing else, this is a great example of why you need to stay in school and actually pay attention.  All right.  This is why you should go out and seek knowledge rather than seek dogma and listen to people give you narratives.  Well, thank you very much for stopping by.
