            "text": "Joining us now to break down some of the big news of the day, Erin Ryan, host of the Hysteria podcast.  Welcome back to the show.  Thanks so much for having me.  Glad to have you on.  How would you like to start off with the stupidest news of the past week or so?  Almost always, let's do it.  Let's do that, okay.  So Donald Trump is responding now to a photo that went viral of him that does not necessarily portray him in the best light.  You've probably seen this going around, let's put it up there.  You see Donald Trump returns to the White House from Charlotte, North Carolina.  That is a photo of him walking either to or from a helicopter.  And there are obviously a few issues there.  We're gonna have his response in just one second.  But what did you initially think when you saw this sort of new look at the president? ",

            "text": "It's funny because he's obviously somebody who has taken a lot of effort to disguise how he really looks.  And the way that he's done it is really puzzling because it's not a very attractive disguise.  But I'm always shocked a little bit when I see the layers peeled back.  Like, I was really shocked at how pale he is and how much of a contrast the color of makeup that he's using is from his real skin color.  It all just... He's a very weird man.  And it was... Driving home the point that that's a way that a very weird man would choose to present himself to the world. ",

            "text": "Yeah, and look, I'm gonna read his response in just a second.  But I wanna make clear what probably everybody already understands as context for this.  And this is not by any means going to placate everyone.  But Donald Trump is a guy who has turned as much of politics into show business.  as anyone before him.  He chooses people for important positions based exclusively on how they look.  He fires women because they're too short.  He doesn't hire men because they have mustaches.  He talks about central casting.  And of course, there's no one in public life over the past 30 years that has attacked people for their physical appearance, especially and most brutally women than Donald Trump.  And so that doesn't make it right.  Two wrongs don't make it right.  But we live in crazy times and I'm going crazy.  So let's have his response.  He said to this photo, more fake news.  This was photoshopped, obviously.  But the wind was strong and the hair looks good.  Anything to demean.  Let's just be very clear because the term fake news is thrown around a lot these days.  So here's another photo from the same photo shoot.  It's not been photoshopped.  That's just what a person like him looks like.  So what do you think?  I mean, I think you're exactly right. ",

            "text": "I'm a little bit less hesitant to pile on to him because of his looks, because I think turnabout is fair play.  And I think that men like him rarely have people stand up to them and tell them how it feels, show them how it feels to have that sort of judgment passed on them all the time.  So I think as long as Donald Trump has been a person who is completely unapologetic, but referring to women as fat pigs, and as long as he holds them to beauty pageant standards and I don't think it's unfair at all for somebody to point out that he is somebody who is extremely deviant from the norm of what we would consider physically attractive.  And I think the fact that he one thing I think is funny about him is that he thinks that he looks like how, you know, those kind of fandom art paintings of him look.  Like in his mind, he thinks that he looks like that.  And there's something that feels good about having to hold something up and be like, no, this is how you look.  This is reality.  And I don't know if it'll ever get through his head.  But the idea of it one day getting through his head because somebody pointed it out to him feels good.  I don't know if it's great long term, but it feels good in the short term. ",

            "text": "Yeah, and let me just round up the whole his history thing that he is continuing to do this into the present day.  His attacks against Mike Bloomberg are about his height.  His attacks against Adam Schiffer about his pencil neck.  The nervous Nancy thing is like a critique of her physical behavior while she's speaking.  Look, I don't want us all to be dragged down to the mud and stay there forever.  And I assume that pointing out to him that this is the world he is creating, he's probably not going to learn a significant lesson from that.  But this is the reality.  This is our president and how he appears.  And so I think it's acceptable to at least briefly mention that. ",

            "text": "Right, I also think that there are people who are not beyond hope.  People who might fall into the trap of feeling like they are entitled to judge women the way that Donald Trump judges women because he sets a terrible example.  And I would think that maybe us kind of piling on and being like, no, actually, You look like you have some sort of a vitamin deficiency, but you've done it with makeup.  I think that us pointing it out might show people who feel tempted to engage in that behavior in the way that Donald Trump does that they're going to get it back.  So it might be too late for him, but there might be some baby Trump out there who sees this and thinks, you know what?  That's not a really good way to behave unless I want it turned back on me. ",
