I will be back with a normal video this Sunday, but if you want to hear what I've got in store, keep watching.  Mulder and Scully.  Batman and Robin.  Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.  Bill and Ben.  Those two guys who made those adverts about that phone number.  The world is full of mystery-solving crime-fighting duos.  It certainly is, and I wish I was part of a mystery-solving, crime-fighting duo.  I just... I need a moulder to my scully, you know what I mean? ",

I'll use all the experience I've gathered over the last 20 plus years of teaching science.  And I'll see if I can come up with a rational explanation to explain what they've witnessed.

Simply go to Spotify, search for Almost Unbelievable, and we're the only one that comes up.  Now, this show is going to have nothing to do with Flat Earth, and it's not a debate show.  It really is just a short little 20- to 30-minute podcast that you can listen to in your car.  But that doesn't mean that Conspiracy Cats is going anywhere.  I will be back this Sunday with a new video, and I will be here hopefully more regularly than ever, certainly after Christmas anyway.  So check out the link in the description, and if you fancy listening to the podcast, give it a go.  Thank you very much.  And now if you want to know what it sounds like, here's a little taster. ",
