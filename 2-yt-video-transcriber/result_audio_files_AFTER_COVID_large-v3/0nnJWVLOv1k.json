            "text": "Hello there Cinnamon Bun.  So this is just a super quick little announcement, I suppose.  You may have noticed in my last couple of videos, I think, I have mentioned that I'm working on a workshop that I'm going to be running soon.  It's called the Story Toolkit Workshop and it's all about organising your writing.  In the last few years, I suppose, but really having come into its own in the last year, I have been working with a specific organisational system for how I go about my writing.  I definitely haven't always had a system, and so I've done the thing where you have a whole ring binder full of loose sheets of paper and a million post-it notes.  and you have no idea where anything is like disorganised notes on your phone with story ideas that you just never find again and never actually make it into the story because you can't find them again.  I've done that and I'm done with it.  so this story toolkit is the alternative.  it's what I've found that really works for me.  it is a system of four tools including writing bullet journal With some changes from the last few videos that I did a few years ago, um, which showed me doing writing bullet journals.  Was that, was that the end of a sentence?  Did I finish what I was saying there?  Who knows?  Yes.  So it consists of these four tools that keep me on track.  One of which is the writing bullet journal.  Um, and I am running a workshop.  Teaching you guys what they are and how I use them and how you might want to use them.  So that's all I'm here to say is that, um, you can register for that workshop.  Now it's going to be a live workshop hosted on zoom.  So we're all going to be on the meeting together.  Um, and I'll be presenting and, uh, teaching you guys, uh, all the workshop stuff.  And then we're going to have a space for questions and stuff as well.  Um, so there are at the moment, there are three different times that you can choose from.  Um, so if you head over to the registration page, you can pick a time that works for you.  Yeah, that's about it really.  Um, the story toolkit system is really just designed to help you get from the stage of having ideas to the stage of having written those ideas.  As quickly and easy and easily as possible, because if you don't have a system in place that works for you, um, or you're not really sure what you're doing, it's very easy to get stuck at different stages during that process.  There are a few things that I've learned, which have really, really helped me, um, and are really speeding up my writing process.  So.  I think I've rambled enough.  I think I've covered everything.  This workshop is going to be happening.  Uh, I was going to say next month, but it is now July.  So it's this month.  Um, and you can sign up for it now and I hope to see you there.  And I think it's going to be a real good time.  Okay. ",
