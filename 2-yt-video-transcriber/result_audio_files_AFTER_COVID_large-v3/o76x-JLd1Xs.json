            "text": "Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy, but I just want to remind you that America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump Pence administration.  That's a fact.  Look it up.  And that was before Trump could blame the pandemic.  He, in fact, inherited the longest streak of job growth in American history.  But just like everything else he inherited, he screwed it up.  And the economic damage that he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs.  First president since Herbert Hoover, back in the 30s.  That's a long time, people.  That's almost 100 years ago.  He loves to talk about black unemployment.  Look how low black unemployment, well, you know what?  Unemployment was really high when I came in and we brought that unemployment low and it kept on going low.  and he wants to take credit for it, says he's the best president for black folks since Abe Lincoln.  Man, now his advisors are out there saying, including his son-in-law, his son-in-law says, black folks have to want to be successful.  That's the problem.  Who are these folks?  What history books do they read?  Who do they talk to?  Don't read?  Is that what is going on?  Black unemployment hit almost 17% during the Great Recession 10 years ago.  And through a lot of hard work, Joe Biden and I helped get it down.  And it kept on going down.  Not because Trump did anything.  And then this year, because they've screwed up the pandemic response, it soared back up to above 17% here in Florida.  But it doesn't have to be that way, Florida, if you go out and vote.  Si se puede.  Yes, we can.  Listen, the only people truly better off they were four years ago are the billionaires that got trump's tax cuts.  in the meantime he has not been able to manage extending relief to millions of families who can't pay the rent right now can't put food on the table right now got no plan to reopen schools that need reopening or protecting teachers in the process.
