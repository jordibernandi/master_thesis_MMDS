I think we should sympathize up to a degree, but we shouldn't be letting them off the hook.  They are batting 40.  They're not children.  They're not young.  They have entered early middle age.  They are supposed to be mature.  They are overprivileged brats who are begging and pleading for sympathy as if they are disadvantaged.  I mean, they're not disadvantaged and they have kicked sand in everybody's face.  I have to tell you, one of the things that has really upset me about Meghan and Harry's story is also how we, the British people, embrace them.  I mean, two years ago, we were the most popular couple in the country.  Everybody was so enthusiastic about it all.  They have kicked sand in everybody's face.  They have their American PR people briefing against the British people. ",

And she has systematically kicked sand in everybody's face.  I think it's very sad.  because I'm very mindful being Jamaican of the tremendous opportunity she was given and how to people of color all over the world.  And you speak about hundreds of millions, if not billions of people whose hopes were invested in her being a great success.  And look at what she's done with it.  She's taken, she's just thrown it away.  She is really, I have to tell you, she does clearly have problems.  And he does as well, because it's almost a talent. ",

And I think also, though, a part of it is that a lot of, you know, being royal has gone to Meghan's head in a big way.  And she has misread the situation and she's misread the power that she feels she was going to acquire as a royal.  Royals do not acquire power.  They acquire influence while doing public service.  But I think Meghan definitely, I spoke to psychologists about Meghan.  It's all in my book, by the way.  I examine them both very carefully as characters, personalities, how their upbringing impacted upon them.  Both Meghan and Harry were spoilt.  He by his mother, she by her father.  And Meghan definitely displays a lot of characteristics of somebody who is on the narcissistic cusp So she could be an narcissist. ",
