            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal C-Nable here, and you know something I've never really understood?  Why has Gerald Ford been forgotten by history?  You know, he became president after the first and only president's resignation, the resignation of Richard Nixon.  Um, you know, let's face it, Gerald Ford wasn't that memorable.  But still, I think we should discuss his presidency and his legacy for both reasons of interest and for understanding our own country and how it got this way.  Yeah, of course Gerald Ford has been forgotten.  Like, Gerald who?  Banga, saying that kids today are just unaware of who Gerald Ford was is giving them way too much credit.  I guarantee most kids today don't even know who Bill Clinton is.  Bill who?  Banga, you are why this platform is so painful for me.  Just know that, you atrocious... So I guess we'll start off with the good with Gerald Ford.  To start off, he fought communism, which was pretty good.  And he fought it peacefully, unlike a lot of presidents, excuse me, with things like the Vietnam War.  Gerald Ford pursued the destruction of communism through relatively peaceful means.  One example of Gerald Ford's more peaceful means to He.  and then Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev went to Helsinki, Finland, It's the thing that communism gleefully ignores at every opportunity with anti-individualistic leaders like Pol Pot and, to a lesser extent, Mao Zedong.  I'm not saying that Mao Zedong was bad, to a lesser extent.  In fact, he killed more people than Pol Pot.  But Mao Zedong made slightly less of a deal about crushing individuality as Pol Pot did.  Secondly, Gerald Ford ran the WIN program, or Whip Inflation Now program.  in which he actively slowed down the economy in order to prevent inflation.  And for all you brain-dead idiots out there who have not even heard of economics, inflation is the process of prices going up steadily over time.  There, did I add a few brain cells to your brain-dead idiocracy?  Idiocy?  So... Obviously, inflation is a bad thing.  Not only does it make acquiring both wants and needs a lot harder, it has been known to cause rioting and crime spikes throughout economic history.  Next, and this isn't as good as the last two, but Gerald Ford, while he was president, and I presume since then, has been criticized a poor job at regulating and overseeing the CIA, which I can guarantee-.
