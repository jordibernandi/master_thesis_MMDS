            "text": "These happenings, these events, the things that we are seeing in today's world, I know many of you want to distance yourself from this.  What this is really about is understanding.  And people, many people, lack a certain understanding of what's really happening.  When a person lacks understanding of something, they are slow to make connections between variables.  5G, for example.  People are connecting 5G with other phenomena, diseases and such, based on the understanding that radiation affects the body in a number of ways.  And what many folks are doing is they are not plugging in the other variables that contribute to or cause the same type of phenomena.  I want you all to think about this for a moment.  See, the thing is People develop these long-term theories about what is going on and many of these ideas are fantastic.  But they are ideas that are planted.  They are manipulated.  Do you know, I've been doing this since the summer of 2016 and every year, at least twice a year, without fail, people have asked me, what do you think about the end of the world coming on such and such a date?  usually a date that is only months away.  I never usually have a solid answer for that question, so I will just say this if inquiring minds want to know.  The world is not going to end.  Humans will always be here because we were intended to be.  This system that we live in, yeah, that's going to end.  And yeah, unfortunately, not every person is going to make it.  And the truth about what is happening is far stranger than you could have ever imagined.  There is a plethora of theories, guesses, beliefs that are out there, and it seems we have entered a realm of unlimited possibilities.  I mean the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the surrounding planets, the stars, space.  They can be anything you want them to be.  Science, physics, you can throw all that shit out the window.  We're in 2020, baby.  Who needs it?  We're on that.  5G triple W 24-7, son.  That's reality.  And it is.  For many people.  For many people their perception of reality is constructed by what they absorb from the internet these days.  And what they are absorbing is an unfiltered concentration of content that is of both fact and fiction.  Except many people struggle with the difference.  There is a reason.  Why I constantly come back to the topics of ancient history and text and the fallen angels.  And the reason I do this is because in order to understand what is happening today, you must, you must understand what happened in the past.  In the beginning, we have man and we have woman.  Their names are synonymous to what they are.  Now, if we go off the book of Enoch, we have the Satan.  or satans, which is not one being, but a group of five.  Gadriel being one of them, who according to some lore, is the one who seduced Eve.  And I think seduced is the best way to describe it.  And due to the nature of this interaction between woman and serpent, the references to being naked, the enmity put between the woman's offspring and the serpent's offspring, the woman would now have to endure labor pains and cravings for her husband.  Now, what could she have done to deserve that?  Many questions come out of this story, and yes, it does hint at the possibility of the woman and serpent having intercourse, which brings up another possibility that Cain may have been the offspring of the woman and the serpent, and Abel was actually the firstborn son of Adam and Eve.  which would be one of the reasons why Cain murdered him.  Think about this.  Didn't God say that he would create hatred between the offspring of the serpent and the offspring of the woman?  He did say that, right?  He also told the serpent that he would be looked at as the most evil creature in existence.  And Satan, the devil, is looked at as the most evil being to have ever existed.  Now whether Cain is the son of the devil or not, it is at this point.  we have an agenda set forth by Gadriel, Satan, Lucifer, Anki, whatever he's calling himself that day.  Because of this incident between the fallen angels and women, and perhaps Eve and the serpent, we have the beginnings of a bloodline cult.  It is a fellowship of the dragon by many names.  and a lot of it has to do with solar worship.  This cult was in formation for thousands of years and became really established toward the ending dynasties of ancient Egypt, particularly with King Akhenaten, formerly Amenhotep IV.  Let me point out that some believe that Akhenaten and Moses are the same person.  After all, Akhenaten did go against normal Egyptian religious traditions and believed in monotheism.  imagine that an Egyptian Pharaoh that only believed in one God even though this resulted in what is called Antonism.  this was the religion of the state.  and since then there has been this dragon cult the cult of Anton the Illuminati Freemasons, the Brotherhood of the Snake, the Rosicrucians, Knights Templar, the Vatican, Pope, Bishop, Priest, all of that is Egyptian, previously Babylonian.  The bloodlines that these elites or royal families are holding on to is not necessarily the bloodline of Akhenaten, but the bloodline of the original cult members.  There are subdivisions of this cult and they come in the form of organized religious denominations.  The first church was the Solar Church.  Akhenaten and the Dragon Court, as they called it, were believed to be of the bloodlines that came from Atlantis and Lemuria before the deluge.  And some investigators say that they can trace this bloodline back to Cain.  You know, David Icke, who has presented information on royal bloodlines and reptilians.  Where he obtains his information, that I am not sure, but he said something one time that was quite interesting.  He said, and I quote, The Brotherhood name organizations in a way that leads people to believe their aim is the opposite of what they are really there to do.  For instance, if you want to run drugs without being suspected, do it through an anti-drug agency.  If you want to destroy land and kill wildlife, do it through a wildlife protection agency.  If you want to run a satanic ring, do it through the Christian church.  He also said something else that stood out.  He said, the most preferred candidates for programming are fittingly like Kathy O'Brien, blonde-haired and blue-eyed Caucasians who are not physically defective in any way.  The Brotherhood bloodlines are not only those which carry the names of the classic bloodline families.  The Brotherhood also uses breeders, women who give birth to their unofficial children.  They use brooder families where women bear Brotherhood children, or rear children from the time they are babies, who are connected to classic bloodline families, although there appears to be no relationship.  Children are swapped sent to foster parents like Sir Francis Bacon, or mothers suddenly give birth when no one even knew that they were pregnant.  Which, of course, they weren't.  This allows Brotherhood Bloodline members to be placed in the positions of power in politics, banking, business, the media, and the military, without there being an outcry from the public that the same families are in all the positions of control.  The Pope, the Vatican.  This is the dragon court in solar church of today.  With officials who are bloodline descendants of the original church.  If you read the Bible or any other ancient text, the common narrative is that at some point in the pre-Diluvian age, the time of Atlantis and Lemuria, a hybrid was created by humans and extraterrestrial beings.  Whether it be fallen angels, aliens, what have you.  And the belief is that the DNA, that strand, has made its way into the genetics and bloodline of several individuals, if not all individuals.  So people in many European royal families believe in holding on to that alien strain.  This involves keeping close ties with the dark entities that own that strain.  During the 18th dynasty in Egypt, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and brought the monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten to the land.  He did allow people to continue worshipping their many deities but that ended in just a few years of his coming into power.  This is the first time in history where there is an established monotheistic religion.  Worship of any other god was forbidden and outlawed.  They shut down temples.  They vandalized and defaced monuments.  They made sure that it was understood that Aten was the supreme god above all other gods.  Akhenaten constructed a new capital city, Akhenaten, or Amarna.  They had constructed sites at Avaris, Tanis, Heliopolis, and supposedly the god Aten is a peaceful god.  loving and protective and didn't require sacrifices.  i'll say that again the god Aten did not require sacrifices so i don't know why these cults sacrifice anything today.  it's quite the paradox right?  the sun god Aten is the symbol of the sun with loving rays of light.  now the dragon court became pretty powerful but Akhenaten was so involved with his religion He couldn't hold the kingdom together politically or economically and his system failed.  They had to wait until Tutankhamun was eight before they can prop him up as the new pharaoh, move the capital back to Thebes and bring back their polytheistic ancient culture.  Many of you probably already understood that these cults are obligated to tell us what their designs and plans are in one form or another.  And that usually comes in the form of media.  And they are very proficient at how they do that.  They've had a very long time to perfect it.  They own all major industries.  They have people well integrated into society, politicians, government workers, business owners, civil servants, media owners, journalists, judges, policemen.  Now, only the kings know the extent of their true agenda.  The people under them are clueless and their agenda is much smaller.  if something happens to one of them and they get into trouble they can prevent prosecution.  they can have roads and highways built just by saying so.  they can make shifts in positions of governments change laws.  if they want a pandemic they got it.  if they want to protest.  apparently their wish is.
