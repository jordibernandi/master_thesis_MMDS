            "text": "All right guys.  so when was the last time that you legit heard a guy say that he wanted to have a daughter or he couldn't wait to have a daughter?  because it seems like in 2020 and moving forward the future of having a daughter and bringing a daughter into this world is very bleak especially if you're a smart man and you have a good head on your shoulders.  you're not thinking of bringing a daughter into this crazy world and the story we're going to talk about today involves a adult star.  let's just say she's an actress and her name is mia khalifa as you can tell from the title.  however she's performed in a bunch of scenes.  let's just say for adult companies in particularly sites that you go on that you usually use a private browser for and here's a list of some of them just so you have an idea of what kind of actress i'm talking about when i say she's an actress.  So as of yesterday, Mia decides that she no longer wants any of her videos whatsoever on any adult website.  She wants to basically be a reformed sl- and pretend that she never had any videos of her performing sexual activity with many men on camera.  You just saw all the scenes I listed here.  And her excuse is one to laugh at.  And it's really hilarious just listening to her argue back and forth on Twitter the other day with the company she used to work for, Bang... She's so mad at them that they still have her videos up and she feels like she was mistreated.  and according to her She's only made $12,000 while performing all these acts and putting her body all over the internet.  before we get into this article she explains exactly why she got into the industry in the first place because this is gonna be an important point because what we often see is women who do certain things like this that later on want redemption and later on want to have a clean slate get married and get into film or whatever it was actual like legal film not like what we're talking about and they don't want to have that history or that backlog of these types of activities these types of scenes filmed all right.  so let's read the article let's see what she had to say about the company that originally hired her and the lawsuit that she's filing against them and let's see if anything adds up because in my opinion none of this adds up and i think that this company is entitled to taking advantage of her to be honest because she decided she willingly made the contract.  she signed the contract knowing that this was a possibility.  let's check it out.  the title of this article is titled bank issued a cease and desist letter to Mia Khalifa.  That should be good.  This is what she looks like in case any of you guys didn't already know.  I'm sure if you clicked on this video, you know exactly who she is.  Bangalore has issued a cease and desist letter to Mia Khalifa, the company has announced.  Taking it to social media, the site said it had issued a letter to the former adult star after she allegedly made a series of defamatory statements about it.  This is the company that hired her.  In a statement on Twitter, a spokesperson for Bangalore urged the 27-year-old to share a fact checklist of the statements she had made with her fans.  And then this is the tweet, the original tweet that Bang Bros sent out.  Today we sent Mia Khalifa legal C&D demand, which lists some of her defamatory statements, false statements about Bang Bros.  over the years and a list of stating the actual facts.  We encourage her to share the fact check list with her audience.  We doubt she will though.  Hashtag facts beat fiction.  It comes after Khalifa said that the 11 films which she made when she was 21 still play on her mind on a daily basis and that she doesn't want another girl to go through that because no one should.  I was trying to play the victim.  Writing on Twitter, she said she still receives death threats for her old movies.  Do I think she should receive death threats?  Absolutely not.  But do I think that at 21 years old, you're not 14 years old, you're not 13 years old, you have a little bit of a brain.  Maybe she doesn't as much, but you have some sort of discernment, hopefully, where you understand if you get involved in this industry, that your videos are going to be out there forever.  It's on the internet.  Khalifa wrote, my fight isn't with personality.  It's with bingos.  PH is home to some strong, independent, entrepreneurial women who own, produce, and distribute their own content.  Entrepreneurial women, really.  I am not here to get in the way of anyone's bag.  I just want bingos to stop actively putting me in harm's way by promoting my six-year-old videos like they're new, making millions of people think I'm still active.  The death threats are emotionally crippling.  i haven't felt safe even going to the grocery store alone in years.  oh no whose fault is that though she's not taking responsibility.  this is what she posted but she doesn't want to be sexualized.  she no longer wants to be known for her sexual history in her past.  but look at what she decides to post and she doesn't feel comfortable.  going to the grocery store is probably because she posts things like this and she has videos of herself all over the internet.  And the reason why I feel like her videos are popping up more recently probably is because people are at home, bored, and they get on trending fast because it's not like she was a mediocre star.  She was one of the best for a while.  Following her statements with a thread, allegedly documenting her involvement with bank... Khalifa's fans came out in support and started a petition to get justice for Mia, demanding that her films be removed.  The petition reads, That's what happens when you don't read the contract.  Instead, you look to be rebellious.  The infamous hijab video has collected ISIS threats that have targeted Khalifa.  From the video's release in 2014 to today, Mia attends therapy on a consistent basis for trauma, emotional distress, and consequences of bullying.  Maybe he should have thought that through.  Mia and her team have provided countless financial offers to the current owners of her domain name and PH videos.  To no avail.  Big corporations are not giving Mia Khalifa a fair chance to demand her content in court due to financial advantage.  we are demanding her domain names be returned, her videos be removed, and fairly discussed in court without putting Mia Khalifa into deep financial ruin.  Mia has stated her regret for her decisions in the pH industry multiple times.  Please consider signing this petition to support Mia's future endeavors and to bring her justice.  Since it has launched, the petition has received more than 1.5 million signatures by simps and manginas.  Yes, I added that.  Khalifa still has yet to respond to the BB's statement.  So unfortunately, the thing about the internet is once you put something out there, it's basically there forever.  And I don't think Mia thought this through when she first decided to rebel and explore her wild side.  So I guess she didn't realize that after you're done making these types of scenes, that you can't get rid of these videos.  They're on the internet forever.  And even if they remove them, like her domains remove them, such as PH and BB, They're always going to be on the internet because people can download them.  So people will resurface them.  They're always going to be on pH for sure.  And at least somewhere on the internet.  That's the mistake that a lot of these women don't understand when they get into this type of industry.  That's the mistake that we see a lot of women making with OnlyFans accounts.  They think that this is all one day just going to.  vanish and that they can get a corporate job or they can get the job that they've always wanted that they got their degree for.  but it doesn't work like that.  sweetie unfortunately it doesn't work like that so she's learning the hard way.  we're going to see what happens with the situation.  but the fact that she's playing victim really just upsets me.  and the fact that she said ph is a home to strong independent entrepreneurial women who own produce and distribute their own content.  This is what the modern day woman sees as a side hustle or sees as being entrepreneurial.  This is really unfortunate.  We've hit rock bottom as a society.  If this is what a strong, independent, entrepreneurial woman looks like.  So I just wanted to share that article with you guys.  Let me know your thoughts in the comment section below.  do you think that this is fair of the websites to do to her these companies to do to her or do you find sympathy towards someone that's made a decision at 21 to put her videos out there on the internet getting piped out.  do you think that that's the right decision?  let me know your thoughts.  let's talk about it.  drop a like on the video.  share the video.  if you enjoyed have a good one.
