In order to have the account of Jesus leaving behind an empty tomb, you obviously have to have him put into a tomb.  And so you have to have some story that explains how it is.  he got put into a tomb when everybody knows the crucified people normally were not put into a tomb.

What then really happened to the body of Jesus?  We don't really know.  My guess is that like others, the two killed with Jesus that day, for example, and others crucified during the same Passover season, Jesus was thrown into a common tomb where he experienced corruption like everyone else, so that within days he was no longer even recognizable.
