            "text": "Well folks, don't give up.  That's the message of this particular one because it ain't over yet.  So I've got some things to share with you on that, so stick with me and I'll be right back.  Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthification Chronicles and my voice may sound a little groggy because I haven't been up very long.  It takes a while for my voice to warm up, but Anyway, I know that I need to get this out.  I have another video that I recorded on Friday night, but obviously now there's some updates and I need to deal with those.  So I'm going to do this short one and then I'm going to edit the video that I did last night because it's a long one.  So Anyway, don't give up, folks.  Don't give up.  President Trump tweeted out, I won this election by a lot.  And we know that's true.  I don't care how many fact checks they put on it.  It doesn't matter because, you know, somebody said, well, Biden won.  No, Biden claims he won.  And all of this is not settled until we have all the legal aspects covered.  And once those cases are settled, then we can talk about it.  But right now, no way in the world that you can say Biden won.  So I'm just saying that right now, just to let you know.  And I agree with this person right here.  This is pretty much how I had mine, that something like this, or there was another one that had him with 333.  Yeah, right here, 333 is what I had.  But I really think that this is more accurate.  And we are going to see some litigation, a lot of litigation.  They have been filing cases everywhere, and they have a lot of support for them.  So no matter what these people say, it doesn't matter.  That's, you know, it's not true.  So stick with me here.  I've got some things to share with you that I think you need to see.  This is President Trump's Twitter feed right now.  And, you know, this glitch that they're talking about, oh, lots to do with that.  But some of the stuff I really dealt with in the other video And I don't want to do it double here, but this press conference happened at 1130 this morning.  And it really was Rudy Giuliani just saying, here are some instances of, you know, examples, actual evidence of voter fraud.  These people are willing to testify under oath.  that they you know witnessed this being kept from uh observing the ballots being counted which is huge.  i mean really huge.  these people couldn't get very close at all and it's like 20 feet away.  what are you going to see at 20 feet?  how could you spot a bad ballot at 20 feet away?  so yeah um It really is a matter... Oh, that's interesting.  Why is Bill Gates a who to follow?  Yeah, interesting.  Oh, look at this.  Yeah.  And so, of course, they're fact-checking him because they just don't want people to know this.  And so... Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 p.m.  on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor-thin states.  As a separate matter, hundreds of thousands of votes were illegally not allowed to be observed.  And then he probably goes on from there, but, well, let's see what this says.  I mean, look at this.  They're just fact-checking him all.  They're just blocking him out.  oh this would also change the election result in numerous states including pennsylvania which everyone thought was easily won on election night only to see it massively disappear without anyone being allowed to observe for long intervals of time what the happened.  um bad things took place during those hours where illegal transparency was viciously and crudely not allowed.  Tractors blocked doors and windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms.  Bad things happened inside.  Big changes took place.  So I have no doubt that that is true.  I think that's exactly what happened.  So I wanted to just share this with you because this is, you know, this morning that he tweeted these.  And of course, again, they're just censoring him.  And, you know, there is absolutely no reason.  I'm sorry.  There needs to be a law in the books that says that if you block any, you know, observers from like either party, then your votes will not count.  Just not count at all.  I'm sorry, it should not count.  Because if you're not going to let the other side observe, you're doing something wrong.  You're doing something bad.  And I agree with Trump there.  I think he's very frustrated.  I would be if I were him, wouldn't you?  And even if there is a plan here, that they're trying to expose the corruption, I still think it's very frustrating.  It's a frustrating situation to be in.  Anyway, here's the conference.  I'll leave it down below the link so you can watch it if you want to.  But essentially, Rudy Giuliani brought these people up to talk about their experiences.  that they were kept out and how they were treated as poll observers, they weren't allowed in.  And so he talks about the litigation that probably this is going to be something nationwide.  Right now it's individual cases in different states because, of course, that's how the election is run, by the states.  But eventually it probably will have some possible national things because it was so Global in a lot of places.  now this link I have in the other one and I play some of the clips.  I'm not gonna play them in this but I want you to listen to these clips.  So the link will be down below in the description.  Please take it and watch some of them.  But if you're not familiar with what the hammer is, that's what was being used.  That's what we're working against.  and Here's a little bit more about it.  There's several posts three of them that you can listen to there and And then here is one that just is a reminder.  This is actually from 2017.  And yeah, they were using it back on Trump even then.  And it's unfair.  I mean, really.  And this is what needs to be exposed.  So If this is what they're exposing, I hope so.  And this right here, Dave Janda, is here so you can listen to that because it just tells you what's really going on.  And this Lieutenant General here is the one that's been spearheading the information out there about it.  And so I think maybe you'll want to listen to that too.  So, very interesting.  Why weren't they taken down?  Because I think they needed the evidence.  You can't, like a shoplifter, you can't arrest the shoplifter if they're still in the store.  You have to wait until they actually leave the store and the crime has been committed.  That's when you can arrest them.  So I think this is, you know, getting all the evidence.  It's going to be very clear and evident.  But yeah, and I agree with this for we wrestle not against flesh and blood.  but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness in this world.  Just remember that.  Because this is not just a political battle.  This is a spiritual battle we're fighting.  So that's part of it.  Anyway, I'm going to leave the links to all these down below.  And Todd Starnes just reminds us, Fox News Channel does not get to decide who the next president of the United States is.  Please remember, That when any of these come out, any of these news outlets come out and they say that Joe Biden is the winner, that's their opinion, okay?  It's their opinion who has won.  Because you can't tell until this recount happens or the legal cases go through the court and the court rules.  You can't tell.  It's not a done deal.  Don't let them bully you into thinking it is.  So it's not.  Anyway, here's something you can do.  if you can't get out and protest.  And if you can, I highly recommend it.  Remember, we want peaceful protests, no violence.  Be very careful if you're going to carry because we don't want to be accused of doing violent things like the left would do.  OK, so keep it good.  Remember, you're really representing our president when you're out there protesting.  So have behavior that's very respectful of him and that paints him in a very good light that these are the people that are standing up for him.  If you can't and even if you can, this is another thing that you can do.  because this election right here needs to be audited.  It needs 90,000 signatures to go.  There's only 9,000 so far, but if we spread this around, I think this can definitely happen.  And I'm not sure how much good it'll do, but we can at least try this.  We got to try everything that we can.  And then I'm going to leave you with this.  This is a video that was done.  It has clips from several different things.  But this is a really good inspirational video of President Trump speaking at some different places.  And I really think they did a good job with it.  And the main message you have to remember is never, ever give up.  OK, so watch this and remember, this is what our president has taught us over the last four years and he's not going to give up now.  So it ain't over, folks.  Hang in there.  That's what I've got for you on this one.  I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see you all later. ",
