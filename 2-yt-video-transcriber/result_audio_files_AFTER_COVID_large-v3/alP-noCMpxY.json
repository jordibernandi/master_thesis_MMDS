I was trying to get the kid reunited with the mom.  I didn't have a chance.  It needs to go through the process and through the law.  But here's my thing.  Here, you just said that instead of that, it... Your messaging, you were so loved.  They would not do the story.  We put it out.  They would not do the story.  You would not believe it.  They would not do the story because they are not.  They would not do the story because they are against us because they are liberal media.  Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story.  I don't want to go to Fox. ",

You know, it certainly doesn't jive with, you know, the Fox whole idea.  I mean, if I'm talking about a war on Christmas, it's funny that she would be leading that.  But certainly it's one of those traditional roles and.  I don't know. ",

            "text": "It's fascinating to hear her talk like that.  She at one point basically says F Christmas like she's the Grinch.  And then she also complains that some people want her to reunite families.  And she really makes it sound like she really doesn't give all that much of a damn about the families being separated at the border.  That this woman that's preaching family and that... supposedly believes you know fighting bullying and and trying to empower children to be their best selves is simultaneously not really caring about the people at the border.  it's not a good look and and i sympathize her actually a little bit with the first lady's duties because i find it sort of outmoded.  Like, why does the First Lady have to be the party planner at the White House?  Like, why is that her job in 2020?  Why is that the role?  Like, why should Jill Biden make that her role if she's First Lady?  Couldn't she do something else if she wanted?  Like, I sympathize there, but you're a woman with immense amounts of privilege and fortune and influence and power, and she never really used it to... to do well, to do good by people.  And it's all excuses here.  It's all excuses about how everyone hates her.  And I think this is actually a very bad look.  Some people are saying, oh, she's going to lose the evangelicals because she says F Christmas.  I really don't think those people are going to be lost.  Those people support Trump, not because they think he's actually Christian, but because as long as he puts in their like, their ridiculously conservative judges, they don't care.  But a lot of, you know, good willed middle class suburban type people are going to see this as a very bad look.  And this is yet another piece of evidence that the Trump family, whether it's Donald or Melania or all the rest, are out of touch and don't care about the concerns of regular people. ",
