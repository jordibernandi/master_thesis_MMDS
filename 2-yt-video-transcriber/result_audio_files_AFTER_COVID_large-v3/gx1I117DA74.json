            "text": "Hey everyone.  So this morning I woke up to my Twitter feed being absolutely filled with videos of this small YouTuber who describes herself as a 22 year old single mother of a beautiful baby girl on her YouTube channel.  Her channel is tiny.  We're looking at like under a thousand subs.  So she's not exactly huge.  But looking at her channel, she makes a lot of videos about things like crystals and you know, all that pseudoscience stuff and paranormal stuff.  And occasionally she will review makeup and things like that.  You know, kind of usual stuff.  Seems okay, seems innocent.  Until yesterday, that is, when she uploaded a video with her two year old daughter crying her eyes out in the background, saying that she just beat her because she ruined her makeup palette.  Not even joking.  This is not okay.  This is absolutely heartbreaking and we need to talk about this.  I warn you now, the video that you are gonna see is not pleasant to watch.  It is absolutely heartbreaking.  It made me so sad, so uncomfortable.  It's absolutely awful.  So if you have any issues with stuff like child abuse or hitting kids or anything like that in general.  Just be careful going forward and use your best judgment.  I trust you guys to know what's best for you.  Also, the video quality isn't the greatest, which I apologize for, but the original video's been taken down now and this is kind of all we have.  But it's still really important to talk about it.  So the video she uploaded was titled My Toddler Ruined My JSC Alien Palette.  And I think this might be a Jeffree Star one.  I don't know.  I don't really watch Jeffree Star.  I've never seen his stuff.  I don't keep up with his makeup or anything like that.  I've never used any of it, so I don't really know.  I think from what I've, like, seen and heard, his makeup seems to be good.  I've heard really good reviews, but I think it just looks a bit overpriced.  So, I don't know.  Yeah.  Anyway, not the point here.  She opens her video by asking if we can hear her two-year-old crying her eyes out in the background.  Watch this.  How the hell can anyone with even half a heart sit there with a face like that when any child, now mind your own child, is literally crying their eyes out like that?  How... Do you?  I don't know.  How do you do that?  How do you?  It's okay.  I know, I know, I know.  She knows I'm stressed.  It's okay, baby.  I love you, too.  I love you.  It's all right.  You're a good girl.  Sorry, Kyra knows from the tone of my voice that I'm stressed and upset.  but see this is kind of like a good point.  you know I'm not a human parent I don't have like a natural child but I do have my Cairo here and she is my daughter and I treat her like one and she's everything to me.  and the thing is Cairo is a really good girl.  she is an absolute angel but very occasionally she will do something a little bit cheeky.  she'll do something that she shouldn't.  It's so rare that I actually struggle to come up with examples for this video, but like there was one time when I was filming the podcast with the here and how that I used to do with Thomas and Steve, there was one time I was filming that, I came back in the room and she got into a packet of Twix's and she'd eaten them, like wrapper and everything, and I was so worried that she'd make herself ill and I was like really panicked and stuff and I had to tell her off for that because that was a bad thing to do.  Or there was another time when we were out in the garden and she saw a fox and she just chased it and she ran across a road without looking and it was really bad and I had to tell her off for that as well.  She doesn't misbehave often but when she does we have to pull out what me and Dan naively started calling the n-word.  We didn't think this through.  Basically it's the word I'm gonna put on screen right now.  I don't wanna say it because it does stress her out and I don't want her to think she's done anything wrong right now.  So, you know, we don't use it unless it's like an extreme, extreme situation.  Yeah, the thing is like when she has done something wrong and we have to say that word, she does feel so guilty and she'll get down on the floor and she'll like hide her face in a pause and she pants and she cries and it just, it breaks my heart.  And I hate hearing her like that.  I hate like seeing her stressed out.  I hate seeing her upset and feeling guilty.  And like, the thing is, she has to learn her lesson.  So I have to like pretend to stay mad at her and not give her attention or cuddles for like five, 10 minutes, something like that.  But hearing her cry, all I want to do is like pick her up and kiss her and cuddle her and be like, it's okay, my bean.  I'm going to love you forever.  No matter what you do, I'm always going to love you.  But when she has done something wrong, I have to wait a bit and not give her any attention for a while, and it breaks my heart.  So if I can't do that for five or ten minutes with my dog, how the hell is this woman just sat there when her child, her daughter, her two-year-old daughter is crying like that in the background?  And not even just crying, crying because of something she did, because she hit her child and upset her.  Like, it makes no sense to me.  My two-year-old just got her ass peed.  Because no matter how many times I tell her not to mess with my baby, she never fucking listens.  Firstly, how can anyone sit there and talk about beating their child and be so calm and so like stone faced and so heartless about it all?  It's disgusting.  And secondly, maybe she's not listening to you because she doesn't understand because she's a two year old.  Two year olds want to be like the people they look up to, their family, their mothers.  You know, she probably sees this woman here like playing with her makeup and doing her makeup and she wants to be like her.  She wants to play with makeup too.  She wants to experience the same things that her mum is and do the same things that her mum is doing.  It's perfectly normal.  I was exactly the same as a kid.  So a lot of you guys probably know that my brother and sister are a lot older than me.  They're like 10 and 14 years older than me.  So when I was tiny, when I was like two years old, they were in like high school.  They were what, like 12 and 16, I think.  So when I was tiny, like I would always see them like sat there doing their homework, writing essays, all that kind of stuff.  And I'd want to join in too.  And my family didn't, beat me and scream at me and tell me to go away.  they saw that I was showing an interest in something that I wanted to be like them and so they gave me my own little spot at the table.  they gave me my own little crayons and my paper and I sat there and I drew and I scribbled and I tried to write the best I could to be like my brother and sister especially my sister.  she was my favorite person in the world.  and yeah I do think that stuff is what helped sparked my love of like drawing and writing and stuff like that and it really helped strengthen my bond with my sister.  in particular it made me feel like I was part of the family you know uh developed a lot of skills and I was able to do things like holding a pen properly like way way before any child should you know.  so I showed an interest in something and my family supported and encouraged it because that's what families do.  They didn't shout at me and beat me because I was in the way.  That's what this child did.  She showed an interest in something that her family was doing and she got beaten for it.  She got beaten by the one person who should be protecting her and helping her and teaching her.  That's not okay.  Kids need to know that even when they screw up by accident, because that's what this was.  It was an accident.  She didn't mean to destroy the pallet.  She didn't go out there looking to hurt her mum.  It was an accident.  She wasn't acting maliciously.  Kids need to know that when... They screw up by accident.  Their families, especially their mothers, especially their parents, are going to be there for them and still love them unconditionally and they're going to help them through and they're going to help them.  put it right and they're going to support them regardless, you know?  Kyra makes genuine mistakes sometimes and I can't be mad at her for that.  When she does something bad but I know it's an accident, I never bring out... the n-word because that just wouldn't be fair because it's not like she did something on purpose it's not like she did something maliciously.  so um hello i love you too.  yeah i'm talking about you i'm talking about you.  um so when we first moved into this place um I treat myself to these two absolutely beautiful gin glasses.  I was really excited about them, I really loved them, they were gorgeous and the first night I poured myself a drink and I put the glass on the bedside table and me and Kyra were having snuggles and she got so excited, her tail started wagging everywhere and she knocked one of these glasses off and it went flying across the bedroom spilt, I think it was lemonade, everywhere and the glass broke and Kyra just immediately panicked and she ran into the other room and she was like crying and she was shaking and she was scared and the first thing I did, I was like screw that glass, no first thing I did was come into the other room and I cuddled her and I kissed her and I told her how much I loved her and how I knew it was an accident and that she hadn't done anything wrong.  and it was just one of those things that happened, you know?  And I made sure that she was calm and happy and safe and she knew she wasn't in trouble before I did any kind of clearing up or anything like that.  because that's what you do when someone you love has an accident.  You make sure they're okay and then you help them fix it.  And ever since then, I just make sure I don't put glasses on that particular bedside table because I know it's in the tail zone, isn't it?  The tail zone, she's always wagging her tail.  I'm a happy girl.  I just, I can't imagine getting so angry with someone so small and innocent over an accident.  I put it away to where she can't find it.  And what does she do?  She finds it.  At this point, I need a freaking safe with a combination on it to keep her out of it.  She has ruined two palettes of mine.  And one of them is being discontinued.  Okay, here's an idea and here is exactly what I would do.  buy the kid her own makeup.  she's clearly interested in it so give her some of her own to play with and it doesn't have to be expensive.  go to poundland and get one of those cheap kits with like five eyeshadows and a lip gloss in it and when she inevitably destroys it the first time you can get her a new one and it's going to cost you like a quid.  and then when she destroys that you can get her a new one and eventually she's going to learn to not destroy it and how to apply it properly.  spend time hey it's okay.  Spend time with her, play with her, teach her how to use it and to apply it, and when she has accidents, it's not gonna cost a fortune to replace it, but she's gonna learn and she's gonna feel involved and she's gonna feel like you and her are doing something together, that you're encouraging her and trusting and supporting her.  That's what you should be doing.  And you're teaching her and you're giving her these tools that she can learn within a non-destructive way.  And again, I hate to keep bringing Kyra up as an example, but I do think there's a hell of a lot of similarities between dogs and kids of that age.  Like my niece Matilda is probably like, what, 18 months now?  And her and Kyra are basically the same person.  so much in common.  but when I first adopted Kyra there was one incident of her picking up one of my stuffed animals.  so you guys probably know I love my stuffed animals.  I have so many of them I collect them from all over.  I get given them like a lot as gifts.  I tend to get stuffed animals when I go to my special like a zoo or a museum or whatever and they're like kind of memory things for me.  and there was one incident in the first like week or so when I adopted Kyra when she picked up one of my stuffed animals in her mouth and it was a special one because it was baby Jasper who was a stuffed dog.  I have that my mum and sister gave to me after my dog Jasper died when I was a teenager.  so that one is like really special and it always reminds me of Jasper and you know I love him I mean they're all special but you know Anyway, so Kyra picked it up in her mouth and I saw it and I just immediately went over and I was like, Kyra, no, drop.  I just said it in this really calm but really firm voice and she immediately dropped it and I picked it up and I held it and I showed it to her and I was like, Kyra, no, no.  Hey, it's okay, sorry.  Sorry, baby.  You're not doing anything wrong, you're a good girl.  So I showed it here and I told her, like, you know, not to pick it up.  And then I gave her one of her own toys and I was like, look, you can play with this.  This one's a toy.  Yeah, and I gave her that and I showed her how to play with it and we played with it together and I gave her a cuddle and lots of attention and told her she was a good girl.  And then she took her own toy and ran off and went to chew and play with that.  And it was great.  And we haven't had a single instance since.  She has not once picked up one of my stuffed animals.  Well, actually, no, she did once because she picked it up by mistake, but she immediately dropped it again when she realised she was like, oh, no, not mine.  and went off to find her own stuff.  But it's never been a problem after that one single occasion.  And she didn't even cause any damage.  She just picked it up.  I told her no and she went off and chewed her own toy instead.  You know, I mean, Kyra loves to chew on things.  Absolutely loves it, don't you?  You love a good chew.  I know, I know.  And so I'm gonna encourage that and let her do what she loves.  But... i'm gonna give her her own toys to do that with where she knows she can be destructive and she can have fun and she can tear things apart if she wants or not.  if she doesn't want and you know as much as she loves to chew.  there's not been a single incident of her destroying something she shouldn't in two years.  she's not once destroyed a stuffed animal or a shoe or an item of clothing or a cushion or i I don't know, just anything around the house.  And a lot of people are shocked by that because they see what she can do to her toys and they're like, yeah, but how does she know the difference?  I'm like, I told her.  And I taught her and I was like, look, you can only chew the toys that I give you to play with and say toy and show you that they're yours.  And... I don't know.  And it's not just that Kyra's amazingly smart, although you are, aren't you?  You're my smart girl.  I know, I know, I love you.  But the exact same thing would have worked with a kid.  If the mother had taken away her palette and said no, and then given the daughter her own to play with and said, this, this is yours, they could have played together and it would have been lovely.  But, yeah.  It's heartbreaking that she didn't think of that.  Stop that second.  My hand hurts.  Because I just need to come back.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not even sorry that I don't have any sympathy.  I just don't have any sympathy.  If your hand hurts, imagine how your poor, innocent, tiny little child feels.  Not only is this absolutely terrible parenting and a complete misunderstanding of your child and their needs and their development, but imagine caring more about a stupid makeup palette than your own child.  I would literally give up everything in this flat to keep Kyra happy and safe.  You know.  And you guys know, I love my stuffed animals, I love my makeup, I love my books.  I'd give it all up for this one, wouldn't I?  Because that's what you do as a parent.  You put your kid first, or in my case, my dog daughter.  My daughter dog.  I just can't imagine ever putting something so stupid as a makeup palette ahead of my family.  It's ridiculous, right?  That's not just me.  it's disgusting, that's the only word I have for it.  And that's why I felt we needed to talk about this today and raise a little bit of awareness of the issue and not only just like call her out for her behaviour but talk about what she should have done instead so that if there are parents going through similar things where their kid is, you know, playing with something they shouldn't or whatever, we can talk about a way to fix it which is of course encouraging their interests but giving them a non-destructive way of doing it like giving them their own toys using cheap makeup palettes and stuff like that that they can play with and use and so on.  But at this point I want to hand this over to you and ask what do you think of this?  What would you have done in this situation?  Do you think this woman should be allowed to still continue with her YouTube channel?  Do you think that you know like child services or like social services or whatever need to get involved and help the kid?  What do you think needs to be done in this situation?  Do you think I'm overreacting a bit?  Do you think what this woman did was okay?  Like, that's not okay.  You can't beat a two-year-old.  Sorry, sorry.  I'm asking your opinion here.  But anyway, thank you for watching today.  I appreciate you guys so much.  Just to point out, I'm wearing my octopus merch.  Oh, I love this hoodie so much.  It's such a big, comfy hoodie, and I absolutely love my design on it.  This is all, like, a hand-drawn... I keep saying octopus, jellyfish.  Um... yeah this is a little hand drawn jellyfish and I love him so much.  if you want this you can grab it over in my merch store.  sorry to add a plug on the end of a serious video but um you know I'm moving house soon and deposits are gonna be a bitch so you know.  shameless self promotion but seriously thank you guys for watching today.  I'm sorry this is a bit of a serious one and a deep one and not the most pleasant or relaxing one.  definitely not one for a giggle but thank you so much for watching.  please let me know your thoughts and I will see you again very very soon.  Kyra says bye to you. ",
