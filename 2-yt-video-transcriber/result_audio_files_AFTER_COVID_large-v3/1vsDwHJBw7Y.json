            "text": "Over the years I have been asked by a various fan of these shows about my thinking regarding the historical Jesus.  Do I believe Jesus actually existed or am I a mythicist believing that the entire thing including this supposedly historical figure was made up?  I've been reluctant to make a video on the topic because the question is so filled with caveats, distinctions, and presumption that the possibility of unraveling all of that and ending with a cogent answer in a 5-10 minute video is equal to a snowball's chance in hell.  as my father liked to say.  But this month I decided it was time to take on this seemingly overwhelming task.  So I went back to the research I'd done years ago on this question, adding to it some of the more recent arguments, and I realized that the question isn't nearly as difficult as I imagined.  Do I believe that Jesus was an actual living, breathing, historical figure?  The answer is, I couldn't care less.  for two reasons.  In part one here, let's divide this question up, as I believe Bob Price was first to do, using Superman as an analog to Jesus.  First, there is the question of whether a particular man, Clark Kent, lived in Metropolis, was an unreliable reporter for the Daily Planet, and had a wicked crush on a woman named Lois.  Then there is the question of whether this man could fly, repel bullets, and see through walls.  Was there an actual person, a Clark Kent, to whom the supernatural or mythical stories of Superman were attached?  It's certainly possible, although in this analogy there was not.  If there were, and his ability to fly, repel bullets, etc.  were not true... No one would give a flying f*** about Clark Kent and we could all go about our lives without ever caring one way or the other about the historicity of Superman.  This is pretty much how I feel about the question of an historical Jesus.  Since there is really nothing we can know about the historical Jesus, we'll deal with that more specifically in part two, there is even less we can know about the supernatural aspects of this supposed person and his ministry.  Paul said if Jesus is not risen from the dead, a question no one can answer with even the slightest bit of certainty, then the Christian faith is mere vanity.  I agree with Paul.  Christianity is, for all intents and purposes, mere vanity.  bolstered by people answering that question of the resurrection in the affirmative when we can't even establish the historicity of the person who supposedly performed such miracles and was the son of a God whose existence also cannot be demonstrated.  We're already three levels deep into the world of we can't possibly know.  Let's start with the most basic level, the supernatural fabric supposedly undergirding the entire universe.  If you're going to accept without any solid evidence that there is a supernatural realm in which dying, resurrecting God-men are possible, then both the historicity of the actual person Jesus and the value of his supposed death and resurrection cease to be of any genuine interest or concern.  This is not a subject for sincere investigation.  You've already answered the question before it's been asked.  If you accept without evidence that this supernatural realm exists, a realm where all things are possible, then there is nothing we can know about anything.  However unlikely something seems, it could be absolutely true, and we would and could never know one way or the other.  That includes the historicity of Jesus and the resurrection.  For instance, the Jesus of the Gospels could be a completely historical figure who did indeed raise the dead, heal the sick, turn water into wine, and then cured himself from a deadly case of the crucifixions.  All of that could be true, and... All of it could be a trick played on us by a malevolent supernatural force whose job it is to drag all of our souls down to the fiery, brimstone-covered pit of hell.  You can't say such a thing would be impossible when you've already committed yourself to believing in a realm in which all things are possible.  God's ways are not our ways.  He sees what we cannot, right?  So for a being who orders genocide, kills innocent Egyptian children, and thinks the only good homosexual is a dead homosexual, allowing our deception in this way would not in any way be beneath him, or even unexpected.  That's the general problem with all questions involving God or gods and the supernatural.  We can't possibly begin to understand realms and beings with which we have no experience or information beyond someone's say-so.  Which brings us to the specific problem regarding the historicity of Jesus and whether or not he could repel bullets and see through walls.  And that's what we'll talk about next time in part one.  Until then, I'm me.  Thanks for watching. ",
