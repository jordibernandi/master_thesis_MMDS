            "text": "Hello, Classic Crew, and welcome to today's video where we're going to be doing a modest swimsuit haul from Amazon.  I get a lot of questions on my channel about how to dress modestly when you're wearing a swimsuit and I thought it would be a fun idea to do a modest swimsuit haul on my channel.  and what better place to order than from Amazon?  because it is so easy to get their stuff in the mail, to order it, get two-day shipping and most of their stuff is pretty affordable and I was really excited to kind of take a look at what they actually had.  So basically what I did was I went onto Amazon and I searched high-necked bathing suits, one pieces, and I searched rash guards, and I searched swimsuits with sleeves, and I just kind of wanted to see what kind of results I would get.  And I actually did find a good number of swimsuits to try.  So I ordered them and I got them here and I tried them all on for you to tell you how well they were made, if they were still cute, and how I liked them, if they were modest enough for me, and tell you if I could recommend them to you.  So I tried on seven bathing suits for you guys today and I'm really excited to share what I found because they are all modest.  Most of them are super well made and I think that they all are pretty affordable.  So I'm really excited to share them with you and I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.  So let's get into it.  So the first swimsuit I tried on is this little pineapple number.  And the reason I chose it was because it has this really high neck.  I actually really love the bathing suits that have a zipper down the front.  I think they look really sporty.  And if you don't want it to be completely up at the top, you can take it down just a little bit and you'll have a little bit more breathing room around the neck.  And I think that the print on this is super cute.  I also really like that.  the back is a racerback.  I don't think that that's really inappropriate.  And of course it does offer quite a bit of coverage in the butt area, which, hey, I love that.  So my only issue with this bathing suit was this seam along the front.  As you can see, it kind of dips down like this.  And I didn't think it was that flattering.  My husband, on the other hand, he didn't think it looked bad.  He thought I looked really nice in this bathing suit.  So he didn't think that this made me look less attractive than I am.  I just didn't think it was that flattering.  But that may have been my personal preference.  The pattern is so cute.  I love the black with the pineapples.  I think that's adorable.  And I like that.  it looks so sporty.  And it really does provide just really modest coverage along the leg, along the front.  The only skin you're really showing is the racerback, which I think is totally fine, and I actually think it's really cute.  So would I recommend this?  Yes.  I think the question is whether or not the seam is going to be flattering on you, but the quality is great.  The zipper seems really strong, and I think this is a great bathing suit.  next up let's talk about this little purple number.  i think this is a super cool bathing suit and it is so modest i can't get over it.  it has these adorable flutter sleeves this ruching in the front this really covered up bottom.  the back is ruched as well and it's just really adorable.  and it has this zipper along the front just like that other one you can see here and it allows you to get into it.  They all come with cups in the front that are removable which I think is super important because I don't like cups in my bathing suits.  I think they look kind of funny.  They're not really comfortable and so I remove them but if you're somebody who wants cups they are there.  The only issue with this bathing suit is that it did run a little large.  So in all of these bathing suits I ordered a medium.  This was the only bathing suit that felt a little bit too big on me.  I think I think I might order it, though, in a small because I love the way this looks.  I love how feminine it is.  I love how covered up it is.  I love how unique it looks.  This is just a really cool bathing suit, not something that you would see every day.  And again, it feels well made.  It feels like it's not going to break down.  The zipper is great and I I really like this bathing suit.  I think this is a really nice one.  If you're looking for something that's more on the feminine side, a little bit more girly, could go with like a little swim skirt perfectly because of these flutter sleeves, this might fit the bill for you because it is really cute and it does all of that for you.  This seam underneath the bust is super flattering.  It almost looks like a dress.  It's just a dress that's been turned into a bathing suit, which I think is pretty cool and different.  It's not something you see every day.  So as far as this bathing suit, I would definitely recommend it.  Just maybe figure out your sizing before you order it, because this was a little bit big on me.  I think I would size down to a small.  Next up, let's talk about this bathing suit.  I think this is such a cool print.  So I own another bathing suit that is similar to this, but this one is way more flattering.  The cut on here is so flattering.  It hits you right at the smallest part of you where the print is, and then the rest of it just is blue and plain.  It almost kind of gives the impression of a two-piece because you've got this kind of seam here.  It's not really a seam, but the pattern stops here, and then the bottom looks like a high-waisted bathing suit.  It's obviously incredibly modest.  It's got that zipper front.  It's got the really long sleeves, and the back is covered up very, very nicely.  This is just a really flattering bathing suit.  Is it as well-made as the others?  questionable.  i think it might be slightly thinner but i really like this bathing suit and i think it is so modest so cute really has some flair to it.  of course whenever you have this kind of raglan sleeve it makes your waist look smaller and so this works really well.  when you want to wear something that is more flattering but is also more covered up it's going to give you great sun protection because you're covering your arms you're covering your shoulders and it just is really cute.  apparently i ordered this in a small surprising.  I thought I ordered this in a medium, but it does fit me.  So if you are looking for sizing questions, I got this in a small.  Maybe if I'd gotten it in a medium, I would feel a little bit less like it was stretching, but I'm not totally sure.  So I do like this a lot.  I think the print is super pretty.  And I just really think that this is a good thing to have in your collection, especially if you're a sporty kind of person.  If you're going to be rafting or canoeing or something this is going to protect your shoulders and that's going to be the first thing you get a sunburn on.  so this is really cute and i think that it's worth having in your collection.  all right guys.  so now let's talk about this little bathing suit.  how cute is this?  i love the print.  i love that.  this looks like a high-waisted bathing suit.  and then you've got this really cute kind of short sleeve the blue and white.  I love it.  I love the pattern.  And I just think this is such a cute bathing suit.  And again, it is so flattering.  You've got a good amount of coverage on the bottom.  I just think this is adorable.  I do have one issue.  This bathing suit's zipper is a little bit more fragile than the other zippers on those bathing suits.  This is like the zipper you might find on a dress or like on a skirt.  It doesn't feel like it's waterproof in the same way as those others.  It's not thick.  And so this makes me a little bit nervous.  Now, I don't know that it's not gonna work in water.  I'm sure that they thought about that, but this zipper really doesn't give me a ton of confidence, but this is adorable.  And if this bathing suit could survive with this zipper situation, I would own like three of them.  They're so cute.  I just really like this seam here.  I really like the pattern.  I really like the colors, the short sleeve, the neckline.  I just think this is so cute.  So if this was just slightly better quality in the zipper, I would be like 100% recommend.  But I'm gonna let you guys decide whether or not you wanna purchase this because it is really, really cute.  All of these bathing suits were not very expensive, so it's not like you're pouring in $100 into a bathing suit.  But yeah, this is really cute.  Zipper is questionable.  Next up, let's talk about this bathing suit.  So cute.  I posted a picture of actually the other version of this bathing suit.  So I ordered this bathing suit in two different colors because I liked it so much and I really wanted it to work.  So it is adorable.  I posted a picture of it on Instagram.  And this to me is like the most bathing suit bathing suit of the lot.  This looks very much like a bathing suit.  It's just a more modest bathing suit.  It's not like a rash guard like those other ones are.  This is a really well made suit.  It's well thought out, well put together.  As far as the back, if you look here, it has the string attached so you can zip yourself, which is great.  And it goes all the way down like this and then you can pull it all the way up by yourself, no help needed.  And then it has even like a little flap here for you to pull over the top, which I just love.  It's so well thought out and I love the high neckline.  The bottom is pretty covered, but I do have a few caveats as regards this bathing suit.  So, I do think it would be better for somebody who has a little bit of a smaller chest.  For me, I found that I didn't have enough space around the front.  I can make it work and I will make it work because it's really cute.  but it does have a little bit less room here than I would like personally.  So if you have a smaller chest, this would probably be perfect for you.  If you have a little bit of a bigger chest, it will still work, but it just takes a little bit more finagling.  Another issue that I have is that there's actually a kind of see-through section on the side that has like lacing, and I don't think that's super modest.  That's not my absolute favorite thing.  I don't know whether I'll wear shorts or something over the top of this because of this or if I'll sew a piece in or if it's not that big of a deal, but I don't think it's that modest and I can't say with full confidence that I think this is just fine.  It does come up a little bit high and it can stretch a little bit and show a little bit too much skin for me.  So I do want to figure out a way to keep this because I do love this bathing suit.  I think it is super pretty, super cute, but I would have to deal with this side area.  So I'm going to think about some solutions, but I do love the top here.  It is really flattering and it doesn't show off a lot of skin in the front.  So I guess they kind of felt like, well, there's no skin here, so we have to show skin here.  But I think that it is really well made.  I would feel very confident wearing this at the beach.  Next up, we've got the same suit, but in a different print.  I did want to order a couple, like I said, because I just think that this is so adorable.  I think I like this print even better than the blue one.  It's very on trend, I feel like.  And again, it's really well made.  It's got that same string that you can pull for yourself.  It's got the same flap along the top of the zipper.  And it does have those same cutouts on the side, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it does have that high neckline, which is great.  And this is just so cute, so well made.  It really feels like a bathing suit and it's sturdy.  It feels like it would last a long time, especially if you took good care of it.  So I really highly recommend this suit.  We'll just all have to discuss in the comments ideas for this side thing, because I would like to hear your guys' thoughts about it.  I don't really know how to solve it, maybe getting some fabric and putting it underneath.  I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts.  So leave that in the comments, because I'm not totally sure exactly how to solve that.  But very cute, and for the most part, the top area for sure, very modest.  Last but not least, I did want to offer a two-piece option that could be more modest.  In the shots of me that I took, I didn't show any skin because I'm not comfortable putting myself on YouTube with a little bit of skin showing around my belly, so I did try and keep it kind of almost looking like a one piece.  If I were to wear it at the beach, there probably would show just a little bit of kind of my torso, just a tiny, tiny sliver because this is super high waisted.  So essentially we've got this piece here.  So this is the top.  It's kind of like a cropped rash guard.  Very cute.  I like the fabric.  My issue is a little bit with the bust.  So you've got these sewn in cups that you can't remove and it doesn't offer that much support.  So for my girls with a little bit of a smaller chest, this might be perfect for you.  For me, it's a little bit less stable, a little bit less comfortable, but I do think it is very, very cute on.  And you can kind of make it work.  I think I could probably make it work, but it's not my ideal version of this suit.  And then you've got the bottoms, which are very high waisted.  They're ruched, pretty good coverage in the back.  And so basically all you'd be showing is like a little bit of area around your ribs.  And if you're interested in having a two piece, I mean, this is kind of going to be the most modest version of one.  It's got sleeves and it barely shows anything.  So I do like the combo.  It feels very vintage to me and I really like that.  I don't think this is the most high quality.  This does feel a little bit cheaper, but it is fun and cute and it does feel really cute and vintage without feeling old fashioned.  I think it's kind of fun and it's it does kind of give you that two-piece vibe.  so if you are looking for something that is more of a rash guard but still has the kind of feeling of a two-piece this is what I would wear and I like the idea of it.  I guess I just don't feel like it's as well made as the other pieces that I'm showing.  but if you're looking for something that's inexpensive and this kind of fits what you're interested in go for it.  And that's everything for my modest swimsuit haul from Amazon.  I'd love to hear which of these was your favorite, if one of these is something that you would order.  What you like to wear at the beach.  I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts.  Thank you guys.  so much for watching today's video.  Please subscribe to my channel and blog if you haven't already.
