As we turn now to new developments in sexual assault allegations made against presidential candidate Joe Biden, last week, The Intercept reported Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, set up to help survivors of rape and sexual assault, refused to fund a MeToo investigation into allegations against Biden.  The charges were brought by Tara Reid, who worked as a staff assistant for then-Senator Biden in 1993, when she was in her mid-20s.  Tara Reid told journalist Katie Halpern in an interview published Tuesday that Biden repeatedly touched her without her consent and sexually assaulted her.  A warning to listeners and viewers, her account is graphic. ",

The Intercept reports the public relations firm representing Time's Up Legal Defense Fund is SKD Knickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is a top adviser to Biden's presidential campaign.  Democracy Now!  emailed Biden's press team for response to the allegations and to join us on the show, but they didn't respond.  Joe Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement, quote, \"'Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims.  We encourage them to do so because these accusations are false,' she  said.\".  Well, in this exclusive Democracy Now!  TV radio broadcast, we're joined now by Tara Reade herself, the former staffer for Joe Biden, who came forward with the allegations that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993.  Tara, welcome to Democracy Now!  It is very difficult to go back over something like this, but if you wouldn't mind, you telling us about how you came to decide at this point that it was important for you to tell your story.  You had come forward last year, when others talked about Senator Joe Biden, the former vice president\u2014the presidential candidate, being sexually inappropriate with them.  But you didn't go as far as to tell this story.  that happened in 1993.  So why don't you tell us what happened? ",

And I went down the stairs and... I don't remember exactly where I was because there's connections between the Russell building and all of that and the corridors.  But we were in a semi-private location.  It wasn't a room.  It wasn't the Russell office building.  I mean, his office.  It was down in the corridors.  And I handed him the gym bag.  And then he\u2014it was one, as I described\u2014 fluid moment, he was talking to me and he said some things that I don't recall.  And I was up against the wall and I remember the coldness of the wall.  And I remember his hands underneath my blouse and underneath my skirt and his fingers penetrating me as he was trying to kiss me and I was pulling away.  And he pulled back and he said, come on, man, I heard you liked me.  But he was angry.  It was like a tight voice.  And he tended to smile when he was angry.  And he isn't like the Uncle Joe like everybody talks about now.  He was younger.  He was my dad's age at that time and very strong.  And he looked insulted and angry.  And I remember feeling like I had done something wrong when he said that statement.  And then I was standing there when he said he was still near me.  He said, pointed his finger and said, you're nothing to me.  You're nothing.  And he walked away.  And I don't remember exactly where I went after.  I think I went to the restroom to clean up, but I don't remember precisely.  The next memory I have is sitting on the cold stairs and the Russell building back stairs where the big windows are.  And I remember just my whole body shaking.  And I remember knowing that knowing that I had made him angry and that my career was probably over.  And I didn't comply, and I didn't comply when I was asked to serve drinks at a cocktail party for donors because apparently Joe Biden said, according to a legislative staffer, that I had pretty legs and he thought I was pretty and I should serve the drinks.  And my supervisor had encouraged me to do so, and I did not.  So sitting on those stairs, the reality hit me.  The next thing I remember was that night and talking to my mom and she was like, you need to file a police report.  It's a sexual assault.  And I didn't think of it as sexual assault.  And I didn't really understand.  And I was trying to just get over the shock of it because I looked up to him.  He was supposed to be a champion of women.  And I was so thrilled to be at that office and so honored.  And it, It shattered my life and changed the trajectory of my whole career in life.  And I lost my job after I complained, and I was fired.

What I did was I went through office protocol, which would be to go to your supervisor, and if you're not happy, you go to the next supervisor, and then the next one would be the chief of staff.  And I did go up the chain verbally.  And there were a couple of meetings\u2014more than a couple, actually\u2014and there were people taking notes.  I mean, I know they took notes.  And some were more informal in the hallway with Mary Ann.  I was\u2014basically, after I had not served the drinks.  that whole, you know, episode, I was immediately told, like, within a few days by Marianne's assistant that I dressed too provocatively, that I was too\u2014that I needed to, you know, be less noticeable.  And then Marianne got me in the hallway, because I was annoyed by that, and she said, you know, you want to just keep your head down and do as you're told, if you want to last here.  And I went to them and told them I was uncomfortable.  So I couched it in those terms.  We didn't use the term sexual harassment a lot back then.  And I remember saying I was uncomfortable and why, but nothing happened.  And in fact, I was put in a windowless office and I had my duties taken away from me.  I was given a desk audit.  I was told to call one of my upper level supervisors Even if I went to the restroom, I was not to call or talk to other staffers or go to legislative hearings.  I was told that I was given a month to find another job.  And I sent out my resumes.  And before I did that, because of this retaliation, I told my mother, who gave me the term retaliation, and explained to me what was happening.  and said to march in there and file a sexual harassment claim.  And I said\u2014and she used the word.  And I said, well, you don't just march into their office.  Like, that's not how this is done.  So I had gone through that protocol.  Then when that didn't work, I went to the outside, which was like a\u2014they had a temporary office set up, so it was Senate personnel or something like that.  And I was given a clipboard.  I filled out a form and talked about just the incident of the sexual harassment, feeling uncomfortable.  And I was told at the window that somebody would call back, you know, call me back in, and they never did.  I ended up looking for work, couldn't find it.  I volunteered for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial.  I was fortunate enough to work in the VIP tent.  with the family, and it was helping me emotionally because I was trying to recover from the trauma of what had happened that day.  And I didn't share it with many people at all at that time.  It's just not something that was easy to talk about.  It's not easy to talk about now.  And when I came out in April, I started again.  I had the intent to tell the whole history with Biden.  But one of the first questions out of the reporter's mouth was, yeah, but it wasn't sexual, right, when he was talking about the sexual harassment.  And it shut me down.  And that's not his fault.  That's my responsibility, I know, to be brave and to be courageous and say the words.  But it just put me off from being able to talk.  And then when the story was hitting, there was so much blowback and smearing on social media.  that I just didn't feel comfortable.  So I was trying to find a way to tell my story to a legitimate news agency.  I didn't want it sold or sensationalized or anything nonsense like that.  I wanted to have the deeper conversation of how hard it is for survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace to go up against powerful men because I have not received any payment for this.  I have not received any compensation, because the facts are, you know, women are not paid to talk.  They're paid to stay silent.  And so I wanted a women's organization around me, and that's why I went to Time's Up. ",

And if you're economically challenged or you need help with funds, they will help you with a public relations platform for one month.  So access to a public relations firm to tell your story with their platform and also to have an attorney, which is what I was seeking because of the social media smears.

But part of their services was to provide a platform, a public relations platform.  I don't understand\u2014 as a survivor.  And I'm not an investigative reporter.  I'm not an investigator.  I'm just speaking as a survivor.  It violated my trust when I read Ryan Grim's article.  I found out with everyone else.  And I'm still processing that.  I shared my story with them again and again with the attorneys that they sent to me.  And each time I was rejected by each attorney, one attorney said, we've met as a firm.

Anyone who has a claim or an assertion of something that's happened, of misconduct, should be able to speak freely without reprisal.  And as you can see in the social media, I am being ripped apart.  I've had my family.  and my friends contacted.  I've had my bankruptcy posted.
