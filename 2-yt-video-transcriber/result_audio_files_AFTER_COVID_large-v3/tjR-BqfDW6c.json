            "text": "Oh, hi there.  It's me, Thoopadoop Slumpadump.  I'm here in the enchanted, mystical forest of unicorns, where socialists like me get all of our economic ideas.  I was out here visiting Grumbletum, the lovable folksy woodland critter who lives out here, eats all of my likes, comments, and subscriptions, and will literally die without them.  I hadn't heard from him in a while, and I was starting to get worried, but, um, no, he's fine.  Everything's fine.  There is no magic money tree.  These are the words often spoken by Theresa May, former prime minister for the UK, before her ineptitude turbo-fucked it forever.  One time, she used this zinger to shut down a nurse who asked her why the spending power of her salary had decreased about 14% in eight years.  I agree with that.  My wage sips from 2009 reflect exactly what I'm earning today.  So how can that be fair in light of the job that we actually do?  But there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want.  Take that.  Get a real job, you lazy.  Nurse.  Hey, this catchphrase sucks.  First of all, there's already an aphorism that sums up what you're trying to say much better.  Money doesn't grow on trees.  That analogy makes sense.  Things grow on trees.  Money doesn't.  Those things are plentiful and renewable.  Money isn't.  Very straightforward.  Makes a lot of sense.  Got it.  Just... On its own, good aphorism.  Might not agree with the message, good aphorism.  Magic money tree, though.  What does that mean?  There are no magic anything trees.  The only reason trees are involved in your expression is because people are already familiar with the other expression that makes more sense, the one that makes your expression irrelevant.  Why does the tree gotta be magic, Teresa?  Things grow on trees without the aid of magic, Teresa.  Apples aren't magic.  Cherries aren't magic, Teresa.  But beyond being a worse version of a common expression, the idea that it represents is childish and toxic.  What Ms.  May is saying is that it would be impossible to pay nurses more or, you know, do whatever else.  she used the catchphrase to justify not funding.  And that's not true.  Like, let's just pretend for a second that there's no way to raise taxes on wealthy people in the UK and that every citizen of the UK is just paying every last cent they're able to in tax.  They couldn't withstand a cent more.  Let us assume that there is nothing that could be cut from the budget.  Every single little dime is accounted for and they can't sell the golden chairs that everybody has to sit in.  Let me tell you just a little secret.  And this secret is going to piss off every economist watching this.  Economists, log off.  Governments control how much money there is.  Governments have as much money as they say that they do.  Because money is made up.  Money's not real.  Now they can't just go willy-nilly with this.  You print too much money and you get hyperinflation.  But the thing is, in this example, this nurse's real wage has decreased due to inflation already.  So essentially what May is telling her is, ma'am, we have to pay less to cover the cost of inflation because paying you more might lead to further inflation.  Which, you know, sounds kind of shitty because whatever you did to cause that inflation was clearly worth funding.  Why isn't my salary?  It's not impossible.  May just doesn't think it's worth the cost.  But if she said that, if she was honest, people would have to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks and make up their own mind.  Instead, she was too cowardly to say what she actually meant.  How many times have you heard something like this?  How much have you internalized the idea that it's unrealistic to expect things to get better?  And who, exactly, does that idea serve?  This Emperor's New Clothes strategy works over and over.  You demand something, the people in power laugh and say, that's impossible, we can't do that.  And serious, smart people, like me, know you can't do that.  And then everybody responds, okay, sure, no, I knew that.  I'm smart, I'm also smart, and I knew that we couldn't have, I don't even want that.  Why are these children even asking for it?  I don't even want it.  Bit by bit, the things that you want and a lot of the things that you already had become impossible according to some standard that is never quite explained to you.  All serious people agree that what you're asking for falls outside the boundaries of serious consideration.  Everything you have is chipped away and it's impossible to ever get it back.  And what the fuck is your problem for?  even asking for it, you nincompoop?  Don't you know anything?  Of course, the onus is never on them to explain why something can't be done.  How will we pay for it, they say?  I don't know, dog.  Probably the same way we pay for everything else.  Nobody ever asks, how will we afford to pay transit cops?  But if you demand free transit, suddenly everyone has a close eye on the budget and knows every detail.  There's no money to take care of veterans, obviously, sorry, but there's infinite money to create new veterans.  Now you've got to come up with some way to generate revenue for the government because you wanted the government to do its job.  And you gotta do it on the spot, and the actual cost of the program you're suggesting is irrelevant.  Even if you come to them with a fully costed solution, they'll just throw their hands up and say, yeah, that won't work, and they won't offer any sort of falsifiable claim to argue with.  No, you've gotta prove it to them, and they don't have to listen to you.  Now you're not arguing about whether or not you should do something, an argument that they would lose, you're arguing about whether or not you can do something.  An argument that they'll usually still lose, but it's abstract enough that most people are bored by it, so they win.  The reason you can't answer the question, how will we pay for it, is because it's a meaningless question.  Discrete taxes aren't earmarked for certain causes.  The IRS doesn't take Amazon's money and then, well... The IRS doesn't take Amazon's money at all, but if they did, they wouldn't take it and say, okay, give that one to the Bureau of Education, boys.  They need new desks in Idaho, so make sure they spend it on that.  The budget is set by expenditure.  We don't really know how much something costs until we do it, so we'll never be able to say with confidence how something gets paid for.  We can make an estimate of how much something costs, present that estimate, and then determine whether or not that fits within the budget.  And if it doesn't, how do we know the budget is set appropriately if we can't afford to do the things people want to do?  When you say, how can I afford to live without this service?  They say, that's not my problem.  Take some responsibility for yourself, you entitled millennial.  And when they say, how can we afford to provide this service?  That's also your problem.  You also have responsibility for that.  Cool.  When they say, beneath the spectrum of visible light, there are trails of darkness beyond darkness, that is your soul, and as I follow it, I grow to possess it.  You say, Hail to thee, O great lord of eyeballs, Oculon, the unblinked one.  Hello and welcome to the Eyeball Zone.  Here in the Eyeball Zone, we feast upon the innocence of small leftist projects.  Long-time slimeheads might remember that my first YubTub was about why political correctness kind of rules, and I did a bad job.  It's not a good video.  I was doing my best at the time and learning as I went.  YouTuber, obnoxious anarchist... Wait, isn't that me?  Hold on, let me check my notes here.  No, that's not me.  His video is like mine except it has arguments and citations and substance.  He outlines the case I was trying to make, and watching his video made me feel a little less crazy.  Go give it a watch and learn how the right-wing media hegemony has convinced entire generations that simply speaking politely is somehow an assault on Western civilization, which, even if it were, frankly, I'd still be okay with it.  Do you have a project you foolishly believe can resist the strength of the eyeball zone?  Ha!  Send no more than one email to thoughtslimeeditor at gmail.com with the word eyeballs somewhere in the subject line and pertinent details such as your pronouns and maybe you too will find yourself trapped here in the eyeball zone.  Utopianism is a dirty word among most leftists.  The word means something different to Marxists and some anarchists.  They tend to use it to mean conjecture not based on material analysis.  And that is a bad thing.  It's bad to base your view of the world on nothing but what you want it to look like.  The problem comes when people combine a fuzzy understanding of that definition with the more common view of the word utopian.  Most people use the term to mean something too good to be true.  And there's a lot of overlap there, but the thing is, if you're trying to make things good in a way that's based on material analysis, but it seems impossible to someone else, they would determine that to be utopian, and therefore not worth working towards.  But if all of your long-term goals go exactly as far as what you're 100% certain you can change within extant society, you're gonna be trapped making small changes that the ruling class acquiesce to.  There's also a bigger danger.  If you're kind of vague on the details, but you hear people saying that utopianism is the opposite of material analysis, you start to think, well, I guess if something sounds like it could be good, but it has serious drawbacks, that must therefore be more likely than something that just sounds good.  And so maybe you start to base your view of the world on creating solutions that have horrible drawbacks baked in.  Want to save the environment?  Gee, I don't know if it's possible without a complete collapse in the human population.  What's that you're saying, Mr.  Eco-Fascist?  You have an idea?  Well, I'm all ears.  Now, I have a feeling that a lot of people are going to read into what I'm saying in all sorts of wild-ass directions.  So let me just lay it out as plainly as I can.  I don't think it's bad to base your view of the world on material analysis.  I think that's, in fact, very good.  I think that's the thing that you should do.  The thing I am whining about here, specifically, is the conflation of undesirable with realistic.  It is possible, sometimes, to do good things without a bad consequence.  Not always, but sometimes.  And where available, that is the option we should pursue.  Pessimism and realism are not synonymous.  It is not more emotionally mature to be a pessimist.  It is not childish to be optimistic, provided that that optimism is rooted in reality, not just what you want to be the case.  The depressive realist mindset means that we capitulate in advance because we're afraid of false hope.  And it hurts to be disappointed.  It's okay to be scared.  I'm scared.  Are you kidding me?  Climate change is killing everything.  Are there koalas anymore?  I don't know.  But convincing you that things can't get better is exactly what the ghouls ruling over us want.  I say you should demand the impossible from your boss, your elected officials, your landlord, and don't stop demanding it until either they admit it's not impossible and give it to you, or they have to make whatever is possible their compromise.  Thanks for watching the video.  Thank you also for hitting the like and subscribe buttons and that annoying little bell that YouTube makes everybody ring.  Thank you as well to all my Patreon subscribers.  Once again... As usual, I am far behind on Patreon drawings, and I just realized that.  Fuck, I have bad time management.  Okay, they'll be there next week.  That's a Thought Slime guarantee that you can take to the bank.  I also have a separate channel where I talk about horror movies.  I recently did a feminist reading of Wishmaster 3 for some reason.  You can find those at youtube.com.  slash scaredycatstv.  Scaredy Cats was taken.  But that's not all, folks.  On every Thursday, there's also me doing Twitch streams on twitch.tv.  slash botslime.  That's right, every Thursday, usually, sometimes I don't, at 8 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time.  That's where I go to do that.  You heard it here first.  I always announce when I'm going live on Twitter, but I would never encourage you to follow me or, indeed, anyone else on twitter.com.  After my last video where I discussed my problem with Microsoft Windows, a lot of people reached out to me with different Linux distros that they thought I might prefer.  And, uh, nah.  Thanks, but, like, nah, though.  You know?  Like, nah. ",
