I don't see anybody in here.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.  Step away from my vehicle, please.  You are more than welcome to stay on the sidewalk, but you can't get close.  Let me let you know something real quick.  You can't get close to my vehicle.  That's my vehicle.  Thank you.  This is not your vehicle.  That's my vehicle.  I fucking paid for it.  Okay.  So, can you please just... Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Just give us some room.  Let's do our investigation.  And if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them, okay?  F. Carada.  Yes, sir.  What's the bitch's name?  Ortega.  A. Ortega.  Apparently they're doing some kind of investigation.  We got G273GJ.  Immediately barking orders.  I saved the bitch's name because she has the blue line flag on her chest.  And so does he.  They're doing some type of investigation.  I see a hat laying over there with cutting tools.  So somebody cut a hole in the fence somewhere.  So they're going to try and locate or figure out who done this crime.  I won't spend much time on this one guys.  Some type of burglary.  She's getting out all the stuff that she needs.  Got one over there.  What's up?  I believe that was Sempe against police violence.  Look like him.  These officers were barking orders immediately, told me to step away from their vehicle.  I'm walking by.  You're safe.  Thank you.  So are you.  I'm always safe.  You have a great day.  Be safe.  She walked to the back.  She's going to come around.  Apparently somebody broke into this vehicle.  or maybe several vehicles.  We got Unit 560, Forensics Services and Crime Scene Unit.  There's nobody in their cars unless they've already toted another person away.  So they're just doing the crime scene part.  Taking photos.  Guys, I'll go ahead and call this one.  Nothing happening here.  We'll be out of here.  And I'll go to the next one.  Spitting Cobra out here on Main Street and date.  I was headed to another call.  Apparently, at the red roof on Main Street, some woman was walking around with no top on.  But when I got there, nobody was there.  Spitting Cobra.  I'm out. ",
