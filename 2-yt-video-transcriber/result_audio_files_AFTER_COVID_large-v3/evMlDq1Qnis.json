The next segment contains graphic images and descriptions of police violence, as we go to Philadelphia, where a black mother who was attacked with her family in October by a horde of police officers is speaking out about the harrowing experience.  Rekia Young was driving an SUV with her 2-year-old son and teenage nephew on October 27, as the city was engulfed in protest over the police killing of Walter Wallace  Jr.,  a black man having a mental health crisis earlier that day.  But Rekia Young didn't yet know about that killing.  She was just trying to get her nephew and son home when she took a turned down a one-way street, unknowingly driving straight into a throng of police in riot gear.  As Rekia tried to turn the car around and leave the dangerous scene, the officers descended on her SUV, broke all its windows and assaulted and arrested her.  This is Rekia Young, in her own words, describing the attack to the Philadelphia Inquirer in a recently published video interview. ",

She didn't back up because there were people behind her.  There were people running towards her.  She didn't do anything to try and assault an officer.

And then her mother and her sister went out to 52nd Street to question the police.  At first, the police acted as though they didn't know what they were talking about.  And eventually they directed Rekia's mother and sister to 15th Street, which is about four miles away from where all this happened.  And 15th and JFK, to be exact, which is near where the Department of Human Services is here in Philadelphia.  And when they went down to 15th and JFK, Rekia's mother found her son sitting in the backseat of a police car, still in his car seat.  And when she touched his hair, glass fell out of his hair.  There was still glass from the car in the car seat.  When I met them, maybe the next day, I looked at the car seat and the glass was still there, large pieces of glass still in the car seat.  The police were just allowing him to sit in that glass.

Eight, seven, eight hours later, they're smashing the windows out of a single mom's vehicle and dragging her away from her child and separating them.

I saw way more than five officers either involved in the destruction of Rekia's property or ignoring the conduct of the other officers and not stopping those officers from doing that.  So more officers need to be held accountable.  I will join in Rekia's request that the officers involved be fired.  They certainly do not deserve to have the trust placed in them to protect and serve our communities. ",

            "text": "Well, Amy, this is eerily reminiscent of a story that I uncovered actually almost 30 years ago.  It's amazing how the more things change, the more they stay the same.  This was back in 1991, in the aftermath of the Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn, New York.  That was the riot supposedly touched off by a motorist, a\u2014 the killing of a young child, Gavin Cato, by a motorcade of a Hasidic rabbi that was passing through the Crown Heights neighborhood.  A few weeks after that riot, I got a call from a lawyer who said that his client had been arrested that night, the night of the Crown Heights riot, and he was an innocent motorist just driving through the neighborhood, who happened onto President Street.  And as he was trying to get home, and the police immediately converged on his vehicle, destroyed his\u2014broke the windows of his car, dragged him out and beat him.  And I said, are you sure?  I haven't heard anything about that.  And he said, no, the Daily News, your newspaper, has a photo of my client, Pierre Regis, being arrested as a so-called rioter.  And he says, I'm trying to identify the other police officers who actually were involved in beating him.  So you must have had a photographer on the scene.  So I said, well, look, I can't give you anything other than what's already published in the paper, but I'll check to see if there are any other photos in our photo library.  And, sure enough\u2014because this was before smartphone videos, and this was still when film, when actual film was being developed by photographers, not before digital photos\u2014and I found the reel of photos that involved this incident.  But somehow, mysteriously, the key photos of the police beating this young Haitian-American, Pierre Regis, were missing.  Someone had gone into the Daily News photo library and pulled out the most incriminating photos.  There were still, though, some photos left.  And so, all I could tell the lawyer was, yes, I think there are some photos.  He eventually subpoenaed them and got the police, civilian review board, to subpoena them.  And the upshot was that there was a trial in which I think Pierre Regis ended up being awarded over $3 million as a result of the injuries he sustained.  But it was the same story.  He was labeled a rioter.  He was just an innocent motorist passing through a neighborhood in the middle of a racial disturbance.  And so\u2014and once again, the police turned the victim into supposed criminal.  So, it's eerily reminiscent of what's happened here to Rekia Young, but it happened so many times.  And luckily, this time, there appears that there will be some action taken, hopefully, by authorities. ",

And, of course, we will continue to cover this.  Next up, we're going to look at how the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft scored a major victory against worker rights with the passage of Prop 22 in California, how they're now pushing similar measures across the country.  This is Democracy Now!  Thank you, Kevin Menci.  We'll be back in a minute. ",
