ALL THREE OF OUR PANELISTS HAVE NEW BOOKS OUT.  I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND ALL OF THEM TO YOU AND WE WILL PRESENT THEM TO YOU IN A PROPER FASHION AT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR PANEL DISCUSSION.  GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.  LET ME START, JOHN, WITH YOU.  I THINK IT'S A VERY, VERY DEVASTATING TO THE BIDENS.  AND NOW WE HAVE THE REMARKABLE, THE REMARKABLE STATEMENT BY THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, THE NUMBER ONE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER IN THIS COUNTRY.  THIS IS NOT A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN.  THIS IS NOT A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN.  THESE LAPTOP EMAILS ARE FOR REAL. ",

And we now know, thanks to the good work that Peter Schweitzer did today, there's a separate batch of emails, not the ones found on this hard drive in Delaware, but that were part of a co-defendant's trial.  We have to remember Hunter Biden's business partner was in as a convicted felon.  He was tried and convicted in 2018.  AND THEY SHOWED JOE BIDEN WAS DIRECTLY ASSISTING HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALS, EVEN MEETING WITH SOME CHINESE OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE BACK IN 2011.  IT'S A QUID PRO QUO GOING BOTH WAYS.  JOE BIDEN IS HELPING OUT HUNTER BIDEN AND HUNTER BIDEN IS GETTING RICH. ",

HE NEEDED TO GET RICH QUICK AND HE DID BECAUSE HE GETS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  I THINK $20 MILLION HE EARNS IN HIS TWO YEARS OUT OF OFFICE.
