            "text": "We always hear that women want to be understood in relationships, but I don't think that's true.  Women just want to be seen.  They want to be noticed.  They want to know that they exist above everything else, that you're paying attention to them.  Similar to a child that says, daddy, daddy, look at me.  I think that underlies why a lot of women nag during relationships because you're not making the relationship enough about them.  It can't approach equality.  It has to be all about her.  She seemingly, through her insecurities, I think, keeps needing to overcompensate in the amount of proof you give her that she's actually there, that you see her, that you care about her.  I suppose it's coupled with the fact of her needing security and needing to be taken care of that she may overcompensate.  But whenever we hear, you know, we just want to be understood, They don't want to be understood.  They want it to be about them.  They want to be seen.  They want to be noticed.  The relationship has to be their relationship, not the two of you, not your relationship together.  It's her relationship.  And if it's not heavily leaning towards her side, then she doesn't feel secure.  She feels not seen.  You don't get me.  You don't get it.  You don't understand me.  With most women I've been involved with and that I've talked to, underneath the insecure shell there is not much of a secure individual willing to speak their mind honestly and fairly be either willing to show who's there but most of the time it's just a pretty shell.  there is not very much inside most women which is why they nag to be filled up all the time.  In the Jungian archetype, men are the presence and women are the absence.  And I suppose that's where the nagging comes from.  Give me, give me, fill me up.  I suppose there's an insecurity in being the passive gender.  You know, that passive gender that survives by being noticed.  Not by going out there and taking action, but by sitting passively and being seen.  See me, notice me, low-cut top, makeup, bright colors, feathers.  It's all about appearance and being noticed with her.  And because she relies on being noticed and seen, she'll do and say whatever she needs to.  When a woman says she wants to be noticed in a relationship and understood, that is code.  That is code for, see me, look at me, it needs to be more about me.  Because if it's all about me, then I can feel secure and safe.  A man generally can feel secure that it's not about him.  In fact, men know it's not all about them.  We're externally referenced as a baseline anyway.  Unlike women who are self-referential, they're referenced from their own point of view.  Men are interested in things.  Women are interested in themselves and anything that reflects that self in a superficial sense.  A woman's view is largely solipsistic compared to a man's.  And how does this overcompensation of see me, understand me in a relationship play out?  It plays out in.  let's go to restaurants, let's go traveling, let's go to the theater, let's watch romantic movies.  Anything that has nothing to do with you as a guy.  to prove that it's all about her.  That's when she can feel secure.  Ah, now he's doing it just for me.  It's only for me, not for us, for me.  Now I feel secure.  My insecurities are alleviated because it's all about me.  And I've made sure because I've picked things for you to do and spend time on and waste your time on.  that have absolutely nothing to do with your interests or interests that we can both share.  And needless to say, today's social media capitalizes on women's vanity and need to be seen.  Notice me.  Make sure I exist.  And that's why they exploit women so much easier today than they do men.  And furthermore, the proof that women really don't want to be understood, they just want to be seen and noticed, is when they're going through a problem, when you're trying to understand them, they accuse you of trying to fix them, but you are trying to understand them.  They don't want to be understood.  They don't want their problems fixed.  They just want you to shut up and listen to them, see them, make everything about them.  They are the only voice in the room.  They are the only concept in the relationship.  When you intrude as an individual that has your own wants and needs, you want to be in tandem in this relationship, then there's this kind of insecurity from the passive sex where they're being overshadowed.  So I think it's an overcompensation, but unfortunately women do it really easily.  And I think at the heart of it, combined with the sophistry of, I just want to be understood, what it really means is I want it to be about me, all about me.  It's not enough about me.  See me, see me, notice me, make me feel secure.  don't want you to fix their problems.  most women don't want an equal relationship.  the relationship context.  if you look at the script if you notice the script of a relationship right from the beginning it's giving giving giving security making her feel like she's seen like you've heard her.  whatever she asks for whatever she nags for you accommodate it over and over and over again and generally Men just want a beer and to watch television and to be left alone.  They don't require much because I think they're tired of so much giving with little of them.  I think the tiredness in men also comes from having themselves deteriorated so much by giving so much of themselves to no avail.  Anyway, something to think about.  Let me know in the comments if you've noticed this.  Women claiming sincerely that they want to just be understood.  Why can't men just see me and understand me and get me?  Where really all they want is they just want to be noticed and they want it all to be about them.  The spotlight cannot shift from them onto you or in between you and her.  It has to be solely on her.  Really, a relationship is she's on stage and the spotlight is always on her and you're the audience clapping.  And if you're not and the spotlight better not shift from her, that's what I've noticed anyway.  Something to think about.  Let me know your thoughts below.  Have you noticed this?  I'm not saying men don't have their faults.  And to women who are the exception, you'll know who you are because you're not offended at this.  In the same way that I know, just because I'm not obsessed with cars doesn't negate the fact that most guys are into cars.  Anyway, let me know your thoughts below.
