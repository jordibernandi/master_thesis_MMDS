Your tag lights, they're supposed to illuminate your tag.  Those two white lights, all they're doing is shooting straight back.  You can't have any white light limiting them back.  So then that also doesn't illuminate your tag.  And on top of that, you got a border around your tag that blocks the county that you live in.  You can't have that on your tag.  Are you talking about the one that the car dealership puts up, the black one?  That silver one that goes around your tag?  Yeah, you can't have that.  You got your license, brother? ",

Any weapons in the vehicle I need to be aware of?  Nope.  Nothing illegal in the car?  Yeah.  All right.  So after I'm done, if I ask to search the vehicle to verify what you're saying is true, you don't mind?  I do mind, but only because I'm a lawyer.  Okay.  So you know what consented?  That's what I'm asking.  Yeah.  So you have nothing in the vehicle?  I have absolutely nothing in the vehicle.  Okay.  And you don't mind confirming that by allowing us to look and make sure there's nothing in the vehicle?  As you can imagine, we here know all the time as they have nothing and we find stuff.  No, I understand that, but I'd rather you not search my car.  Okay.  Cool.  Just hang tight, brother, okay?  How you doing bud?  Two times a week.  Say what?  Two times a week, right?

            "text": "That border?  Asking him to roll down his window may not be what it seems.  He has his driver's side window rolled down.  Why is he asking him to roll down his passenger's side window?  Well, it just might be because he wants to create a crosswind.  That way he can smell marijuana or alcohol emanating from the car.  Check out this court case.  This is the case of Grant versus the state.  It's the state of Maryland in which Terrence Jamal Grant tried to get... evidence suppressed of marijuana in the vehicle.  Let's just go down where it says verbatim the interaction between the police officer and the subject, which will explain everything.  It's important to note that a lower court, the circuit court, denied the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence.  Now it's in front of the appellate court, which is really just a court of appeals.  Here's the conversation between the defense counsel and the officer.  Defense counsel, so when you stopped him, you got out of your car, did you smell marijuana?  Deputy Atkins, Yes, on the initial contact.  Counsel, I said when you got out of your car, did you smell marijuana?  You mean before I went up to his car?  Yeah, before you went up to his car, did you smell marijuana?  Deputy Adkins, no.  Counsel, okay, did you perform a sniff of his car?  Did?  what do you mean by sniff, said Atkins.  Defense counsel, like a dog, I'm saying, did you specifically examine his car for, for the smell of marijuana?  Deputy Atkins, you mean did I walk around the car and just sniff at the car, at his car?  I understand the answer may be no.  Deputy Atkins, no.  Okay, ah, so the point at which you, you allege you smelled marijuana was when you kind of leaned in to get his license and registration.  If you call it leaning, it's when he rolled down his window and I made con when I was speaking with him.  Okay, do you recall how you positioned yourself when you were speaking with him?  Like... I don't know how to explain it because I do it every single stop that I have.  I, you know, put my head, he, they have the, they roll the window down and I have my head by their window.  And, okay, do you recall if your head entered the window or not?  I don't know if my head entered through the window pane or not.  I wouldn't of, you know, it, I don't know, honestly.  Okay, you wouldn't be surprised to find out that you did.  Deputy Atkins, if I had crossed where the window glass was, no.  Were the, were the pain?  Deputy Atkins, because sometimes defense counsel would have been, state's attorney, objection, your honor, the court.  Let, let him answer one at a time.  We have all morning to finish.  Unclear one word, go.  Defense counsel, thank you, Your Honor.  Deputy Atkins, no.  I wouldn't be surprised.  So, everything hinges on... Whether the officer broke the threshold of the car, putting his head inside the car and sniffing the vehicle and then ascertaining that there was a smell of marijuana because then he put his head inside the vehicle.  We retain a right to privacy inside our vehicle in a plain view doctrine.  Clearly states crossing the threshold of the door or the window would be an intrusion and an invasion. ",
