            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is that she's never worth chasing.  reappeal dosage short videos right to the point now after three calls man.  If she doesn't show high interest after I give her three calls, man, then I'm gone.  If she isn't showing high interest right off the back, odds are that she will never have high interest again.  There are subpar fee fails out here waiting to be chased, waiting to be courted.  Most of my.  I don't want to call them failures.  I'll say waste of time with the fee.  fail has been because I refuse to court.  I don't date.  I recreate.  Right.  But what I mean by chase is that she wants to do all the calling, all the texting.  Start all the conversations, take her out for a day, show her a good time, impress her, sweep her off her feet and all of these things.  And I've encountered such an expectation from fee fails that were 30, 40 and even 50 plus who felt that I should be pursuing and wooing.  And I refuse to do such a thing when you chase her, which I don't.  But when you chase her and she shows you very little interest anyway.  And you're showing her a whole lot of interest.  This immediately and automatically shows for she knows that in her mind that she's the prize and you're showing her that she's the prize in your eyes as well, which automatically now lowers your value.  In her mind and what she wants is to deal with the guy in whom she sees his value as high.  Sometimes if she's interested, she'll play a game just to see if you will chase.  But don't worry, because if she is into you, ignoring her will make her want to chase you.  But that's only if her interest is already high in you.  You only got so much time and so much energy in this lifetime.  So do not waste it on a fee.  fail that does not start off with high interest.  Because most likely, if her interest is low, it will stay that way.  While you're trying to pursue one, you're letting others get away.  But I don't say that you pursue anyway.  But your attention spent on this one is less time and attention on another.  When you deal with a fee fail, it should be smooth and easy.  an easy transition most of the time from the number to her phone to the bedroom make the seduction quick no more than a few weeks.  if nothing happens in a few weeks get out of there.  you're doing this thing most times with speed because you don't want to waste your time and energy which is too precious and too valuable.  so hurry up.  i didn't say be thirsty.  I'm just saying that she's not worth your time and patience in most cases.  And I'm saying this because I'm being nice on the tube.  But never allow a fee.  fail to waste your time because it's worse than wasting your money.  You hear me?  For me, I refuse to sit through a movie that I don't even find entertaining just for a shot at the V. You should also be refusing any type of courtship with the average fee.  fail who is definitely not worth entertaining and spending large amounts of time with.  that doesn't involve the bedrooms.  Realize that she doesn't offer anything of real value unless she. ",
