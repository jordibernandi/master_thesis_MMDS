            "text": "Here is a just to give you a taste of what kind of folks showed up for the rally.  I think I mean, obviously, there's two things dynamics going on here.  One is their complete overestimation of how many people were coming.  I mean, it was massive.  And, you know, the the value of that in a material way.  to those of us who want Donald Trump to lose the election, is that it creates more dissent within the campaign.  Donald Trump cannot be happy with Brad Parscale.  I would be a little bit concerned if I got, if anybody on our team, if Brendan came and told me like, look, we've got, we had, we've got 300,000 people listening to yesterday's show.  And I'm anticipating 350 for tomorrow.  And I started touting it.  And then we show up on the next show and it's like, well, we got, well, we got like, you know, 20,000 people.  Brendan would have a talking to, he would have his commissary badge docked for probably close to a week.  Yeah, that's right.  So there's going to be a lot of dissent, I would imagine, on that campaign for the next couple of days.  Who knows?  The other aspect of that was just simply that, never mind the expectations game, people were either... Let's put it this way.  People decided that it was not worth going to see Donald Trump and risking getting covid.  The people who came out believed that you can't catch covid, that it's not real.  Even though they had their the health department in in Tulsa issuing warnings.  I just believe he couldn't get it.  And here is a Trump supporter at the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from Friday night.  Guy named Jason.  He's a supporter of Donald Trump's.  This is CNN spoke to him.  We need some volume there, Brendan.  And I like the mask.  I like the mask that the CNN reporter is wearing there.  Pretty, pretty heavy stuff. ",

Just to do the math, I just did it quickly here.  0.2% mortality rate in a country of 300 million is 600,000 people.  0.4 obviously would be 1.2 million people.  I guess that's, um, you don't have to worry about that.  That guy seems to be in very good health.  And of course he's completely wrong about, I mean, I don't know if he's wrong about chloroxy.  What is it again?  I can't, I can't even remember now.  Um, chloroquil.  I don't know if he's wrong about it.  I'm not a doctor, but he's wrong about what the FDA said.  Now, maybe the FDA is wrong and he has done his own studies and he understands it.  But the level of misinformation that these people have when they show up there, and you notice that the CNN reporter was wearing a double mask.  He had an N95 underneath his like black face covering mask because i think he was like a little bit nervous.  i don't blame him i'd be a little concerned too.  going in there all right.  um we will get to uh david road in just.
