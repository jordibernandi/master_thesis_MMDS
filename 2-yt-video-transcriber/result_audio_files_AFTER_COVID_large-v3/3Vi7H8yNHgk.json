I'm honored to have back with me someone I consider a very dear friend and someone who is an incredibly courageous patriot.  A little background on my friend Patrick Byrne.  He's a truly multi-dimensional figure and individual.  Patrick, many people know him as the CEO founder of Overstock.com.  Other folks know Patrick as a person who actually which pretty much hides the fact that he has a PhD from Stanford.  Incredibly well-educated individual and transformative figure.  In addition, most people that obtain the billionaire status sit on their hands and feet, if you will, head out at the beach.  Not Pat.  He took on Wall Street.  took on their corruption, helped every person who has a penny in the stock market or in a 401k in a retirement plan, took them on, exposed them.  And then if that wasn't enough of late, as we've outlined in our two previous interviews with Pat in the past month, Pat realized, wait a minute, being an IT guru, there are problems with elections in the past and what's coming up in November, assembled a team of IT forensic experts, analyzed what happened in the past, were there monitoring what happened on November 3rd, and had the courage to come forward and speak about this platform on a number of other platforms, what they found and what they're doing.  It's my honor to welcome back my friend Patrick Byrne.  Pat, welcome back to the Insider Insight Show. ",

He's a wonderful man.  As you know, I did not vote for him, but my whole feelings about him changed.  He's not at all as the media portrays.  He's a wonderful, gentle, he's way too kind.  I finally told him at one point, sir, CEO to CEO, I'd be firing these guys on the spot.  His own lawyers were yelling at him.  and they're lying, there are a dozen options or half a dozen options the president has.  Let's say there's a dozen options and with each passing day, one of them is disappearing.  Maybe a bit poetic, but that's about right.  Everything that gets discussed, his lawyers led by his general counsel are immediately in the mode of, oh no, you can't do that.  No, you can't do that.  And then they caucus and try to figure out why the answer's no.  But their answer is no to everything.  Their entire answer to President Trump about having had this election on a landslide victory stolen from him, their entire answer is more is lie back and think of England.  Their entire answer is just take it.  You can do nothing.  That's really what their answer is.  And any attempt to have a civilized discussion about the plethora of alternatives that say otherwise is met with, oh no, you can't do that.  You can't, oh, that might not work.  Oh no, if you did that, oh, that might hurt your reputation in the press.  Oh, you know, it's silly.  It's childish.  And I don't want to say much about what he said, but I can tell you he sees what they are.  He turned to me several times and said, can you see what I have to put up with?  Can you imagine what I would have been able to get done in these four years if I didn't have, you know, he actually said, Patrick, my whole life I've had the best lawyers.  People call me from all over the world, ask me what lawyer do I use on this?  What do I use on that?  I've never had such terrible lawyering as I've had here in the White House.  It's this is what I've been putting up with for four years.  Can you imagine what I could have got done if I had some real lawyers?  All they want to do is submarine them.

You don't even want to fight.  You're just, so it was terrible.  And Pat Cipollone is the guy who went, not only did he leak the story, which is the president's lawyer, general counsel, the way his general counsel is inappropriate.  He leaked a lie about it.  He leaked that we were in there talking about martial law and insurrection act.  And that was a fabrication, not even twisting.  That was a fabrication.  So you have the White House general counsel not only leaking to the New York Times, but when he leaks, he's fabricating things.  So the president should fire them on the spot.  I can tell you the president would win.  I'll give you something that if he did, I think the chance is about 80 to 90 percent that on January 20th he'd be sworn in for a second term.  And that would be sign a document that makes Sidney Powell special counsel and make Mike Flynn president.  I don't want to disparage Mark Meadows.  Mark Meadows seems like a very nice gentleman.

Let me tell you, there are a few people that I meet with that I'm watching them put facts together and draw and conclude and see them doing it as quick or, I know this sounds cocky, but as quick or more quickly than I, he was one of them.  I mean, I spend time with Buffett.  When I'm with Buffett, you can just see how smart the guy is, how quickly he gets jokes, how quickly he staples things together that are separated in the conversation by 20 minutes, things like this.

There is somebody behind them that owns them.  that's selling somebody out.  In this case, they're selling the president out.  Who owns these guys, Pat?  I bet you know.  You have an idea.  Yeah. ",

Flynn and I started looking at each other and saying, this is surreal.  What we're experiencing, Mr.  President, this is surreal.  I've never seen anything like it.  They were so disrespectful to him personally, which means disrespecting the presidency, which means disrespecting the entire United States.  You know, if I'd been in a... I was so close to taking a poke at one of these guys, I figured it wouldn't help our cause.  I couldn't believe that this was going on in the Oval Office, how they are impolite to him and shouted at the president, not just at Sidney and Mike and me, I don't care about me, but Sidney.  The other thing is they're sexist.  If you in a corporate, they were so condescending.  There was another lawyer there, one of Sidney's people, I don't know if she wants her name involved, so leave her name.  A young woman, terrific lawyer, very bright.  They were so condescending to that woman and to Sidney, these three lawyers.  If you were like that in a corporate environment these days, you'd have a class action suit like that.  I couldn't believe how impolite they were to these women, and they're clearly total sexists.  So, I mean, it was really one of the most unpleasant meetings of my life.  that and it's and it was like being in the 50s, the way these men were treating the two women and just brushing them off.  And you're and that.  but literally they were saying they kept they rather than have a substantive discussion.  Right.  Their answer to things that Sidney would say would be things like, well, she's filed 50 cases and not one of them.  They've all gone thrown out, which is, you know, explain why.  that's a lie, Dave.  Explain to your audience. ",
