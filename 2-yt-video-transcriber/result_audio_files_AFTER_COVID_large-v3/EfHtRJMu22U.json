            "text": "COVID-19 is surging around the country, but in states like South Dakota, the numbers are genuinely startling.  So the CDC recommends that if your positivity rate is above 5%, that means you shouldn't be reopening your state's economy.  Anything above 5% means that's too high.  Once you get below 5% in terms of positivity rate, you can start to reopen the economy gradually if you want to do it safely.  However, the positivity rate in South Dakota is 58%.  58%, nearly 60%, meaning the majority of people who take a COVID-19 test test positive.  And this is a small state.  So it is very, very serious in this state.  But their state's Republican governor has deliberately not taken any action, is pretending as if COVID-19 isn't a thing because she's a Republican.  And she thinks that this makes her a better politician because she is giving people in her state liberty.  And because she's not doing anything, you know, the people in her state are happy.  This is according to her.  It's just, it's honestly puzzling that this is happening.  Like, you'd think that a global pandemic would not be a partisan issue.  But in 2020 America, of course, it's a partisan issue.  And it's one of the most divisive issues of our time, right?  So there was a thread on Twitter by a nurse who is in South Dakota, who's working on the front lines with COVID-19 cases and patients.  And what she said here was, It honestly was shocking.  So she tweeted this out.  I have a night off from the hospital.  As I'm on my couch with my dog, I can't help but think of the COVID patients the last few days.  The ones that stick out are those who still don't believe the virus is real.  The ones who scream at you for a magic medicine and that Joe Biden is going to ruin the USA.  All while gasping for breath on 100% Vabotherm.  They tell you there must be another reason they are sick.  They call you names and ask why you have to wear all that stuff because they don't have COVID because it's not real.  Yes, this really happens and I can't stop thinking about it.  These people really think this isn't going to happen to them and then they stop yelling at you when they get intubated.  It's like a fucking horror movie that never ends.  There's no credits that roll.  You just go back and do it all over again.  Which is what I will do for the next three nights.  But tonight, it's me and Cliff and Oreo ice cream.  And how ironic.  I have on my home hoodie.  The South Dakota I love seems far away right now.  Now, when I read this, this... This shocked me, and what she said stood with me.  Like, it was on my mind for days after I read it because this is just shocking.  Like, you would think that the denial ends once you're personally affected with something like COVID-19, but they still deny it even when they get it, and they literally are dying from it.  I mean, what do you even say?  There's no words that capture how sad this is.  And this is sad.  Like, these are human beings that probably, you know, didn't believe this was a thing.  They didn't take any precautions.  They ended up getting it and they still, they still, you know, denied it as they're in the hospital dying from it.  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.  Like, this is horrifying.  Now, this thread went viral and she went on to CNN and she explained a little bit more about her experience.  And it's this is unreal to me.  Like, I wouldn't expect this.  to be a thing that happens, even with how delusional Trump supporters are and how cult-like they are.  Like, again, you think that there is a point where, you know, you stop believing in all of these weird things when you can see it, when it affects you on a personal, concrete level.  But according to her, that's not the case with all of them. ",

And when they should be spending time FaceTiming their families, they're filled with anger and hatred.  And it just made me really sad the other night.

That's not really that compatible with life.  And we know where that's going to head.  And it just makes you sad and mad and frustrated.

And the reality is since day one, when COVID started in this area in March, you've kind of been able to say if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck.  Like, I hate to tell you that you have COVID, but that's what you have.  Even after positive results come back, some people just don't believe it.  Now, that's not everybody.  We have a lot of patients who are very, very grateful for their care and very thankful for what you do.  But unfortunately, that's not what I'm remembering right now.  And as my nursing career, that's not what I want.  to be remembering poor.  I want to remember the saves and the happy situations.

            "text": "Now, the part of that that really, really hit me was when she basically explained how these folks are instructed to call their families to say goodbye.  And they refuse to do so because they don't believe they have COVID-19.  That, to me, it's astonishing.  As they're dying, they feel as if they are dying, most likely, and they still deny that they have COVID-19 and they don't call their loved ones.  Don't even say goodbye because it's not possible that something like this could happen to them.  I mean, you know, part of me thinks... You know, they don't take it seriously and they kind of brought this upon themselves.  But at the same time, these are human beings suffering right now.  They're in agony and they still can't admit that What's happening to them is real.  I don't know if their denial is, you know, exclusively partisan.  Maybe it's the case that this is like a coping mechanism for them.  I'm not sure, but this is heartbreaking.  I don't see these people as, you know, Trump supporters, Trump cultists.  I see them as very, very sad human beings who their last bit of life is, you know, they're consumed with rage and they're taking it out on people who are trying to save their lives.  This is... This is heartbreaking.  Now, I've heard shocking stories from people who I know that work in health care, that work directly with COVID patients.  And what I hear from them is alarming, right?  Especially the folks who are asymptomatic.  They test positive and they just they don't take any precautions.  They don't want to wear masks.  They put up a fight.  When it comes to them being required to wear masks, you know, that to me was shocking because you'd think that there'd be some level of concern for, you know, their peers, people who are there, who they're around.  But I mean, denial, it's not just them using a talking point as a Republican politician would.  They believe this to their cores.  And then to take it a step further, what, you know, the nurse from South Dakota, Jodi Doering, is saying is that this isn't just like denial.  This is a deep-seated belief that they have.  They genuinely believe that they don't have COVID-19 as they die from it.  And they believe in this so much, or don't believe in it so much, rather, that they won't even call their families to say goodbye.  I don't know what to say about this.  This is why it's so important that politicians don't be so careless with the rhetoric that they use.  It's why when Trump denies the severity of COVID-19 publicly under the guise of not causing a panic, that's an issue.  People, they take their cues from leaders.  I wish that they had a greater capacity to think for themselves, but unfortunately, the reality of this situation is that they take their cues from leaders.  If someone that they trust says something, they believe it, and nobody is going to prove that individual wrong.  The only thing that will get them to change their minds is if the person who they trust that led them astray tries to do better and reverse course and undo the damage that they caused.  If Trump said, look, this is a serious thing.  We all need to wear masks.  That's the only way I could see these folks actually doing. ",
