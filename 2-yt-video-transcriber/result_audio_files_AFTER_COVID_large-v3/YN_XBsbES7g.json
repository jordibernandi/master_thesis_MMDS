Today we're going to continue part two of three of our discussion of Antarctica in response to Professor Dave's 10 challenge questions.  Now so far we've gotten a lot of word salad and ad hoc explanations as to why the sun shines for 24 hours straight during the month of December at the South Pole.  We're going to continue that today, but we're going to start off on one of my favorite subjects, the non-existent dome over the non-existent flat earth.  So key up the music, and let's go. ",

            "text": "Now, this is another logical error that Flat Earth commonly makes.  Because we have refined our measurements of the distance to the sun over the years and centuries, if they are not all exactly the same, they're all false.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  The initial measurement to the sun was by Aristarchus of Samos, and that was estimated to be 40 times the distance from the earth to the moon.  Now notice that they knew at that time that the moon was in orbit around the earth and the sun was some distance from both the earth and the moon.  By looking at the angle to the half moon, they were able to create a right triangle and estimate the distance.  It was off by a factor of 10.  But then again, it was 200 BC.  As we got better and better measurement techniques, it went up to about 95 million miles.  And now it's down around 94 million miles based on a variety of different measurement techniques.  We have such things as the transit of Venus.  We have radar distances to both the Moon and Venus, orbital mechanics that tell us what the relationship between Venus and the Earth and Mars are in astronomical units, which is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.  Now, if we know the distance precisely between the Earth and the Moon, which we know down to about 30 millimeters, the distance between the Earth and Venus, and the distance between Earth and Mars, we can very precisely determine what one astronomical unit is.  We also understand that our orbit is not perfectly circular, so our distance to the Sun varies slightly depending on where we are in our orbit.  This idea that since every single measurement between the Earth and the Sun has not been identical, they're somehow all wrong is ridiculous.  But let's go on. ",

They like to claim that the only way to actually do something is to perform a task that's not possible to do.  Therefore, they can point out that, well, you didn't do it that way.  Now, had we stretched a tape measure between here and the sun, they'd claim that that was inaccurate as well because there could be sag or stretch due to heat.  You know, come on, guys.  How do we measure the distance to the sun?  We use trigonometry for the most part.  We use radar imaging.  We use orbital mechanics.  You know, we've sent probes to it.  So we know how far away the sun is.  There's not really a question about that.  It's been measured.  It's just not been measured to the way you want to measure it because you have no concept of the idea of scale.  How much aluminum would have to be in a tape measure half an inch wide that stretched 94 million miles.  Why don't you go ahead and calculate that real quick, and then compare it to the volume of the Earth.  Do we even have enough aluminum on Earth to make a tape measure that large? ",

And by the way, another way that you can do it is you can bounce lasers off of reflectors as we have done with the moon.  And as I noted, we can now measure the distance from the Earth to the surface of the moon where those laser reflectors are to an accuracy of millimeters.  Now we can measure that so precisely that since the Apollo landings in the late 60s, we know that the moon's orbit is some 30 millimeters further than it was in 1969, as the moon is starting to move away from us slightly.

The question was, how do you account for the 24-hour sun in Antarctica and 24-hour darkness at the North Pole?  What's the pattern of light?  Now, granted, you're at a disadvantage.  In order to adequately answer that, you would have to have some idea of a model of what the flat Earth looked like or a map, which you were unable to do.  But you didn't even make an effort at it.  You came up with some ad hoc word salad nonsense about LED lighting from the ice ring and a dome that you've never touched, seen, measured, or been to, yet accept as real, and deny the fact that there's a station at the South Pole because you've never been there.  So... Right now, you're not really doing too well on intellectual honesty.  Now, your answers are interesting in a way, kind of like asking a two-year-old to explain relativity.  It would probably result in an interesting answer, but it doesn't make it true any more than yours are. ",

We know where it is.  I can pull it up on Google.  Why do we make these videos?  These videos are being made to counteract the anti-science, anti-education, anti-learning, anti-critical thinking message that people promoting the narrative of the Flat Earth are putting out.  We're not interested in educating you because you're kind of beyond hope.  We're interested in providing good information and good reasoning to people that are watching these videos because they want to learn things.  People that are watching my videos will look in the description and look at some of the videos I used in reference for this.  And they'll go on to learn more things from those videos beyond what they learned in mine.  because they have intellectual curiosity they have integrity.  those are two things that are not found in the flat earth.  because you are promoting a narrative you are part of a movement.  flatter is the pet rock of youtube.  you just don't realize that it's a joke.  one of the things that you mentioned later on in the series that i think i'm going to address now in addition to them is why do you have forty thousand viewers?  quite frankly it's beyond me.  your videos are poorly made their random slideshows.  you're boring and you are devoid of any content.  so why do you have forty thousand viewers?  well there are two types of people with the third subgroup that watch flat earth videos.  You have people that sell t-shirts.  You have gullible people that buy t-shirts.  Those are the first two groups because they all want to feel special and be part of this movement.  Then you have the people that are curious about it.  And they tune in and subscribe to your channel just to see what kind of nonsense you come up with next.  And then you have people like me that are debunkers and I'm not even subscribed to a channel like this.  I just find them, I look at them, and I look at the points that are raised.  So, that's why people come to your channel.  It's not because they're coming to learn new truth or feel special.  So, this is Bob the Science Guy signing out from Northern Michigan.  Hit that like and subscribe button down there and follow along.  In our next episode, we're going to continue this prolonged discussion of Antarctica.  as he continues to ramble on about some other things, and we'll be addressing those.  So make sure you tune in tomorrow, and I'll go ahead and complete this, and then we'll move on to the next subject next week.  Take care, guys. ",
