            "text": "Let's talk about hunting, specifically hunting stags and rabbits.  Now you might think that's a very strange example, but it's an example given by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality.  In the second discourse, he talks about this problem as paradigmatic of the problem of social evolution and societal cooperation.  The basic idea is this.  Two hunters decide to go out hunting.  They can either hunt for a stag, which requires the cooperation of both, or they can go after a rabbit, something they could catch on their own.  Well, the payoff for getting a stag is much greater than the payoff for getting a rabbit.  A rabbit might feed one or two people, but a stag, well, that could feed maybe the whole village.  So, the stag is a significantly bigger game to hunt, and it's harder, it requires cooperation, but on the other hand, it feeds a group for a long period of time.  So, there's a real advantage to doing that.  Well, let's think about these two hunters.  Again, let's imagine that there's me and there's you as our two players here in the game, and we've each got two options.  Our options are to hunt stag or to hunt the hare.  Once again, I'm going to represent the outcome matrix here with ordinals rather than cardinals simply because how much the stag is worth compared to the hare and so on.  Let's not get into the cardinal values that might indicate that.  Let's just think about what's my first choice, what's your first choice, and so on.  So, if I think about this, I think, well, all right, my first choice is to get that stag.  And let's say we can get it or at least have a really good chance of getting it if we work together.  So, my first choice is that we work together and get the stag.  Now, what happens if I hunt the hare and you hunt the stag?  or you hunt the hare and I'm hunting the stag?  That's really dangerous for me, right, because then I'm going to bring home nothing.  If I'm hunting the stag while you're hunting the hare, I am doomed to failure.  I'm going to get nothing.  You at least get the rabbit.  And so, that's my last choice.  I'm basically guaranteed to get nothing out of that.  Well, suppose I decide to hunt hare.  Then, in a certain sense, it doesn't even matter to me whether you're off hunting a hare or whether you're hunting the stag.  You might think I'm a little better off maybe if I'm hunting the hare while you're hunting the stag.  After all, then, I've got the hare hunting to my own.  Here, we've got two of them.  supply of rabbits, and maybe that disadvantages us.  So, in this case, we'll say, yeah, my second choice is that I just go after the hare while you hunt the stag.  That means my third choice is, well, we're each just hunting rabbits.  Of course, we switch around and look at this from your point of view, and it's pretty much the same.  You say my first choice is to get that stag, so I'd like to do that.  My second choice is that you go off hunting or that I go off hunting the stag while you hunt the hare.  That's your second choice.  But then you say, well, my third choice is that we each hunt hare.  But then your worst option is really if you go hunting the stag and I'm hunting rabbits because then you're guaranteed to fail.  So, we get those ordinal preferences.  Well, let's think, as we did last time, about each person and where they're better off.  I look at this and I say, well, all right, I can't control what you do.  But if you hunt stag, I get either my first choice or my second choice, depending on my selection of hunting a stag or hunting the hare.  Well, I prefer my first choice, so I prefer that option to this option.  Now, over here, on the other hand, I get my worst option.  If I'm hunting the stag while you're hunting the hare, But I get my third if I'm hunting the hare and you are too.  So I definitely prefer my third choice to my fourth choice.  I'd rather have a pretty good chance of getting a rabbit than have no chance at all.  I'd rather have a pretty good chance of getting a rabbit than no chance at all of getting either a rabbit or a stag.  Now let's look at it from your point of view.  You are thinking, well, I can't control what that crazy bottleneck does.  But you're thinking, I can hunt stag or I can hunt hare.  So, I can choose one or the other of these.  So, let's say I go hunting stag.  Then you think, well, I've got a choice between my first and second options.  I prefer my first.  But then suppose I go off hunting wabbits.  Well, then you've got a choice between your fourth and third.  You definitely prefer the third.  Now, let's combine those.  Think about what that means about what's likely to happen.  I don't have a dominant strategy.  Notice that this arrow points up, this one points down.  That tells me, well, what's best for me depends on what you do.  If you're going to hunt stag, I should hunt stag.  If you're going to hunt the hare, I should hunt the hare.  And you look at it and you think the same thing.  These arrows go in opposite direction.  If I'm hunting stag, you should too.  But if I'm hunting rabbits, you should too.  And so, we trace again the arrows to see where they end, and they end here and here.  So, both of those are Nash equilibrium.  We've got one Nash equilibrium here and a second one here.  This yields the larger payoff.  On the other hand, it's a bit risky because if I commit to this and then you don't go along, ooh, I get my worst option.  So, this is riskier, but it is more rewarding.  This is much less risky, but on the other hand, not nearly as rewarding.  Why do I say less risky?  Well, partly because notice what happens if you're doing the other thing.  In this case, I actually end up a little better off.  You look at this and you think, yeah, if you choose to hunt this tag, then actually my odds of getting a buddy rabbit improve.  So, if I go for rabbits, that's not really risky at all.  I don't really, in fact, I'm a little better off if you do the other thing that I'm expecting you to do.  And notice that in either case, I can't unilaterally improve my situation.  I can't improve my situation by taking the other option here, nor here.  And the same is true for you.  So, these are Nash equilibria.  But notice one of them is much better than the other.  In this case, admittedly riskier for both of us, but nevertheless, that gives both of us our first choice.  That's a great option.  Here, we each get our third choice.  We're both worse off on this option than we are on this option.  But it's a Nash equilibrium and neither of us has a dominant strategy.  So, it's a toss-up which way this is going to go.  Now, notice what happens here.  This one is best.  It has the highest payoff.  It's payoff maximal.  But on the other hand, it's risky.  This one is way less good, but it's also less risky.  And a lot of decisions among people end up being like this.  There's an option that is The one that's most promising offers us the highest reward, but it's also riskier.  It depends on what other people are doing.  We've got to trust them to make a similar choice.  And we might be able to actually reach some kind of agreement with them, but then again, will they keep the agreement?  Now, in this case, if we're keeping the agreement, they have an incentive to keep the agreement, but again, they have to be willing to trust us.  So, what tends to make the difference between these two is, well, a matter of trust.  Is there enough trust?  between the parties to make this work.  If there's not enough trust, they tend to opt for this.  Less good, but on the other hand, a lot less risky.  So, think about all of the ways in which you might find this happening in society or within an organization or in the behavior of the organization itself.  Let's take a simple example and think about countries.  It might be that we all are much better off if we can agree to a certain policy.  less well for all of us if we pursue this alternative policy.  This is best for all of us.  On the other hand, it's risky because if we commit to it and the others don't, we're in trouble.  A good example might be arms control agreements.  They've often been analyzed as prisoner's dilemmas, and indeed in a practical circumstance they can be.  but they can also be stag hunts, because it might turn out that the best option is really that we don't commit to spending a large amount on developing weapons, for example, and neither does our competitor, so we have peace, we have prosperity, because we don't have to spend all that money on defense, and in general, that's the best for everyone.  A situation where we're involved in an arms race involves a significant commitment of resources, for both of us, and so we're less well off under those circumstances.  If that increases the chances of war, of course, then even worse off than that, but let's even forget about that.  Just think about the expenditures required.  Well, why don't we obviously then go for this one?  Well, look what happens if I commit to this, but then you, for example, violate the agreement.  Now, I get my worst choice because I am really defenseless against your greater power.  So, I'm in a position of great danger.  Now, why is this only your second choice?  You gain a real international advantage over me.  But on the other hand, you're having to spend a lot of money to do it.  And so, it might be that you think, yeah, we have an advantage, but still, is it worth spending that much to outmaneuver them in terms of this arms race?  And so an arms race where building up those weapons and building up the military is very expensive and gains a limited international advantage for you can be very much more like a stag hunt than it is like a prisoner's dilemma.  Now if we both just develop weapons, we end up down here.  And that's less risky because neither of us has an advantage really by getting out of this situation.  Moreover, we don't suffer really if the other person doesn't commit.  Let's say we're in this less good situation.  We're both committing a lot of money, and you decide, you know what, I'm not going to do it anymore.  Well, you now lose a position internationally, and so we gain strength relative to you, but we don't have to spend any extra money to do it.  So there's a sense in which there's not much risk here.  We just gain if you decide not to continue with this arms race.  However, here, if we decide not to commit to further arms and you, on the other hand, pursue these weapons, then we are in real danger.  How can this happen within an organization?  Well, here's a way.  Suppose we're thinking about a group project.  In fact, a lot of people have said this explains a lot about group projects.  You and I are supposed to work on this project together.  What's best for both of us is that we both fully commit to this.  Here, hunting the stag is doing our best on this project, putting in hard work on it.  We'll do a good job, and that's our best option.  But now, suppose I actually decide to goof off on the project, put in a half-hearted effort.  Well, that's still pretty good for me.  The report is less good.  On the other hand, you're working hard here.  And still, in the end, the report isn't all that good.  So you're wasting a lot of effort.  That's tough for you.  And you end up saying, yeah, gosh, I wish I hadn't put in that extra effort.  Now, if neither one of us works very hard on it, and we do, a kind of shoddy job.  Well, the result is shoddy, but at least we didn't expend any effort on it.  Here we get the shoddy report, and you worked hard on it.  Here we get the shoddy report, but at least we didn't work very hard on it.  Here, of course, I'm committing, I'm working really hard, but you're not, so the report ends up shoddy, and I had to work hard to do it.  So, what's the result?  Well, it looks very much like this, and there are going to be two Nash equilibria.  One where we both work hard and do a good job on the project.  Here, one where neither of us works very hard, and we end up with a shoddy product.  But still, neither of us put in much effort.  So those end up being the situations.  Now, this one is clearly less good.  We end up with a much worse product.  On the other hand, it's less risky in that we're not at risk of wasting our effort if the other person doesn't go along.  Here, we get the best result, best for the company, best for our careers, and so on.  But on the other hand, it's risky.  If we put in that effort and the other person doesn't, then we're in trouble because we end up with a shoddy product and we did a lot of the work.  It's not only that the work isn't that good and hey, we had to work really hard for it.  Now, the other person could say, well, really, I didn't have time to do it.  So, if it's shoddy, it's all that guy's fault and that causes problems for us.  So, it is risky, which means there's a real temptation to end up here.  Now, we're going to look at other kind of group project situations.  They're not all snag hunts or prisoner's dilemmas, but they easily can be.  And notice what happens in this situation.  If we can trust each other, then we'll both commit to doing our part, we'll do the best job.  But if we can't really trust that the other person is going to be fully committed to this, then we're inclined not to fully commit either.  What's the moral of the story?  In part, the moral is when we don't have a dominant strategy to play, We have to think about, well, where the Nash equilibria are.  And before I said, a nice rule is seek a Nash equilibrium.  But in this case, there are two of them.  And so, since there are multiple Nash equilibria, we have something of a coordination problem.  The stag hunt really is a coordination problem more than it is something like a prisoner's dilemma.  But it's a different kind of coordination problem in our simple driving game.  all chose to drive on the right or drive on the left.  Here it matters whether we hump the stag or hump the hare, whether we fully commit to the relationship.  One outcome is much better than the other, but the better one is riskier.  And there are a lot of things in life that are like that, not just relationships or group projects.  A lot of investments are like that.  A lot of times just seeking success in whatever you're doing is like that.  You have to fully commit, but that's risky.  It might not work out.  You might have wasted all that effort.  And in general, that's the great danger posed by a stag hunt.  If it doesn't work out, if the other person doesn't agree or if nature just doesn't end up conforming to your wishes, you will have wasted a lot of effort.  Now that's better than going to prison for a long time, which is the downside of a prisoner's dilemma.  There, if you commit and the other person doesn't, or reality doesn't conform, well then, you're in real trouble.  You are much worse off.  Here, it's not exactly that you're worse off, but you've risked a lot of effort for no gain, and perhaps even for a loss.  So, the stag hunt is one where you're in danger of well, taking a risk, committing a lot of effort, potentially for no payoff, maybe even being slightly worse off.  And that means that you've got to have trust that the other person is going to fully commit in order to make that justifiable.  If you're thinking of this in terms of nature, like you're working hard on this invention or trying to prove this theorem or whatever it is that you're working on, Well, you hope that that strategy you're pursuing will work, but what if the world doesn't cooperate with you?  Then the world is something like your opponent in this, and you realize, I could be wasting a huge amount of effort.  And sometimes that happens.  People take on a project, they are committed to inventing this project and making it commercially viable, for example, or they're committed to proving this theorem for their dissertation or whatever it is.  And if it doesn't work out, they will have wasted a huge amount of effort, time, and money on a project that in the end doesn't yield any results.  Rather like hunting the sag and finding that in the end you're working on it all by yourself and can't possibly achieve your objective.  So much of life ends up looking like a staghunt problem, where the best outcome is also the riskiest outcome.  And we have to decide whether to go for it or whether to settle. ",
