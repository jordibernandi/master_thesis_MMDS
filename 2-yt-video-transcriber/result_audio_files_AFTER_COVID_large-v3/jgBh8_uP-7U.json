            "text": "Are you serious?  Are you serious?  Guys, I'm very serious.  We've got some breaking news coming out of the Middle East that President Trump has ordered a shift in US military command for the Middle East.  Matter of fact, according to the report, it's gonna include Israel in the United States' military command in the Middle East.  President Trump has ordered the Pentagon to include Israel in the U.S.  military command structure for the Middle East.  The Department of Defense, the DOD, has confirmed today that a major change meant to reflect an easing of tensions between the Israel and several Arab countries.  Now, why does that matter?  Well, let me tell you that in just a second.  But first, I want to make sure you're healthy.  www.agewithpaul.com.  www.agewithpaul.com.  Guys, seriously, Biotrust has put together a great product using turmeric, ageless body.  They've sold over a million bottles of this.  This is awesome.  And they've cut the price 51%.  turmeric has become one of the greatest secret ingredients to the fountain of youth.  why do you think i look so young?  i'm so energy?  are you serious?  it's because of turmeric and of course because the lord is who gives me my strength.  but he also created this great spice called turmeric where and it's really in helping improving.  go get it.  www.  agewithpaul.com.  That's www.agewithpaul.com.  Well, okay.  Thank the good Lord for the joy.  The Lord is our strength.  I'll tell you that.  And a merry heart maketh like a medicine.  Now, There is a shift which comes as President Trump prepares to leave the White House next week.  That's according to The Hill.  This means Israel will be moved from the U.S.  European command to the U.S.  Central command.  CENTCOM, huge shift, which oversees U.S.  military policy involving Arab nations.  Israel, for decades, was grouped with the European countries due to, of course, a lot of M&A.  animosity between Israel and the Arab countries.  but now that Israel has has now put together five covenants of peace and not including Egypt and Jordan that they already had seven nations are now walking in fellowship with Israel.  Trump says hey we just can go ahead and put Israel in our central command in Middle East.  it's okay we're all starting to get along now.  The DOD reviews the Unified Command Plan every two years and reassesses all boundaries and relationships against the operational involvement and environment.  They also structure boundaries to best mitigate risk and to protect the United States' interests and its partners, according to a Pentagon statement released today.  The easing of tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors brought about by the recent Abraham Accords, has provided a strategic opportunity for the United States to align key partners against shared threats in the Middle East, which of course is Iran.  That's right.  And they will open up additional opportunities for cooperation with other countries.  with our other US command partners.  That has been done.  So in the last days, if these are the last days of the President Trump's administration, he is setting the bar as high as you can set it to continue to protect Israel.  While the entire capital was impeaching him the other day and the whole world was watching that fiasco, Trump was helping and assisting the Israelis as they bombed 135 targets against Iranian targets in Syria during the exact same period of time.  the world didn't know because everybody was watching trump being tarred in feathers.  basically trump laid himself on the on an altar to be sacrificed while he was defending the holy city of jerusalem and the united states of america.  this man oh and morocco just gave president trump the highest award that can be given to a foreigner for his exceptional peace efforts to help bring a peace deal between Morocco and Israel.  So now this year, or since September of 2020, President Trump brought together peace accords with Israel, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco, Kosovo, Serbia, And of course, they already had Jordan and Egypt.  There is now eight nations in covenant with Israel.  Are you serious?  They're about ready to build the third temple.  Are you saved?  Give your life to Jesus Christ.  We're running out of time. ",
