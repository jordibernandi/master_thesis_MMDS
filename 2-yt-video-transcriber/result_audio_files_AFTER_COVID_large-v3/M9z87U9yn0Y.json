And that means there's probably some more important things for y'all to do with your money than to give it to us to get bonus episodes, right?  So, for the duration of the protests for George Floyd and against police brutality... You can donate to any of the charities listed below and send us the receipt via Twitter, DM, or email, and we'll send you the link to the bonus episodes instead of you all having to donate to our Patreon, right?  Those are mostly like bail funds and stuff like that.  Now, that link will be to all the bonus episodes, and it'll work forever, right?  That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me.  Anyway, on to the bonus episode preview. ",

Yeah, love you too.  OK, so, we have a picture of Communism Grandpa on the screen, and we have some very nice, very early... Yeah, that's just Roz, like, four days ago.  Yeah, that's true.  It's like two-thirds of the podcast.  Okay, so, why build skyscrapers in the first place?  Well, we're out of the primitive accumulation of capital, which is All of the stuff that we've been talking about, where, like, the pharaoh makes you build something, or the pope makes you build something, or the king makes you build something, or the, like, medicis make you build something, and we're into capitalism, where you have a capitalist class, right?  that's controlling the means of production and is defining classes differently, which means you create this kind of expanding middle class of clerks and stuff who work in an office instead of hitting things with a hammer, and they have to work somewhere.  What if you put them all in one building?  And I'll point out, at this point, that the home insurance building, that first one that we saw, their starting occupancy was 96%, and it was almost all... Wow.  Yeah, almost all.  Like, they built this thing, and they sold the office space immediately.  And it was filled with firms who were doing relatively new, speculative business on the back of this economy that had not existed a hundred years earlier, of doing things like arbitrage, or doing things like insurance at a scale that hadn't been possible.  When we talk at some point about the San Francisco earthquake, I'm going to have to talk about Lloyd's of London essentially inventing the modern insurance industry, because that's what happened.  And, in fact, the San Francisco earthquake is a fantastic lead-in to the other reason why skyscrapers, which is that, like... The American city pre-Skyscraper is incredibly susceptible to all kinds of shit, most notably burning down.  Like, Chicago, New York, Boston, not sure if Philly or not, but like... ",

After your city burns to the ground, you rebuild it, but because you're living in the 1870s, you have your stovepipe hat on, you start getting utopian notions about steamships and shit.  And so you're just like, ah, no, let's... All of this has been raised for us, which means it's a blank canvas, which means we can do rational, orderly... grid street networks.  We don't build in wood anymore, that's illegal because it'll burn down.  We're gonna build this holistic city.  But at the same time, you also have incredibly small parcels of land, because, like, geography.  Manhattan's not a big place.  Or you have confused ownership rights, because everybody's been screwing everybody on rents and tenancies for the last hundred years.  So you end up with these tiny, tiny lots.  So you just buy as many of them in secret as you could, and then you just build this steel-framed box on it, and you use it to house this new class of white-collar workers.  And you'll notice, like, And you can see a difference between the left skyscraper and the right skyscraper, in that they start being boxes, and then they become boxes on boxes, and then you start adding ornaments, and it starts becoming a symbol of status, because you can say, you know, this is the Standard Oil business, or this is the Standard Oil building, or this is the Vanderbilt building, or whatever, you can put your name on it.
