            "text": "Hello everyone.  Okay.  Here's message number two.  So 2020 was a massive awakening for a lot of us.  One of the aspects of that awakening was realizing that there are people in power and people that we have looked up to, whether it's in the medical community, the political community, the entertainment community, but we've recognized and we're beginning to recognize more and more as we awaken that we've been lied to, that we've been manipulated, that we've been controlled.  What's gonna happen in 2021, it's happening right now and it's gonna continue to happen, is more and more humans that are unaware of this or not awakened to this yet will begin to awaken to it based on external experiences that are gonna happen that are going to finally be that sort of line where they're going to say, I got it.  I got it now.  2020 wasn't that.  I got it moment for them.  2020 was that I got it moment for millions.  And some of us were awakened and had that.  I got it now moment years ago.  It doesn't matter.  What's happening is the human collective's awakening.  They're stepping out of the conditioned, programmed, zombie-like state that we've been in for a very long time.  And I also want to state that there's nothing wrong with this.  There's nothing bad or wrong around being manipulated, controlled in a zombie state, tied to a matrix.  It is what you agreed to when you came into human form.  You were acutely aware of this experience.  So there's actually nothing bad or wrong about it.  It's a beautiful divine design that we are stepping out of.  It's called the evolution in human consciousness.  So we are going, The evolution of consciousness is going to require more humans to wake up, which is going to require more humans to look outside and say, OMG, I've been lied to by my government.  I've been manipulated by the media.  I've been lied to and manipulated by all kinds of communities.  individuals that I thought had my best interest at hand.  This is very difficult for humans to hold.  There's a lot of cognitive dissonance around this, but because it is very challenging to hold the notion, the truth, that people in power, people you have looked up to, people that are super famous, whatever it may be, that they don't have your best interests at hand, that there's actually an agenda behind the actions that are taking place.  And there is an agenda.  It's a very small group of individuals on the earth plane, all over the earth, that have been controlling and manipulating the human.  More and more humans are going to wake up to this.  And you don't have to hold it as your reality until it becomes your reality and it may never become your reality.  But the beautiful piece about this is that just to begin to realize whether you're awake to it or not awake, whether you think I'm crazy or you think that I'm correct, whatever your belief is, there's nothing wrong with what is unraveling.  That is how we evolve an entire human collective's consciousness.  And whether you're capable of holding this right now or not, there is consciousnesses in this collective that we've experienced as fear, manipulation, control, greed, lack.  These are consciousnesses that we're dismantling.  And there are systems that are playing in these consciousnesses and that have used these consciousnesses to control humanity for a very long time.  There's nothing weird about that.  There's nothing unique about that.  There shouldn't be any sort of like shock about that.  It's consciousnesses that we've been playing in for a very long time.  Now we just have to break it down, which means we have to see it.  We have to be like, oh, the only way you break something down is that you acknowledge it, you see it, you feel it.  To acknowledge, see, and feel that people in power that you thought had your best interests at hand have been lying to you for their own benefit is very difficult.  For instance, there is a narrative around the COVID virus that it's This pandemic.  that's literally like sweeping the nation or sweeping the world and killing all these people.  Sure, it's killed a lot and we have to honor what has occurred and really have compassion and empathy for what has happened.  But the death rate, at least in the United States, is the lowest it's been in 10 years.  The flu, there is no flu right now.  If you go look at the CDC, there's very few flu.  The flu season is like, there isn't enough.  What happened to the flu season?  No one has the flu anymore.  And there's a 99.4 to 99.9% chance of surviving COVID if you get it.  99.4 to 99.7.  I mean to 99.9.  Those are facts.  So that's a narrative that we could be using.  We could be talking about this in the media.  We meaning the media, the mainstream media, could be talking about the fact that 99.4 to 99.9% of humans will survive COVID.  That the death rate is down lower than it's been in 10 years, right?  We could be increasing human's energetic fields by creating optimism, hope, et cetera.  But instead what the media is doing is creating fear.  And the reason it creates fear is it can control you.  So why are we using a narrative?  Why is the mainstream media and the political system and all these other systems, why are they using a narrative that doesn't talk about the positives, i.e.  99.4 to 99.9% survival rate.  I'm not saying people don't pass from COVID.  People pass from the flu.  People pass from a lot of things.  But what I'm saying is why is the mainstream media choosing a narrative creating fear in your body when they could easily use this other narrative?  And the reason is because we have to see over and over and over and over again, a billion times over perhaps, fear consciousness in order to step out of it.  It's repetitive.  It's over and over and over and over like a record player until the human finally says, wait a second, something doesn't seem right here.  You have to break cognitive dissonance.  The human has to break cognitive dissonance.  You have to break out of the brainwashing and the mind control, which believe me, I've been in it.  It is intense.  And the cognitive dissonance is what pulls you back into it.  Because as you step out and you start to say to yourself, well, maybe this is true.  Maybe there is something to this.  Then you start to say, there's no way that person would lie to me.  There's no way they would lie to the human collective.  You're going to see more and more stories come out that that is actually true, that there is a lot of lying and manipulation and there has been for a very long time.  And we will be very shocked as this stuff starts to unravel.  2021 is all about disclosure.  It's all about peeling back the layers and looking at what's behind the curtain.  And cognitive dissonance is gonna get super loud.  Thank goodness it does because it allows the human to begin to snap out of the mind control, pull themselves out of that matrix and say, hold on a second, maybe I've been lied to.  There is nothing wrong with being lied to.  There's nothing wrong with looking at it.  There's nothing wrong with acknowledging it.  It's just challenging.  It's shocking.  But this is how we shift an entire human collective.  This is how we evolve.  So it's going to get more crazy out there for the sole purpose of waking more humans up, snapping them out of it.  Because we all have a line that we hit.  And if we cross that line, that's when we wake up, right?  For many of us, it was COVID, it was masks, it was shutting down your businesses and never opening them back up.  It was not being able to see your family members when they were passing in the hospital.  I mean, there's so many stories.  that was that line for the human where once they crossed it, they woke up, something isn't right.  something isn't right.  how many times have we heard that?  last year right?  so this year even more more humans are going to hit their line and snap and wake up and a lot of that line is the disclosure is the holy cow i've been lied to.  and then you settle in to what you've been in and you start to navigate and rock this new reality that you're about to walk into.  So if you are awake and you've recognized all this for a while, have compassion for those that haven't.  If you're not awake and you think us that are speaking like this are crazy, have compassion for us.  We're all on the same playing field.  We're all navigating the same thing.  There's no right or wrong.  There's just different states of consciousness.  There's different states of awareness.  That's it.  That's all there is.  Having compassion for the other person's experience is going to allow all of us to be able to get through this easier.  But it's all going to break down.  It's all going to break down.  The consciousness of fear, the consciousness of control, the consciousness of manipulation, greed, all of that, it's going to break down.  It already has, it already is, it's going to continue to.  Only for the sole purpose of allowing more humans to step out of it so that we can raise the collective's consciousness.  Here we go.  Love you so much.  Thanks for being here with me.  Bye. ",
