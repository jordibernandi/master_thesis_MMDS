It's gonna be an amazing show today because of this guy, John Kwasinski, is my very special guest.  Very, very exciting.  Some other exciting news, last week I did an interview with a woman, Dr.  Lori Santos, and she is the teacher of happiness at Yale University, the most popular class in the history of Yale University.  But some of the statistics she was throwing around were really mind blowing.  It was about three blessings that if you are grateful every day and you just jot down three things that you're grateful for, that your happiness levels go up drastically.  So what Dr.  Laurie Santos was talking about was that if our happiness levels go up by 15% by simply making this list every day, simply writing down three things you're grateful for, ",

Like if you just sit down and you look at the, just the raw hard data or data, is it data or data?  I still don't know how to pronounce it.  I'm in my 50s.  It is mind-blowing how gratitude works in correlation to happiness.  So remember, writing this down, 15% increase in happiness by writing down three gratitudes a day, sharing it with someone, giving a call, saying, hey, I'm super grateful for you, Grandma, Dad.  John Krasinski, whoever it is, if you're able to do that, your happiness levels will stay up for over a month.  It's really unbelievable.  So that's what I wanted to share with you.

Full stop.  And you're like, whoa, right.  Because of course, as a small person, you think this is it.  Right.  You know, and so that I, you know, both my girls, I think, are still working through that idea of, yeah, yeah, we keep telling them that you're going to see your friends at some point.  And they're like, yeah.  And so they're just.  they're still trying to figure it out.  And I think that, you know, again, it just shows the superpower of human interaction and like direct communication and hugs, hugs, man.  I mean, hugs have become something that my girls talk about a lot.  They keep saying, I can't wait to hug my friend.  And I can't.

I was just talking to my brother about this, that I really think about the kids, especially in high school, you know, Walter's age, who have lived enough life experience to know that this is very weird and, you know, that this is a new program and that we're bearing down and having to pull from somewhere deeper.  And That's a pretty massive thing.  You know, it's once in a few generations that the entire world is called upon to do something together.  So I'm thinking of him and I hope that he sees that there is something.  And I'm sure all kids in high school and college are like, whatever.

I know I've told the story before, but I have a DVD that one of the guys at NBC very sweetly made me.  Jeff Engel back then was an executive who came down every Friday.  Yeah.

How about that?  so nice.  uh what a great guy.  wish him all the best.  he's doing such great stuff out there.  putting such great stuff into the world was a sincere pleasure.  working with him for nine years i always said like he in my head i was like oh my god this guy's gonna be a brilliant writer director because he would always have ideas on scenes and he would always kind of lean over and whisper like hey what if you did?  and then like this and like and he would give me these notes and They helped make Dwight so much better.  The notes I got from John Krasinski made Dwight at least 14% better and funnier through the years.  And now he's writing and directing, which is awesome.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for tuning in to Hey There, Human.  Thank you to John Krasinski.  Stay human, you guys. ",
