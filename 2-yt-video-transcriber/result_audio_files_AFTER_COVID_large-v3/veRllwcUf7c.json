            "text": "Hello, friends.  We're in the last week prior to the elections, I believe a very critical time in American history.  I begin today's storyline with this quote from Abraham Kuyper.  When principles that run against your deepest convictions begin to win the day, then battle is your calling.  Today I have written a response to John Piper, Reverend.  John Piper, one of the great men of God in America.  A man to be greatly honored.  His love for God has affected millions.  His books.  But today I lay my convictions before friend and foe.  Because I believe they run against what is actually the biblical understanding of what is taking place in this election right now.  I write.  Recently, well-known pastor John Piper wrote an article saying that he probably can't vote for President Trump because he perceives the president to be morally unqualified for the position.  My response is I suppose Piper would not have voted for Cyrus or Jehu either.  But God had another idea.  He called them his anointed.  They were anointed to fulfill God's purpose at a specific moment of time.  Daniel 4 verse 17 states that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he wills and sets over it the basis of men.  What a statement.  He rules over the kingdoms of men and puts over those kingdoms even the basest of men.  In other words, God is not always making character the foundation of his appointments of those in authority, though without a doubt it is of high importance.  He sets leaders up, even the basest, for his divine sovereign purposes to go forward.  Piper went on to state that in his subjective opinion, Donald Trump's base life, his unrepentant sins and vulgarity, are bringing more death to this nation than legalized abortion.  Frankly, I don't know how John Piper could scripturally support such a statement.  But I do know this, William Wilberforce, the great parliamentarian who ended the slave trade in England, of whom Reverend Piper wrote a brilliant brief biography, once said, there is a principle above everything that is political.  And when I reflect on the command, thou shalt do no murder, believing the authority to be divine, how can I dare to set out any reasoning of my own against it?  It is one thing to write a biography of praise about a man, but it is duplicitous to not honor his code of faith.  In other words, William Wilberforce made Thou Shalt Not Kill the highest premise over every subjective opinion and thought process.  I believe that John Piper has raised up his own subjective reasoning over the most foundational divine command in Scripture.  He who sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God he made man.  It seems obvious to me that Reverend Piper has not yet been staggered by the terrifying implications both for individuals and nations laid out in the scriptures concerning the doctrine of the shedding of innocent blood.  By encouraging thousands of Christians to consider not voting, or even worse, make way for a candidate who supports abortion up to nine months.  John Piper and those in agreement with him are like the four members of parliament in William Wilberforce Day, who, when the slave trade could have been ended years earlier by their votes, instead opted out of voting and went to an opera.  How much death, torture, and human agony could have been averted?  If now in his providence, God is seeking to remove this horrifying offense of abortion as he did with slavery, then over the next four years, President Trump could be a Lincoln-type president, and the legalized slave trade of abortion could be no more.  Or America could face a terrifying day of reckoning.  If 650,000 men died on the Civil War battlefields because of the offense and bloodshed of slavery, as President Lincoln understood it to be, what will that day of reckoning be for the blood of 62 million babies, unborn babies, killed and crying out from the ground for judgment?  I believe Reverend Piper is only judging by what his eyes see and cannot recognize what God is pressing for in this pregnant, throbbing moment.  The ending of state-sanctioned murder of the innocents.  It has been said that God is not a single-issue voter, but sometimes he is a single-issue judge.  Many issues faced America during the Civil War, but God was trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored to judge one thing, the vile atrocity of American slavery.  So meanwhile, in this election, non-voters, enjoy the opera.  while the slave trade of abortion languishes another 20 years or more, and we and our children are swept away in the day of reckoning.  Blood is on our hands.  If the great men of the church don't get the surpassing evil of the abortion holocaust, comparing it to the character of a man, then maybe the great women of the church will.  Let the Deborahs and Esther's arise and may the sons of Issachar rally to their side.  Thank you. ",
