            "text": "The most delicate thing you own is your heart.  God has created your heart to be so tender that it will fall in love so very easily.  So every time you enter into a relationship this happens.  Every time you make a memory with someone this happens.  Every time you laugh cry, sing, dance, kiss someone else, this starts to happen to your heart.  And then one day, if you're fortunate, you'll walk down an aisle and you'll look at your future husband, your future wife, and you'll give them the most precious gift you own.  you'll give them your heart.  So my question to you is, do you want to give them a full heart or are you quite contented to just give them a piece of your heart?  And that is why we should never ever be casual about dating.  Your non-Christian friends, they might say it's only a date, it's only a kiss, but actually no, the Bible says do not awaken love until it is ready.  So here are five warning signs, five red flags that God might be protecting you from a bad relationship.  Number one, they are a flirt.  Now, perhaps I'm wrong about this, so I'm going to ask for your opinion now.  You tell me, do you think there is ever such a thing as innocent flirting?  Over to you.  Personally, I don't think there ever is.  You see, when we flirt, we give the person we're flirting with the impression that we're attracted to them.  So as we said earlier, the heart, which is so delicate, it begins to open up.  And we give that person a false hope that we're interested in them.  If the person you know, the person you're interested in, if they really do enjoy getting attention off the opposite sex, I'm saying just be very, very careful.  Because everything in our life grows.  Whatever we harbour in our hearts, it will grow into something bigger.  And that flirting can often grow into something much, much bigger.  that can lead to cheating and adultery in marriage further down the line.  Let me let you into a secret.  Some of my closest friends don't agree with me on this matter, but I'm going to say it anyway because I believe the Lord has placed this on my heart.  I personally don't think it is a good idea for a man to be close friends with a woman who he is not in a relationship with.  I just think you're opening up the heart to many different issues.  Perhaps you disagree with me on this one, but it is interesting that Billy Graham, the evangelist, he promised, he vowed that he would never ever be caught spending any time alone with another woman other than his wife.  And in an era where there were so many scandals with evangelists, with famous preachers, to this day, Billy Graham still has a clean name.  And so I try to live like that.  And I perhaps would like to suggest to you that you are only seen alone with the person that you would desire.  to be with for the rest of your life.  Red flag number two is sometimes God will reveal to you that this person actually has a nastier side to them.  They're abusive or they're aggressive.  I can assure you of one thing, the most unhappy marriages are the marriages that are filled with point scoring, with arguments and with aggression.  The Apostle Peter was not playing games when he wrote this.  Do not let your adornment be merely outward, arranging the hair, wearing gold or putting on fine apparel.  Rather, let it be the hidden person of the heart with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.  Now, let me tell you something.  It is important to be physically attracted to the person you're going to marry.  I'm very physically attracted to my wife, if I'm being completely honest with you right now.  But at the same time, please, please, please listen to me.  It doesn't matter how many preachers you will hear say, looks are not the most important thing.  Some of you will ignore this piece of advice.  And you will just be led with your eyes and with your lust, dare I say.  And you'll run into a marriage and you'll marry a person who does not have the godly traits.  You see, the most beautiful marriages are the marriages which are clothed with gentleness.  Those are the marriages which God blesses.  And I'll tell you something, if you marry an angry or abusive man or an angry or abusive woman, when they're getting angry and those frown lines start to deepen and deepen, suddenly they won't look as attractive as they once did.  So if God does show you a glimpse of what this person really is like, remember once the dating mask is revealed and you enter into a church and you marry that person, it's only going to get worse and worse and worse.  So think very, very wisely whether this is a person you could live for the rest of your life with.  And really, that leads us on to red flag number three, if they don't fear God.  Can I tell you something, men?  If you find a woman who fears God, you need to put a ring on that finger straight away.  The Bible says this, charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord... she shall be praised.  Before Emma and I got married we chose a couple, an elderly couple who were very, very dear to us.  It was a pastor and his wife and they told us their story of how they fell in love.  They went to Bible college when they were like 18 or 19 years old and every night they would kneel down and they'd pray together.  and the man actually said, I fell in love with my wife when I heard her pray.  Isn't that beautiful?  And I'll tell you something, when I look at marriages around me, I still cannot think of a more beautiful marriage than that couple I'm telling you about right now.  But on the flip side, however, I've also got another friend and he's been single for a long, long time.  And I remember once we were on a mission together and he looked at me and he said, Joe, your wife must know some other younger Christian women that I might be able to marry perhaps.  I mean, just tell her they only have to be half a Christian.  They don't even have to be a full Christian.  And we might kind of laugh at that but there are actually quite a few people who I think think like that on a subconscious level.  as long as they just say they're a Christian as long as they sort of read their bible once every couple of months they'll do.  I'm just so desperate to get married.  But really, there is nothing, as I said earlier, there is nothing more important than who you decide to marry.  But hey now, let's just be honest with one another.  If you did want to marry a half-baked Christian, it wouldn't be hard to find.  Just go into one of our churches.  There's a sort of social Christianity that has spread through the church.  Where we have Christians who they've grown up in the church.  They love the community.  They love the morals, the values that Christians have.  But they don't love the Christ who saved those who bear the name of Christ and call themselves Christians.  You know, the Savior did tell a very, very shocking story about this farmer's field.  And it was filled with wheat.  But alongside the wheat grew these tares.  And what was interesting is the tares looked exactly the same as the wheat.  They were identical and you couldn't tell the difference.  And then Jesus goes on to say that the harvest will come and the wheat will be gathered and put into barns.  but the tears will be plucked up and put into an unquenchable fire.  And that story is a picture of the church.  Because in the pew next to you are people who might not even know the Lord Jesus Christ.  Okay, they're identical to you, they say the right things, but at the very heart, at the very epicenter, there is no repentance and there is no love for the Saviour who died for sinners.  okay so here's the answer you all want to know.  tell us joe how do we know if this person is actually a true born again believer?  well it's very very simple.  jesus also said this once out of the abundance of the heart so the mouth speaks.  so what you and i have to do is listen very very carefully to their conversations.  do they love to speak about the lord jesus christ?  if you talk about the savior do their eyes light up or do they glaze over?  When you want to read the Bible or pray with them, do they get excited or do they try and change the subject?  Because you want someone who has the same passion that you have for the Lord Jesus Christ.  And maybe you're listening to this now and as I'm preaching it, I myself am getting quite challenged in my own spirit thinking, do I often speak of the Saviour?  Well we all need to make sure that we get that heart of repentance, we keep turning back to the Lord God, we keep believing on the Gospel, keep believing on the Saviour and turning to Him.  Red flag number four.  Sometimes your friends or your family members might be very very concerned that this person isn't the right person for you at all.  William Shakespeare once said, love is blind.  And for those of you who've ever been in love, you know exactly what Shakespeare meant.  You often don't see anything but the good in that person.  And that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world.  But sometimes our friends and our family members might see things which we've totally missed.  But at the same time, remember this, sometimes friends and family members, they might be jealous.  Or sometimes there might be mothers who are so protective of their children that no one in the world is good enough for them.  Okay, so take all of that into your mind and then let me take you to a man called Samson.  Samson in the Bible fell in love with an unbeliever, a Philistine woman.  And his parents severely warned him not to marry this woman.  This is what they said.  Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren or among my people that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?  But Samson ignored them.  He went his own way and he kept running after these Philistine women all the way through his life.  until eventually it led to his death because he was so proud that he would not listen to the voice of his parents.  But let me give you something else to think about.  Not only are we to listen to what our parents say, we're also to listen to what their parents say.  This person you're interested in, do they respect their mum and their dad?  How do they treat their friends?  Are they always gossiping and stabbing them in the back?  or do they love them and they're loyal?  because remember this how they treat the people who are closest to them is how they will one day treat you.  and lastly red flag number five which really is aimed at my fellow christian men is an unwillingness to work.  proverbs 24 verse 27 says this prepare your outside work make it fit for yourself in the field and afterwards build your house.  So what does that verse mean, Joe?  Well, I think it means this.  You've got this idea of here are these farmers and their livelihood is their crops.  They're working hard in their fields and they're planting many, many seeds and they know the harvest is coming.  They know that soon they'll have food on the table.  So once the field is sorted out, then they can go in and they can build their home and have a family.  The Bible also says this, if a man will not work, he shall not eat.  And if there's a man that you've got your eyes set on, ladies, and he's not willing to work, and if you're a man listening to this right now, and you love playing on video games all day, you can't get up at a reasonable time, you're lazy, you don't have any responsibilities, How can the good Lord give you the biggest responsibility, a daughter of Christ?  Now, men, before you hang your head in shame and feel totally embarrassed, let me tell you something embarrassing about myself.  I've got to fess up and be totally truthful with you right now.  I, when I proposed to Emma, didn't have a job.  And the Lord, in his mercy, provided a job within a week.  My old boss, the former employer that I worked for, she rang me up and said, Joe, would you come back and work for us?  And I said, of course I will.  I've just got engaged.  and I need money so that I can get married and the Lord provided in that way.  So don't panic too much.  I'm just saying to you that we all need to make sure that we take these responsibilities seriously and remember it is a total privilege to be in a relationship.  It is a total privilege to get married and to become one with another person.  If you've got one more moment, would you mind just listening to this?  As a Christian YouTuber there are certain videos that really do matter to you and that the Lord particularly lays a message on your heart and you want it to reach as many people.  One of them is this video right here all about saving yourself for marriage and I prayed to the Lord, Lord would you let one million people watch this video saved and unsaved?  I want the world to hear this message and in his mercy He really did answer that prayer.  So if you've not seen it, please go and watch it now.  And if you haven't yet subscribed, please do consider subscribing.  We'd love your friendship here at Off The Curb Ministries.  God bless you all and thank you for watching. ",
