            "text": "This is a pandemic.  I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.  All you had to do is look at other countries.  Stranded in my bedroom.  No one to love.  Then there he is.  Let us give you an update as to where we are today.  My favorite guy.  He's the earth and heaven to your giant deep within.  Honey, we can see right through you.  Andy, can't you see I'm in quarantine?  A nervous wreck and skirt as heck.  Of COVID-19.  But not nice coronavirus.  You bring hope when I can't cope.

And whatever you decide to be once this whole thing blows over, whether it's governor of New York or president of the United States or ABC's next bachelor, I'm with you now, Andy, only you.  Even as I continue to light a candle, get naked, and pray every night for the speedy recovery of your brother, my first love, Chris, with his tight, wet T-shirts and his sweaty Instagram workout videos and his big, muscular.
