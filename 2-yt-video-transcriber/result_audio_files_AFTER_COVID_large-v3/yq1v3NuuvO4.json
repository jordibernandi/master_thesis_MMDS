Exodus 26 and 1.  Hold on one second, brother, because I don't want to give you my words.  I want to give it to you straight out of the scriptures.  Exodus 26 and 1.  And then hold on.  You ain't got a word about holding on to that.  I'm going to bring that out later.  The book of Exodus chapter 26 and verse 1.  So this is the explanation of the colors.  Read.  Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple and scarlet.  You hear that?  Blue, purple, and scarlet.  Now remember like we said in the beginning, everything we say and we're doing, word or deed, we do all in the name of Mashiach Yahushua.  So that's what we're doing.  What we do is because it was done in the scriptures.  We follow after the law, statutes, and commandments and after our customs.  That we were given by our forefathers way back in the day.  So that's the reason why we wear these colors.  It's biblical.  Okay?  What's your next question?  All white people are wicked.  Every last one of them.  Every last one of them.  All of them are wicked.  From the oldest to the youngest.  Straight up out the womb.  They're all wicked.  Matter of fact, let me get Sarat 12 and 10.  We're going to prove it to you out of the scriptures, okay?  Your best friend is going to have you killed.  You better be careful.  Stay away from the devil.  Stay away from the devil.  Bring that out.  Book of Psalms chapter 58 and verse 3.  The wicked are estranged from the womb.  The Bible say the wicked are estranged from the womb.  Read.  They go astray as soon as they are born.  As soon as they are born they are telling lies.  They go away.  They go towards evil.  Read.  Speaking lies.  They speak lies.  They speak lies from day one.  I see the video of a little white girl that ate ice cream and her mama asked her who ate it.  She said a black man.  Black man in England.  And this girl wasn't even two.  In England, yeah.  She was lying from the womb, right?  Go to, yeah, bring that up.  May I say something?  Come on.  One second.  The book is all right.  Chapter 12 and verse 10.  Right.  Never trust thy enemy.  Sometimes.  Never trust thy enemy.  Read.  For like iron rusted, so is his wickedness.  So, Mr.  White Man, you are our enemy.  You've been our enemy since y'all brought us over here.  Go ahead.  Say something.  Hold on, brother.  I hope that's not your best friend, but you can stay right there.  I can hear you.  You don't need to take your shirt.  You can do what you want to do, but I don't want to see that.  Okay.  Where's that in the scriptures?  I'm Roman Catholic.  Is this your Jesus?  Yeah.  All right.  Revelation 1 and 14.  So this is Jesus, right?  I'm asking your best friend.  Is this your Jesus?  This is Jesus, right?  No, Jesus is God.  But is this him?  He's invisible.  He's invisible?  Bring that out.  Yeah, go ahead.  Revelation chapter 1 and verse 1.  One second.  So, Mr.  White Man, we're going to explain it to you according to the Bible, or we're not going to give you our own word.  So listen.  He has no color.  Okay, he has no color.  You standing on that?  Yes.  Okay, read that.  The book of Revelation, chapter 1 and verse 1.  The revelation of Jesus Christ.  Okay, so this is the revealing of Jesus Christ, right?  Bring that out.  Go ahead, go back.  Verse 13.  So in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of Man, read.  Similar to this.  Christ had a garment down to his foot, read.  about to pass with a golden girdle.  A golden girdle like this.  Read on.  His head and his hairs were white like wool.  His head and his hair, meaning the hair on his head was white like wool.  Read.  As white as snow.  As white as snow.  Read.  And his eyes were as a flame of fire.  Now this is totally different from invisible because you said he was invisible.  Read on.  And his feet like unto fine brass.  His feet like unto what?  Fine brass.  What color is brass?  What color is grass?  What color is grass?  What color is it, brother?  The grass is brown.  Hold on, hold on.  You can say what you got to say in a second.  Let me prove my point to you, all right?  Hold on, hold on.  You don't run nothing up here.  I run it right now.  We run it.  So listen, listen.  Listen, read it.  As if it burned in a furnace.  As if it did what?  As if it burned in a furnace.  Hey, so Esau's a damn liar.  Because he said Christ was invisible.  He's a liar, just like the scripture said.  Christ was a black, so-called black man from the tribe of Judah.  That's right!  He was a real Jew.  He wasn't damn Jewish.  He didn't have blue eyes.  He wasn't no damn homosexual devil like y'all are.  That's right!  Right?  Okay, so let me get, go back to that, go back to that.  You got another question, Devin?  Jesus has no color.  We just read that he was, he was like grass burned in a furnace.  We just read that out of the Bible.  So should we believe the Bible or you, the devil?  Jesus is not precious.  What?  What?  Let me get, let me get Matthew 15 to 20. ",
