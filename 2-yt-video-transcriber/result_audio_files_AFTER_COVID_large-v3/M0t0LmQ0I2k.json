So all you people who think you can talk to God, before you dial the number to call us, ask God if you should call us.  Because if that was part of God's plan, then I think God's plan is to continue demonstrating that there's no rational reason to think that he exists and that his advocates look like buffoons.  That's got to be God's plan because that's what's happening.  God is punking you.  If God's telling you to call this show, and knows what we're going to say, and knows what we're going to ask, and knows what would convince us, what would change our mind, and what number Drag and I are thinking of.  And God wants you to call in to say that we're just closed to love.  Bullshit.  I love.  I've been loved.  I love lots of people.  I have special loves.  Oh, you're just not open to God's love.  No, no, no.  Those are all post hoc rationalizations.  That's you making up excuses for why you can't do the shit you claim you can do, which is get an answer from God.  oh, well, God, there's nothing that would change your mind.  Well, then that's what you should have said.  If it's true that there's nothing that would change my mind, then when I ask God, hey, what could I say that would change my mind?  And he'd say, nothing.  Hell, that would have been closer to accurate than anything that you spewed forth from your brain. ",
