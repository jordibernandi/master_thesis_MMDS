You should be praising the people that have done a good job, not doing what you do, even that question.  So just so you understand, if we didn't do a job... ",

But I want the men and women of this country that are in danger, the admirals and the generals that have done a job like they've never done before.  They're in war.  We're in war.  You know, I call it the invisible enemy.  That's the war.  And it's a dangerous war.  We're also at a level when you said 40,000 people.  And you're right.  Almost 40,000 people.  And and what how more than OK, good.  Correct me.  Correct me.  Well, I'm really glad you corrected me.  But here's the story.  Let me just say something.  If we didn't do what we did, the 40,000 right now could be a million people.  Could be a million people, not 40,000.  It could be a million.  We're tracking at much less than the lowest possible estimate.  And that's a great tribute to a number of people and a number of things.  One of the things that it's a tribute to is what's taken place in this country with the American people, because they've gone inside, they've done it.  They've done a job that nobody thought was possible.  And, in fact, when they did the models, as they call them, nobody thought it was possible.  They did models not based on this kind of success.  I've seen New York streets, and I see it in the morning.  I've watched all my life New York streets.  And you can't even see the pavement.  There's so many people.  And you take a look this morning.  You take a look even on Friday morning.  I looked at it.  I saw it through a camera.  There wasn't a person on Fifth Avenue.  There wasn't a person on Madison Avenue.  I've never seen anything like it.  because people have really listened to instructions, and they've listened to what we've had to say, and the professionals, they've listened.  And those people should really give them a lot of credit, including people like you, because you just don't have the sense to understand what's going on. ",
