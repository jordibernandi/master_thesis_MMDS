            "text": "NFL.  Ratings are down across the board.  All right, people, you know, even my Jets, who are a pathetic, pathetic football team.  But I've always rooted for them.  They won't come out of the locker room for the national anthem.  I can't root for them.  Not rooting for the Jets this year.  Sorry, Joe.  Joe Namath is a friend of mine.  I'm sorry.  Can't root for him.  Stay in the locker room, all right, because you're pathetic on the field.  So across the board, every football telecast is down, and down big in some cases.  The NFL fined some of the coaches and personnel about a million dollars for not wearing masks on the sidelines.  All right.  Emmys.  Do you care?  Nobody cares.  And this is the indicator that the television entertainment industry is done.  Finished.  You look at what's on television.  It's Dancing with the Swans.  It's the date game.  It's Stranded on the Island with Puff Daddy.  Whatever it is.  Blue Blood is the only show I watch.  All right?  TV is over.  My urchins?  Never watch it.  I mean, they watch specials and Netflix and all that.  But scripted shows?  None.  All right, so the Emmy Awards were Sunday.  You probably didn't even know.  How many people watched?  Six million.  6 million watched.  Last year, 7 million watched.  2010, 10 years ago, 14 million people watched the Emmys.  It's cut in half now.  Does anybody care who won the Emmys?  Do you know?  No, no, no.  Nobody cares.  TV industry, done.  Okay?  Not coming back.  TV news industry will be done after the election, no matter who wins. ",
