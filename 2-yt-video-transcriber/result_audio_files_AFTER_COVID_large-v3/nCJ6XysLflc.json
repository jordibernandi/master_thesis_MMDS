            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, an advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  I've started this video series to help people learn more about what happens in court during sexual assault trials and to better understand the rules of evidence.  My last video talked about the legitimate rape myths, which most countries reject in argument from defense lawyers.  It's important to know and to understand these myths because those lines of argument will be unsuccessful at trial.  Additionally, in Canada, or any country which allows acquittals to be appealed by prosecutors, if any of these myths are employed, it could result in a retrial.  Obviously, that's something to be avoided.  Now this week, I'm going to discuss the more ambiguous rape myths, which aren't necessarily myths.  But before I start, please take a moment to donate to my non-profit, The Lighthouse Project, as all my work is crowdfunded and I count on donations to help me attend court and to work full-time to protect our legal systems from ideological corruption.  Now, in 1991, in Canada, the same verdict which threw out previous rape shield laws set down what are called the twin myths, covered in my last video.  This verdict, referred to as Seaboyer, had a dissenting opinion from Justice Leroy de Bay, which declared a bunch of other things to be myths, which are mostly now treated as forbidden lines of argument or inquiry in court.  There are problems with this list, which I'll get into in full detail, but the quick outline of extra myths is this.  1.  If a woman didn't struggle or say no or fight back, she shouldn't be believed.  2.  That most rape is perpetrated by a stranger, so women aren't believed when the alleged attacker is known to her.  3.  That women are either virtuous or whore-like.  This is actually just a rewording of the twin myths.  4.  Women of bad character who drink, do drugs, or engage in prostitution are responsible for the assault on them or less believable.  5.  That real rape victims will be emotionally hysterical afterwards and display their distress in an obvious way.  6.  That real rape victims will report a rape right after it happens.  7.  That women accuse men of rape out of malice or revenge.  8.  That women claim they were raped to avoid being caught having consensual sex.  9.  That women fabricate rape stories because they fantasize about being raped.  10.  That psychologically normal men don't rape.  There is one more thing commonly called a myth, which is not on the Seaboyer list because it's kind of a combination of items on that list.  And that's that real rape victims will behave in predictable ways consistent with a stereotypical rape victim.  The problem with this list of myths is that legitimate arguments are often blocked as an alleged rape myth when it's actually relevant to an issue at trial.  So let's look at the first one.  I'm going to call this communicated consent.  The law requires that an accused person can show by words or action that the person who alleges rape communicated consent to them to the sexual activity.  Of course, this is very difficult to prove because even if the complainant grabbed the guy by his shirt and said, I want you to fuck me right now, if she's later saying that that didn't happen, you can't prove that it did.  Just as there are rarely any witnesses to prove that a woman was raped, there are rarely any witnesses to prove that she wasn't.  To make this more complicated, people cannot give advance consent, so the accused must show that they continued to obtain active ongoing consent every time a new sexual act was initiated.  But if you actually do that, the judge is unlikely to believe you.  Let's look at the case of three Toronto police officers who were acquitted of raping a woman in their hotel room.  It's the 2017 verdict in Arv vs.  Niznik.  This verdict is incredibly well written and includes a paragraph or two about how useless the hashtag believe all women mantra is in criminal trials.  Justice Molloy is a female judge, and thus less likely to be afraid of being accused of misogyny if she doesn't reach the verdict that angry mobs are expecting.  At paragraph 17, Molloy wrote, Although the slogan Believe the Victim has become popularized of late, it has no place in a criminal trial.  To approach a trial with the assumption that that the complainant is telling the truth is the equivalent of imposing a presumption of guilt on the person accused of sexual assault and then placing a burden on him to prove his innocence.  that is antithetical to the fundamental principles of justice enshrined in our constitution and the values underlying our free and democratic society.  but in terms of affirmative ongoing consent.  at paragraph one twenty six the learned judge said mr nisnik was also careful to provide evidence about each separate variation of sexual contact either being initiated by a b that's the initials given to the complainant or the subject of a specific and explicit spoken request from one of the men, and spoken consent by A.B.  Also, unlikely.  There was no fluidity, nothing seemed to flow naturally, and even the language was stilted.  For example, Mr.  Cabero, Oh, looks like you're having a party.  Can I join you?  Some of this simply did not ring true.  So what we can see is that if men actually engage in the type of consent that they are being taught, a judge will not find their testimony to be credible.  And there's good reason for that.  Quite simply, it's not the way that humans normally engage in sexual activity.  Our laws should not demand that human beings conduct themselves in ways not natural to human beings.  This does not mean that people should be reckless about consent, but it demands a little teamwork between men and women, either to comply with these new rules of engagement or to strike down the expectation in law that they act in ways that they don't naturally do.  Most women do not want a man to ask them if it's okay to kiss them.  They don't want to be asked for consent to remove every single piece of clothing in a separate request.  Most women don't want a man to be afraid of having sex with women.  And we need to let our lawmakers know that.  What we do expect is that if we say no or stop, that the sexual act in progress will cease.  That said, there are times when someone may be too afraid to say no or to say stop, but the reason for that fear should require some establishment.  It is a stereotype to assume that all women are afraid of men and have a default of being unable to say no to a sexual advance.  It is also a demeaning stereotype to say that a man initiating an unwanted kiss causes a woman to freeze up with fear, so overwhelming that she goes into a state of so-called tonic immobility.  Exploring these questions should be permitted in court, without the defense being accused of rape myths.  It should not be a prohibited line of questioning, And if that fear was irrational, we should be permitted to see how an accused person could not have known that the woman was frozen with fear.  I'm going to give you a scenario which we know happens all the time in a consensual encounter.  Imagine a couple who've been dating for a long time, or let's say they're married.  They're having consensual sex when all of a sudden the woman seems to get tense or freezes up.  The partner, who knows her well, observes that change and stops the activity to ask what's wrong.  Maybe the woman says she had some sort of flashback to a time she was abused by someone else.  They then have a discussion about that memory and he seeks to find a way to help her deal with her trauma because he wants to help her heal and he cares about her.  This is something that happens on a regular basis.  But in this scenario, the people knew each other really well.  and were likely sober at the time of the sexual encounter.  But if the person hadn't observed this subtle change in demeanor, the sexual act may have continued, and the woman may later tell her partner that she was really unhappy about it.  At that point, the guy will likely say something like, oh my god, if that ever happens again, please tell me.  This is also a scenario that most of us have experienced or heard of, and it's not rape.  It's a situation in which the person feeling trauma did not express it to the other person.  So now let's think about how the hell someone less familiar with their partner is supposed to know if something goes wrong.  Here's another scenario that we all know happens.  Let's say a woman is very attracted to a man in her friend circle.  She gives him all kinds of signals that she's into him, but he doesn't respond.  The woman finally gives up and assumes that he doesn't like her in that way.  Years later, she finally tells him that she really wanted to sleep with him way back then.  And he expresses disbelief saying, oh my God, I had no idea.  I was totally into you too.  Now this is a lesson on the uselessness of counting on nonverbal communication.  if it happens in one direction where the woman actually wanted sex why should it work any better when she doesn't?  when women fail to say that they want sex is because they're afraid of rejection.  we leave it up to men to risk rejection all the time because frankly they're better taught how to handle it.  the result is that men are more willing to pursue sex when they don't have a clear yes or no.  we've taught them to take risks and women are often very happy when they take that risk of rejection.  So we can't punish men for trying.  Send them to jail for failing to read body language.  So this alleged rape myth that women should fight back or say no if they don't consent, it's only partially a rape myth.  If they didn't say no, we need to know why.  We have to ask that question because if the accused couldn't know that they didn't consent, then he should not be convicted of rape.  And here's the final, more complicated point on how this alleged rape myth plays out in criminal court.  Prosecutors abuse these rape myths all the time.  in the infamous trial of Arr v. Wagar, where the judge, Robin Camp, was thrown off the bench for saying, why didn't you keep your knees together?  Well, in this case, the prosecutor tried to block evidence that the complainant literally told someone that she was about to have sex with Wagar, so that witness left them together in the room.  From this decision, in the retrial where he was acquitted again, Paragraph 52.  As part of her testimony, Skyler Porter states that at some point in the evening of December 13th, she, the accused, Dustin Goodhue, and the complainant were in the bathroom together smoking marijuana, and that during the course of the discussion, out of curiosity, she asked the complainant if she was going to have sex with the accused.  Her testimony was that the complainant answered, yes.  She also testified that shortly thereafter, she and Dustin left the washroom, leaving the complainant and the accused in the bathroom, and 10 to 20 minutes later, the accused and the complainant appeared in the living room, walking hand in hand.  It is during that period of 10 to 20 minutes that the sexual contact occurred.  Now the prosecutor argued that Ms.  Porter didn't know what happened the moment the door closed behind her and that the complainant can't give advance consent.  So here we have as close as we can get to a witness of the actual event.  She left the room because the complainant informed her that she was about to have consensual sex with the accused.  The prosecutor seems to think that Ms.  Porter should have stayed to watch them.  Additionally, this conversation took place right in front of the accused, who would have heard the complainant's answer to the question.  The only conclusion that we, the public, can reach is that the prosecutors are willfully blind to what a human being can know or not know about the contents of a woman's mind.  We were being asked to convict men of rape when they had every reason to believe the woman consented.  A judge got thrown off the bench in this case and publicly humiliated after the prosecutor told him that the accused had to say specific words to obtain proper consent.  He asked her if they teach those words in school.  That was seen as insubordinate and ignorant on the law of consent.  But it was not.  The judge was right.  There are no specific words that need to be said.  Consent can be communicated through words or actions.  And if a woman stops consenting, there should be an obligation for that withdrawal of consent to be communicated in some way.  I declare this so-called rape myth about the requirement to communicate non-consent to be a myth about rape myths.  Defense should absolutely be allowed to make inquiries about how the lack of consent was communicated, and if fear is claimed on behalf of the complainant, they should be allowed to inquire as to whether or not that fear was rational or objectively knowable to the accused.
