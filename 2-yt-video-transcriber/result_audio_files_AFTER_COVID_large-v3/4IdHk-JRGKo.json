What you talking about, Willis?  That's what I say whenever we get here.  It's a great hospital, of course I know.  It's a nasty question.  Do I know the date?  This is the cognitive questions.  Do I know today's date?  Of course I know that.  You know, I'm not just having, I don't have cognitive decline.  I feel like I'm getting stronger.  I have cognitive incline.  That's what they should be calling it.  But do I know the date?  Of course, it's June.  It's June, July, July.  It's July 2020.  We don't want to.  we're not going to get too much more specific.  We don't want the deep state finding out.  But it's July 2020.  Of course, I know the date.  That's a ridiculous sort of absurd question.  And I don't really like the July month.  I don't like it because I don't think, you know, I don't like saying July.  You know, I think they're tough negotiators.  They're great negotiators.  And as you know, my daughter, my great beautiful daughter, Ivanka, converted.  OK, she kept her fingers crossed.  But, you know, for the purpose of great real estate deals, she converted.  And so I don't like saying July.  I would rather call the month July.  Tough negotiators month, okay?  But we're not going to change it.  We're not PC like the left, so we're going to keep it as July.  Can I draw a clock where it's 10 past 11?  I could.  I'm not going to.  You'd like that, wouldn't you?  But I'm not going to.  But yes, for your question, I can do that, of course.  And that reminds me, we had a joke in West Palm Beach.  Who hates 10 past 11?  And the answer was the great Jeff Epstein.  And we always liked that joke.  That was a great joke.  And I got to tell you, can I identify, you're asking, can I identify three animals in the picture?  Yeah.  Immigrant, child, Obama, crooked Hillary.  Oh, that's just the newspaper?  Well, no, I can, of course.  There's, you know, different animals.  Like all of them were on old McDonald's farm.  Remember him?  We love McDonald's.  And can I draw a picture of a cube?  Yes.  And I'm not going to, but yes.  So we're done.  Aced it. ",
