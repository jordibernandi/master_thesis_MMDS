            "text": "No, not nice.  Then they questioned him, saying, Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are to occur?  He said, Look out that you are not misled, for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, I am he, and the due time is near.  Do not go after them.  Furthermore, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must take place first, but the end will not occur immediately.  Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences.  and there will be fearful sights, and from heaven great signs.  I've been reading from Luke 21, verses 7 to 11, and you may have noticed I've been reading from The very latest study edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.  Up-to-date spiritual food, one might say.  So this morning we were woken up by an earthquake and the timing was interesting because obviously we are in lockdown due to the coronavirus.  Yes.  And it's fascinating how at times such as this... your coding sort of overrides, your programming kicks in.  Even though you've been out of the organisation for years, even though you're very well familiar with all of the reasons why you left, there's still a part of you, there's still a part of you that somehow manages to muster a what-if.  What if this is it?  What if I've made a massive mistake by leaving Jehovah's organization.  and now it's all going down?  Coronavirus pandemic, wars in Syria, and now an earthquake on my doorstep.  By the way, there's been no damage where we are.  It seems that the damage has been in Zagreb.  Nonetheless, it was a hairy moment when it struck, the earthquake.  So what do I have to say, I guess, to Jehovah's Witnesses watching this who are thinking, and I know they're out there.  I've heard the anecdotes and the stories from other ex-Jehovah's Witnesses who have been contacted by their relatives who are saying, now do you see, now do you understand that this is real and this is happening?  Are you going to come back?  What do I have to say now?  to Jehovah's Witnesses who are saying, now the joke's on you, Lloyd.  Now the joke's on you, evil apostate.  Well, here's what I have to say.  I want nothing to do with any God who thinks that throwing rocks around and killing men, women and children with a horrendous illness is a suitable way of impressing people.  I want nothing to do with a God who wants to impress people full stop.  But I especially want nothing to do with a God who thinks that the way to solve millennia of misery and death and suffering is to tolerate millennia of misery, death and suffering.  And I especially want nothing to do with a God who sets up this bizarre test whereby in order to be rewarded with surviving the greatest genocide the world will ever have seen, I need to observe the authority of a group of men, a group of bloated old men in New York who are intent on perpetuating abusive policies, who are intent on ripping apart families over ideological differences, who are intent on manipulating people to lay down their lives, who celebrate the death of children like Gerard Sceptre who die refusing blood, who orchestrate the cover-up of child sex abuse on an industrial scale and refuse to put basic policies in place that will protect children.  If God's idea of a purity test, of a worthiness test, involves me putting aside my common sense and my humanity and throwing my support on men like that.  He can have his paradise.  He can have his pandas.  He can have his tables strewn with watermelons, as far as I'm concerned.  I want nothing to do with it.  I wouldn't want to spend, as I've said before, millennia praising a God who would wipe out seven and a half billion men, women and children just to make a point, just to remind people of his importance.  And then terraform the planet over their remains to conceal the crime and ask the survivors who've all made it through due to following people like him, due to following people like him, ask the survivors who passed the test, this weird test, to praise him, praise him, morning, noon and night.  Not for a few days, not for a few weeks, not for a few months.  for millennia, forever.  I don't think that that's how things are going to pan out.  I think what we've experienced here is a total coincidence.  I think that earthquakes are inevitable on a planet with a molten core and a moving crust.  I think that diseases and epidemics and pandemics are increasingly inevitable on a densely populated planet.  where pathogens are roaming freely.  And by the way, it was God who created the pathogens to begin with.  And yes, on occasion, bad things are going to all converge at the same point.  Here in Croatia, we're on lockdown due to coronavirus.  We've just had a fairly big earthquake.  even if Serbia or Russia were to invade, I wouldn't be thinking, oh, well, in that case, I need to respect the authority of Tony Morris.  I need to listen to Stephen Lett.  I need to ignore the lies at the Australian Royal Commission of Geoffrey Jackson and think he's a cool guy.  That's what I need to do.  to get me and my family through this.  Even if that were the case, I'd want nothing to do with it.  Happily, it isn't the case.  Happily, it is all just a coincidence.  Happily, it's just a matter of me escaping a group that leaps on bad things as a reason to coerce people into following a group of leaders who are sycophants and narcissists.  And I would rather go to my grave with my mental freedom than live for millennia in serfdom, pretending to admire a God who would mess around with his creation in this way.  A God who would treat human life as of such little consequence.  A God who requires so much death and destruction in order to make a point.  So I thought it might be a good idea to use this experience that I'm having now while it's all fresh in my mind.  Maybe there are some of you in lockdown at the moment who need to hear this, who need to be reminded that even if multiple Multiple things were to happen that seemed to be fulfilling the sign from Luke 21 or Matthew 24.  Do you really want anything to do with all of that, even if it were true, which it isn't?  Do you really want to be a part of that grim new world?  I, for one, will resist it and have nothing to do with it to my last breath.  So those were a few thoughts I wanted to share with you.  Please do remember, everyone, to stay safe, stay inside, look after your loved ones.  If you don't have loved ones, try to keep in touch with others online.  Try to keep that sense of community going to the extent possible.  There are other ex-Jehovah's Witnesses on Reddit.  who are there for you to talk to, or perhaps on Facebook or Twitter.  They're out there.  Just get the sense of community that's already there if that's what you need.  But above all, stay safe.  You're going to get through this.  And most importantly of all, you're going to get through this with your mental and intellectual freedom intact.  I hope you've enjoyed this video.
