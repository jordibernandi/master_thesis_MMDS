You know, that kind of thing.  Heh.  Anyways, I got my time machine back and I used it to go into the future and check out next week's season finale and oh boy is it ever an absolute fucking beauty.  But before the season finale, we have to do the episode before the season finale.  We asked, and we're not allowed to skip directly to the finale.  We said, hey, can we just do the finale?  And they said, no, you have to do the episode before.  So we decided, hell, why don't we just make it an absolute big banger?  And that's exactly what we did, as we called our friend Tom Gulley, as well as the mouth noise man, Jamie.  First, though, the absolute main event.  J.J.  McCartney often snaps when we call and say the word shirt.  But every now and then he snaps even when we don't say the word shirt.  And that's what happened this week.  As I present to you, J.J.
