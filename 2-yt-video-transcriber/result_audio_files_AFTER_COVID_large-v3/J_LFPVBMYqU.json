            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Forat.  We've been receiving a lot, a lot of emails regarding the Feast of Pentecost, Shavuot, a lot of confusion about the different Bible translations.  How do we count the seven weeks?  Are we supposed to count it from after the Sabbath?  Are we supposed to count it from after the High Sabbath?  Why does the Bible say seven Sabbaths to count it?  I'm going to clear all that up today using the original Hebrew text.  But before we go to the Hebrew, I'm going to read a various English translations and we're going to see where this confusion comes from.  So first of all, Leviticus chapter 23, verse 15.  Let's have a look at, we'll just take for an example, the King James version here.  And you shall count for yourselves.  from the day after the Sabbath, from the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths shall be complete.  So if you're reading this, number one, you think it's a regular Sabbath.  But first of all, when the Bible talks about a feast, it could very well be that the Feast of Pentecost, Shavuot, which is called the Feast of Weeks in Hebrew, could fall on a Sabbath.  Sometimes that happens.  But for example, this year it fell on a Thursday.  Next year it might fall on a Wednesday.  When it says after the Sabbath, what it really says in Hebrew, it means the High Sabbath, which means if it falls on a Wednesday, that day would also be a Sabbath.  So that's that part of the Bible verse.  you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths shall be complete.  Now, if you're reading this, you think, okay, let's say the feast fell on a Wednesday.  Okay, it's a high Sabbath.  I need to wait until Saturday, until the Shabbat, and then start counting seven Sabbaths.  But that's not what the Hebrew says.  In fact, some of the English translations are even correct.  And I'll give an example here from, for example, the New International Version says, from the day after the Sabbath.  And again, we're speaking here of a high Sabbath, meaning whatever date the feast would fall on Saturday, Wednesday, Tuesday, that would be a high Sabbath.  From the day after the Sabbath, after the high Sabbath, the day you brought the sheep of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks.  So we see here two different translations.  One says to count out seven full weeks and the other one says to count seven full Sabbaths.  That's a big difference because if the feast fell on a Wednesday or a Tuesday, you don't begin counting until that first Saturday.  And that's where the confusion comes in.  In fact, that's why so many people celebrate the feast at a different day, because one is counting the seven weeks from the morrow after the high Sabbath, and one is counting, waiting for the Sabbath to come, and then starting to count seven Sabbaths.  So you miss four or five days here.  But if you go on the original Hebrew, then in this particular version, the New International Version happens to be correct.  Now let's look at Leviticus 23, verse 15 in Hebrew.  And I'm using here the original Hebrew text over here.  Now, here in Leviticus 23, it talks about Tmimot.  And the word Tmimot is weeks.  So when it says Shabbatot Tmimot, it means seven weeks in Biblical Hebrew.  Very important to realize.  And in fact, in this particular translation even, they wrote, and you shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest.  It should have been, well, because the day of rest is a high Sabbath, and you shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest, after the Sabbath, the high Sabbath, from the day you brought the sheep of the way, seven weeks shall be complete.  So this actually matches the Hebrew here, where it says, the word here would indicate that it's weeks and not Sabbaths.  Very important to bring out.  So how do we count the feast of weeks?  From the morrow after the high Sabbath, whatever that day falls, you start counting seven weeks.  You don't wait until the Sabbath and then start counting.  That's where the confusion comes in.  And we have to take the original at face value.  And that original Hebrew text clearly says that we have to count seven weeks and not seven Sabbaths.  Now the Bible is clear.  God is not the author of confusions.  If we see a contradiction in Bible scripture, it's either we don't understand the text or there's a misunderstanding in the translation.  But in no way is God going to confuse us from one Bible verse or one chapter to another.  The Bible is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.  So let's have a look at the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 16, verse 9, which speaks about the Feast of Weeks, the Feast of Shavuot, Pentecost.  We'll have a look at a few translations here in English.  Count off seven weeks from the time you began to put the sickle to the standing grain.  And then we look at verse 10.  Then celebrate the festival of weeks to the Lord your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given you.  So it's very clear here.  It's the Feast of Weeks, the Feast of Shavuot.  Here the translators did not get it confused.  And the reason was it didn't mention Shabbat.  It didn't say Shabbat, Sabbath, So they didn't have to get into the translation, high Sabbath, not high Sabbath, count Sabbaths, counts weeks.  Because the text talks about weeks, they translated it correct to weeks.  But if it says here to count seven weeks, and God is not the author of confusion, then how can it say in a different text to count the Sabbath?  Well, because that's an inaccurate translation.  It's very clear that we are to count the weeks and not wait for the Sabbath and count off seven full Sabbaths.  And that's the confusion here.  Let's have a look at another translation here in English.  We'll have a look here at the King James Version.  You shall count seven weeks for yourself.  Begin to count the seven weeks from the time you began to put the sickle to the grain.  So we can see here again that it's seven weeks, not seven Sabbaths.  And the reason that in the book of Deuteronomy they didn't get it confused is because the word Sabbath is not there, and therefore it was easy for them to translate that.  It is the same thing as the book of Leviticus, God is not the author of confusion, and the word of God is firm and never changes.  Now let's have a look at the Hebrew text, which is the original.  Deuteronomy chapter 16, verses 9 and 10. in Hebrew, in the original language, 9 would be tet, 10 would be yud.  I mean, seven weeks you shall count.  And you count, From the day after the morrow of the Sabbath.  Seven weeks.  Not seven Sabbaths.  And then you.  Chapter 10.  And you celebrated the feast of weeks.  So it's very clear.  That it is the feast of weeks.  And therefore you count weeks.  And not Sabbaths.  And that is what the original Hebrew text says.  Also in Leviticus.  And also in Deuteronomy.  And you may be asking yourself.  Okay what does it make such a big difference.  If it's.  if I know how to count it or don't.  Well, because in this particular feast, the Feast of Week, Shavuot, God doesn't give us a date.  He doesn't, like the other feasts where he tells you, on the 14th day of the month, you should celebrate the Feast of Passover, Pesach.  On the 15th day of the month, you should celebrate Unleavened Bread.  Here he says, from the morrow after the High Sabbath, you shall count seven weeks.  Now, if you're thinking that it says seven Sabbaths, then you're going to start counting from the Sabbath.  What's going to happen to the days until the Sabbath?  You're going to miscalculate them.  And that's the reason there are so many misunderstandings on when the actual feast of Pentecost falls every week.  I pray this teaching has blessed you as it has blessed me over the years.  And before I was a believer in Yeshua and Jesus, I also used to count the weeks because that's what the Bible says.  But I never understood the deep, full meaning that it's all pointy to Jesus, to Messiah Yeshua.  And it's wonderful that we can celebrate these feasts together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  The Jews and the nations, one in Yeshua, one in Mashiach Yeshua.  And it's important that we do know how to count these weeks in order for us to celebrate the feasts at the right time and also in the fullness of Messiah Yeshua.  And we can be a witness to the Jews who are celebrating the same feasts, but they don't have the Lach HaKodesh.  They don't have the Holy Spirit, and therefore they really don't understand the power of these feasts through Messiah Yeshua.  Thank you for joining me.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehuda, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
