            "text": "It's the way of the Crypto Warriors, changing our world day by day.  The way of the Crypto Warriors, can't rely on the bank, there's no way.  Hey guys, BigSquareRoader.com.  I have officially posted the first of, I think, three or four of the Road to Ruta, Road to the Future timeline posts.  This is for private road members at Road to Ruta.  And, of course, I had to start off with my friend, my good friend Cliff High, talking about what we had talked about back in September, what changed and where we stand on it.  He gave a talk to all of my friends at the Silver Summit.  Not the Silver Summit.  The Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas.  It was September of last year, and he predicted everything that we're going through now.  It was just phenomenal prediction.  And I went back for a little extra cliff today and amazing stuff.  We talked for an hour and a half.  So that is posted on the private road at Road to Ruta.  Time to join the Road to Ruta.  I also had a conversation with Christoph Malkizdek about the future of spirituality.  mind-blowing stuff.  i talked with jenny moonstone and we talked a little about theta jenny's a brilliant i don't even know what she is psychic medium tarot reader.  she goes by tarot reader.  she's really cool too.  so i'm going to post that this weekend.  this weekend i got all kinds of great stuff going up on the private room.  um Cliff and I did talk about silver on the private road again, and everything's coming in line with what he had talked about before.  So crazy stuff.  We're just at the beginnings of silver, by the way.  We're at the beginning of 150 years of price suppression is about to turn around.  I wish I had never heard of silver until today.  Because today, I wouldn't have to have gone through 20 years of pain and suffering.  Today, I would have jumped in, mortgaged the house.  This is not financial advice.  Bought as much physical silver as I can get my hands on.  I'm hearing premiums up to $5 to $10 on Silver Eagles.  Yes, it is crazy.  Yes, the U.S.  Mint is purposefully, purposefully... curtailing the amount of coins available illegally.  now i do hear they said they're going to just choose one coin to make.  i do hear it's going to be silver eagles.  i'm just saying that doesn't mean they're going to have many.  um because they can't find the silver.  most likely although it was the largest delivery month ever on the comics 80 was it 86 million ounces.  I'm looking for double in September.  If the system holds together, that's part of the timeline also.  I'm looking for double, not price, double delivery.  Or 120 million ounces delivered.  If the system stays intact by then.  The comics.  Remember, the world can keep going if the comics shuts down.  Just people will have to pay real prices for silver.  I don't know where they'd be priced because there is no other exchange.  For gold, there is.  There's Shanghai Gold Exchange.  LBMA is not an exchange.  They don't even call themselves an exchange, be aware.  But yes, silver is going to moonshot, rocket shot.  And mining companies, no.  Too much rehypothecation in the shares and an easy target for nationalization, especially if they own foreign mines.  Think about it.  Would you allow the hope for your future, the metal in your ground of a country, would you allow foreigners to take it out of the ground because they own part of a silver mining company?  No, of course you wouldn't.  And they're not going to.  I think 60% of the mines are shut down now.  Just another thing on the supply-demand that keeps you scratching your head saying, where's all this stuff you're coming from?  Right out of the pocket of J.P.  Morgan, who had Shanghai'd it for the past 10 years.  So we'll see how much they're willing to give up.  Stock market's going crazy.  Talk about a bubble.  Now here's the question, and I will be addressing this in my portion when I sit down and tell my version of the future, the road to real customers.  Will... Cryptos, gold and silver.  If the stock market crashes, which we're in mega bubbles now, will gold, silver and cryptos go down or will they go up?  I have my theories on that and I'll talk about that as well.  But stocks being overvalued is just ridiculous now.  All-time highs, all-time mega highs.  Some of the data... growth versus valuation.  Look at that.  This goes back to 1978.  We are even nowhere near the proper valuations in stocks.  This is the all-time stratosphere of stocks.  2000, 2001, remember the dot-com bubble?  That was here.  Look where we are now.  And everything's falling apart around us, but the stock market valuations are larger than ever.  scary.  Uh, just quick note about Theta.  Yes, Theta is on the short list, very short list to be listed on Coinbase, which would open up, uh, Theta to the entire United States to buy.  So, yes, it's a good thing because you need Theta in your portfolio.  I get it every day.  People ask me, I can't buy Theta because I live in the US.  You can go to coinswitch.co and swap Theta for Ethereum and Litecoin, I think.  Um, Other than that, when Coinbase opens up, Theta is going to be moving off the shelf, shall we say.  I do think Coinbase is going to be a validator node at some point as well.  Coinbase knows exactly what's going on.  Theta is the big hidden secret in cryptos, by the way.  Theta is the new internet.  It's like being... The World Wide Web was released in 1990.  And I remember when I had friends in the tech business, they're like, oh, you got to invest here.  You know, there's private equity investing in this thing called the World Wide Web.  You got to get indexed.  I was like, yeah, there's nothing.  Email over the phone lines.  What's the big deal?  I learned my lesson all throughout the 90s.  All my friends were getting into the tech world because I was working in San Francisco and They made fortunes and lost fortunes and made fortunes.  But the World Wide Web was a big deal.  That's what created what we know now as the Internet.  It made it possible for all of humanity.  Theta is the Internet 2.0.  The problem with the World Wide Web is it's very centralized.  You have centralized controllers.  Theta decentralizes everything.  And it increases bandwidth massively.  Unlimited bandwidth.  If you get enough people, for example, Samsung putting Theta edge nodes on every single one of their appliances and TVs and phones.  Yeah, that's expanding the internet with Theta.  It's going to get crazy.  You have to have some.  If you have a crypto portfolio, you have to have some in your portfolio.  It's only 26 cents.  Michelle White has it going.  $2,000, $3,000 per coin, per token.  And you don't have the regulator problem because they never ICO'd.  They pulled their ICO at the last minute.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Good move, Theta.  Yeah.  And you won't be able to get it.  They're going fast.  If you look at how many coins are locked up right now on the Guardian nodes, it's 174 million.  There's a total of 1 billion Theta tokens and 5 billion Theta fuel.  But if you look at where we are right now, Guardian nodes, there's 1,286.  Those are securing the network all around the world.  There's 12 validator nodes, which are the big guys.  Samsung, Google, Binance.  There's a couple other names in there.  and then the validators have locked up 320,000.  So right now, we're just inching so close to 5... Sorry, 320 million.  Inching so close to 500 million, which is half of the total out there, but the float, how many are out there, is 800 and... I think 800 and something million.  Let's take a look.  870 million theta are in circulating supply.  I think theta owns the rest of those.  So of that 870, already over 50% have been locked up and they're earning theta fuel.  Earning theta fuel, that's what you get when you're a guardian or a validator, you earn theta fuel.  Or if you run the edge node and you don't even need theta, you could just share part of your broadband spectrum of your computer.  It is insane what this coin can do.  And they're introducing smart contracts.  this, I think it's this half of the year.  And of course, Ethereum programmers programming the same language on Theta as they do Ethereum.  So is it the new Ethereum even?  From my reading of Ginny Moonstone, really good stuff.  And I'll tell you about that when you're on the private road.  Don't forget to go to the private road.  And if you don't want to run a node, a Guardian node, you can just join the Gpool delegate.  Do the delegate.  You have your choice of join Guardian.  You have delegate or stake.  Do the delegate because you keep your keys.  That's what I've been screaming about forever.  You keep your cryptos.  All you do is stake to their node.  So delegate, delegate is when you basically, you can even run it off your phone.  If you're running a mobile app, you need 10,000 theta to do it.  You stake it and you use their guardian node summary.  And if you click on it, you'll figure it out.  That way you don't have to run the node.  You don't have to watch your computer and make sure it's always up and running.  You do it for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have I drilled that into you guys enough yet?  That theta is something big that you need to own?  I hope I have.  All right.  And if you're not into cryptos, you can go to Road to Ruta.  Hit subscribe today.  Join and I will send you 100 theta and 100 theta fuel already loaded on a paper wallet.  You don't have to do anything.  Just shove it in your silver safe.  And wait for Michelle White Dove's prediction to come true and you'll be doing all right.  All right.  Again, I have posted the first of a few this weekend, Cliff High and the WebBots.  It's an hour and a half long discussion about the future.  You don't want to miss it.  Just go to roadtour.com, hit the private road, and you're good to go.  And in cryptos, it says we're in the green.  This thing is... Yeah, we're in the green.  So what does that mean?  I've sat here and seen it in the red.  It says sell.  Oh my God, everybody's selling.  And then the price shoots up automatically.  You never know.  This fear greed index, It's a cute thing, and I like to put it up there because if you just go by it, you probably do well.  You probably should sell some cryptos if you're a trader in this range.  And then buy back after it jumps down, but you might miss the big run-up.  But that's the trader world.  But if you go to the private road, first I have the September 2019 Cliff High interview, the full version.  I think it's two hours.  And then the next is the Road to Root or Road to the Future, the one we just did today.  Come check it out, roadtoroad.com.  Subscribe today.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye. ",
