            "text": "So the fake news over the last couple of weeks had a real ball, a real beauty, the fake news, where I said so simply and very nicely, to be honest, wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be nice if the churches could be open and full on Easter Sunday?  I didn't say they had to be.  I said it would be nice because I want our country back.  You can't shut down a country.  We have so many industries that need to be working.  We have the the great industries that have to like get back to work.  But we just want to get back to being a great country.  We had an economy like really nobody's ever seen before until this COVID, coronavirus, the, call it the invisible enemy, trademark pending.  And It hit us like nothing.  that's like ever hit the country before.  It's like vicious.  It's nasty.  It's a sneaky enemy.  And I just wanted us to be back, okay?  So we couldn't do it, and the fake news made up lies.  But what we are talking about now, which is great news for the country, is we're actually talking to great faith leaders, okay?  We're talking Mike, great Mike Pence, and I are talking to religious leaders.  I call them faith leaders.  I like that.  I like that term, faith leaders.  It sounds... I'm kind of a faith leader, if you think about it.  And we're talking to all of them.  We're talking to the Pope, okay?  I like the old Pope.  He was a little more conservative, said nicer things.  We're talking to Joel Osteen, great faith leader.  Great private plane.  And we're talking to Bishop Don Magic Juan also.  Good guy.  Great, great faith leaders.  And we're going to move Easter.  We're looking to move Easter.  Nobody's ever done this before.  This is like a crazy, incredible thing.  But we're going to try to move Easter to the week of July 4th.  So now we have... America's birthday, followed by Jesus's birthday, which is of course Easter.  So we're going to get it done, and then the fake news can't say that I was wrong, because we'll be open by New Easter.  We're calling it New Easter.  But we have an announcement from the very angry Andrew Cuomo.  We don't need to move Easter.  We need more ventilators and creatine for my brother Christopher. ",
