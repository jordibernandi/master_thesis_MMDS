            "text": "Hi there, everyone.  Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here today.  I'm going to channel Jesus, but I do want to mention a few things first.  I've recently completed a three-day channeling retreat and the recordings for that retreat are now available on my web store.  So if you go to channelingjesus.com and go to shop, you will see the October event there for sale.  So I just wanted to let you know that that was available.  Also, I will be doing a one day mini online retreat December 21st.  So in one month, it's the 21st today, in one month, please put that date aside.  We don't have booking links yet or anything like that.  It is going to be a live event on Zoom.  So I will be channeling for an hour and a half initially.  Then we will have a meditation session.  Then we will have a short break.  We will also have two guest channelers.  And then I will channel again to finish the last hour and a half.  So it will probably be about 10 till 4 on December 21st, that auspicious day.  So please mark it in your calendar and consider joining us.  I will make announcements on YouTube and Facebook how to join and how to sign up.  The last thing I wanted to say before I channel is that this is the book this year, A Year of Forgiveness.  Now, I'm not sure if that's gonna come out back to front or not, but it's a beautiful book.  Look at this, it's got gold edges, It is a compendium of all 365 commentaries that I did on YouTube last year.  So if you enjoyed that program, this is the book that has all of those in it.  And it is also beautifully.  Oh, hang on a second.  It is beautifully illustrated by Renee Phillips.  She has done a lovely little drawing for each lesson each day.  and really, really beautiful, whimsical pictures.  It's in full color, this book.  My publisher really, really went to town on this.  She did what I wanted and she said she had never spent so much publishing a book.  So if you are a Course in Miracles student, this is a companion text to your Course in Miracles.  It has been sanctioned by the Foundation for Inner Peace as a companion text.  So when you're doing your lessons, you can check in with this book and see what Jesus has to say for that day.  So, yeah, consider buying it as a show of support for my publisher who has stood by me all these years.  OK, let's see what Jesus has to say to us today.  You are blessed beings indeed.  I am that one that you know as Jesus.  And as we enter into the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, you can feel the, we'll call them the thumbscrews tightening.  You are being put under tremendous pressure.  You not only have the unresolved American election to contend with in your hearts and minds, you have these increasing shutdowns, lockdowns, and financial difficulties that are being caused by loss of business, loss of your ability to work and move freely.  This is what we will call the winter of discontent.  This is the winter of discontent.  This is the winter where you all get to feel what you're unhappy about.  When you have access to distractions, when you have access to extra money, when you have access to travel, many of you do not deal with your problems and this is one of the great benefits that you have the opportunity to take advantage of in these winter months.  when you have a relationship that's not ideal.  when you have a job that is not ideal.  when you have a living situation that is not ideal You are trained to distract yourselves.  You are trained to go for dinners, go for holidays, take the long way home.  When you have the freedom to distract yourself, many of you will not deal with the fundamental issues of your life.  We want you all to understand that this is part of the ascension process.  You are now stuck with yourselves, your partners, your families, your lifestyles.  And you are clearly seeing where you have perhaps made incorrect investments, both with your time, energy and money.  You are perhaps seeing where you have not been investing at all in a relationship or your household or the way you live within and around your home.  You've been too busy doing other things.  This year brings up for all of you that which is not okay.  It is the winter of your discontent.  But what we want you to understand is that the things that are surfacing now are being shown to you for your benefit.  They are being shown to you so that you can feel them and you can see them and you can accept that they are there and then you can do something about it.  Until you accept that there are things in the way you're living and the decisions that you've made and the things that you've valued and invested in, until you see that there are problems in those decisions that you've made, you cannot fix them.  You cannot address them.  You cannot heal them.  And so what we want you to understand as we go into this coming month is that the pressures are going to increase.  The fears are going to increase.  The discontent is going to increase.  The anger is going to increase.  The desire for freedom is going to increase.  And what we want you to understand is that when you have a desire, it shoots out into the universe.  It is your true wish.  It is not your distracted fantasy.  It is your true wish, your true desire is emitted out into the ethers and the universe is listening.  When you are locked in your homes or your breathing is restricted, and you hate it and you want freedom and you want clean air, the universe hears that prayer.  It's the true prayer of the heart.  So when you are feeling these things, do not get angry at yourself and think, I should only be peaceful, I should only be happy.  This is a mistake that many Course in Miracles students make.  They do not allow energy to flow and they do not allow their guidance system to let them know things.  They repress control, put a lid on it.  This is not the time to act rashly, but it is the time for you to pay attention to what your guidance system is saying.  Many of you are going to be looking at your lifestyles, your family arrangements, these kinds of things, and you are going to see that there are amendments that need to be made if you are to continue on in a healthy, sane and strong way.  We would suggest that you listen to those directives from your heart.  We would suggest that you express the feelings in your heart, whatever they are.  Do not hurt people with your words.  Do not attack people with your words.  But use this winter of discontent to align yourself with new ideas, new guidance, new feelings and new energies.  New energies are coming your way.  They are coming your way fast and furious.  And the expressions that are going to be arising from you are not to be stopped.  They are not to be stopped because the cleansing and clarification process of the ascension journey is underway and cannot be stopped.  You must allow sadness, grief, anger, fear to surface so that you can see it, so that you can hear its voice, and so that you can decide whether or not it gets to reside within you going into 2021.  Do not procrastinate anymore, dear ones.  Do not procrastinate anymore in doing your forgiveness work, in doing acknowledging where you are in pain, acknowledging where you are unsatisfied, acknowledging where you have been misled or you have misplaced your energies.  Do not hide it from yourself anymore with distractions, but face your demons, face your fears and face your true desires this winter.  There is going to be time for you to focus on the inside of your mind and heart, there is time for you to focus on that which needs to be shifted and changed.  Take that time this winter and know that in the spring of next year, things are going to look quite different.  There is going to be a shift in the winds.  Do not despair.  Do not sink beneath the weight of your fears of the future.  It is not going to go the way that you think it's going to go because all of you are going to shift your energies.  All of you are going to do your inner work this winter.  And that is what it will take to turn this ship around.  All of you doing your forgiveness work, allowing your unresolved issues to become resolved through the applications of the principles in A Course in Miracles.  If you have not started A Course in Miracles yet, we ask you to consider doing that while you are in this winter of discontent.  If you spend the next four months working through the lessons of A Course in Miracles or the first four months of the lessons of A Course in Miracles, you will be in a different place in the spring of next year.  Not only will you see a difference in the world, but you will feel a difference within your own heart and mind because you have used this time wisely.  Use this time wisely, dear ones.  It is a gift, even though it may not feel like a gift right now.  I am that one that you know is Jesus, and I will speak to you again soon.  Thank you for joining me today.  Once again, A Year of Forgiveness, a beautiful, beautiful book for your Course in Miracles practice.  It is available on Amazon and you can order it through your local bookstore if you would prefer to do that.  You can also order it directly from my publisher, which is Light Technology Publishing in Flagstaff, Arizona.  Thank you for joining me.  I'll see you again soon.  And don't forget, December 21st, a one day live event here.  Thank you, bye. ",
