You're misinformed.  What?  This isn't videotaping.  It's digital.  No, it's not.  Quote me the law.  Quote me the law.  You're gonna quote me the law?  You're in public, bro.  Too bad.  See, they always say that you can't record in public, but they never can quote the law.  whether it be law enforcement or the public themselves.  And I am open carrying, so I think he finally saw that I had it on my hip and decided to just walk away.  Like I said, we're down here at the Richard Luger Plaza.  What do these mean?  You're not allowed to go on the property?  Closed.  That's just to go up there.  Up in the commons area.  Got public bathrooms down here.  They're closed.  Just down here taking a stroll.  on a nice day the sun finally came out and clouds are still there but they're uh pretty much uh pretty much broken.  now it's not overcast so we thought we'd come out today and do some filming and see.  Let's see if there's anybody in this booth.  Yeah, looks like it.  Employees and service entrants.  Wind's kicking up.  Security in the booth is watching me.  Again, I am open carrying, like usual.  Of course the government buildings are being taken care of.  They're cleaning the windows.  Obviously that's essential.  There's a sheriff that showed up.  Deputy.  He wasn't there just a second ago when I turned around.  Now they're both there.  Obviously they don't care.  That's what people should do.  The garage.  Because I can.  I'm on a public sidewalk. ",
