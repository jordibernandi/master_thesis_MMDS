            "text": "Hey everyone.  Okay, I'm back with more info on Bill Gates.  I read this article in Zero Hedge, and well, I just had to do a story on it.  As a follow-up to the last report I did on how Gates is using his vaccine alliance to lobby the Canadian government to push for his coronavirus vaccine.  Anyways, we've gone through remarkable changes over the last few months to fight coronavirus, and we've lost most of our civil liberties in the process.  In fact, I would argue our countries look more like a communist wet dream now, including fines for standing too close to strangers, fines for being in a park, citizens forced onto a universal basic income because they've shut down the economy, millions out of work, business owners getting arrested and jailed for not complying with shutdown orders, etc.  The decision-making for quarantine, social distancing, and shutting down the economy have all been due to projections of computer models, and most of the West has imposed extreme China model lockdowns on their entire populations.  But how accurate is the science that got us here?  I would argue very, very corrupted.  There are two major models that are being used in the West to predict and respond to the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the USA and Europe.  One was developed at Imperial College of London, and the second one, which is more focused on the effects on America, was created by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, also known as IHME, and it's based in Seattle, near one of Bill Gates' homes.  So what's so interesting about both of these institutions?  Well, both groups owe their existence to mega funding by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Did you also know that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is not a charity?  Nope.  It's actually a private tax exempt foundation.  And as you know, Bill Gates is leading the coronavirus vaccine charge.  maybe because his foundation stands to make billions on vaccines and other drugs to treat coronavirus.  In early March, Professor Neil Ferguson, head of the MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, issued a widely discussed model that forecasts possible coronavirus deaths in the UK as high as 500,000.  Now, Ferguson works very closely with the World Health Organization.  Other than actual countries, Bill Gates' foundation is the biggest financial contributor to WHO.  That report pushed by Ferguson was the reason why the UK government went from a typical public health policy of isolating at-risk patients while not shutting down the economy and not trapping healthy people in their houses.  A few days after the UK went into lockdown, Ferguson's institute revised the death estimates several times and substantially.  His absurd predictions didn't happen and the UK economy has flatlined.  But that's not all.  Imperial College, along with Ferguson, have a serious track record for predicting doom and gloom with diseases.  In 2002, they said up to 50,000 people in the UK would die from mad cow disease, possibly even 150,000.  Guess what?  A total of 178 people were registered as dying from mad cow.  In 2005, Ferguson predicted that up to 200 million worldwide would die from bird flu.  By early 2006, only 78 deaths were linked to the virus.  Then in 2009, Imperial College anticipated that H1N1 would kill roughly 65,000 in the UK.  In the end, only 457 people died of the virus.  Now, why would the UK government listen to Ferguson when his group has a notoriously bad track record of predicting deaths that don't come to fruition and panicking people?  Ferguson was also the source of the insane forecast that 2.2 million Americans would be killed by COVID if the economy wasn't shut down immediately.  Ferguson's modeling caught the attention of Dr.  Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy Infectious Diseases, and another very close associate of Bill Gates.  And he put President Trump on blast by pressuring him to declare a national health emergency.  Once the damage to the economy began in the US, Ferguson sneakily lowered the US fatality estimates to between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.  That is one dramatic revision.  In both the US and UK cases, Ferguson's modeling relied on Chinese data, which has now been written off as unreliable.  Neil Ferguson and his modeling group at Imperial College are backed by WHO, but also receive millions in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Ferguson heads the Vaccine Impact Modeling Consortium at Imperial College, which lists as its funders the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Gates-backed GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.  From 2006 through 2018, the Gates Foundation has invested an impressive $184,872,226.99 into Ferguson's Imperial College modeling operations.  Now, why would Bill Gates invest so much money in a man and modeling system with an outrageous record for being wrong?  The second major institute to put out faulty models is the University of Washington and their Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IHME.  Their forecasts have been used to justify the draconian lockdowns imposed on the US public.  They also predicted the 2.2 million coronavirus deaths in the USA unless drastic measures were taken.  And by April 7th, they had revised the number down to 200,000 deaths.  Their latest correction put the deaths at roughly 60,000.  That's a far cry from 2.2 million.  IHME claims its revisions are a result of the lockdown taking effect, even though that would take weeks to show up.  Just like Ferguson at the Imperial College London, the University of Washington's IHME is another project of the Gates Foundation.  It was created in 2007 with a generous grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  IHME signed an agreement with WHO to collaborate on data used to estimate world health trends.  In 2017, they received an additional grant of $279 million from the Gates Foundation and another $210 million gift in 2016.  And like Ferguson, IHME has a terrible track record with overinflated models.  Data from one of their predictions found that 430,000 intensive care beds were needed across the U.S.  in March.  States went into a panic.  By the end of April, hospital beds were found empty all across the country and untold numbers of other operations had been canceled to make room for COVID-19 patients who never materialized.  There's also major issues with the testing itself.  A German lab recently reported that according to WHO recommendations, COVID-19 virus tests are now considered positive, even if the specific target sequence of the COVID-19 virus is negative and only the more general coronavirus target sequence is positive.  This can lead to other coronaviruses, such as cold viruses, also triggering a false positive test result.  That means you can have a simple cold and you are deemed coronavirus positive.  No wonder the number of people infected with corona has exploded.  And what about Dr.  Dan Erickson's claims that several U.S.  states have been pressured to issue death certificates mentioning COVID-19, even though they themselves did not agree?  All of it seems like they're intentionally pumping up the numbers to perhaps justify the tremendous devastation government intervention has caused when it wasn't warranted, or perhaps something more sinister is in the works, like mandatory vaccines or immunity passports for work and travel.  Anyways, what do you think about Bill Gates' influence on these models?  And I'm talking about financial influence.  Let me know in the comment section below.  I always love to hear from you.  Have a great day. ",
