We'll be doing 10-15 on that vehicle.  10-4, vehicle is 10-54, 10-29.  Gray 2016Q, utility to Jeffrey Gray.  Out of St.  Augustine, Sean, valid 48.  He says Jeff Gray.  10-4.  Are we in your way?  Yes, sir.  You're good.  Enough.  Okay, then you don't need to be up here.  Why's that?  Because I said so.  Because I'm responsible for the safety of this.  I don't care if you said so or not.  Well, guess what?  The police line is right there.  I don't care.  But I don't want something falling on your head.  What's your name?  Mike Lofton.  Who are you?  Detective.  Mike Lofton, detective.  Either extend your police line or shut up.  Is that right?  Yes, sir.  You know what?  We will extend it.  I'm sorry.  I'm getting farther back there for you.  It's up to you, man.  I'm just, I'm going by the police line.  That's what we'll do then.  If I talk to you, who's talking to who?  No, that's what we'll do.  No, no, no, no, I mean.  No, we'll do, that's what we'll do.  All right.  Check your attitude, man.  Yeah.  You don't need it now.  Check now.  Check your attitude.  Yeah, okay.  We're going to extend it to him.  I'll move that, I'll move that.  I'll figure out something for you.  The sidewalk is still open.  I'm just going by where the police line tape is.  The sidewalk is closed.  If you could move back that way, please, sir.  How far do you want me to move back?  Pass that pole out there.  Find a pole or something.  We can post right here.  I'm going to go around that pole.  What's your name and badge number?  Officer?  Say again, sir?  What's your name and badge number?  My name is David Young.  I work for the state of Florida.  What's your ID number?  Can I have your ID number?  All right, thank you.  All right, there you go.  No need to get huffy.  Right?  Say again?  No need to get huffy.  No need to get huffy, but he asked you to come over, and you're trying to... You see this thing right here?  This thing right here?  This is called a police line.  Yep.  And the police line is right there.  Well... The sidewalk is open.  We thought some people might have come to stand there where something might fall on them, and he was trying to get you away from that.  And you were kind of ignoring it.  I'm 51 years old.  Okay.  So that's why we have to put up the tape out here.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's your job, right?  Are you like a fire marshal?  Yes, sir.  Okay, cool.  You got suspected as arson?  Yes, sir.  No, we don't suspect anything at this point.  Oh, you're just investigating?  Gotcha, gotcha.  So... Gotcha.  it's a little chilly probably a situation where maybe some homeless people we're in the business.  usually when it gets cold like this there's usually a fire somewhere.  somebody's got a space heater or something like that.  that starts a fire.  i'm not saying that's what happened here but a lot of times that's what the deal is.  If you're going to put the line there, man, I'll stay behind it.  Okay.  All right.  That way we'll keep everybody safe.  All right.  We sure hate for something to fall on you from that building right there.  Gotcha.  All right.  Thank you.  Is that like an unoccupied?  Is that like an unoccupied business?  Yeah.  It was?  Okay.  So they probably had some homeless people get in there and start a fire or something like that.  I know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  We haven't even walked in there yet.  Gotcha.  All right.  All right.  Me too.  Thank you. ",
