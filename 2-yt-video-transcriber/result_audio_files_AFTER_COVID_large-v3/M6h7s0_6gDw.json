            "text": "The only poll that matters.  Mr.  Reagan.  So, I say poll, but this isn't actually a poll at all.  It's a predictive model.  As we know, the polling for Trump is abysmal.  He's down by 10 points.  That's an insane gap.  There's no poll that shows Trump ahead at the moment.  It's a bit depressing.  But... Are these polls right?  They almost all got it wrong in 2016.  So did they fix them or are they still way off?  I actually think they're worse than ever.  Riding in the streets, burning buildings, violence encouraged by Democrat politicians, strict coronavirus lockdowns in Democrat states.  Many members of the public are sick of the demented politicians reducing their quality of life.  That said, the Democrat politicians and the mainstream media are doing a pretty good job of blaming Trump.  Conservatives scoff at the absurd claim that the problems we now face are somehow Trump's fault, but sadly, a lot of easily manipulated Democrat voters are buying it.  Nevertheless, I do believe there are more sensible Americans than gullible ones.  I learned this lesson in 2016 when the media had me convinced that Hillary had the election in the bag.  And then, out of nowhere, Trump won.  It was fantastic.  I was so impressed with the American people.  I realized for the first time that the American voting public were indeed paying attention.  They were far savvier than I'd given them credit for.  And I think in 2020... They're savvier than ever.  So what is this poll?  that's not a poll that contradicts the others?  It's a predictive model called the primary model.  It was developed by a political scientist by the name of Helmut Norpeth and applied to every presidential election in American history.  It has accurately predicted the outcomes of all but two.  That's a 96% accuracy rate.  That's pretty darned accurate.  A predictive model uses past data and algorithms to predict future data.

            "text": "This model is really accurate and really positive for Trump.  Do other models show this?  Honestly, I couldn't find that many predictive models in my research.  This is possibly because political scientists who develop these models tend to lean left and they don't necessarily want to sensationalize an optimistic result for Donald Trump.  Also, these scientists might fear being canceled by the woke mob or by an overly left-wing academic administration.  As Professor Helmut Norpeth says in the video, a lot of models developed by political scientists have predicted a Trump victory, and yet, I can't find them.  So if Helmut's model is so accurate, and if other models also predict a Trump victory, why are the polls so off?  Well, I think it may be because voters are also afraid of being canceled.  I have a friend who works in a creative field here in Los Angeles.  He's very successful.  He's actually famous within his profession.  And recently he shifted from being a moderate leftist to being politically hard right.  This is primarily because of the riots that tore through L.A.  and are currently raging in Portland and other parts of the country.  But he doesn't dare express his frustrations openly.  He calls me when he wants to talk politics.  No one else.  How many Americans out there are like this?  Well, according to a recent survey by the Cato Institute, 77% of conservatives are afraid to express their political beliefs openly.  Seventy seven percent.  That's crazy.  And apparently Americans from all sides are afraid to express themselves.  But look at this chart.  This is very telling.  The more conservative you are, the more pressure you feel to be silent.  Where I live in Los Angeles, you absolutely cannot express your views if you're a conservative.  It's not 77% of conservatives.  It is a solid 100%.  And no leftist feels the least bit of fear expressing their hatred of Donald Trump.  I heard radical leftist gobbledygook all the time when I used to work in Hollywood on sets.  And this was from very important, powerful people.  Ironically, I know some very important, powerful people who are strong conservatives out here in  L.A.,  And they can't speak up at all.  They are totally silenced.  In fact, I was watching TV the other day and... I probably shouldn't say this actually, but I'm going to.  It was this totally left-wing propaganda show, just despicable left-wing propaganda.  And I see this actor who I know personally, big star, and I know that this actor is hard right conservative, but nobody on the show knows that.  And I actually asked them once, I said, are you openly conservative?  And they were like, oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't work.  I couldn't work.  So I will not be naming names here today.  Honestly, you guys would be shocked at some of the people who are conservatives here in L.A.  And they're passionate about politics, and they absolutely abhor the corruption and the ethical vacuum of Hollywood.  These are very good people, but... I mean, I can't really talk about it, so let's move on.  My point is that conservatives feel totally silenced in America today.  We feel like somehow if we express our support for Donald Trump, there will be negative consequences.  So many of us stay quiet.  So far, I haven't seen a reasonable way for pollsters to account for this problem.  But there's another major reason why the polls get it wrong.  Enthusiasm.  There is a massive enthusiasm gap this year.  Trump supporters are stoked to vote for Trump.  You know you are, and everybody watching this video, if you're a conservative, none of us can wait to vote this year.  I'm actually doing a video coming up that illustrates this problem for the left, so I'm not gonna go into too much detail here, but no one is excited to vote for Joe Biden.  No one.  I don't even think Joe Biden is excited to vote for Joe Biden.  This is a huge factor.  And actually, it's one of the things that the Helmut Norproth primary poll measures.  The poll measures the margin of victory in each party's presidential primary.  And this is a strong indication of how much enthusiasm there will be for that candidate in the general election.  Think about the Hillary Clinton situation.  Trump crushed his opposition in the primaries.  Nobody else came close to beating him.  Ted Cruz did the best with 25% of the vote.  And Hillary certainly beat Bernie soundly, but Bernie still got 43% of the vote.  That's pretty dang good.  And the DNC even cheated to give Hillary every possible advantage.  And Bernie fans were loyal, and they did not like Hillary.  They felt utterly cheated.  Helmut's model accounts for voter enthusiasm by using the primary results.  It's brilliant.  So don't pay too much attention to the polls.  It's not to say that you can just sit back and relax and watch Trump coast to victory.  You still got to get out there and vote.  But I mean... Who among us aren't going to go vote?  I mean, we get to go vote for Trump again.  It's an honor and it's a privilege.  I can't wait.  And before you mention in the comments, yeah, I know the whole thing might be spoiled by Democrat cheating with vote harvesting and other nefarious methods.  And certainly coronavirus changes things a little bit.  And to be honest, if you were running against anybody else, I might be a little bit worried.  But against Biden? ",
