            "text": "Every time I try to talk about something else other than The Last of Us Part II, Neil Druckmann opens his mouth.  So, Druckmann appeared on Kinda Funny Gamers with Troy Baker, and he pretty much explains exactly how he fucked up this franchise.  It's amazing because you can see that he's really annoyed that his big brain story flopped with gamers.  He's lived so much in his head and surrounded himself by people who either kissed his ass or were too afraid to speak up that no one told him that he's not as clever as he thinks he is.  It's like he made feminism the game.  You get to play it and you're like, this is shit.  Yeah, that's pretty much always true.  Enjoy.  So in the live stream, Druckmann admits to a lot of things, the biggest being that he personally contacted YouTube to have them remove any videos showing the leaked footage.  This was a huge contention when people's videos started getting struck and folks started getting hit with DMCA strikes.  The claim from Naughty Dog, which they apparently told to Angry Joe, was that nobody from Naughty Dog was involved.  This was all something coming from Sony or Musso TNT  Ltd.,  which was obviously bullshit.  The leaks were out and people were getting DMCA strikes on news sites, Twitter, and YouTube.  There's no way that was all Sony's little shell company.  Someone from Naughty Dog, probably Druckmann himself, had to be involved in that.  And he admits that. ",

            "text": "And there you have it, folks.  Neil Druckmann admitted on a live stream to flagging videos showing the leaked footage.  So all the shit that happened to my channel, Ryan Kennel, Jeremy from Geeks and Gamers, Mr.  H Reviews, Ass from Heel vs.  Babyface, and everybody else, all of our channels were being fucked with because Druckmann himself begged YouTube to pull down content.  Now, in fairness, it sounds like Druckmann targeted channels that played the leaked videos, so it may not be the case that he specifically targeted all our channels because none of us showed the videos.  But he probably is the reason the channels got struck, and that's because of how YouTube's copyright claim policy works.  YouTube allows owners to upload content they claim they own and those are used by YouTube's algorithm to track whenever someone else uploads those files, and then slaps a copyright claim on it.  YouTube will then say that the video was manually claimed, but that's not true.  No human actually looked at the video.  That's the algorithm.  A human just uploaded the files.  This is why people were getting claims within seconds of the videos processing and how Musso TNT Limited was able to flag videos that were already flagged by Sony.  They both uploaded the same content to claim.  So what happened to me, Az, Ryan, and Mr.  H probably comes from that.  But that doesn't explain what happened to Jeremy because unlike the rest of us, he didn't show any videos or images.  He only talked about the leaks during the live stream and it was pulled and his channel received a DMCA strike.  There's no way that happens without Naughty Dog Sonny or Druckmann himself telling YouTube to have their algorithm check for certain phrases people used, which is a clear violation of the Copyright Act and fair use.  The other option is that someone watched Jeremy's livestream and flagged it.  Those are really the only two options, and both look bad.  The weird part here is that Druckmann had no reason to admit this.  He's already taking heat for the game.  Admitting that he was false.  flagging videos isn't going to help his case, but there you have it.  It was obvious that someone from Sony or Naughty Dog was colluding with YouTube to pull down any videos about the leaks, and here's Druckmann admitting the shit.  So, Neil, just in case you see this, just know I will never buy a single thing you're involved in ever again.  And I encourage everyone watching or listening to do the same.  Don't give this man your money because this is how he behaves.  And we're going to see it's much worse than that.  He says this. ",

If you knew people would hate the game if you killed Joel in this manner, why do it?  why not rewrite the scene so joel's death is less infuriating.  why do it this way knowing half the gamers wouldn't like it?  was it the shock value?  was it a lack of better ideas?  did you really think it was so cool that even people who hated it would just let it go?

            "text": "Context?  Context.  Dude, you killed off a beloved character in the most gruesome, pointless way possible.  You're over here talking about, what about the context?  It doesn't matter what the context is.  here since you're having so much trouble wrapping your head around this imagine this the gamers are abby and joel is abby's dad.  now you get it.  abby doesn't give a flying fuck.  why joel killed her father.  it doesn't matter what his reasons were.  it doesn't matter what the context is.  he killed her father.  end of discussion.  this is the same thing.  people love joel.  they see him as a flawed father figure and you murder him in a brutal way for really no good reason.  narratively it doesn't matter why abby does it because we're not invested in her.  we don't know the character.  we don't care about the character.  we care about joel and you killed him.  you can't try to get us to care about her after the fact.  it doesn't work that way not in fiction and not in real life.  what you did was the equivalent of having someone rape a child and then try to explain why they did it.  i don't care.  i don't care what in life got them to that point.  once you've shown them doing something so horrific you're never going to get understanding from other people.  we're just not built that way.  If you want people to know the context, then you should have shown it to begin with.  You should have started the game by having gamers play as Abby, have her meet Joel and Tommy, have Tommy stupidly tell her their names, and then on the way back to her base or their base, have a flashback sequence to Joel in the hospital from the end of the first game.  We see everything from Abby's perspective, maybe her trying to avoid getting killed by Joel and then discovering he's killed her father.  Then you can have the game center on Abby trying to find out who this man was and then running into people protecting him from her and the fireflies.  Every time she gets close to finding him, someone blocks her way.  Over those years she could train and buff up to be prepared for the fight that's going to go down.  I was on Nerd Roddick's livestream a couple of days ago and Az mentioned the idea of Abby not knowing Joel's name.  this could work too.  maybe she doesn't get his name until right before she meets him.  either way works because you're building tension to what happens when she finally confronts joel.  you could even have flashbacks of her father telling her not to resort to violence so that she's conflicted about what she wants to do to joel.  she wants her revenge but she also wants to honor her father and maybe seeing joel or hearing how he raised ellie as his daughter is a trigger point for her.  then you could play out the scene exactly how it happens in the game.  but now every time she pauses it gives those moments a new meaning because maybe she's hesitating maybe she's reluctant maybe she's not going to do it and then she does.  and maybe the reason abby kills joel isn't to hurt him but to hurt ellie instead to make her feel what abby's felt for years.  And this would actually hurt Joel too, with him knowing that his death will cause Ellie so much pain.  It doesn't make the scene likable, people are still gonna hate it, but now it makes it understandable.  You get why Abby does what she does.  You're invested in her, so it's not going to be easy to just outright hate her.  On the livestream, I compared this to how I felt about rolling this change from the Dark Tower series after he lets Jake die.  I instantly hated Roland, and that never left.  When I got to the fourth book where you get Roland's backstory, I still hated him.  I didn't care about his trauma, I won't spoil it.  I didn't care about his guilt over it.  I didn't care that he was barely 14 and was manipulated the entire time.  Still hated him.  When I read the series again, I caught more of Roland's regret and horror over what he did to Jay, which didn't make me stop hating him, but it did give me a better understanding of him, and it made me more willing to feel sympathy for what happened to him as a kid.  I both like and despise the character, and that's an excellent example of good storytelling.  It's also an example, though, of how powerful having a character do something horrible can be.  My view of Roland is completely tainted because of that one act, and I knew next to nothing about Jake.  Now imagine doing that to a character I know and love.  That's what you did to Joel.

She's just dealing with the aftermath of what she's done, with people coming after her, and maybe the fact that killing Joel didn't ease her pain.  There's no lesson learned from this.  She literally gets everything she wants.  as had a really good idea of having abby be conflicted after killing joel realizing that the pain is still there that killing him didn't solve anything but instead made things worse for her and the people around her.  the rest of the game could then be about her regretting her actions while still trying to stay alive.  and then in that final confrontation with ellie the roles are reversed.  instead of ellie sparing abby abby spares ellie realizing that she doesn't need to take another life and shouldn't have taken joel's.
