            "text": "I keep hearing over and over that the most important thing is to beat Donald Trump.  that we must vote blue no matter who.  The Democratic Party is hyper-focused on this.  The left-wing media obsesses over it.  Candidates start off their speeches with it.  This is how it always goes.  Evil will win unless you vote for us.  The world's morals are at risk.  The only thing that matters is defending our values.  And you know what?  They're right, but they're wrong about who we have to defeat.  It is becoming increasingly clearer and clearer that who we have to beat no matter what is the establishment.  The establishment on both sides of the aisle have turned their back on American values and have sold us out to billionaires and international corporations.  The American values we have cherished for generations, the value of the American dream is gone.  It's been destroyed by greed.  My generation and younger have had to kiss goodbye the idea of owning a home with a white picket fence.  Having multiple kids, two cars, the college education we were able to pay for by working a summer job, even the idea of having a stay-at-home parent is long gone.  Instead, younger generations have had to create a sharing economy where they don't own a thing and a gig economy which will leave them with nothing to retire on.  Our political leaders keep us focused on emotional moral issues, such as immigration, abortion, racism, misogyny, so that our attention isn't on what's really happening.  The people in Washington and those who fund their campaigns are running off with our money.  They are robbing us, and stopping them is the only thing that should matter.  They don't represent us.  They squabble back and forth with each other saying, Democrats want to destroy us, so vote for us, or Republicans want to destroy us, so vote for us.  Meanwhile, they're both destroying us all together.  They distract us with things that we do care about, but that aren't really affecting our day-to-day lives.  Communists aren't coming to get you.  Your guns aren't going to be taken away.  And me being a minority female am not being held back because I'm Vietnamese, nor because I'm a woman.  What holds us back is the increasing inflation on basic necessities, which is intended to siphon money from us to distribute to the already wealthy.  Many of us are riddled in student loan debt, have to be careful about going to the doctor so we don't rack up bills, are priced out of the ridiculously high housing market, and the thought of having a kid and paying for daycare?  Forget it.  The establishment and the rich oligarchs they are in bed with have turned the middle class into serfs in their fiefdom and have completely ignored the poor.  Our poor are living on the streets.  Many are addicted to drugs just to escape their terrible reality, and even more are unable to compete with immigrants or automation for jobs.  These are real issues, yet we hardly hear about them.  There are a few candidates who actually attempt to offer solutions.  Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Andrew Yang all have ideas that are tangible.  Medicare for all, end the extremely expensive wars, the freedom dividend.  And when they talk about Trump just being a symptom, and when they court voters on the other side of the aisle, they're smeared as apologists, communists.  Yang and Gabbard, neither of whom are white, actually get confronted about having white supremacists as supporters.  It's all gaslighting in an attempt for you and I to not see what's really going on.  The establishment is corrupt, they are bought off, and we the people need to do everything we can to get them out of office.  It can't be vote blue no matter who.  It's got to be.  Vote anti-establishment no matter which side of the aisle they come from because our true American morals and values depend on it.  turn off Fox News, turn off MSNBC, turn off the propaganda that keeps us fighting with one another to the benefit of the ruling class.  We need to join together and defeat the establishment.  They tell us to put our differences aside and vote blue no matter who to defeat Republicans.  But what I'm saying is, If you're a Republican or a Democrat, we need to put some of our differences aside and vote anti-establishment no matter what in order to get our nation back.  I will not vote for an establishment candidate even if it means Trump wins again because the war we are fighting is bigger than that.  If an establishment Democrat wins, the left becomes complacent.  People think all is well with the world and they no longer have to pay attention to the continued corruption that has plagued both parties.  People actually think, whew, Trump is gone.  Democrats are in control.  They're the good guys.  Meanwhile, they continue to march us into wars, bail out the banks, keep migrants in detention centers, get their family members multimillion-dollar jobs, and somehow make even more millions upon millions while they hold public office.  They want you to vote blue no matter who, so you don't have a clue.  But what we need to do is stand up and say, nope, we're on to you. ",
