I saw this video on Glowbuster's channel and it talks about centrifugal force and why that disproves the spherical earth.  Apparently, he brought in a mechanical engineer to make this point.  It's so funny when conspiracy theorists bring in someone who is supposedly an expert in the field, And that somehow makes their point more valid or something, as if that person represents the field or everyone in the field itself.  Like you could pick any of the other 99.9% of mechanical engineers and they would tell you the Earth is round, but instead you pick this one.  Looks like we're picking some chairs here. ",

            "text": "Let's assume, and every Ball Earther would agree with me, that every mass on planet Earth is being pulled exactly to the center of the Earth, which would be the center of all the masses around us in essence.  Now imagine any point on the Ball Earth and picture that point spinning around the axis of rotation of the Earth.  No matter which point you pick, with the exception of exact north or south poles, all of those points have the same path.  In other words, depending on your location, you may be closer or further from the axis of rotation, but every person and every mass is going around the axis with uniform circular motion.  Again, any given point is spinning in a flat circle around the axis of rotation of the Earth.  This means that there has to be a centripetal force that has a tendency to fling you in the opposite direction of the axis of rotation, not opposite the center of the earth, but opposite the center of your own flat circular path.  If we are to believe a ball earth, then of course we know this force would be small and wouldn't overcome the force of gravity.  So of course I'm not arguing we should be flying off into space, if that's what you want to call it.  But as it turns out, this force is not negligible.  This has huge ramifications because what it means is that everything on the spinning globe should be pulled however small to the equator, a tendency to flatten out due to the spin and gravity always pulling you to the center.

            "text": "Alright, I let that video play for far too long.  Finally, now I have a chance to respond.  So to summarize the point of the Flat Earther, because of the spin of the globe, everyone standing on Earth would move in a circular path parallel to the equator.  And because of that, there's a centrifugal force that would pull you in a direction away from the Earth, but isn't exactly directly opposite of the gravitational force.  By the way, I think the word you were looking for is centrifugal force, not centripetal force.  I think you got them mixed up.  Centripetal is the force that would pull you towards the center of the spin, not away from it.  Kind of weird for a mechanical engineer to get that wrong.  Anyway, back to the main point.  They claim that this would give you a slight pull towards the side if you consider the vectors of all forces in play.  Now, the answer to this is actually incredibly simple.  I made a video a while back talking about this exact same point.  I think I did a pretty good explanation of it, so check it out if you have time.  Otherwise, I'm going to reiterate my point here, although I may be just repeating myself a bit.  Videos should be responded to on an individual basis, I guess.  Okay, so this is what the forces look like.  We have the force of gravity, and we have the centrifugal force.  As you can see, they point in different directions, but not exactly the opposite.  If they pointed in opposite directions, then gravity would just cancel out the centrifugal force, and we wouldn't be here talking about this right now.  The mechanical engineer Flat Earther is right about one point, that the centrifugal force has to point away from the circle that we rotate around, which is parallel to the equator.  You get a gold star for that one.  Now, if you've learned anything about vectors, you know that they cancel out each other and have an overall direction.  The centrifugal force here is actually incredibly tiny in comparison to gravity, so gravity would negate most of it, but it still has a small directional influence.  So why is it that we don't feel ourselves being pulled in one direction even slightly?  That's because our Earth actually compensates for that.  I say compensate as if the Earth is making that decision, but it's more like it conforms to it.  due to physics.  As we know, the Earth isn't entirely spherical.  It is a little oval-ish due to the spin of the Earth.  You can kind of think of it in the way that this overall force vector applies to everything on the Earth, not just us, and that includes the Earth itself.  The crust of the Earth is slightly pulled towards the apex of the spin and gathers up to form a hill of some sort.  This bulge eventually contributes to the slightly flattened out shape of the Earth.  When that happens, we're not actually standing so that our feet are pointing towards the center of the Earth.  Instead, it is pointing exactly with the overall force vector that we drew out earlier.  In other words, because the Earth conforms to this force vector, we are standing in a position in which that overall force vector points directly downwards for us.  That's why we only feel the force downwards and not towards the side.  This does not contradict with anything we know about a spherical Earth.  And also, this isn't the first time I heard that argument either, so you aren't very unique.  Anyway, David here goes a bit further, so let's have a look at that. ",

But if we're talking about the overall force after centrifugal influence, then that would be ever just so slightly different.
