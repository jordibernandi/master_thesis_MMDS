So if you want to get the latest from Harvest, hit the subscribe button.  You know, Larry King recently passed on.  It was my privilege to be on the show and to meet him.  He's a very nice guy, very witty, fun to talk to off camera.  But once the camera went on and the lights were on, he could be a very intimidating person.  He was a great conversationalist, really listened carefully.  And he would often ask questions about the afterlife.  There are many times Billy Graham was on a show and talked in great depth about Christ and about what happened after death.  And Larry wondered, what happens beyond this life?  And that's a question we should all be asking.  When I was on with Larry King in 2005, somehow we got on the subject of suffering.  And he asked me, well, why does God allow suffering?  Isn't God all powerful?  And I said, he is, but sometimes he can use suffering to get our attention.  And I told him the story of a woman who had just come to me and told me that she found out she had breast cancer and it caused her to turn to the Lord.  And then I quoted that passage where the psalmist says, before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I have kept your word.  I said, sometimes, Larry, sickness or crisis can bring us to God.  And he says, but don't you think Christianity is a crutch?  And I said, oh, no, Larry, I think Jesus Christ is a whole hospital and I still feel that way.  I need God and I turn to him without any shame or any embarrassment and I think we all should.  Maybe you're going through some kind of a hardship right now and you just need to know.  maybe the Lord is trying to get your attention.  Turn to the Lord.  That's the place to turn in this life and also the place to turn for the afterlife. ",
