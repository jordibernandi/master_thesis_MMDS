            "text": "From the pages of MikeHuckabee.com, where you can break through the liberal media fog to find some real news and analysis that you can trust, let's take another look back at the week that was.  And you know, you can sign up for the totally free Huckabee newsletter on my website.  That way you get my news and insights delivered right to your email box twice a day, and it's all free.  Well, sleepy Joe Biden told some whoppers at the Constitution Center this week, of all places.  Even NPR called him out.  Whoa.  Biden read prepared remarks, as he always does, from a teleprompter, and then he proceeded to tell falsehood after falsehood about the Constitution, his past record in the Supreme Court.  But even NPR's political editor tweeted, and I quote, Biden says there's no Supreme Court term until after the election.  That's false.  First arguments of the new term, as ever, began the first Monday in October.  Biden also said Trump campaign only started asking for his SCOTUS list after Ginsburg's death.  That's not true either.  You know, you'd think that with so many days of rest between 15-minute campaign speeches, his staff might have put together a string of sentences that weren't so easily called out as blatant gaffes, even by liberal media fact-checkers.  And as Democrats cry foul over a perfectly legitimate constitutional process to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, some are now threatening to pack the court as they wouldn't have tried it anyway, of course they would have.  This is ironically in polar opposition to what Justice Ginsburg herself said about court packing just one year ago.  And I quote, I'm quoting her, She says, nine seems to be a good number.  I've heard that there are some people on the Democratic side who would like to increase the number of judges.  I think that was a bad idea when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to pack the court.  Frothing Democrats also ignore something she'd previously said.  And again, I quote her.  The president is elected for four years, not three.  So the powers that he has in year three continue into year four.  And that's how it should be.  As I said on Sean Hannity's television show this week, if Democrats have a problem with it, remember it was Senator Harry Reid who killed the filibuster for judicial appointments.  Mitch McConnell told him at the time it would come back to bite, and now it has.  Moving on to the Twitterverse, I say turnabout is fair play.  Nancy Pelosi, powerless to stop a Senate confirmation of President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, decided to threaten the I-word, another impeachment of President Trump, because it really worked so well the last time.  Well, I tweeted, I have a better idea.  Let's impeach Pelosi.  That way she'll be free to get her hair done, eat expensive ice cream, and hang out in Chinatown without a mask.  Leave the serious work of governing to people who give a rip.  And I was pleased to see Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis introduce legislation that would toughen penalties for anyone committing crimes during protests.  To that I say, protests are protected free speech, but hurting innocent people, attacking cops and burning, looting and destroying property, that's a criminal act and it should face consequences.  So thanks, Governor Ron DeSantis.  Now, I'm not sure who could oppose this except maybe the rioters and maybe liberal lawyers paid to represent them.  But for the normal people, maybe Florida will be a little safer for all of us.  And time to dole out some shame.  First to Newsweek, the far left publication cranked out about a thousand words falsely linking Amy Coney Barrett to the dystopian feminist novel, The Handmaid's Tale.  One problem, it is completely, entirely untrue.  Newsweek claimed that Amy Coney Barrett is affiliated with a religious group that inspired The Handmaid's Tale.  Turned out, of course, she isn't.  And Newsweek, rather than do the right thing and remove the article, merely issued a bland correction at the bottom of the same article, otherwise untouched.  Shame on you, Newsweek.  You're so bad, you give fake news an even worse name.  Next up, CNN's Don Lemon, who decided to threaten terrorism, hopefully just in a figurative sense, when he said, we're gonna have to blow up the whole system with what's going on with the Supreme Court.  To his credit, Chris Cuomo of CNN offered at least a meek rebuttal when he said, well, I don't know about that.  But Lemon doubled down, going on to say that America needs to get rid of the electoral college and pack the courts.  Now these unhinged threats would be crazy even in a normal election cycle and political environment.  But given the tender box that America is now, the last thing we need is another match in the haystack.  Well, how about some shout outs?  Republican Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, he's no fan of President Trump, but he signs off on Trump's Supreme Court nominee.  Romney told reporters on Tuesday, my liberal friends have over many decades gotten really used to the idea of having a liberal court, but that's not written in the stars.  He called it appropriate for a nation that is center-right in order to have a court which reflects center-right points of view.  So while Senator Romney may not be the best of friends with President Trump, and remember, he even voted to impeach the president, he does recognize that a Supreme Court made up of jurists who more accurately reflect the citizenry of the United States is really more important than personal feelings.  I say kudos, Senator.  Finally, a shout out to union members who aren't buying Joe Biden's claims of being some down to earth son of Scranton union guy who will stand up for them in the White House.  Politico reports.  To rank and file members in some unions, especially the building trades, it doesn't matter.  They're still firmly in Donald Trump's camp.  Politico goes on to quote Democrat strategists who say they can't move the needle on this.  Many blue collar union members see the career politician Joe Biden for what he is, someone who's been removed from the private sector and away from the concerns of Scranton, Pennsylvania for 40 years.  Well, let me leave you with a thought from C.S.  Lewis before we go.  Don't use words too big for the subject.  Don't say infinitely when you really mean very.  Otherwise, you're gonna have no word left when you wanna talk about something that is really infinite.  And until next time, these have been the facts of the matter.
