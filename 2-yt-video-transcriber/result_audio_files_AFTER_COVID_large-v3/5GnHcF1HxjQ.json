We thought you were going on to great things for the Lord.  So there was a period of time where I absolutely believed that God wanted me to be a minister.  As a matter of fact, for the longest time, it was a calling that I felt that I thought I was running away from.

Do you think God was encouraging you to have the surgeries so that science could help you?  Or do you think that, I mean, because if I'm God and I know I'm going to heal you, I don't need to send you a message that says, how are you going to serve me if you're dead?  Hang on, I'll save you.  I just save you.  right well to me it's your personal.  so the thing that makes me worry about whether or not i'm going to be able to be god's representative if i'm dead is me being terrified of being dead.  if if the if everything happens according to god's plan i'm either going to be dead or i'm not and god's either going to save me or he's not and any worry about this clearly comes from me.  but even if you're like What does it feel like?  Okay, so God told you, said, how are you going to essentially serve me if you're dead?  Did you hear that audibly?  Was it an impression?
