            "text": "What are you talking about, Joe?  I love it.  Think about it.  I mean, how many times have we seen that?  That's kind of one of his go-to, oh, crap, I don't remember what I'm saying, I've either lost the prompter or lost my notes, lost my train of thought.  That's your candidate, Dems.  That's your candidate.  We don't have clips for it.  We didn't pull them today.  But you could see outside of that venue that he was at in Pittsburgh, a very small spattering of Biden supporters gathering, trying to get, you know, pro-Joe chants going, this, that, and the other.  And I tweeted about this yesterday yesterday.  It literally sounded quieter than like a youth soccer game.  Like pre-pandemic, like where all parents and grandparents and friends and family could go.  Still a tiny crowd being it's youth soccer.  But it was quieter than that.  Like there's no excitement for this guy.  And that's why.  He stays in his basement.  He can't speak.  He's not healthy, which, again, I don't.  I don't wish him poor health.  I just wish that they weren't running him.  And I do in the sense that it's it's going to make it hopefully a victory for President Trump.  But but I wish that they weren't dumb enough to think that this was a good idea to make him the face.  And yes, I get it.  Strings are being pulled behind the scenes, and they're not really just putting all their eggs in the Joe Biden basket.  There's a lot more to it than that.  The DNC has different plans, and it's not just Joe Biden's our guy.  That's not it.  But the reality is this is still the face of what is out there.  This is what people are seeing and hearing.  And it's just remarkable.  And I talk about the people on the outside trying to muster up a chant.  You know, the couple handfuls of people that were out there.  But here's what it looked inside.  It was really bizarre.  This is a tweet Jack Posobiec put out.  And it shows inside.  You've got your social distance circles.  And there's what?  Six circles spaced out.  So what's confusing to me is you won't leave your basement, but then you come out because you want to attack Trump and make a couple policy statements, mainly, which we're going to get to in a second, the fact that now he's calling the violence out there what it is, violence.  something he's decided he didn't want to do before.  But you won't leave your basement.  Then you leave your basement, travel to Pittsburgh only to have a room full of five or six people, one of which is the cameraman.  I just find it odd.  It's really, everything that they are doing is bizarre and it's strange.  And it's hard to put your finger on exactly what's happening with it because all of it is so strange that... any rational line of thoughts about, okay, it seems like maybe they're doing this, this, and the other, all of a sudden are taken off the table because then they do something else that throws a wrench in you.  You're like, well, never mind.  I don't know what they're doing.  It just doesn't make sense.  I know it doesn't make sense.  I know it's not good for America.  But, you know, it was interesting to see this.  You look at... His speech.  And depending on the feed you had, you got different angles, of course, and whatnot.  But we all think... Look, my day's very full between all the stuff we do for the show, all the stuff I do outside of the show, our staff.  Everyone is working really hard.  We're all busy.  We all think it's tough.  But you know who's got it tougher?  This guy, this interpreter, and we can play it here.  We'll just put it on mute.  But you can see Joe Biden's interpreter, as he's having that gaffe we saw earlier, watch his face.  He starts to get confused, and he's on track here, and then he can hear Joe.  Wait, what's he saying?  Never mind, hold, stop.  I mean, I don't speak sign language.  I admire those who do.  But this guy is like, dear Lord, give me a break.  Like, figure out what you're saying.  Stop changing, because he's 100 years, 100 people, 100, you know.  So you think your day's tough.  At least you're not Joe Biden's interpreter.  That's all I got to say.  But in this speech and kind of one of the big things that came out is, you know, they are going out now and trying to flip the script as Democrats always do.  You know, they take an approach to slam Trump, try and drag him through the mud.  It doesn't work.  And then they literally just flip the story around and try it that way.  And that's what they're doing now because it's been over 90 days in Portland, for example.  with violence, looting, fires, assault on police officers.  Now we can add murder into that discussion, sadly, with Jay Bishop this weekend.  But they've been silent on it, calling it peaceful the whole time.  Yes, little pockets here and there have condemned it, but the loud voices, Biden being the one that should be the loudest, have not condemned it until just recently here.  Don Lemon, we talked about last week, and CNN started saying, we're seeing this change in the poll numbers.  We need to stop this.  And literally was that bold in saying, basically, that's why.  We don't care about businesses.  We don't care about people or the livelihood or of the businesses there or our police officers.  We care about the fact that we hate President Trump and things are changing.  And, oh, people don't like the violence.  Oh!  Oh, we need to stop this.  We need to stop this.  So this plan has backfired.  And now Biden's coming out and admitting it.  Not full blown.  You know, again, he had a conversation the other day with the National Guard where he still called it mostly peaceful protesters that were out there, which is absurd.  Yes, there are peaceful protesters, but calling it widespread peaceful is not only stupid, but it's reckless.  It's dangerous.  It's ignorant.  It's lots of things.  It's not true, though.  But these were his comments on Rule 3. ",

Holding a poster board wearing a t-shirt, going out, maybe having a megaphone, although I always think it comes through as loud and jarred.  And I hate, you know me, I hate protests.  I think that they're a useless waste of time.  But if you feel good about it, you feel like it's bringing change or allowing your voice to be heard, fine, go do it.  I don't care.  Go do it.  Go be heard.  Most people aren't going to listen, but go be heard.  But there is a distinct line from holding up a sign and And then creating a Molotov cocktail behind it and throwing it at buildings or police officers or innocent bystanders.  The lines are so clear.  I mean, you do not \u2013 I'm not the smartest person on the planet, people.  You do not have to be smart to see the clear distinction between what's been happening in Portland, Kenosha, Seattle, Chicago, albeit in a different form.  In some cases, not all.  But you don't have to be smart to see that that is against the law.  That is violent.  That is destructive.  That should be prosecuted to the fullest extent.  And then this angry group of mouth breathers over here who just want change and want their voice to be heard and have poster boards and signs and hats and shirts and whatever else.  That's fine.  But they're very different.  So, and they've known this.  Don't be fooled by the fact that they're coming out and saying it now.  They've known this.  It's exactly what Don said the other day on CNN.  They hoped they put all their eggs into the basket that these riots and this violence was going to make President Trump look bad.  And they encouraged it, some of them verbally, you know, with Presley and others saying there needs to be more unrest in the streets.  Some of them, by not saying anything, encouraged it to continue on because their message has been clear for, you know, since President Trump took office.  We do not like this person.  We will do everything we can to stop him.  Though, again, I still don't know why.  With so many great things that have happened under him.  There's claims of him being authoritarian, a dictator, all these things.  Which, again, if that was the case, none of the stuff that's happening in the streets would be happening.  Your voice wouldn't be heard.  You wouldn't be allowed to do this.  It's literally so far opposite of the claims that they're making.  It's funny.  But now they're flipping the script because, again, they're seeing that this is coming back to bite them.  And the Americans, once again, don't like what Democrats are offering.  Democrats have always been, but more so than ever, are way, way out of touch with middle America, with the everyday people.  Are they in touch with some of the folks in the big Democrat city?  Sure.  But across the board... They do not understand the American voice, which is why they were shocked when President Trump took office in 2016 and won that election.  But now they're saying it's not working.  So they're flipping the script and blaming Trump for the violence in the streets that they have not condemned the whole time up until just now.  It's remarkable.  I think it's too late.  I think they overplayed their cards and it'll come back to bite them big time.  The other thing that's going to come back to bite them is you've got Leo Terrell out there, big civil rights guy, saying that Trump is going to get the most black votes for a GOP person in history.  And there's polls.  There's the new Zogby Strategies EMI research poll.  which was taken just last week after the RNC, that shows that Trump's support from the black voters is at 20%.  Biden's at 75%.  You could say, well, 75%, that sounds really good.  But you got to look at the history and you got to look at the data of how this work.  For Trump, that's 12 points more than he had in 2016.  And strategists inside say that he only needs, I think, 11.  11% to win.  They're saying he's at 20 right now.  So, Biden has not done well.  And a lot of people thought he would do well with some regards.  There's folks who said the one crime bill from the 90s would hurt him.  There's others who thought, no, no, he's going to be good for the black community and they're going to like him.  But it's proving to be otherwise.  They're not happy with it.  Black communities, black individuals are seeing that President Trump has done a lot wrong.  for them and for other minority communities for that matter.  So experts say a Democrat needs 90% in high turnout among the black community.  Again, the numbers just aren't looking good for Biden.  And at the end of the speech yesterday, he didn't, which I think, you know, the audience that's outside, that's dismal and laughable, the blunders during his speech, and then this at the end, you know, he walks off.  This is how he finished the speech.  Roll four. ",

But then this guy will not take questions because he can't go off script.  He's not there enough to do it.

He's going to get angry.  He's going to say stupid things.  He's going to stumble over his facts and his numbers.  I can't wait.  I hope it happens.
