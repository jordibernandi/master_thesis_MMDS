When I was 17 years old, like many of you, I participated in sit-ins to desegregate the restaurants and movie houses of Wilmington, Delaware.  I came out of the civil rights movement.  I was one of those guys that sat in and marched and all that stuff.  During the 60s, I was, in fact, very concerned about the civil rights movement.  I was not an activist.  I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware.  I was involved.  I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling.  I was involved, but I was not out marching.  I was not down in Selma.  I was not anywhere else.  I was a suburbanite kid who got a dose of exposure to what was happening to black Americans when I, in my own city, You know, when I was a teenager in Delaware, for real, I got involved in the civil rights movement.

And I'd go to 8 o'clock mass, then I'd go to Reverend Herring's church where we'd meet in order to organize and figure where we were going to go, whether we were going to desegregate the Realdo movie theater or what we were going to do.  I got my education.  for real in the black church.  And that's not hyperbole.  It's a fact.  But I got my education, Reverend Doc, in the black church.  Not a joke.  Because when we used to get organized on Sundays to go out and desegregate movie theaters and things like that, we'd do it through the black church.  I was no big shakes, Reverend, in the civil rights movement.  I was just a kid.  I got involved in desegregated movie theaters and Helping.  you may remember Reverend Moyer in Delaware and Herman Holloway organized voter registration drives.  Coming out of black churches on Sunday, figuring how we're going to move.  In October, I was invited to the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis to receive the Freedom Award, a thing when I sat in black churches on the east side of Wilmington getting ready to, and by the way, next to two Jewish rabbis, getting ready to go out and desegregate movie theaters in Delaware.  I never, ever thought in my life I would be worthy of, and I'm still not sure I'm worthy of it. ",
