            "text": "for our young future to come here because music changes.  I mean, we saw the saxophone literally walk through the crowd and change the energy and ignite power, ignite personal power.  You know, for so long, you haven't been heard.  You haven't been seen.  This is not okay.  Personal power.  is so important.  So this music, coming together as a community, creating resources, having allies that will be human shields for you.  This is not about me.  I'm not standing up here for me.  I'm standing up here for you.  And I just want to say thank you for allowing me to be in your space.  Thank you for allowing me in your service.  Don't thank white people for helping you.  You can appreciate us, but this is part of what it should be.  This is how it should be.  You know, I have my daughter here.  She's creating a future for us because she's learning how to protect her young black cousin boys.  And I feel like that change is beautiful.  It's not enough.  But at least with one child and that one child teaching other children, we can maybe have some future glimpses.  Devon wanted me to share... a poem that I wrote in honor of this.  that's happening right now.  I'm sorry, baby, I had to put you down.  You're growing, okay?  So, it's called Strange Streets.  Minnesota streets burn their streets.  Blood on concrete and blood on God's feet.  Black bodies dying on lining streets.  Death tolls rising by the hands of police.  How can I breathe when every breath keeps leaving our black men, women, and young ones?  I keep on seizing from the feeling of losing another one.  How can I cope, lump in my throat the pain of anguish?  I succumb.  Where is the love?  I want to know.  Resuscitate me.  Aren't we one?  Where are we one?  I need some hope.  How do I keep you alive?  I use my privilege, but please stop thanking me until we all stay alive.  I teach my daughter to protect you.  She's only six, but hey, it's something to see a white child protect black people.  It is the future that I'm molding.  And now we cope and burn down stores.  And you go numb as I sign petitions, but don't you dare give up.  You rest and recharge as I take the action that is needed.  I will pull over and record when the arrests take place.  I will speak out until the world is finally hearing that it's not okay.  You take all the time you need and love on yourself the most.  I'll stand here as a protector while you rebuild yourself to hope.  Minnesota streets, burn their streets.  Blood on concrete and blood on cops' knees.  Black bodies dying on lightning streets.  Death tolls rising by the hands of police. ",
