            "text": "word, L-I-K-E?  Yes, sir.  Absolutely not.  If we waited on that, we'd be waiting forever because the system is not even designed to have black people like each other, not to say anything about love.  You hear a lot of stuff about black love and whatnot.  That's non-existent.  You can't have love in the system of white supremacy.  That doesn't compute at all.  So you have to get the mechanics down.  And then you have set the seeds, you have planted the seeds where you can get this liking and this love.  You're not going to get it in the system of white supremacy.  The system of white supremacy is designed for hostility.  And we have all been poisoned by that.  So that clears up that mystery, I think.  And that is, no, I mean, no, you are supposed to be able to function with people that you don't care about emotionally at all.  Because this thing about having it already in existence, talking about you hear black people sometimes say something that's absolutely false, and that is talking about this black love that exists.  You can't have love in the system of white supremacy.  Why?  Because what does the word love mean?  If you would toss that word around loosely, very loose, so it's meaningless.  It means absolutely nothing.  It's non-existent.  But what is it in essence about what it should be?  The word love, and I have this in the word guide, and the word justice are one and the same.  You cannot have one without the other.  So since you can't have justice, going by the computer now, going by logic, you can't have justice without and white supremacy in the same universe at the same time.  Therefore, you can't have love either, since love and justice are one and the same.  And what is justice?  Guaranteeing that no person is mistreated and guaranteeing that the person that needs help the most gets the most constructive help.  Now, no black person can guarantee that. ",
