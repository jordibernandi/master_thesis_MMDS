            "text": "Hey how's it going?  Good to see you.  What?  what nothing nothing.  what is it?  is it my hair?  i just got a haircut.  it's a quarantine cut so it just.  no your hair looks fine nice job.  do i have blackheads because i've been trying to get rid of the black?  no i don't see any blackheads.  okay good it's work.  do i have like food on my face?  no there's no food there.  okay good well then what is it?  well it's just you're wearing a mask.  oh yeah yeah i mean of course i just didn't think you're one of those kind of people.  you know what kind of people are those?  Well, I mean, it's clear that you're being manipulated by the liberal media.  Oh, you mean like doctors and scientists?  Doctors and scientists.  Uh-huh.  Look, we should probably stop talking about this because it's just, we're not going to see eye to eye.  It's a known fact that masks don't work.  Oh, they don't?  I mean, it's common knowledge.  Who told you masks didn't work?  I hear lots of people saying that masks don't work.  What kinds of people?  Lots of people.  Which people?  Um... My friend Dave.  Ah, your friend Dave.  What does Dave do?  He's a plumber.  He's a plumber.  Good, good.  He's a smart plumber.  Who else?  Well, Donald Trump, our president.  Donald Trump.  Yeah, where did he study medicine again?  Is that Trump University?  Come on.  Didn't he suggest injecting disinfectant at one point?  That was sarcasm.  Sarcasm.  He knows more than all the experts.  Okay, so Dave the Plumber and Donald Trump.  Anyone else?  Um, a blonde woman on Fox News.  Oh, the blonde woman on Fox News.  Well, I mean, there aren't any other kinds.  All right, so forget it.  Just... Yeah, I just don't think that's reliable information.  Okay, so what are you going to do?  Just live in fear?  You're going to wear a mask for the rest of your life?  No, just until cases stop spiking or there's a vaccine or at least a treatment.  That could be like six to eight months.  Yeah, probably.  You're going to wear a mask for six to eight months.  Why would you wear a mask for six to eight months?  Because I'm hoping to live longer than six to eight months.  I just think it's sad that you're living in fear.  Yes, I am living in fear.  You admit it.  He admits it.  Well, yeah, because it's kind of killed 120,000 people and there's no vaccine and people aren't social distancing.  So, yeah, I'm afraid.  I mean, the truth is we're all afraid of something, right?  I mean, look at you.  Right.  Wait, what am I afraid of?  Well, for example, you're afraid of immigrants, which is why you want that big wall built.  And you're afraid of LGBTQ people, which is why you're really upset by that Supreme Court ruling.  And you're afraid of people of color, which is why you don't really want to say Black Lives Matter.  And you're afraid of monsters lurking in the shadows, which is why you love your guns so much.  Hey, don't pick on my guns.  And you're really afraid of people like me.  How am I afraid of you?  See, you're afraid that if I'm right and you're wrong, then you might be responsible for getting a lot of people sick or killed, and I'm not going to have done that.  And if you're right and I'm wrong, well, then I've only had to wear a mildly uncomfortable facial accessory for a little while.  i'm afraid of things that kill diverse humanity and you're afraid of diverse humanity.  it's just okay.  i believe in personal freedom right like you do you bro?  now if you want to wear a mask go ahead and wear a mask.  if i don't want to wear a mask i shouldn't have to wear a mask.  living's just like a choice like wearing a seat belt.  no you do.  you doesn't really work because if you don't wear a seat belt you're gonna die but i'm not gonna die Right.  No, this is more like making the decision to go and drive indiscriminately into a crowd.  I mean, heck, you're going to get sick and die of something, right?  Hey, you're going to die of something.  It's a good thing you can't see my face right now because I look really disappointed.  I just think it's better to trust the doctors and the scientists and the people who spend their lives studying these exact things rather than people who have no knowledge of them.  I just, I mean, at the end of the day, it's just... The thing is... Masks don't work.  Okay, I think we're done here.  I think we're done here.  You do you, Rob. ",
