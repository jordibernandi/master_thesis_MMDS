            "text": "2020 has brought a bunch of unexpected developments.  A global pandemic, the biggest uprising against racism since the 1960s, and rapidly increasing tensions between the world's two major superpowers.  But an event last night was even less likely to have appeared on anyone's 2020 bingo.  Grammy and Brit Award winning artist Dua Lipa, who made Spotify's fourth most streamed album of all time, tweeted this to her 5.6 million followers on Twitter.  So it says, autochthonous, adjective of an inhabitant of a place, indigenous rather than descended from migrants or colonists.  Most people would have read this, not really, you know, what is going on here?  Also, you're looking at that map.  What is going on here?  A little bit of research.  It's Greater Albania.  That is what she is referring to.  So Greater Albania is an irredentist concept.  It's the idea that Albania should grow to include or expand to include all areas with a majority ethnic Albanian population or which historically had a majority ethnic Albanian population.  And we can get up a map now of what that would look like.  So these would be the borders of Greater Albania.  And you can see why it would be controversial, because it would not just include Albania, but also parts of Macedonia, parts of Greece, Kosovo, parts of Serbia and parts of Montenegro.  So it's an ethnic nationalist concept.  Ash, I'll go to you first.  Dua Lipa and Greater Albania.  I mean, I kind of rate it because her, I mean, obviously I don't rate the concept of Greater Albania, but her managers will be fucking screaming at her.  They'll be like, why, why did you tweet this?  You know, they probably have an audience, you know, they probably sell records in Greece and Macedonia and in these other countries.  So for her to this tweet that out to her 5.6 million followers was presumably controversial.  Your thoughts? ",

            "text": "I mean, look, call me old fashioned, but I'm not really into ethnostates.  That's just my position as a leftist.  I don't think ethnostates are ever progressive.  I have to do a Lloyd Russell Moyle non-apology after taking that highly controversial opinion.  Catch me next week.  But no, they're not progressive.  And I think what this speaks to is two things.  One is the way in which historical wounds are carried down through the generations.  So when you have a people which has been fragmented across different national borders because of conflicts, treaties, the movement of history, right?  There's often a sense that this is a collective trauma because often that process has been very traumatic.  And sometimes that collective trauma can be wielded for really reactionary and horrible ends.  So for instance, after the Treaty of Trianon in which Hungary was carved up, after World War I. That's been this kind of nurtured wound, which has also then had an impact on nationalism, even antisemitism, xenophobia and racism.  It's this idea of we are once strong, proud people tied to this land.  We're butchered, right?  We were dismembered.  When it comes to the existence of a greater Albania, As far as I can tell, the only time in which it has really existed in history was under Nazi occupation during World War Two.  So it's something which has, I think, particularly horrible origins, even if Dua Lipa, having been shaped by her parents' experiences as Kosovan refugees, really horrible impact of trauma, displacement and violence, might have legitimate reasons to feel quite assertive in her Albanian identity.  The map that you see on the flag, when you see an abstracted map like that, you don't really know what kind of landmass it covers.  And the first time I saw that flag was when a football match had to be stopped because a drone had flown in with the greater Albanian flag.  And I didn't realize just how much landmass that includes because it doesn't just include Kosovo, but it also includes bits of Northern Macedonia and Greece, you know, huge areas.  huge areas of land in which you do have diverse populations.  Now, I believe in, you know, the protected right of a people to self-determination.  That's not the same thing as the right to forming an ethnostate, regardless of the wishes of the other people who live there.  And I actually think, you know, multilingual, multi-ethnic, multi-religious democracy is a value in itself.  So, yeah, Dua Lipa.  bit of a curveball bit weird not that into it not into ethno states.

What do you make of this tweet? ",

What does the word mean?  What is this landmass?  What is that national insignia?  Who are these two guys?  None of it is remotely understandable to the average person.  Yeah, it's kind of crazy.  You're basically asking for Yugoslav civil war mark two.  That's kind of crazy.  And look, there's a broader context here, which is about, for instance, Kosovo.  You know, there's a good argument that Kosovo and Albania could be one country and so on.  But irredentism, which is the idea that there is a part of the nation which has yet to be turned back to the kind of, you know, Redeem, so to speak, is obviously a very old concept.  You get it in Italy before the First World War.  I think that's actually where it comes from, l'Italia irredente.  So parts of Dalmatia, for instance, which is modern-day Croatia, were really parts of it.  They're essentially Italian.  Now, this concept can go back very far.  We could talk about Greek irredentism would probably have most of northern Turkey, right?  Or... you know, Calais, we want Calais back.  You know, you could go back, you know, Korean eruditism, you might want bits of Manchuria.  Indian eruditism, clearly you might ask for reunification of the Mario empire.  So you go all the way to...

            "text": "Well, yeah, you know, you go from Herat to Bangladesh, basically, right?  So there are dozens of countries which have a very feasible, historically, you know, explicable irredentism.  But Ash is right.  I think what's really interesting about the case here of Albania is historically it's been a very marginalised, unique country in Europe.  You know, I think historically it's maybe the only, along with Bosnia, they're very rare in being majority Muslim countries in Europe.  And that sort of the amalgam of Yugoslavia brought together countries which were formerly from, you know, Christian, from the Austria-Habsburg Empire, with these other countries which historically were part of the Ottoman Empire.  And so there's a civilizational tension there almost, which makes it a bit different from, say, Italian irredentism.  But I think it is interesting that a kind of millennial pop superstar is talking about ethno-nationalism.  And I do think it's an important point to talk about that.  a lot of the kind of identity politics, when we talk about... people coming from the Global South.  It can, I don't think it often does, but it can purge into forms of ethno-nationalism.  Even the idea around cultural appropriation.  Cultural appropriation is bad.  I'm not saying it's a good thing.  But the idea that culture is a fixed thing, which is immutable, that only certain people can perform in certain places.  For me personally, I don't see a huge jump between that and ethno-nationalism, or at least not recognising immediately that ethno-nationalism is quite a bad thing.  And by extension of that, we see often with discussions around Israel, people say, well, Israel's got the right to self-determination.  If we're being serious about international protocol, Jewish settlers have been there en masse since at least the early 20th century.  You can make a pretty solid argument about that.  But then it becomes this kind of idpol thing of historical repression, ergo means an ethnostate, which right now is quite rare.  But I think it's becoming quite a salient thing amongst younger people.  It's kind of like this thing.  That's quite worrying.  We need to have political identities forged on values and togetherness and meaning rather than the colour of your skin or the language that your parents might speak.  And it's strange to me because Dua Lipa is, for me, again, I might be wrong, she's British.  She's a British Albanian.  And so if you're asking for an ethnostate, be careful because then you're not going to last here very long.  I think it is in many ways actually expressing some quite important political conversations we've got to have on the left. ",

            "text": "No, not necessarily.  I don't necessarily see that link.  But what I do think is true, and I was wondering if you'd agree with this, Aaron, is that sometimes when you have people who live in the diaspora and they're, you know, that one stage removed from their heritage culture than their parents, maybe two steps removed.  You do find sometimes people of our generation, our age group and younger going for really reactionary ideologies.  Yeah.  as a way of feeling closer to a culture, a place, a way of being that they're fundamentally really, really distant from.  I remember when I was at school, for instance, there was a girl in my class who, you know, she had Hindutva everything.  You know those clear big art folders that you had to take in?  It was Hindutva branding and she had that kind of very funny mix of bourgeois, Indian, Hindutva, but also kind of entrepreneurial, go get a spirit, kind of mainlining Reaganism.  She was a really funny girl.  But as that kind of looking for a meaning and a history which has very contemporary, potentially very violent and very oppressive consequences, but because you're that one step distance from it, you're a little bit, I don't want to be patronizing to anyone, but you're a bit ignorant.  You're a bit ignorant of its full consequences.  Your parents and your grandparents are the ones you have to live with the nuance.  They're the ones who have to live with the facts that nations are diverse and you might feel really strongly about an ethno state, but actually your neighbor is Serbian and they're ill and you take them there shopping every week and you don't actually want to see them kicked out, right?  We all have to exist in the gray area.  where there aren't these hard and fast rules.  But when you're that generation removed, you can look back and turn things up to high contrast.  I'm not sure if I'm expressing it well, but do you know what I mean?  It's a generational thing. ",

Something that Ash and I share that sadly you don't have with us, Michael, is that we're the descendants of people who weren't from here.  And so for people in Britain in the 21st century, it's about forging a meaningful identity that allows us to be happy and live well.  And I think that's a really important conversation again for the left to have.  And I think often there's this bizarre, vacuous, insipid thing about, oh, you know, Englishness or Britishness.  I mean, I'm not into that.  I don't like it.  But clearly, you know, we live in this political entity, which is actually incredibly mixed and diverse.  And I wonder what kinds of togetherness we can forge in the 21st century.  To me, that's a more appealing political project than politics.  some faraway ethno state that actually, I think, if anything, appealing to that is a reflection of alienation, right?  I think that by necessity, appealing to some abstract ethno state from a place you're not even living in, I think reflects a feeling of unease at the same time in the place that you are living in.  And so I think for people of mixed heritage, I think for people whose parents are from other places, I can understand why that's appealing, the Hindutva stuff and so on.  But I don't think it's going to help anyone.  I don't think it's a particularly nice way to live.  I don't think you'll be particularly happy doing it generally.  But I do think there's a project there for people on the left to talk about coming together and forms of collectivity in the here and now, which aren't a reflection of alienation, but actually the opposite.
