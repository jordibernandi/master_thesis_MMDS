            "text": "We are the children of the one you have.  You are the chosen of the one you have.  And he has given his life.  Any question?  What book do we read before the Bible?  You've been drinking?  Yes.  We went by oral tradition.  Yeah, go to Genesis and get me the story of Cain.  No, I'm not proving the Bible.  I'm proving oral tradition.  Wait, wait, wait.  One thing at a time.  Go to the book of Genesis, get me Cain and Abel.  I'm going to show you something, brother.  I'm not using the Bible to prove the Bible.  I'm using the Bible to prove oral tradition.  You got it?  Read.  What did he just do?  He did what?  He brought his what?  And it's also called a what with an S?  He brought a sacrifice.  How he know to do a sacrifice if the Bible was not written and given to him yet?  Because it was written in the heart.  It was the tables of his heart that it was written on.  Alright?  Give me Hebrews 8 and 8.  The Most High tried to take you back to that.  Hold on.  The Most High tried to take you back to that.  Where the law is written?  where?  In your heart.  You know why we need instruction?  You know why every man must teach his neighbor?  Because you went to slavery.  Coming out of slavery, what did you have to learn?  You had to learn how to stand up.  Yo, the black man coming out of slavery wouldn't even raise his voice in public.  That's how far they broke you down.  Coming out of slavery, you had to learn how to lead a family.  Because in slavery, they put the black woman in different special privileges than the man.  And made him very diminutive because he was the threat.  So you had to learn how to be a man again after slavery.  You know what else you had to learn after slavery?  How to serve God.  Now when I read that, I don't see no new covenant with the house of Ammon, with the house of Esau, with the house of Moab, with the house of Ishmael.  I see a new covenant with the Israelites though.  Read on.  Now according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, I came and saved them out of the land of their captivity and brought them to their own land.  This brother says it's a lie.  You know what's a lie?  What is a Jew?  What is a Jew?  What is a Jew?  What is a Jew?  Man, that's a lie.  Brother, who are the Shasu?  Who are the Shasu people?  Who are the Shasu people, brother?  Hold up.  That's a lie.  It's called the Shasu.  Look up the Shasu right now.  Brother, no, no.  First off, are Egyptologist men?  Are Egyptologist men?  Do they write books?  So don't reference them and then criticize me for that.  All right?  Catch yourself.  Listen, that's irrelevant.  Brother, brother, that's irrelevant.  Can you stick to one question?  Can you stick to one question?  No, because here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  You ask a question when you get cut on it.  instead of conceding and admitting that you just scratched your dick at yourself, you change questions.  Now, he's good.  He's good.  He's good.  He's good.  He's good.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen, brother.  Listen, brother.  Do you know who the shouts are on?  Listen, listen, listen.  First off, no one said God wrote a book.  Men wrote the book.  Men write books.  Listen, listen, listen.  Prove me what the shape of the earth is.  Move it!  Move it!  Move it!  Move it!  Move it!  Have you ever seen the other side of the moon?  Have you ever seen the other side of the moon?  Have you ever seen the other side of the moon?  So how do you know what's on the other side of it?  You've never seen it.  Because the white man told you, you're a hypocrite.  That's what you are.  You're nothing but a hypocrite.  You take whatever the white man says at face value.  Hey brother, the Egyptian cosmology is a flat earth.  Why do you think they got sick arching over a flat plane like that?  They believe in a firmament.  No, no, no.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  What if you said it's been right yet?  You called all these gods ignorant.  I didn't call you ignorant.  You called every god to be ignorant, right?  I said, okay.  We know.  We know.  We know.  You listen to the Egyptologists like it's fact.  Word.  Are Egyptologists scientists?  No, it's not.  It's an academic discipline, but it's not a science.  It's not a science.  It's history.  It's not science.  That's different.  No.  No, it's not.  It's not.  Google Egyptology.  That's right.  Just Google Egyptology.  We're going to Google Egyptology.  So you cannot get a Ph.D.  in Egyptology.  Yes or no?  What are you talking about?  Egyptology is the study of ancient Egyptian history.  What history?  Language, literature, religion, architecture, and art.  Where was science in that?  See these niggas get all hyped up on this Egypt so they have no idea what they be talking about.  The brother ain't want to just deal with it.  It's foolishness.  He's drinking.  He's feeling foolishness.  The brother ain't even want to deal with this simplicity, man.  Niggas ain't talking about nothing.  No God, brother.  I know.  Holy men wrote the book by the inspiration of God, though.  That's what we're saying.  Right?  We know that Yahweh didn't come down here and say, here's the Bible, guys.  Right?  That's not exactly how it worked.  Right?  But he gave instructions to men.  Right?  Go ahead.  Precept, go ahead, slide.  This is the book of 1 Timothy, chapter 6, verse 19.  I'm going to start at 20.  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings.  That's what the brother was doing, avoid.  This dude come up here drunk with profane and vain babblings and don't know a damn thing.  Avoid it.  Read.  opposition of science in opposition to what science falsely so-called false science.  that's not even science.  he calls something science.  that's not a science.  it's the study of a people.  you have egyptology you have a seriology.  these are ancient empires that people study.  that's not scientific Right?  That's historical.  You're looking at what these people believe in.  What's the science to spell 700?  I'm still waiting for somebody to say, you would have stuck around long enough.  You would have asked them about that.  What's the science to give sodomizing the son?  I need to know the science on that.  These guys are crazy, man.  They don't know a damn thing and they want to gainsay the Bible.  What book will we read before the Bible?  Well, like the brother said, that's what everybody did.  All traditions.  Before you write stuff down, what did you do?  You talked about it, right?  And eventually what?  Somebody wrote it down.  But what is Egyptology?  And first off, you're not even, he's not even an Egyptologist.  He just knows about certain things that Egyptologists have said.  But we ask him, there was no slavery in Egypt.  Who are the Shasu?  Who are the Shasu?  Who are the Shasu that had a deity by the name of Yehawah?  Who was that people?  Right?  Who?  Amimisi came and led out in a rebellion after he killed the Fohotep who was a slave overseer.  Who is that?  Don't tell me nothing about the Israelites and then the Bible.  That's madness, man.  We study the Bible.  We study history.  We study science.  We study all those things because Yahweh has given us the Holy Spirit to do so, man.  But I'm going to get back to the Adonai and Joel.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, brother asked him who to shout to.  That brother started tap dancing.  He did.  Man, feet was moving.  Hey, the elder called for Psalms 81 and 5.  Read that.  Psalms 81 and 5.  All right.  Hey.  this is all i ask for you egyptologists.  this is what i ask can you translate one hieroglyph for me?  i didn't ask for two i asked for one one just one.  can you give me half a translation of one?  how about you?  just translate two or three characters and tell me what that's?  but you believe that you understand hypocrisy really This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that I understood not.  This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that I understood not.  Brothers dealing with being Hamites, they really Israelites, man.  You say you heard of what?  I heard a language that I understood not.  The most high.  He said he went through Egypt, he heard a language he didn't even understand.  So we ain't dealing with that.  No matter what they say, we ain't dealing with them.  Period.  Right?  If you had an understanding of not understanding their language, whatever they saying, we ain't dealing with them.  Period.  Point blank.  You see that?  They don't know what them people talking about, man.  Hey, but you know, Satan always comes and try to take it the way it were, but he can't do it out here.  Look at his gathering.  and strong, man.  Hey, I always say this, though.  When somebody come on Scarper, Israel descend on that man.  His loins was fastened.  Yeah.  Brothers, what?  You don't believe the Bible?  Like, the brother Bowles was failing him.  Y'all was scaring him, man.  Be merciful to the Scarper.  Let him hang around a little bit.  I wanted to know about the Shasul.  He ran.  Hey, I'm going to tell you something, his woman had more wisdom than him.  She did.  She said, right over here.  She was like, he drunk. ",

All right?  We trying to show you blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics that y'all are the same family according to the Bible.  All right?  All the archaeology points back to it.  All the history points back to it.  You go to New Mexico right now, you see the Decalogue Stone, got the Ten Commandments in Hebrew, elevation 1,800 feet up in the air.  Who put that up there?  Right?  You read the book Lost Tribes in Promised Land, and this is Esau's account, who came off them boats, and the Native Americans met us with Deuteronomy 6 and 4.  Because they thought, well, these must be our brothers coming from afar.  only to be deceived.  There was verse 48 and through 50 of Deuteronomy 28, that nation that came from afar to put them chains of iron.  That's who Esau really is. ",
