            "text": "Tonight, protests across America after a grand jury finds that two police officers were justified in Breonna Taylor's death.  Another officer was charged with recklessly firing into a neighbor's apartment But no one was charged with killing Breonna Taylor.  Joining us now, CNN law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey.  He's the former Philadelphia police commissioner and former DC police chief.  Also with us is retired LAPD Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey.  She's the author of Black and Blue, The Creation of a Social Advocate.  Great to see both of you.  Sergeant Dorsey, I want to start with you.  What is your takeaway from the conclusions reached yesterday by the grand jury and attorney general there? ",

We know that there were several residents who said they didn't hear the officers announced, but he chose to present the one who said they did.  And when you understand that this AG is a Trump ally and reportedly engaged to the granddaughter of Moscow Mitch, it all makes sense.  I find it offensive and appalling. ",

They were justified in returning fire.  Now, that doesn't lessen the tragedy of Breonna Taylor's death at all.  And certainly the third officer should have been charged criminally.  But the fact that one officer was not only fired upon, was actually struck by gunfire, returned fire, I just don't see where a criminal charge would be presented there.  As tragic as this whole thing is, I think.  one issue, though, that didn't get attention from the Attorney General is why they were there in the first place.  The warrant itself.  Now, the officers that executed the warrant were not the ones that applied for the warrant. ",

He thought somebody violent was breaking into their home.  He says repeatedly they didn't identify themselves.  He's legally allowed to have self-defense and to fire his gun.  He owned it legally.  So if he's justified in firing that shot, which he is legally, and the police are justified in firing back, The system's broken in that case. ",

We know that they arrested him or at least transported him and held him for several days after the shooting.  And so I think if what they're saying is true.  Kenneth Walker would be facing attempted murder charges against a police officer, those who entered a residence serving a legitimate search warrant and making an announcement that they're the police coming in, and that didn't happen.  And so everything that we've heard reported by this police department has been intellectually dishonest from start to finish.  An officer fired 16 rounds without reassessing a threat, just willy-nilly shooting, and none of the bullets hit Kenneth Walker, six hit Breonna Taylor. ",
