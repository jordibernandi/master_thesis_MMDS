            "text": "All right, people.  I'm going to confess to you, much as the case for almost every relevant musician, I have no idea what a Billie Eilish is.  I'm still not entirely sure.  They seem to be well-liked, you know?  um but there was recently some drama and i thought i'd talk about it.  i saw now i saw billy at the dnc thing and i didn't know anything.  i didn't know what billy's gender identity was because they wore super baggy clothing and they looked depressed.  uh i had no idea.  they seemed cool like i don't know they seemed cool.  um But anyway, just the other day, I saw this, and somehow this one tweet turned into a fucking trending topic on Twitter, okay?  And it's Billie Eilish, and I beg of you, I know you're all horny because you haven't had sex in the three minutes since I said you guys can't have sex anymore, so try not to horny post for this, okay?  It's very antithetical to what I'm trying to go for here.  You can horny post later, this is not the time to horny post, okay?  But anyway... here she is having a body and being outside.  uh as you can see uh judging from the light we can tell that she's outside and uh uh judging from the fact that uh Her physical form is opaque.  We can assume light is not passing through it, so we know she physically exists in the material world.  And yeah.  Anyway, somebody made fun of how she looks, and this spawned a bunch of people making fun of that person, but the tabloids apparently make fun of her as well.  And, um... Anyway, so there's a person, okay?  And I just wanted to talk about this for a second.  Do you guys know the origin story of Vosh?  Do you even know?  It didn't used to always be fucking election coverage and socialism and race and crime and all that crap.  It used to be just honest-to-God old feminism.  That used to be the shit that really got me.  You know, the male feminists.  um whatever the case is it was the male feminism that ended up planting the seeds for me doing what i'm doing today because my first argument with destiny like six years ago was over.  i think like anita sarkisian and like shit reddit says which was all like feminist oriented stuff.  but we we can get back to my roots here and i just wanted to talk for a second about this.  okay so This is a person.  Some people are saying she looks ugly.  And there are a lot of people who are saying... Well, to counter the people saying that she's ugly, I will say she's actually very pretty.  And that's fine.  I think she looks quite nice, too.  But that's not really the important issue here.  The important issue is... And please forgive me for the livery here, okay?  I know... Ah, this feels so lip-shitty to say.  But if... You have to be able to listen to this, otherwise we're getting a little bit too far from our roots here, okay?  People treat women really fucking weird.  People treat women so fucking weird, dude.  It's so fucking... Listen, I've been into gaming my whole life, okay?  Always, always, always, okay?  And early on in my life, I was weird with women, too.  I think it's kind of natural for, like, 12-year-old boys to be kind of weird around girls.  It's influenced by society as well, but there's sort of a natural uneasiness as you get used to puberty or whatever.  But I feel like a lot of people never leave that phase, you know?  A lot of people just... They can be like, okay, 14, they're weird about girls.  And then, like, 19 and you're weird about girls?  Like... Okay.  Um... Alright.  The issue is, I hate to blame gaming culture for this, you know, I really do, because I like games, and there are good people who play games, but man, have you guys ever played, like, Halo, or Call of Duty, or Counter-Strike with the mic, you know, you have to have the mic, and a girl says something?  Every time you hear a feminine voice in any voiced program online, you know what's going to happen.  Girl!  Girl!  Show me your fucking titties right now.  You fucking suck at this game.  You fucking loser.  Are you sipping, bro?  Are you sipping for that girl, bro?  no dude I'm just playing with her.  are you sipping for that bro?  no I'm just playing with you.  show me your pussy like.  the shit is fucking insane and it's every time even in other communities like in overwatch for example.  overwatch has a lot of women like overwatch because it's sparkly and pretty and girls tiny brains can latch onto the bright colors.  they can't appreciate the sophisticated high IQ gameplay of Gears of War Online.  But anyway, dude.  There are so many little ways that we destroy girls' confidence.  And I don't mean this in some fucking pussy-ass, like, we need to be nice to all girls.  I just mean, like, let's not be terrible people to other people for no reason.  A lot of it's with comedy, too.  You know?  With comedy, everyone says girls aren't funny.  You know what?  Here's my hot take.  I do think, on average, men are funnier than women.  It's not because women aren't funny.  It's because we fucking brutalize women who try to be funny.  We destroy women who try to be funny, so they stop trying.  In middle school and high school, if girls try to make, like, jokes or they try to be jovial or class clowns or any of the things that, like, assist a person in getting to be funnier, you know, you have to practice that shit.  Nobody just becomes funny.  I know I made plenty of cringey fucking jokes back when I was in middle and high school.  You know, you have to work at that.  When guys do it, you know, you can get made fun of, sure, but there's not, like, this brutal fucking condemnation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But when girls do it, either they get ruthlessly mocked, ignored, or they get called flirts.  Girls will be called sluts for making jokes because it's assumed the only reason they would ever make jokes is to attract attention and cock, you know?  Which is funny because most of the reason guys make jokes in high school is in the hopes of getting laid.  Vainly.  So I don't know what that double standard means.  But the, um... The, uh... But there are so many things we do to fuck this over.  Why do girls not like games that much?  At least relative to men.  It's getting better.  It is getting better.  But why?  Well, it's not because girls and computers don't mix.  Girls were actually disproportionately represented back in the early days of computer development.  You know, not pussy ass, I can no scope and call of duty, but like building the fundamental blocks of how computer logic allows us to now literally like building the path, you now drag your ass along, leaving a skid mark, you know?  And, but so why with the girls?  Well, historically, the reason girls didn't get that much into computer shit is because it started getting marketed to boys.  Go look at all the commercials ye back in the 90s and early 2000s about video games and everything computer-related.  These were not gender-neutral commercials, dude.  These were, like... These commercials were like Dennis with spiked hair, frosted tips and sunglasses, skateboards through a window, and fucking throws an early Apple computer at you, and it explodes.  And in the explosion, you see Sonic the Hedgehog duking it out with Halo Master Chief or whatever.  These were very, very heavily coded commercials.  And, uh, and girls who did this shit got made fun of because it was boyish and, you know, like, wouldn't you rather play with a doll, whatever.  And we get this whole problem wraps around now.  And now we got the fucking appearance thing, like with, with, with Bill, Billster, the Bill, the Bill, Bilbo over here, you know?  And it's like.  Yeah, so to be perfectly clear, okay, there are some people who make fun of my appearance.  I also have like a really huge hate base, like a hate fan base, like a really, really big one, you know?  So it's kind of expected they would default to those attacks because they're mad that all my ideas are good and they're stupid and they can't understand them.  It's, you know, that's how it goes, typically.  But for the most part, nobody really makes fun of... Of how I look.  Like, generally speaking, I don't get denied respect for how I look.  You know?  I'm chillin'.  Like, I can come on here looking like shit.  I put no makeup on before any stream.  I haven't trimmed my beard in probably a month.  I don't care.  My camera's at a downward angle.  It looks fine.  I don't care.  I wear the same four shirts.  I wear gray sweatpants.  And nobody gives me shit.  Nobody gives me shit.  Nobody gives me... I can be completely secure in looking like whatever.  Have you?  Maybe you guys don't.  See, because I'm an industry insider, I've talked to girls who... Yeah, people call me a Chad just for... Well, they call me a Chad for my confidence, not my looks.  And I'll take that badge.  If you want to give that to me, sure, I'll take it.  I'll wear it on my lapel.  But the... I've talked to girls who work in the industry, you know, streamers, of course, and there's this constant underlying anxiety that... Not just girls, femmes, anyone who's femme.  There's constant underlying anxiety about your appearance.  If you're too attractive and you're a female or femme streamer or whatever, you get made fun of for being a slut, for trying too hard, all this crap, you know?  And if you're femme and you don't, you know, and you have like a blemish or you're a little chubby or whatever, you get ruthlessly mocked.  You know?  People get made... If you're a girl, you get made fun of your appearance for fucking anything.  Does everyone remember the Pokimane leafy drama?  Pokimane is like a... I mean, again, I really don't think the actual attractiveness here is relevant to the dignity a person deserves.  But I think that, like, Pokimane is a perfectly... Fine, I know, yeah, Leafy making fun of anyone's appearance, I know.  But, like, this is what Pokimane looks like, you know?  It's good, yeah, it's Pokimane, you know?  Great, okay, I think... But Pokimane, to me, like, when I think of Pokimane, I don't think anything relating to Pokimane's appearance.  I think that, you know, she's, like, pleasant-looking, I guess, if my opinion matters, but... people still make fun of her like a lot but but it's in both directions.  they make fun of her for being a whore who cakes on a ton of makeup to to be a slut to get donos and people make fun of her for being ugly.  and there's the fact of the matter is there really is no golden ratio here.  there's no like you know there's no perfect uh proportion of trying too hard and not trying enough If you're a femme online.  And it's just, it's really dumb.  And the only reason I'm saying all of this, to collect my woke virtue signaling points, the only reason I'm pointing this out is because, let's be real, okay?  Let's be real.  Oh, check this.  Hold on.  Some Billy lore, and it got famous at 17.  Imagine getting famous at 17.  I'm a fucking idiot, and I'm semi-famous at 26, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  People were like counting down Billie Eilish turning 18.  I remember that.  You do that.  They do that with every celebrity.  I remember the Kate and Olsen twins getting the countdown to 18.  I remember that shit too, yeah.  There were entire boards dedicated to it back in like the... Well, I don't remember when they turned 18.  My timeline might be a bit off here.  But I remember there were like internet boards dedicated to it back 10 years ago or something like that.  And it was like... only four more days till hypothetically, if I came across them, I could rape them and it wouldn't be statutory rape, just regular rape, like that kind of shit.  You know what I mean?  Um, okay.  That's maybe extra creepy.  That happens to every single underage female, uh, celebrity, every single one, every single one.  I'm not kidding.  Every single one.  There are people who, uh, uh, uh, track till 18.  It happens to every single one.  Um, yeah.  But whatever the case is, you know, it's all really dumb.  But let's be real.  The point of this isn't like to say, oh, what a Queen Billie Eilish.  I don't know who the fuck Billie Eilish is.  I don't care.  The thing that actually matters here is how fucking pathetic the men who obsess over this are because it is so obviously reflective of insecurity.  It is fucking insane to me.  you know what i mean.  they'll never know it too like.  they'll never reflect on that.  so they'll always think that they're just like the.  you know like the vigilante joker you think i'm crazy.  well she's not even a size two.  I don't know how big a size 2 is.  I don't actually know.  They'll always think they're like crazy truth tellers who are just sticking it to the man and showing it how it is.  But in reality, they are like very desperately insecure people.  Have you ever met a guy like that who was happy with their life?  Has there ever been a person who's happy with their life and then goes on Overwatch voice chat to shit talk women or who goes on Twitter to make fun of people for being size 4?  It never happens.  You're broadcasting.  You're projecting so fucking hard.  You are broadcasting.  your insecurities to the world.  You're projecting them onto a screen the size of a fucking skyscraper's wall.  It is crazy.  And you know, the lesson here, if there is any lesson to be derived from this aimless rant, is... Obsessing over other people's bodies kind of makes you a fucking cuck because your eyeballs are being cucked by their bodies.  Okay, you need to chill.  Don't allow yourself to be cucked like that.  Just fucking chill.  If you actually want a good lesson on how to balance the body shit or whatever, as a person who... used to be really into fitness uh people who are just at the gym and like work out all the time and have basically physically flawless bodies these people don't give a fuck.  if other people are chubby okay if you go to the gym and you talk to the one guy in his mid-30s who has like a office job but still somehow looks like a looks like a model underneath the suit this person isn't fucking obsessing over other people.  no this guy's just getting his reps in.  okay fucking chill jesus.  um Now, mind you, even if you're super fit, I don't think that gives you a right to be shitty to other people about how they look.  But whatever the case may be, it's just a. it's just a really like pathetic trait.  You know, I have never been in a in a in a voice chat in a game and heard a guy go, oh, you make me a sandwich fucking framework.  And I thought, damn, you know, wow, that guy's got a life I want to live.  You know, yeah, that that guy what that guy's got going on.  That's that's what I want, you know.  I've never seen... I've never felt that, I gotta say.  Maybe that's my lack of perspective, okay?  Maybe that's me being weak.  Maybe if I was a stronger man, an alpha male, I would see people on Twitter screaming about fat rolls for celebrities that they've never met and think, yeah... What a fucking champion of Western virtue.  But alas, I am not.  I am but a beta male who thinks that's actually really fucking weird behavior.  I don't know.  Okay, okay. ",
