She came to America as a teenager over 20 years ago without papers in search of a better life.  She married my dad, who served our country as a Marine in South America, Africa, and Iraq.  My mom worked hard and paid taxes and the Obama administration told her she could stay.  My dad thought you would protect military families, so he voted for you in 2016, Mr.  President.  He says he won't vote for you again after what you did to our family. ",

Every day that passes, you deport more moms and dads and take them away from kids like me.  We will begin moving them out day one.  You separated thousands of children from their parents and you put them in cages.  Some of those kids are now orphans because of you.  These are our people.  I don't want them in our country.  They're animals.  Mr.  President, my mom is the wife of a proud American Marine and a mother of two American children.  We are American families.  We need a president who will bring people together, not tear them apart.  Sincerely, Estella. ",
