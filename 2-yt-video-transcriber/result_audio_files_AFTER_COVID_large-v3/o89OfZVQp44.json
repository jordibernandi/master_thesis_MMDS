            "text": "Hi, with YouTube clamping down on people who have similar opinions to myself, I've decided to basically start my channel over and now I'm just going to do movie reviews because that seems to be safe.  So the first movie... I'm going to review is Pride, right?  Pride is a movie, it's called Pride and that actually reminds me of something else, it reminds me of the police in the UK.  Did you know that in 2012 that they had to start taking an oath of impartiality, right?  But the thing is, are the police in the UK and the wider Western world, are they impartial?  Because I don't think they are.  So here it is here.  This is from the official government website, right?  Police and crime commissioners to swear an oath of impartiality.  They'll be required to pledge an oath to represent all sections of the public without fear.  favour right now.  the reason they had to start doing this was so that the average citizen can feel confident that when they phone the police or interact with the police that they won't be mistreated or even shown favour just because of the demographic they happen to be in.  right I think it's a good thing.  the police should always be impartial right but I want to.  I want to give you a couple of hypotheticals here, right?  I want you to imagine there's a Jewish fellow, right?  Imagine there was a Jewish fellow, right?  and his next-door neighbour was a Nazi, right?  Like a raging, stereotypical Nazi.  He had the Nazi tattoos, swastikas and all that, right?  Skinhead, you know, the stereotype, right?  And there's a dispute.  They've got a fence between them, and somebody has broken the fence, right?  So an argument starts, and the Jewish fellow, he phones the police, and he goes, look, can you come and sort this out?  I think my Nazi neighbour... broke my fence right.  so the police come out but they arrive in a car in the livery of the car.  Or is it livery?  I think it's livery.  The livery of the car has a big swastika on it.  And on the bonnet it's got a photo of Hitler and it says Heil Hitler underneath, right?  And then the police get out of the car and they've got little swastikas on their uniform, right?  Now, do you think that that Jewish fellow can feel confident that the police are going to be impartial in that situation?  Do you think that... he can feel confident that he'll be fairly treated by the police in that situation.  In that situation, if he knew beforehand that the police did drive a car like that and did wear a uniform like that, would he even have bothered to phone the police at all, right?  Throw in another hypothetical.  Imagine there's a white guy and he lives next door to a black guy, a militant black guy, black power, all that kind of stuff, right?  And he's like a militant black guy, right?  He's got the Africa chain and all that.  He's totally militant, right?  He's got the black glove on, you know?  And the white guy, same situation with the fence.  He phones the police.  Like, I think my neighbour has broken my fence.  You know, can you come sort it out?  The police arrive.  The livery on their car says, Black Lives Matter.  And, I don't know, there's a photo of... Malcolm X on the front of their car and then they get out and on their uniform.  it's got a little black fist black power fist right now.  do you think that in that situation that the white guy can be confident that the police will be impartial?  after all they've taken an oath right.  but can he really feel like it's going to be impartial?  and just to throw another one imagine there was a Rangers fan and a Celtic fan and the Rangers fan thinks the Celtic fan broke the fence, which, believe me, it would have been the Celtic fan because... I'm just kidding.  But just imagine that, and then the police turn up, and they've got a hail-hail, the Celts are here on their car.  Can the Rangers fan feel confident that they're going to be impartial in that situation?  But let me give you a realistic scenario, right, which could happen, and probably has happened many times.  Imagine that you've got a stereotypical heterosexual, whatever that is, just let's say he's married, he's got kids, I don't know, what else is a stereotype?  He doesn't dress well or something, I don't know, right?  And then next door to him, there's a homosexual man.  Not just a homosexual man who doesn't get in your face about it.  I'm talking about the type who's flamboyant and, well, irritating.  That's the word I'm looking for.  Now imagine that scenario.  Again, broken fence, right?  So the heterosexual man, he phones the police and he says, can you come and sort this out?  I have a dispute with my neighbours, a broken fence, and I think he broke my fence, right?  And then the impartial police who have taken an oath of impartiality, to pledge to be impartial, they arrive in this car, right?  It's got pride on it, the rainbow flag, or they arrive in this car.  Again, pride, police with pride, or maybe this car.  Pride, police, rainbow flag, a big rose there, multicoloured rose, or they arrive in this car.  rainbow stripes all the way down it.  These are police cars, by the way.  These are real police cars.  They arrive in one of these cars and then they get out of the car, right?  And they have these hats on with a rainbow stripe all across the hats, right?  or they have the kind of big thing in front of their uniform that says police in big letters and that's got a rainbow flag on it or they have a badge like this.  I know this is America and not Britain but it's just another example San Francisco police and it's got the pride colours all the way around it.  or they arrive looking like this this is from Canada again police.  they've got the rainbow flag on the police.  now.  Do you really believe that the heterosexual man who has a dispute with his homosexual neighbour, do you think he can be confident that these police officers arriving in this vehicle are going to be impartial?  Remember, they've taken a pledge of impartiality, but they arrive in this vehicle.  Do you think he can be confident that they're going to be fair?  Not necessarily take. ",
