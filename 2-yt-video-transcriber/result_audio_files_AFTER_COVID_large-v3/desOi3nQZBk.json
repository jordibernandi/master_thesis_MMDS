So I just want to give a shout out to Dr.  Joe and Mama Nasira to say thank you for, you know, sending the medicine down to me.  I really appreciate that.  So, yeah, so basically these are groundnuts and I want to talk a little bit about agriculture while I'm here.  Because as you can see, the land is fertile.  So a lot of the time when people have seen me film, you've seen me film in dry season, but many people haven't seen me film during rainy season.  So I want to show you how lush and green Gambia is during rainy season and believe you me, everybody is planting, everybody is farming right now.  Agriculture is a bone of the GDP, a bone of the financial infrastructure of the Gambia.  that's why it's so so important um that when you come here you know you try to come to small farms local farms meet some local farmers.  i'm hoping that we can go to Fonny.  i want to take you down there and um show you where we've been doing the seed project.  uh you know and contributing to Mansa's project you know got to pick up Mansa for doing that.  so you can also go and see some farming landing you know and maybe you can work out something with the local farmers where you can do a project because you know that'll be really amazing for you to do that while you're here.  i'm all about giving back and i'm all about you know us keeping it real while we're here and adding to uh you know the lives of you know our fellow brethren and sisters you know that's what it's about.  so i'm glad you got to see this beautiful area and it's got palms in it as well.  that's what i love.  it's got really nice trees cashew trees and like i said before there are many varieties of palms here in the gambia some of which you can harvest as well for palm nuts and also these other nuts which are really nice and you can get palm oil you can get palm wine you can get palm everything you can get palm so many things.  but um it's just nice being out here in nature.  do you know what i mean?  it's just nice feeling one and living in peace.  so man it's very brutal hanging a lot.  it is beautiful.  yeah yeah i'm just feeling i'm feeling the vibe right now i'm just feeling emotional right now.  yeah you're home.  yeah yeah for sure i'm like wow i'm really and and your land ain't far from here you know that.  yeah it's just over that way.  so and it's very much like this.  So I can't wait for us to go and see it as well together.  It's going to be amazing.  Mankanase in Mandinka and Mankanase in Wolof.  And this is a very important medicinal plant.  And it can be used for if you've got food poisoning or malaria.  You dig up the root.  The root of this is like a yam.  That's why I can't pull it. ",
