This very ugly, toothless, no-lip woman walked up to a Black family.  in a Walmart parking lot and accused them, falsely accused them, okay, because she lied.  She falsely accused them of stealing her car.  And they ended up getting attacked by multiple people over this false accusation over them stealing her vehicle.  Let me go ahead and play this video.

            "text": "no, no, no, no, Okay.  So, ladies and gentlemen, this allegation was false.  You know, I wouldn't even be surprised if this was the Klan or some neo-Nazi group that planned this whole thing on this family.  So this is what happened.  You know, kids were in the car.  That's a damn shame.  So as you saw, it was a toothless white woman that came up.  I don't know what the hell that was that came up to the window and made the accusation.  And I really think they planned this whole thing on this family.  You know, y'all can tell me what you think in the comments section.  But I think this was a planned attack.  They were going to do this to anybody black that came along.  And what kind of person don't know their own vehicle?  Seriously, what kind of person don't know that?  this whole thing just didn't make any sense?  It just looks stupid.  And all of those people on the motorcycles, this was a deliberate act, y'all.  I'm sure not fooled by none of it.  It's a deliberate act.  This is a shocking moment.  A Black family were forced to flee after being accused of stealing their own car as bystanders attacked the vehicle with bikes.  Yeah, because it was a white woman making the accusation.  And it was a Black family in the vehicle.  So, you know, in this country, they're going to automatically believe her toothless ass.  So footage taken outside a Walmart in Spokane, Washington shows The incident unfold as a woman approached the car and accused a father of two, Lee Allen, of stealing the family vehicle he was driving.  His daughter, who was in the backseat, recorded the footage while sobbing as bystanders gathered and became violent after immediately taking the side of the woman.  Yeah, well, you know, you got to teach your daughter when it comes down to race, they will do that.  It don't matter if the woman is telling the truth or not.  They're going to side with her automatically based on skin color only.  The woman who was riding a push bike and was wearing a crucifix claimed the car was her property and she stood in front of the vehicle blocking its way.  She shouted at Alan, this is my car.  How did you get this car?  I don't want violence.  I just want to know how did you get this car?  Instead of standing there, if he really took your car, wouldn't you be calling the police and reporting it?  Why didn't she call the cops instead of confronting somebody that stole your car?  Mr.  Allen then attempted to drive past those blocking him, at which point a man stood in front of the car.  And as you saw, one man was riding a damn hood.  And I don't think it was a coincidence that these people were all on motorcycles.  I don't believe that.  Okay, so Mr.  Allen then asked his son to call 911.  The video has gone viral after Mr.  Allen shared it to social media in early March.  So this happened in March.  You know, it's amazing how all these Black incidents just keep coming out on social media months later.  Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Taylor, you know, everything is coming out.  Even McLean, Elijah McLean, that was a year ago.  So they never show you this at the time.  it's happening, you know, and I believe this is a deliberate act also.  It was filmed on February 28th before the Black Lives Matter protests that followed George Floyd's death begun.  Wow.  Mr.  Miller stated, just to explain something, this is her car.  At which point, Mr.  Allen slammed the door shut to protect his family.  Mr.  Miller's fingers were caught in the door.  Well, he had no business walking up and grabbing on no door anyway.  It was not his right to do that.  which appeared to enrage him.  So what?  It wasn't his right to do it.  The man attempted to maneuver his car away from the crowd as Mr.  Miller started to shout profanities and Mr.  Allen's daughter began to wail in fear.  A man jumped onto the hood, this dude with his hand in his jacket, I guess he was trying to look intimidating.  Um, He jumped on the hood, making it impossible to drive away safely while the crowd continued to bang on the car.  One bystander even attacked the vehicle with a bike.  Mr.  Allen continued to drive with the man on his hood of his car and a motorbike chased him, chased behind him, as you saw in the footage.  Mr.  Allen told KHQ, Q6, I knew I was going to keep my kids protected no matter what.  If all fails, I could just step on the gas pedal and shout out like a rocket.  Yeah, you know, so I understand what he was trying to do.  He was just trying to get his family out of harm's way.  Boy.  I mean, that was just so sad listening to his daughter crying in the backseat because she was afraid.  Mr.  Miller, who was riding the motorbike behind Mr.  Allen's car, claimed he was only trying to get the man to stop so the man on his hood could get off.  That's bullshit.  He had no business getting on that hood in the first place.  He ain't no cop.  He ain't no authority.  He told the broadcaster the kid jumps on the car.  What do I do now?  I've got to get this kid off the car.  I don't know if this guy knows who's driving the car, but if the kid falls off and he runs over and kills that kid, well, he had no business being up there.  He'll go to prison for murder.  Well, all of y'all should be going to prison for falsely claiming someone took this ugly woman's car.  She lied.  She lied.  And all of you that participated and automatically believed her, all of you need to be arrested.  Everybody there that attacked this Black family should be arrested.  After he glared his horn and flashed his light, the occupant of the car believed that Mr.  Miller wished to do them harm.  And I would, too.  The way he was around the car and opened the door and everything, I would have believed that, too.  Mr.  Miller told KHQQ, I don't harm kids.  I raised a daughter.  Oh, I don't want to hear all that mess.  This dude now trying to defend what he did.  No, get out of here.  What you did was wrong.  This woman lied and you just automatically believed her and then turned on this family for no reason.  Mr.  Miller said the whole scenario was an unfortunate misunderstanding of And he has been threatened since.  Who cares?  So he's claiming he's been threatened since the video went viral.  No, you put yourself out there like that.  I don't feel bad for you.  Meaning he had to stay away from his family for their safety.  Well, you threatened the safety of this man and his family.  So the Spokane Sheriff's Office want to speak to the man who threw his bike at the car in the video, asking anyone with information to call.  So they just have the number of the sheriff's office.  However, they told KHQQ6 that they do not believe Mr.  Miller will be charged today.  in retaliation to the incident.  Well, he should be charged.  Everybody there, the person that got on the hood of the vehicle, the raggedy looking woman that made the lie up that her vehicle was being stolen, and Miller, who approached the vehicle and opened the door, all of you need to be charged.  Every last one of you.  He don't need to get let off for nothing.  Y'all, please tell me what you think.  Please leave your comment and subscribe.  Don't forget to hit on the notification bell, and I'll see you on the next video.  Peace, family. ",
