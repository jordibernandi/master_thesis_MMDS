A member of the Flat Earth came forward and presented the Flat Earth arguments in response to these questions.  So far, the first nine have been very unsuccessful for them, but I have high hopes for number 10.  Actually, no, I don't, because this is the most difficult of all of them.  do anything scientific and have it published in a reputable, peer-reviewed science journal.  So let's cue up the music and see how they try and get out of this one. ",

You think that because somebody is scientifically literate, they are automatically part of a plot, a conspiracy, if you would, to suppress your efforts to reveal the truth and sell t-shirts on YouTube.  Well, let me give you a little hint here.  Nature is an excellent scientific journal.  It has a very wide range of editors and reviewers that look at all articles that are submitted to Nature.  Not one of those reviewers gives a rat's ass about your silly little conspiracy theory.  So I think that if you actually have something scientific, It really won't matter that you have truth seeker in your name or description.  Your data and conclusions will stand on their own.  And if they stand up to scientific scrutiny as being legitimate, they'll be approved.  We have strange ideas come out in science all the time.  Einstein came up with a very strange and novel idea with his theory of special relativity and his theory of relativity.  It bore the review of the scientific community.  Will your data do that?  Will your experiments do that?  Let's find out.  Why don't you try and do an experiment? ",

When they are presented with evidence, and classic examples include Bob Nodal demonstrating the rotation of the Earth, and Jaron demonstrating the curvature of the Earth, even when their own experiments clearly show the Earth is a sphere.  They spend hour upon hour trying to come up with some convoluted explanation that somehow fits in their narrative.  That's not scientific review, Chief.  Try again. ",

The challenge was do a scientific experiment and have it published in a reputable scientific journal with peer review.  I would suggest nature.  You too could be the next Einstein to come up with a revolutionary idea that sets all of science on its ear.

It's very convenient when you put something out and then you judge it and don't submit to the review of anybody else.  But there's a lot of us out here who do take you seriously because this is a very dangerous thing to have in society.  The lack of critical thinking, the lack of reasoning skills is a detriment to our society.  So what we do in the debunking community is we look at your claims.  We evaluate them from a scientific basis.  We point out where you went wrong.  And in many cases, we try and teach you something.  Now, it's very evident that you don't want to learn anything.  You are not interested in the truth.  You're interested in your narrative.  But some of the people that are watching these videos are indeed interested in the truth and would like to learn something.  And that's a function that we fill here on YouTube.  We are a counter to nonsense like you put out.  So this is kind of a yin and yang type thing.  You put out crap.  We point it out as crap and give the correct information.  People who review these videos on both sides get to see both.  Hopefully, they go with the real information that we provide.  You may gain a follower or two.  We may stop a hundred from going down that silly rabbit hole that you went down three years ago. ",

Is there a stock market listing for flat earth and round earth?  I mean, can you point any of that out?  How do I invest in the globe earth?  Now, we pretty much just deal with reality.  We're amused by people that deny reality.  But we don't gain financially or politically or anything else by the fact the Earth is a sphere.  I personally don't care what shape the Earth is.  As it turns out, it is a sphere.  I don't care.  I deal with it.  If the Earth was flat, I'd deal with that.  I don't care either way.  The bottom line, though, is the Earth is a sphere.
