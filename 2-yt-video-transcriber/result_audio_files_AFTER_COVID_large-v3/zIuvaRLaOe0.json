            "text": "Electric cars, despite the subsidization and lobbying.  How much subsidization?  To the point where my wife wanted to get a Tesla.  Not because we wanted a Tesla, because she wanted a self-driving car.  Don't buy a new car.  It's the same.  Ever.  It is better for you to buy an old 85 Bronco than that new Tesla.  First off, I don't want a Tesla.  Sorry, Tim from HR.  I don't like... Right now, many of you have asked me this.  Have you ever changed your mind on anything?  And to be clear, the reason for change my mind is to present your position in the affirmative and allow other people to make an argument.  And that's because a lot of people are busy trying to score points.  And the idea for change my mind is to listen to someone make their case.  That being said... I have changed my mind on a subject.  Really?  Teslas, let's go.  Okay, so let me be really clear here.  I have spoken in the past about... This is where that montage would come in handy.  Where... I wasn't a big fan of electric cars, Teslas in general.  Now, let me be really clear.  Where I have not changed my mind.  A lot of trash talk throughout the year.  The arguments still stand in that electric cars are not better for the environment than buying a used car.  Okay?  The best thing you can do.  do is buy a used beater and drive it into the ground.  You don't need a new Tesla.  And if you go and you look at these lithium ion batteries, depending which ones they are, mining for these very difficult to put together minerals.  And they basically sit in the earth for a very long time.  Right now, it is... And by the way, electricity comes from somewhere.  Coal.  Some places.  Mostly.  That's kind of... That's reductive.  Sorry.  But... Clean coal.  It does typically.  Where does your energy come from?  where you are?  It could come from gas, natural gas.  It could come from coal.  In Quebec, it came from hydroelectric, which is apparently a problem here because of an endangered species of fish.  I don't get it.  It's just water moving.  You saw Swiss family Robinson.  I don't know how anyone's against it.  Now... I am also still against subsidies in general.  I want to be really clear.  And there has been a lot of subsidization for electric cars.  And yes, Tesla is a company that would not exist if not for... My mind has not changed on that.  Also, I still maintain that most electric cars... This is where there's an exception.  Tesla is notwithstanding.  But most electric cars are still pretty gay.  So... Okay.  By the way, hit the notification bell.  If you want more of this.  Because every morning, you get a notification now. ",

            "text": "Let me be really clear here.  Because when I had to reflect upon all of this, Tesla is basically an American-based car manufacturer.  We have to compare them to the marketplace.  Now, Tesla has received directly $0.4 billion in subsidies.  OK.  Not a big fan of that.  They did pay it all back early with interest.  So now if we compare that to the big three, GM, Chrysler, Ford, they received just in 2008, and that's not the first bailout, $80 billion alone.  And the taxpayer is still on the hook for $9 billion of those dollars.  So that's more.  $80 billion compared to $9 billion.  And I do think this is important because the bailout was given to the big three American car companies when they were losing market share because they had mismanaged their businesses, they had these crazy union pensions, whereas Tesla received these subsidies while they were creating a new market and expanding their market share.  So there is a difference with a new technology, right, and the government saying, okay, this might be beneficial in the long term if it's... It's a loan that is paid back, which it had been and is creating new markets because that will actually create new jobs.  That loan allowed Tesla to employ more Americans, whereas the bailout to GM, $9 billion of which still we're on the hook for.  Thanks, Barack Obama.  Actually just maintains employment and retiree benefits for people who don't do any work.  Yeah, really, really, really bad union contract.  So that is important.  I think it's also important, you know, listen, this is the result of too big to fail.  Now, in a perfect world, no car companies would be receiving bailouts, okay?  No car companies would be receiving loans.  But it's really hard to create a car company in the 21st century when they're receiving 80, it's just like you can't create a new airline, right?  They're receiving hundreds of millions and billions of dollars over time because the government says, well, they're too big to fail, just like the banks.  Well, what should really happen is the banks should fail and then local state banks should become national banks, right?  Local credit unions.  They should be able to do a little bit better.  The same thing with cars.  Oh, you mismanaged it?  Well, now Daewoo gets a shot.  Only in this case.  No, they've already had their shot.  It's Tesla.  Right?  It's Tesla.  It's really hard to compete against the big boys.  Just like opening up a bank, you're not going to compete with Bank of America.  Tesla, now people will argue that they've been more subsidized in the form of a $7,500 tax credit.  And that is true.  Where?  for electric vehicles, basically, you get a $7,500 tax credit.  That's basically effectively a subsidy.  But it's different because it's not just a one-time, like $80 billion bailout.  It's basically being subsidized through each car sold because they see value in this technology compared to, let's say, old gas guzzlers.  Now, I'm against that.  I am against that, again, $0.4 billion and then $7,500 for cars.  Here's the thing, though.  Here's the kicker.  Tesla getting $7,500 tax credit.  So is GM.  So is Ford.  Every electric car manufacturer gets the $7,500 tax credit.  So it's not a leg up from Tesla.  It's just the same level competition field, only it's worse than that because Tesla has actually generated electric vehicles.  And this is really what it comes down to, that people want to buy as opposed to whatever it is, the Volt, the Bolt.  There's the Volt and the Volt.  You would think the Volt.  The Bolt is the electric, but I think the Bolt is a non-electric, and then the Bolt is electric.  I don't know what it is.  There's the Leaf.  Horrible cars.  They receive $7,500 as well.  Tesla doesn't get any more, because once they sell 200,000 electronic vehicles, that credit goes away.  So because Tesla has been successful despite paying back the loan with interest, and GM, Ford, Chrysler have not fully paid back the loan, they've sold 200,000 units and now they no longer get that subsidy from the government, that tax credit.  But GM, because they've been making shitty electric cars that nobody wants, still get that same tax credit.  So they're still to this day receiving more subsidization from the federal government.  So I did have to look at that again.  I am totally against bailouts.  I'm totally against supporting and propping up businesses that don't deserve it in the first place.  However, you do have to live in the real world and understand, ultimately, since we have given these bailouts, is it better or worse for American consumers and for people who are working in the American manufacturing sector to have another company who can compete and pay back these loans with interest and do it on a buy-as-you-go?  So that is one thing that I actually will tell.  you has changed my mind on the Tesla.  But you know the main reason\u2014 on the teslas.  uh and i've ridden tim's tesla here from hr.  my wife actually got you know the gbs and so um it was really hard.  it's hard for her to drive right now.  and so i was looking for this sort of autopilot features and i was looking at ford and then i was looking at the the korean cars and then i was had to look uh higher scale where they said actually the auto driving is really much better on bmw and mercedes.  and then someone said have you really just looked into a tesla?  it's not even close.  oh wow.  so i tried driving a tesla.  it is It's pretty damn cool.  It's so fun.  It is so fun to drive.  That wasn't the case back when I had a friend who had a Prius.  He was gay in Simi Valley.  Drove the Prius, but I know it's not fully electric, but it was like driving a shopping cart, even with that one fourth wheel that goes, and you're like, what the hell?  Why can't you get a cart that works?  Compared to the Tesla, it is more fun than any car I've ever driven.  Nice.  And the autopilot is incredible, so it does make sense to get from my wife.  You can do the one-pedal driving.  But even more than that, what convinced me, and I want to know where you line up here on Teslas, if this has maybe changed your mind a little bit or provided some context, was not only did I drive them, but when the Hodge twins were here for a week, I drove with them.  And so then I bought one immediately.  Here, you'll see why.  Hodgman's first time in a Tesla.  Uh, Audio Wade's first time in a Tesla too, right?  I don't know if a Tesla has exactly the same zip as a McLaren.  We were going 80.  What? ",
