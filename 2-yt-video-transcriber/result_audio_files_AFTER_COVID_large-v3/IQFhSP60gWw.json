            "text": "Ah, you're here.  Welcome to Survive the Jive.  My name is Tom Roussel, and I've been studying European pagan religions for 11 years.  During this time, I received a master's degree in medieval history from University College London, in which I studied the pagan traditions of the Anglo-Saxons and Norse peoples.  Prior to this, I obtained a bachelor's degree in communications at the University of Brighton, where I first learned to make films.  This led to a career in media and communications.  I was an accredited journalist in London and later an international science communication specialist working for a subsidiary of the World Health Organization in Sweden and traveling all over the world to advise government health departments on their online communication strategies.  Survive the Jive is a history channel.  But I don't just talk about history.  I show you it.  by visiting archaeological sites all over the world and talking to local peoples about their ancient folkways.  I also interview historians, scientists and other experts to gain more insights into the traditions, religions and genetics of the ancient peoples.  This is not an alternative history channel.  The theories I present are evidence-based, and I always check the latest and most up-to-date studies on the topics I cover.  But thankfully, since I am not affiliated with any corporate or academic institution, I am free to explore the subject matter without the politically correct bias that dominates academia and media.  and sometimes obscures a proper understanding of the traditions of the ancient world.  I present the facts without the jive of conspiracy theories about ancient aliens, or incongruous woke sociological theories.  So if you want to learn about the religious history of ancient Europe, and you don't mind hearing it from a pagan Englishman who tells it like it is, then this is the place for you.  Hey. ",
