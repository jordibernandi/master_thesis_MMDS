But I'll have him understand and know that in crafting this bill, we worked with health officials.  But the important thing is that a public hearing is not a sine qua non for the passage of any bill in this house.  That's a fact.  And many bills have been passed without.  Otherwise, what it will mean invariably is that a house that passes thousands of bills in a year will have to subject every bill based on its own logic to public hearing.  Let's forget about the fees, the cost, let's forget about the time, let's forget about the energy.  Even an ordinary in-office bill will must be subjected to public hearing, but that is not the position of our law, of our rule.  and to also begin to talk about cheap in somebody's body.
