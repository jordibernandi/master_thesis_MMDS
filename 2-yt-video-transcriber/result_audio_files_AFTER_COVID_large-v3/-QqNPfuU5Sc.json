Have you ever thought of a three-in-one solution to some of our most pressing problems on the continent in the area of electricity, clean, safe water, and healthy lifestyle?  Three-in-one, have you?  I bet you haven't, but someone has.  Take a look. ",

It's a problem that we face all across the continent.  So personally, I feel like our governments should invest in solutions like this to scale them up to other parts of the continent.  i mean this solution addresses the challenge of electricity.  so with this solution here you can generate your own electricity power to meet your daily needs those basic daily needs that you require electricity power supply to address at low cost.  You are saving some money that you would have paid utility bills to address other family needs.  How cool is that?  I like this solution because as a girl who grew up in a background where I had to go sometimes in search of water, I understand just how challenging it usually gets when you have to wake up in the morning To go search for water before going to school.  It's usually draining.  By the time you do all of these demanding chores in the morning and you get to school, you're most times just tired and you know, learning becomes an uphill task.  But I guarantee you, the girls in this household, We don't have to face those challenges in the morning.  Everybody wakes up in the morning, you know, you have your bath, do some of the necessary chores in the house and then you get to school still very much alert and active enough to engage in learning.  And this will also improve academic performance.  i don't know how you see this.  what do you think?  drop a comment.  and apart from that this solution also addresses the challenge of irrigation just like you heard him say.  so farmers can actually deploy this solution.  so you know address the challenge that they face.  season i went with seasonal you know change in weather.  when there is no rainfall they can deploy this solution to irrigate.  so we have agricultural yields all year round.  there'll be no shortage of food in communities.  no no farming and all of that.  so i like this solution.  what do you think guys?  i think it's something that should be scaled up really and it will do everyone a lot of good.  and like every other innovations.  innovations are not always perfect but there's always room for improvement and you heard him say it himself as well.  so there's always room for improvement opportunity to invest.  you know invest in this solution do some of the tweaking that you need to do the improvements every here and there and then it becomes a masterpiece that everyone can use without any um challenges.  and the most interesting aspect of it is the fact that you get all of this solution while you know exercising.  so you're exercising on this bike and at the same time you're generating a power to be converted to electricity.  you're generating power to pump water and you know this is just so cool.  people will no longer have to complain about.  i don't have money to go and register in the gym to walk out.  come and sit here walk out here while you also you know provide solutions to these other challenges that we face.  i like this personally.  honestly i like it.  so for all those feed farms this would be a perfect solution for you.  while you walk out at home you are you know solving these other problems as well so i like this.  thank you so much.  so what do you think about this innovation farm?  drop a comment and most importantly share this video.  i mean this is an innovation that requires all the attention it can get.  you never know who the investor might be so share it wide okay.  thank you guys so much for watching this video.  and if you've not subscribed what are you waiting for.  go ahead and hit the subscribe button and the bell beside it so you get notified each time i upload a new video.  take care stay safe healthy and below abiding.  i'll see you in my next video.  bye Thank you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Thank you. ",
