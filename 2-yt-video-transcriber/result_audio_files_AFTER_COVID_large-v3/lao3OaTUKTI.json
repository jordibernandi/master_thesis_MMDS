            "text": "10 feet.  Yeah, that's the ruling.  You don't get to make the ruling.  Shut the up.  It's a traffic stop.  I've given you twice as much space as you need.  It doesn't matter how much tape you put up you dumbass.  Alright, then tell him to chill the f*** out, let me record, let's just all be quiet, move on.  You look like an idiot.  What?  No.  You're gonna get sued.  You guys can't just put up tape every time you want to move a camera.  No, that's not the way the law works.  Alright guys, you got my lawyer on the phone, this is gonna be it.  I need names of everybody getting sued here tonight.  So it's just a traffic stop.  We've dealt with this case specifically.  Now here's the sidewalk.  This is a public sidewalk.  Now they don't want me filming their traffic stop.  So they're gonna wrap tape all around this place because they don't want me to film their traffic stop.  Somebody has put it in their mind that if they put tape around an area that no matter what, no matter what, that that means, see they're not supposed to be putting up tape though except to preserve a crime scene.  That is the purpose of crime scene tape, is to preserve the crime scene.  Say that there's shell casings around, maybe somebody's been shot and there's blood on the ground there.  Maybe there's a DWI accident and we've got skid marks on the road.  The purpose of the tape is not to get rid of the camera.  It's to preserve the crime scene.  So this is going to be Arizona DPS and yeah, they are going to arrest me.  So my wife will come pick up the car.  She's got spare keys.  I don't know what they'll book me on.  I mean, it's just ridiculous and stupid of them to do this.  If I had to take a wild guess, what's the go-to every time?  Interference.  Interference has to be something physical.  In other words, interference has to be like he's trying to go from his car to this car to search the car, and I'm physically keeping him from doing so.  I'm standing in between him or blocking the door Or something like that.  So he's... Our perimeter is already established.  I need you to step out of our perimeter.  Where's your supervisor?  You can record all you want over there, but not in our perimeter.  Where's your supervisor?  Get that light out of my eyes now!  Get the light out of my eyes now!  Get your supervisor now.  Get your supervisor before you do anything else.  Get your supervisor before you do anything else.  I'm not going to ask you again.  I'm telling you nicely, no thank you.  There's no perimeter.  Okay.  No, leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Go do your job.  Go do your job.  Leave me alone.  I'm asking you nicely to leave me alone.  There's no fucking perimeter.  I can be all the way up there on the sidewalk.  I gave you a ton of space.  I could be up on the sidewalk.  I can be on the sidewalk.  I gave you a ton of, all right, I'll go be on the sidewalk.  Then let me stay here where I think it's a safe distance rather than up close to you on the sidewalk.  They're gonna arrest me.  What's your name?  What's your name?  All right, keep the light down out of my eyes and I'll keep it out of yours.  Go over there.  Go over there.  Go over there.  Keep the light out of my eyes.  Just keep your light down out of my eyes.  You're making it... There's no... Shut up, dude.  What's your name?  What is your name?  What is your name?  What is your name?  Get your supervisor now.  I told you to get your supervisor.  Now do it.  Are you disobeying a lawful order?  It doesn't have to be like this.  Leave me alone.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Get your fucking hands off of me.  Get your hands off of me.  Get your hands off of me, you fucking piece of shit.  Fuck you.  Get off of me.  Stop resisting.  Get off of me.  Stop resisting.  Get off of me.  Stop resisting.  Get off of me.  Stop resisting.  Stop punting me.  Get off of me.  It's just a fucking camera, you dumbass.  Get off of me.  Get off of me.  Let go of my camera, you piece of .  Get off of me!  Get off!  Turn around!  Get off of me!  Get on your stomach!  Stop chasing me!  What the f*** is wrong with you guys?  It's a camera!  It's just a camera!  I think, um... But I'm going to go ahead and give it to you.  Yes, I do have quite a bit of injuries that I've sustained to my head.  I was tased in my abdomen.  I've got a big gash in the back of my head.  My shoulder is messed up and my neck.  So I'm going to... few places including the the hospital.  first We got pictures documenting the big gash on the back of my head From when he threw me on the ground Cuts in my lip from when he started punching me in the face And The the charge The charge I know you guys knew it was bogus when you first saw it, but I kid you.  not, I'm not even joking.  This was essentially under arrest for resisting arrest.  The charge was felony aggravated assault on a police officer.  But what that was and what they told me when they brought me in was anytime a police officer arrests you, and they get hurt in the process of arresting you, it's aggravated assault on you.  And this officer has bloody knuckles from my face and my tooth.  Okay?  He charged me with aggravated assault.  I'm not even joking.  You call them, you ask them.  I haven't seen the probable cause affidavit myself.  You can't make this up.  I'm not fucking kidding.  I'm charged with aggravated assault on a police officer for damaging his knuckles with my face.  That's a lie?  Go ahead and ask him.  Go ahead and ask him.  One of the biggest problems is that Arizona DPS doesn't have body cameras.  Things like this, when they were said in the back at Leon Valley, are all documented.  But even without them saying that, or even without having that documented on actual video and only my testimony, that I will swear on my life on, under oath, that that's what they said?  That when an officer gets hurt arresting you, you're charged with aggravated assault on the officer?  Well, again, but I'm not arrested for anything.  The only charge is aggravated assault on the officer.  The only charge is the officer's bloody knuckles.  But even without video of them actually saying that to me, it's clear as day what happened.  How could I possibly have been the attacker when I was moving back at such a fast rate of speed?  I was probably anywhere from 30 to 50 feet away from the point where he started trying to attack me.  That shows me moving away from the attacker.  There's no body cam.  Um, Arizona DPS does not have body cams and a lot of them don't even have dash cameras.  The ones that do have dash cams, uh, don't have mics that go with their dash cam that they keep on your body.  Um, no, I am, I, I mean, I'm, I'm okay.  News now Fort Worth, but I'm not going to lie.  No, they, they fucked me up bad.  Yes.  My shoulder is messed up bad.  My neck is messed up bad.  We're going to shave my head.  There's a nasty gash on my head.  Little one right here is just from being punched.  The ones on the back of my head are from splitting my head on the pavement when he threw me back on the pavement.  So, yeah, that's what's going on.  You got any question about, I'm sure someone will say, oh, you're lying, man.  No, they didn't charge you with aggravated assault for damaging the cop's knuckles with your face.  At some point, all this becomes public, you know.  At some point, this all comes out.  Same with the Leon Valley case that is just now, two and a half years later, beginning to come out.  But it all comes out.  It all comes out.  Sorry, I don't know what happened there.  I don't know why it keeps ending. ",
