            "text": "Boy, oh boy, is there a really interesting situation unfolding right now with Wall Street.  Now, some people on Reddit, they're doing something that I have to say is quite brilliant.  It's Reddit trolls, and it is, honestly, it's genius.  So I'm going to walk you through it.  It's a little complicated to understand, but I think you'll get the gist of it.  So, first let's go to this Twitter thread, which I think actually explains it relatively well.  This is from a guy by the name of William Legate.  He says the following, Now again, he's going to explain this a little bit, and then I'll come back and explain it as well.  Up nearly 100% just today after being up about 100% yesterday, LOL.  Tell me we're not in a bubble.  If GameStop goes up another 17%, this hedge fund will instantly collapse.  $13.1 billion gone.  Poof.  Elon Musk just tweeted about the stock, and they're now trading at $192 after hours.  If they open at this price, Melvin Capital will go bankrupt tomorrow morning.  $13.1 billion in wealth transferred from Wall Street to Reddit trolls.  What we're witnessing isn't a traditional pump and dump.  It is an unorganized yet collective effort of meme lords and average Americans to completely ignore all market fundamentals and through the power of social media, bankrupt hedge funds overnight, taking their funds.  Legality unclear.  Reddit also is in the process of memefying AMC stock to revive it from the dead.  This is like an Occupy Wall Street movement, but on their own turf and with real financial consequences.  Incredible.  So one post, which I think was rather poignant, described this as, we originally had Occupy Wall Street.  Now we have Infiltrate Wall Street.  So what's happening is this.  A bunch of people on Reddit saw that when it comes to GameStop, the stock GameStop, it was massively shorted.  That's actually publicly available information.  You could see... how much of the stock is shorted.  Now, in layman's terms, what shorting a stock means is you're betting on the stock to fail.  You're betting on the stock to go down.  That's what shorting a stock means.  So they saw that over 100% of GameStop stock was shorted.  So, they looked at that, some intelligent people on Reddit looked at that and they said, huh, this is clearly billionaire hedge funds betting on it to go down.  And what happens is, when you're shorting a stock, if you're shorting it over 100% of the value... you're kind of squeezing it out of existence.  And not only are you squeezing it out of existence, you're making it so that they won't GameStop if they needed more access to capital to avoid bankruptcy, you're making it so they won't have access to that capital.  So they could go bankrupt.  And then, of course, the other downside is a lot of people will lose their jobs.  So you have this billionaire hedge fund betting on GameStop to fail and then basically making that come to fruition by shorting it colossally and like squeezing it out of existence.  So they'll make more money if slash when GameStop goes under.  That's the gist of it.  So some intelligent people on Reddit saw this and And they said, hmm, well, that's a risky bet to short GameStop and over 100% of its value.  So, because what can happen is when you're shorting a stock, losses can be infinite.  Because what happens if the stock recovers?  What happens if it becomes, you know, an incredibly profitable company and it starts doing well?  So it's a very risky bet.  It's a super risky bet.  So what the people on Reddit did is they saw this and they said, well, we like GameStop because a lot of these people are gamers, right?  So we like GameStop.  And why don't we all buy the stock and, you know, revive the company and make the stock worth a decent amount of money and you know in the meantime if you get in relatively low and then the stock goes up.  you know you're making money.  you're making money so in other words they're playing the market.  that's what this is man they they looked at some shitty risky bets from wall street hedge fund billionaires.  they said hmm shorting it over 100% of the value, I mean, that's risky.  We can make money if we buy it.  And so it took off on Reddit.  And, like, a lot of people on Reddit started buying, you know, GameStop stock.  So what happened?  They bought so much of it, so many people bought so much of it, that the value skyrocketed, literally skyrocketed.  This is in the last day, I think.  136% it went up.  So now GameStop stock is worth $344.94 as I talk to you right now.  I don't know what it started at.  It started at like $4 or something like that.  So what happened is... They basically bankrupted the hedge fund that made that bet.  Now... A lot of people are seeing this in mainstream media, and they're saying, wow, they're manipulating the value of the stock.  Like, this should be illegal.  But I'm watching this, and I'm going, okay, you're saying this should be illegal, but it's equally manipulating the stock.  when the billionaire hedge fund was shorting the stock over 100% of its value, squeezing it out of existence so that they can make another dime.  So why is it that when the hedge fund billionaires manipulate the market and drive a company out of existence and get rich in the process, why does that not count as like hair on fire?  They're manipulating the stock and they're hurting real people in the real world who have jobs.  So the real people who were manipulating the stock, it was the Wall Street billionaires.  But guess what?  They fucked around and they found out.  Because now you had people who were smart enough to look at the bets of these billionaires and they responded rationally.  You know what it's called when you see that they're shorting this stock, and then you know you have a bunch of people who like that company and they want to buy the stock?  That's called a smart investment.  That's what that is.  So again, not only did they do it with GameStop, then they moved on to AMC.  AMC, you know, the movie theater company.  And so they drove that up 211% so far.  And all this happened because, you know, a loosely organized thing on Reddit.  And can you guess the response?  I'll tell you.  They halted trading.  They halted trading.  So in other words, when regular people started playing the market and making money, shut it all down.  Can't have that.  And now they're actually having a conversation.  I'm not kidding about this.  This popped up on Twitter right before I came on air to talk to you guys.  They're actually having a conversation about potentially bailing out some of these companies.  Which is... Beyond ridiculous.  I'll read you the exact tweet here.  This is from Street Insider.  It's like a Wall Street news company, I guess.  CNBC's David Faber said he is hearing a number of hedge funds are in similar trouble that Melvin Capital saw in its GameStop situation and may need to be bailed out.  Look at the wording.  May need to be bailed out.  So stop and think about this.  When you say, hey, we need health care because 40,000 to 65,000 Americans die every year because they don't have access to basic health care.  Tens of millions of Americans don't have health insurance.  Medical bills is one of the top cause of bankruptcy.  So you say we need health care.  We need education, including college.  We have over a trillion dollars in student loan debt.  We need survival checks because 60% of the businesses that closed because of COVID are now permanently closed.  30% of the country can't make their housing payment.  When you say those things, what do they say to you?  Shut up, suck it up, here's some bootstraps.  But when Wall Street billionaire hedge funds make shitty speculative bets, and they lose, we quote, need a bailout.  You need a bailout?  You need a bailout.  No, no, no.  You want a bailout.  Welfare for the people is somehow discounted immediately, and not taken seriously, but corporate welfare... is something that you need, that it's framed as like, well, obviously we're going to get this, right?  I mean, listen, we lost all of our money making a shitty bet, so now the taxpayers have to rush in and bail me out, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'd much rather have my tax money go towards healthcare, go towards education, go towards survival checks for people in the middle of a pandemic and effectively a depression.  They need a bailout.  Shouldn't be getting one.  Shouldn't be getting one.  But see, now you're going to see the ace up the sleeve of Wall Street.  This is what a lot of people didn't understand, or perhaps didn't get.  the extent to which this is true.  What the Wall Street billionaires have over the regular people and the trolls on Reddit is that the Wall Street billionaires bought and owned the government.  So when you buy and own the government, yeah, they're gonna rush in to help you and bail you out, just like what happened in 2008 and 2009 with the subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession.  These companies made decisions that bankrupted themselves.  And then the government rushed in, bailed them out, and they paid bonuses to the same people who crashed the world economy.  So it's not about merit.  And these aren't the smartest people in the room.  These are the greediest people in the room, and they happen to have friends in high places.  They're the greediest people in the room and they bought and owned the government.  So that's what people don't understand.  That's the ace up the sleeve of the Wall Street hedge funds.  So that's why we're even having this conversation about bailing out billionaire hedge funds simply because they made a bad bet, which gets to the main point and like the main reason why we're even talking about this, which is look at how it works.  Look at how it works.  These guys, all day long, are doing puts, they're doing calls, they're shorting stocks, they're doing all these incredibly risky casino capitalist bets.  And all day long, they're, you know, hurting real people in the real world.  Whether it's what they did with the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession with these predatory loans, where they play hot potato with toxic assets.  Or what they're doing with GameStop where it's like shorting it to squeeze it out of existence.  so they don't care that people are fired.  They don't care that the company goes under.  They get rich.  So they're doing those things all day long.  And they're making money.  They're making money when they win in the market.  And then they're also making money when they lose because the government rushes in and bails them out.  So they get to do that all day long.  All that happened here is that people on Reddit said... Okay, we see your shitty rules in this terrible game.  We are now also going to partake in this terrible game.  And we're going to use the same rules that you do, and we're going to beat you.  We're going to outsmart you.  Now, what does Wall Street do in that situation?  Shut it all down.  Shut it all down.  Change the rules.  This is unfair.  Yes, I know.  I was winning with these same rules... Forever.  For decades.  But now, since I'm losing with these same rules, it's time to change the rules.  And also, by the way, let's rig the rules so only I can win.  That's literally what's going on here.  So again, the main thing you need to take away from this segment is that... The media is now going to go all in.  trying to act like.  Reddit is the problem.  The people on Reddit are the problem.  And what they'll do is they'll isolate silly things people are saying when they're playing games.  And, you know, it's a meme.  Like, they're fucking around.  They're calling each other silly names.  So what they'll do is they'll isolate that stuff and say, see, these people are so unhinged.  Look at what they're doing.  But the real market manipulation did not start with the people on Reddit.  The real market manipulation was the billionaire hedge funds.  squeezing a company out of existence, shorting a stock over 100% of its value.  that has real-world consequences and real-world effects.  GameStop, if they... At the time when they would need more capital, they wouldn't be able to access that capital.  And people would be fired.  People would lose their job.  This is people pushing numbers around on a computer screen and fucking real world... And fucking real people in the real world.  Okay?  So that's the real market manipulation.  And then what happened was people on Reddit... saw the stupid fucked up bets that billionaire hedge funds were making.  And so they said, okay, you want to play a free market game?  Let's play a free market game.  We're going to beat you at your own game.  And so free people bought stock and it went up.  And if the market really was free, they put these hedge funds out of business.  And that's what we call tough cookies.  And that's what I call, hey, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  Because you win all the time with these bets.  Fair and unfair.  And then the one time you lose, all of a sudden, oh, this is... Now we need a bailout.  We need corporate welfare.  We need to change the rules.  Or no.  You've been hoisted on your own petard.  Like, this is... This is the logical consequence of people now beating you at your own game because they're more intelligent than you.  So suck it up.  The real market manipulation was from the billionaire hedge funds.  And this is Reddit saying, we could play this game too.  So we're all going to make a bet in the other direction.  And it looks like we won.  But what's crazy is you're very likely to get more government action.  There's already been more government action from this than you're going to get when, for example, we learned that there was massive insider trading right before COVID.  Kelly Loeffler and other politicians massively selling their stock because they were in on a government meeting where they said, hey, guys, COVID is going to be really bad and the market's probably going to crash.  So just a heads up.  Wink, wink.  And what did they do?  They all ran and sold their stock.  So, there's going to be more government action from this, which is a lot more legit.  What the Reddit people did is playing by the rules that they set up.  There's going to be more government action over this than there was when there was actual corruption and fuckery.  I don't know what the result is going to be, but it's very likely that you're going to have a situation where Maybe they ban some of these apps.  And maybe they try to find a way to ban regular people from trading.  And partaking in the stock market.  Maybe that's what they do.  I could definitely see them do that.  But like... You just... You need to understand... who the bad guys are in this situation.  It's not the people on Reddit who saw a shitty, fucked-up bet being made by hedge funds, and they bet in the other direction.  And it just so happened.  it caught on, and they had the numbers where they were the ones who made money, and they put the hedge fund out of business.  Or nominally they did.  They'll probably get that bailout.  But those people did not do anything wrong.  those people made a rational investment based off of evidence that they saw.  So, but again, watch, the media is going to have you hating the Reddit people and loving the assholes with suits and ties who are corrupt and bought the government.  Don't fall for it. ",
