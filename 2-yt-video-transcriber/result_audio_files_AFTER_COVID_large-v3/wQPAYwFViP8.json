            "text": "But we do fund schools.  According to the U.S.  Census, the latest statistics show that New York City already spends more money per student than any other district in the entire country, spending nearly $22,000 per student.  And despite that record spending, when you look at 2019 New York State test scores, Only 47.4% of New York City students scored proficient in reading.  And only 45.6% passed the math portion.  So AOC claims that we should defund the NYPD because they're failing to stop the crime surge.  But by her own logic, we should also defund the New York City Department of Education because we outspend every other school district in the country and we can't even hit 50% in test scores.  And while we're at it, let's defund AOC.  Because giving her a second term isn't going to help anybody. ",
