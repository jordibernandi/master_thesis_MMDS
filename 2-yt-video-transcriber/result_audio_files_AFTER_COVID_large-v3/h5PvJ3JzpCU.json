            "text": "oh hi guys i'm back for real.  this time it has been a lot of minutes.  a lot of minutes.  um it's been almost two years actually since i posted on youtube regularly.  i was uh very burned out as those of you who followed through lacy's burnout saga May remember and I guess it takes about two years to get unburned out.  I have been missing YouTube.  I've been missing you guys.  I've been missing my online community admittedly.  I have not really missed social media.  I have not missed Twitter or Facebook or any of those things I feel like if I hadn't you know started a YouTube channel I would be one of those people who could not be found online.  But here we are.  So I thought, you know, I've been really enjoying making the podcast that I started last year.  And thank you so much to those of you who have been tuning in and writing me about the podcast.  It's just great.  And I've been really enjoying it.  So my plan, which may change because I might decide this is a very stupid plan.  is that I'm going to make a condensed version of these topics, a YouTube version.  The idea here is to basically create the space that I've always wanted on my YouTube channel, which is to talk about all kinds of stuff, all kinds of things that interest me, The big questions that I have about the world.  I hope you like it.  I like it.  So maybe someone will.  I don't know.  And hopefully the entire time my headphones stay hidden so that you don't know that they're there.  Too late.  Anyway, before I begin today's inauguratory episode, I don't have many life updates for you.  Just one.  But it's a big one.  Well, actually, no, it's very small.  I got a puppy.  Her name is Poppy, after my favorite flower.  She's a mini golden doodle, about four months old now.  And I adopted her actually right before all the quarantine stuff got real.  So it was perfect timing.  And I've been wanting a puppy for so long.  She makes me so happy.  I just die.  I die.  So you'll probably be seeing more of her around because the internet is for floofs.  Okay, let's get into today's topic, which is the very uplifting, deeply fascinating, death. ",

I think that all of us ponder at some point or another whether or not we're afraid to die.  I like to tell myself that death will bring sweet relief and so it's nothing to be afraid of, but deep down, I'm not sure I actually believe that.  In fact, it's probably just the depression talking.  In reality, I do have some anxiety about dying, and I think most people do, though we push it down to varying degrees.  There is actually a ton of research out there that finds that our fear of death motivates our behavior in a lot of weird ways.  It can influence everything, you know, from romantic relationships all the way up to national politics.  Does anyone remember the button?  In 2015, a mysterious button appears on Reddit.  It has a countdown clock that's set to 60 seconds, and the only explanation we got was you can only press the button once.  So users start flooding the subreddit and using their click, and every time someone presses the button, it resets to 60 seconds.  But once you take your turn, your account is forever branded with a color coded flare showing how quickly you press the button.  And interestingly, these digital tribes start forming around the colors.  You know, you've got the Emerald Council, the Red Guard.  But in all this hubbub, there's one big question unanswered.  What the f*** is the button?  What does it mean?  And what's gonna happen when the clock runs out?  It's a month in, and people start losing their minds.  You know, one user writes, \"...there's not much time left, guys.  With strong discipline, the knights may be able to hold back the clock for a couple of days.  I really don't want to know what's gonna happen when the button  stops.\".  I'd rather be in hell.  And then it happens.  Two months in, over a million clicks later, the clock runs out.  The mods give people 10 minutes to leave their final words.  I feel nothing.  What the hell am I going to watch in the bathroom now?  Who is the prosaia?  We need to know.  What was the point?  Where is our closure?  And on that day, poor wannabe groundhog realized there would be no closure.  You see, the button never meant anything at all.  It was just randomness, chaos.  It meant something because we collectively decided that it meant something.  And all of our fears and anxieties about the clock running out were ultimately moot because it was going to run out and there was nothing that we could do about it.  So why am I telling you this story?  Well, I think that the button is this perfect weird little microcosm of terror management theory. ",

We are made immortal through our legacy, the things we do in the world, or the little people that we make in the world.  And all of this literal or symbolic immortality is absolutely critical because it allows us to continue functioning in a world that is chaotic and scary and where death looms around every corner.

So the path to being a good person here is pretty straightforward.  You just need to defeat the bad guys.  So what's a hard place worldview then?  Well, these are views that are less absolute.  People with these views see more nuance to what's right and wrong in a given situation.  In fact, they may even see the merits in other people's views, just like their own.

Another problem is, in a large culture like ours, many roles have to be filled.  We need sanitation workers, for example, right?
