            "text": "You want me to talk to him?  Yeah.  So you can't do anything about a guy talking to 12-year-old girls asking where they live?  Hey, Officer Fiddlesticks.  There's a crime in progress.  214781.  You fucking... Super fucking superhero, man.  I can't do anything about that because my super's brown.  The super's brown, so I'm Brown University Police.  I can't do anything about that because it's brown.  I can't do anything.  I'm brown police.  If your super wasn't brown, I could do something to pull you over.  But, you know, the way it goes... Fuck, man!  Cops don't do fucking anything.  Ever!  Ever!  Cops give you a fucking speeding ticket.  Period.  Period.  Cops exist to fucking generate revenue, protect insurance companies, protect banks, etc.  God damn!  Fucking useless, man.  This is the thing, listen.  If by some... Some stroke of fate, some happenstance... What have you, okay?  You're watching this right now, and you're a liberal-minded guy.  You're a Democrat-type guy.  You're an anti-racist-type guy or girl.  Fine.  I have no beef with you.  But I'm telling you, the motherfucking cops are never, ever going to help you.  Okay?  They are never, ever going to help you.  I have had plenty of friends who are Democrat types, liberal types, art school, living in New York City, etc.  I've rubbed elbows with these people.  Love them, okay?  Big time motherfucking flaw, weakness, is thinking that if you are ever in trouble, if anyone's ever trying to hurt you, if I'm stalking you, if I'm texting you 300 times, give me that pussy.  Not that I would ever do that.  But if you're ever in trouble thinking that the police are ever going to help you, they are not.  They are fucking not.  And it's not a race thing.  It's not a class thing.  It's that these motherfuckers are on the clock.  They're punching the clock.  They are punching the clock.  That's why.  It's not because you're black or Latino or because you're a guy and you wear a purse and a skirt, whatever.  That's not why the cops have this glazed over, fluoride, Dunkin' Donuts.  look about them.  The reason is because they are clock-punching, period.  That's all there is to it.  Same as at the DMV, same as at the fucking road work crew, the DOT.  They're there to sit, get fat, get a check.  That's all.  And goddamn, this harkens back to this podcast language.  You wouldn't know about it.  This reminds me of a time where we caught a live flasher, a guy showing his dick in the ghetto.  Ran to a cop?  It's right there.  It's happening right there.  The crime?  Where was the crime?  Was it two hours ago?  Was it last night?  It's right there, baby.  There's no laws.  There's absolutely no laws.  What are they going to do?  They can't catch me because they're not the Brown police.  They're not the right department.  It's out of my jurisdiction.  As if that's real.  As if that's real.  That's from an 80s movie.  It's out of my jurisdiction.  Yeah, fucking right.  What was I going to say?  Oh, anyway.  Liberal friends, art school types, people I like, okay?  Oh, the flashing.  It was right there.  It was right there.  Flasher, 20 feet that way.  Cop, 20 feet that way.  Flashing incident, 30 seconds ago.  30 seconds ago.  I go up to the cop.  And we're yelling, that guy's right there.  He just flashed her.  Go get him.  Go get him.  That's him right there.  Go get him.  Instantly!  Instantaneous!  .1 millisecond response!  The clock did not change the hand of one second before the female cop, the female cop said... What did she say?  She said something.  She said something out of a Philip K. Dick book.  Out of like a black comedy sci-fi dystopian book.  book.  she said something.  she said something like well did she file a report?  she made a statement because like she said and that wasn't what she said it was what she said was like it was astronomical whatever.  whatever it was that she said.  i don't want to pretend like.  i remember it word for word but it made me instantly instantly realize instantly lose faith in the cops.  She made it perfectly fucking clear that she was not about to go.  And why would you if you're a woman cop?  What are you going to do?  Run for cover.  That's what you're going to do.  Dumb bitch.  Fucking, I'll be a cop.  I don't know what to do.  They got good benefits.  They got good benefits.  They got good benefits.  I always liked the uniform.  What goes through the mind of a fucking female cop?  Holy fuck!  Oh!  Wow.  Wowie, wowie.  The wowie monster strikes again.  Jeez, man.  Jeez, dude.  I can drive as fast as I want.  That's what I keep telling people.  The law states that you have to take a report and be from a different jurisdiction.  There's no jurisdiction.  I don't see it.  These cops around here, there's cops everywhere.  They're wrong jurisdiction.  What are they going to do?  Call in the other jurisdiction?  It takes too much time.  I hope if I ever get pulled over in this thing, I hope it's Officer fucking Fuddlegum's.  What's that chocolate pudding called?  Fuddlement?  I hope it's old Officer Fumbledums.  Officer Dumbledore.  I hope it's him.  Man, you should have seen him.  He was sprinting to the scene of the crime.  And by the way, this was all instigated by some fucking guy.  There was this little fucking 12-year-old girl.  First of all, goddamn, man, this is the point.  You have to protect yourself, and you have to protect the people that are close to you.  And just start being a stand-up guy in public.  It's fun.  Go fuck with people.  If you see someone acting out of pocket, just go up to them.  It's the most fun shit ever.  You just have to get really huge.  You can't have a gun.  You can't have a knife.  That's not reality.  You go to jail right away.  That's what you will go to jail for.  You just got to get huge.  But that's the most fun thing in the world.  Hey, what are you doing?  I love saying it like that.  I think Nick, I think I got that from Nick.  If you go to somebody and you just twist your face up like this, you don't have to swear.  You don't have to be like, hey, faggot.  Hey, that's what people, that's what I used to think.  That's what I used to think.  I used to think if you're going to mess with somebody in public, you had to be like, hey, faggot, want to die?  Like the type of shit that I would insult people with in like middle school.  Hey, hey, fuck face, you want to die?  That's not how it is.  The real thing to do, you just twist your face up like this and then go up to him.  I think I got this from Nick.  Twist your face up and go, what are you doing?  Like, say it like that.  What are you doing?  More, that's too surfer-ish.  That's too, like, innocent.  What are you doing?  Just hit him with that.  I love that.  Hey, excuse me.  Do you need help?  Asking, making your face super angry and then asking someone if they need help.  Excuse me, do you need help?  Ooh.  Anyway, this is all precipitated by, there was this guy asking a fucking, like, prepubescent girl where she lives.  And I went up to her and I was like, do you know that guy?  And she said no.  And there was a cop, like, right there.  So I went up to fucking Officer Busybone and told him.  And he sprinted to the scene.  He put on his magic cape and his Tony Stark Iron Man suit and sprinted to the scene.  I was amazed.  I just saw a blur moving.  No, he went into Walgreens.  He said, I'll call it in.  He went into motherfucking nigga Walgreens and got aspirin.  I watched him.  He got aspirin and some other cold remedy thing.  Stupid.  Fuck, man.  People everywhere.  You have to fucking protect yourself.  That's all there is to it.  All right, guys.  Whoa, whoa, she's a buckin' bronco.  That's what I say when I bog first gear.  I say, oh, she's a buckin' bronco.  We call that rock-by-baby mode.  All right.  That's all there is to it.  That was fun.  I like lawless mode.  I like to drive around when it's lawless, and we'll be doing that more soon.  I love that.  I just love it.  I love you, car.  I'm going to kiss the steering wheel, but you guys can't see that.  That's naughty time.  Alright, peace.  Don't call the cops.  They'll do nothing.
