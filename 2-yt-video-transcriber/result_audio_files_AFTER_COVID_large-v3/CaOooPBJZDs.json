            "text": "We reported first, and now it's all over the place, that the three founders of Black Lives Matter Global Foundation are Marxists.  And I give these three women credit.  They didn't lie about it.  They're not trying to hide it.  Their names are Alicia Garza, Patrice Cullors, and Opal Tometi.  They are in Los Angeles.  All right?  Now, they want to overthrow the system in the United States of America.  They don't want capitalism, they want communism.  This is who is running the Black Lives Matter Global Foundation.  There is no doubt about it, no question, the ladies admit it.  Here is a partial list of corporations who are donating money to people who want to overthrow the government.  See, Black Lives Matter is using the racial strife to drive their Marxist-communist agenda.  That's what they're doing.  It's very shrewd because the press will not report that.  Here are the corporations.  Cisco, 5 million.  Microsoft, 1.5 million.  Amazon, 10 million.  Gatorade, 500,000.  Decker's Outdoor Furniture or something, 500,000.  Unilever, 350,000.  Nabisco, Ritz, 500,000.  Microsoft, 1.5, I said that.  DoorDash, 1 million.  Intel, 1 million.  Warner Music Group, undisclosed, but big donation of Black Lives Matter.  Tom's Shoes, 100,000.  Airbnb, 500,000.  Partialist.  So these corporations are basically funding a communist movement.  They're capitalist corporations.  Why?  Because they're stupid.  They don't know.  And they don't care to know.  Why don't they care to know?  Because they want a virtue signal.  They want to tell all the world, we are so noble.  We believe in social justice.  We believe that there's terrible things that have to be confronted in America.  So we're going to give millions to the Black Lives Matter Global Foundations.  It is beyond belief.  But everybody thinks corporations are smart.  They're not.  They're run by mostly sycophantic, frightened morons.  I am so happy that I run my own now and I don't have to work for a corporation.  I'll never work for a corporation again.  So anyway, just to bring you up to speed, the Black Lives Matter Global Network is not a nonprofit.  All of these corporations give them millions and millions of dollars, but it goes to Thousand Currents in Oakland because that is a nonprofit.  So the money goes over there to be laundered.  And then it comes back.  71%.  71% of all of these millions of dollars goes to the three women and their consultants who can be their mom.  71%.  Hey, you know, this Marxism-Communism is pretty good business. ",
