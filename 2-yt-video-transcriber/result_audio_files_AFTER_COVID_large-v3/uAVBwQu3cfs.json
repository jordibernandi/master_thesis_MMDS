While the world has been waiting on Pope Francis and his crooked cabinet to release the report on the evil empire and clerical accomplices of Homo Predator and former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, another much more quiet route to the truth has been quietly moving along out of the public eye.  James Grein, the premier victim, so to speak, is suing McCarrick, but also the Archdiocese of New York, the Diocese of Metuchen, New Jersey, as well as the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.  He's able to file these suits because both New York and New Jersey lifted the statute of limitations last year.  Part of each of these lawsuits entails Theodore McCarrick actually being deposed, sitting down to be deposed, by Grein's attorney, Mitchell Garabedian.  Garabedian is the noted attorney from the original Homo Predator scandal cases dating back to Boston in 2002.  He's alive.  There are people who know where he is, and he's trying to mount a defense against you.  What on earth do you think of that? ",

He traveled for the U.S.  State Department routinely and along the way developed a network of globalist interests and very influential individuals.

China is an enormous threat to the  U.S.,  a communist nation bent on world domination, assisted by the Vatican and the disgraceful accord bargained by McCarrick.  Even FBI Director Christopher Wray, in a speech last week to the Hudson Institute, laid out the massive threat China poses to the United States.  And interestingly, Joe Biden, phony Catholic, with his very close relationship with the Chinese communists, a relationship stretching back decades, and one from which his son, Hunter, profited over a billion dollars, not one U.S.  bishop has ever voiced a concern.  Not one has raised a single question about all of this.  Likewise, not one single Catholic establishment media operation has checked into any of this.  The world is careening toward a globalist Marxist empire where the Church will be viciously attacked because that's what Marxist Communists do.  And a very likely key to understanding all of this is Theodore McCarrick.  And yet, not a word from inside the Vatican.  No questions from U.S.  bishops, many of whom knew him very well and, in fact, owe their careers to him.  What's the goal?
