When students are radicalized by online hate movements, they just don't know how to stop it or if it's a power struggle they can ever win.  How creepy is it that these people literally view the Enlightenment as a hate movement?  Because they specifically reference Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan.  Oh, man, I got to read you this paragraph.  They say, Of course.  Tessa, a 29 year old in the Midwest who teaches 14 to 18 year olds at a private school for students with learning impairments, says that while many of her students simply take on the talking points and politics of their conservative parents, this can make them especially ripe targets for full blown radicalization and infatuation with far right figures.  Quote, A few started listening to Joe Rogan's podcast, which led them to reading Jordan Peterson's books.  She said, I think that Joe Rogan's ideology is the biggest threat to critical thinking in the last decade.  I got it.  Yeah. ",

It was viral thread where a guy was complaining that parents now with virtual classrooms would start to learn about what they were teaching their kids.  That's terrifying.

I get his point because Donald Trump entered and he doesn't have that on, you know, in his history.  But come on, you know, look, Joe Biden changed.  Yeah.  Times have changed.  He's gotten with the program.  He's changed his opinion.  I'm more concerned about what he's doing now and his character now.  I can respect, you know, Grinnell's opinion for sure.  He knows better than I do because he is a gay man.  But I look at what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent now.  I'm concerned about the now, not the yesterday.  However, I look at Joe Biden's wishy-washiness, his waffling, and what the Obama administration did, and that does matter because they do have a history, and that's important.  Perhaps you could say that Donald Trump doesn't, you know, because he doesn't have that history, it's harder to criticize him.  It's his first time running for office, and he became president.  Right.  Yeah, that was a really funny thing when he brought it up.  I ran for president one time, or I ran for public office one time and became president of the United States.  It's funny.  So he has an advantage.  But I look at the Biden administration and the things they did, and that's why I'm like, I'm not interested in that. ",

I feel like I should be able to do a better job at teaching critical thinking skills, and they should have enough trust in me to believe that I'm telling the truth.  Honestly, she adds, it makes me feel like I failed at my job.  Well, you failed at your job for a lot of reasons.  I'll tell you what.  If I had to choose, if there was a little kid in front of me and they were like, you could say one thing, just one word, or you have two choices.  He either grows up to become a Proud Boy or he grows up to become Antifa.  And you can only, you have to choose.  I'd rather that kid be Proud Boy. ",
