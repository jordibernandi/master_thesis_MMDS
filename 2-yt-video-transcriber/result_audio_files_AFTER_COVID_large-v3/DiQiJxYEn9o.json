            "text": "okay but you know let let's think about that.  okay you're a former raw marine okay so so you know um what it's like to be.  um you know on the front line now paddy main was leading a patrol an sas patrol deep behind the lines in north africa.  what was their mission?  their mission was to take out German and Italian air bases, that's warplanes, and those who operated those warplanes.  Why was it a crucial mission?  Because we were losing the war in North Africa.  We'd won it initially against the Italians, and then Hitler sent Rommel, one of his best generals, to North Africa with the Africa Corps, and they were beating us left, right and centre.  We were being driven back to Cairo, into Egypt, and we might lose the Suez Canal, at which stage things were looking very dire.  So hit those airfields, take away the German-Italian air cover, and you might start to turn things around in the war in North Africa, and also with the siege of Malta.  So theirs was a vital mission.  Now let's look at the makeup of their patrol.  What did they have?  They had a few Jeeps, a few Jeep-mounted machine guns, some Lewis bombs, which are these incendiary devices to blow up aircraft, and a handful of men, probably 12 men.  David Sterling said, you deploy in four-man units.  That's your ideal situation.  unit for behind the line raids but then normally went with around about 12. so they're going into an airport in the dead of night hundreds sometimes over a thousand kilometers behind enemy lines.  when they've raided that airfield they've got to get back again hunted all the way.  okay in that mess there are german pilots.  german pilots fly warplanes which are killing our troops and which are the target that they've been sent out to destroy.  OK, if he doesn't, if he and his men didn't do what they did at that moment and said, OK, we'll leave those guys in the mess.  We'll just go and sabotage the aircraft.  What were the chances that they would have been discovered?  And then you have 30 guys piling up that mess with weapons to hunt them down.  So in the moment, faced by the situation they faced, why was that the wrong call?  War's not a nice thing.  You know that.  I know that.  I've been on the front line of war as a reporter.  You've been there as a soldier.  But it's not great.  I'm carrying a camera.  You're carrying a weapon.  We've both had similar kind of experiences.  You know war is not a pretty thing.  And you're not there to do nice things.  You're there to fight.  And Paddy Main made a split-second decision.  You speak to anyone.  There are just a handful, two or three veterans left alive who served alongside Paddy Manion.  I have spoken to them and you ask them why they would follow that man to the ends of the earth, actually to hell and back, because they'll all say that about him.  Okay.  And they won't say that's because they, they, he was the most likable individual.  It would, they won't say it's because they worshiped him.  It's because they'll say he was, would get you out of there alive if he possibly could.  And he always led from the front and he had this uncanny ghostly ability to assess threat and danger in an instant, in a split second to decide whether the right thing to do was to attack or run away.  That's what he had.  So isn't it easy 70, 75 years after the events, to, you know, to throw stones and to cast aspersions.  I mean, you know, just by chance, two weeks ago, I was with Paddy Maine's niece, Fiona, okay, who's his nearest living relative.  You know, this is a man who many believe should have been given the Victoria Cross at the end of the war, and instead he won his first, his fourth DSO, Distinguished Service Order, which in itself is an incredible achievement, one of the most decorated soldiers ever in the British Army.  You know, people always ask, well, you know, was he bitter that he didn't get the Victoria Cross?  And, you know, I was there with a filmmaker who wanted to meet, you know, Fiona, Blair Mane's niece.  And he asked her that question.  And she said, he was never in it for the decorations or the medals. ",

I mean, he, whatever, he was a character, you know.  and not everybody is.  in fact there's not enough of them and this is the thing.  it is war and war is horrible and there are sort of I don't want to say pretenses.  There are certain conventions in play, let's say.  But if any civilian thinks that that's a rigid set of etiquette that everybody abides by, then I'm going to say they're probably a bit naive.  Like you say, this was a mess full of fighter aces, German fighter aces, who were dedicated at all costs to getting kills.  They didn't see it as killing the enemy.  They saw it as getting kills, getting the marks on the side of their plane.  So when they went back to Berlin or wherever, they could raise a glass of champagne and that's a fighter ace over there.  I mean, they saw it as... ",

            "text": "Not only that, Chris, but you've got to bear in mind, when they carried out these raids, the Germans didn't really have an equivalent unit to the SAS or the Long Range Desert Group, which were the more intelligence gathering unit in North African deserts.  They had small kind of ad hoc units, but nothing really to compare.  So when they carried out these raids... What was it that hunted them through the desert?  It was the Luftwaffe.  Obviously, it was aircraft and pilots.  So the more aircraft you could take out, and let's be honest about it, the more pilots you could kill, the less chance that you would actually be hunted for a thousand miles back across the desert as you try to retreat and get back to your base.

But no, it constantly saw it through to the end.  And war isn't nice.  And I think some of the stories I've heard from the Falklands, would probably really make people um you know it would it it it would spin their minds i think if they knew some of the truths of what went on down there.  you know young men full of anger bitterness testosterone had to watch their their friends massacred and we i'm obviously talking about both sides here.  now you fight your way up a hill you've got you know a grenade and you've got to chuck it in a trench of the enemy that have just killed your best friends.  And then if they shoot you all the way up the mountain, and once they get overrun, they suddenly go like this, when they could have done that, eight hours ago or 12 hours ago and no one would have had to get hurt.  You know, it's not even like a decision, is it?  You're in that killer's up, killer's own.  And I think, yeah, it's slightly naive to try to put these fixed rules on things, isn't it? ",

By the end of the war, they had been doing behind the lines operations 1940, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, for five or six years.  And sometimes they were doing more than one a week back to back with no leave, no going back home, no seeing your loved ones.

You're all about to die or not die, as the case might be.  So you've been five years at war doing behind the lines operations, seeing your closest friends get killed.  killed get captured.  you know when they're captured they're getting tortured by the gestapo and being murdered because we realize that after a while that's what was happening.  and yet you're supposed to fight by queensberry rules.  what are the chances?  imagine the trauma.  imagine the drip drip drip drip effect of the trauma over all those years.  imagine what that does to your mind.  that there's a story about maine.  later in the war you know kind of end of 44 early 45 And they're advancing into Germany, the SAS, at the vanguard as always.  And they capture a young SS man in pristine uniform who has just been responsible for some unspeakable atrocities against civilians, as they often were.  And there's a man on his patrol who had been captured earlier in the war.  held by the Gestapo and the SS, tortured, sentenced to murder, taken to woodlands to be shot and escaped.  And he says to Maine, let me deal with him.  And there's a quote, you know, from what Maine said at the time.  And he said, I used to think war was a chivalrous thing.
