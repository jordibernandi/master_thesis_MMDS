            "text": "Hey everybody, hope you're doing well.  Now, I want to start off by saying that I'm not sure if all these pastors are false teachers, but I do know that many of them are.  These are 20 pastors that recently were on the Sid Roth Show giving their unique God-given prophecy for 2020.  The Bible says not to despise prophecy, but I do think it's okay to question it.  In fact, we're told to test the spirits, and if these are people claiming that God spoke to them personally, then we have the biblical right to question their authenticity.  Scripture also says that in the final days we will have dreams and visions.  God will give those to people.  But once again, there's no harm in questioning these people, especially those that are involved in the NAR movement.  And the fact that they are all hearing directly from God and grouping together on the Sid Roth Show is a strong statement in itself.  I'll quickly give you the short version of what each of them said, and then you can decide for yourself.  But Sid opens up saying that if we watch it to the end, we can get a special announcement and a free gift.  Oh boy, I can't wait.  The first guy's Hank Kuhneman, and I've never heard of him, but his prophetic word is that God has declared this to be the decade of difference.  He says that each decade is defined by something like the 60s was.  This decade, though, will be given to the children.  he says that children will be getting together in public to pray and laws are going to be overturned.  then he says god said there will be an unveiling and a great shaking and that he's going to step in and there will be regime changes in the middle east and we are going to receive payback for all of our shame.  we are entering into twelve years of god's divine order and a revealing of his divine glory.  i'm quite sure this guy's a dominionist and follows the seven mountain mandate and i'm quite sure he's wrong.  the bible says we are going to get much worse and it will only get better when christ returns.  Next we have Perry Stone.  He goes into what he believes based on the year represented by the Hebrew letters has a connotation connected to when Jacob took his hands and blessed his grandsons and that he switched his hands and the one who was supposed to get the blessing did not and the other did.  That right now there is a global outpouring of God's Holy Spirit on servants, handmaidens, sons and daughters and that's what we should expect.  Great baptisms of the Holy Spirit.  It was really just a bunch of spiritual fluff from what I could hear.  Next we have Patricia King.  2020 is going to be a year for America when many paradigm shifts take place.  There's gonna be kingdom government authority released.  divine strategies and other amazing things given to apostolic and prophetic intercessors, and that with enough prayer we can turn the nation around.  So another Dominionist believing this is the year for a Christian takeover.  Let's just say I'm pretty skeptical of that happening.  Next is David Herzog that has a prophetic word for 2020, and this is going to be the most important year and decade of our lives.  There's going to be paradigm shifts for awakening, harvest, and revival.  I thought the Bible said there was going to be a great falling away.  He also says this is a season of fire and that we need to ask God for his baptism of fire.  We know that apart from the tongues of fire on Pentecost, fire is associated with God's judgment, so I'm just going to pass on this one.  Next is Dr.  Clarice Fluitt, another lady I've never heard of, and she wants to share her thoughts on what God has given her.  She says that it's going to be a year of awakening and that many are going to be anointed like John the Baptist.  There's going to be a change in worship and the frequencies, and during this, people are going to be getting healed and set free from addictions.  Then she talks about a transfer of wealth to us.  She goes on with, the Lord showed me this and that, and I'll let you watch the rest in the link.  I'll leave at the end.  Kynan Bridges, whom I've also never heard of, says 2020 will be years of supernatural manifestations and that it's the year of prophetic prosperity and prophetic vision.  He says prophecy releases prosperity and this is the greatest year of wealth transfer and that God is rising up.  market apostles to do this.  Wow.  Another unknown to me is Joan Hunter, who says a bunch of stuff with numerology in the Jewish calendar year, and numbers aligning for the first time with our years, and walking in dreams and visions, and a real word salad.  The next guy is James Gall.  I've heard of but don't know much about.  He says we are going into the era of Christendom.  We are going into the time of fulfilled prophecy like the billion soul harvest.  Now this is not biblical.  He's quoting false prophet Bob Jones.  The next guy I haven't heard of either, Jeremiah Johnson.  He introduces himself as not only a pastor, but a best-selling author.  What pride!  Unbelievable.  God's been talking to him about a boom in the upper room.  Wow.  He says, I want to prophesy to you about many prodigals that are going to come home.  He says that God has clearly said to him that the future of America belongs to the baby boomers.  But wait, the first guy, Hank Cunnaman, said it was going to be given to the children.  Didn't God contradict himself?  He also talks about a dream he had about Donald Trump running a marathon.  Okay.  Another unknown is Catherine Ruanala from Australia.  She goes on about the time of harvest.  Nothing too in-depth from her.  Yet another unknown is Hakeem Collins.  He says the Lord spoke to him to tell us that 2020 will be the year of the mouth.  that it will be the year of prophetic fulfillment and great awakening.  Once again, the Bible says the last days is going to be a great falling away, not a great awakening.  We will see manifestations of every word, every dream, and every will in our life.  Wow, sounds exciting.  God's going to separate the wheat and the tares and the goat and the sheep.  Wait, I don't think that happens this year, Hakeem.  You better read the Bible.  This happens at the end.  Glenda Jackson reveals what God has shown her and that we will receive double portion of heaven coming down on the saints and we will walk in a higher level with God than ever before.  Prophecy will increase and miracles will be a double portion.  The next guy, Kevin Zaday, talks about an angel visitation he got three years ago and that this year was the start of the year of the cloud of God coming into churches and great repentance will happen.  The children will be laying hands and seeing great miracles.  He talks about more angel visitations and more preachers coming forward because of this.  Warning!  Next, Anna Werner says God gave her two visions and it really sums up the greatest outpouring of God's glory of all the puzzle pieces of life coming together.  The next guy, Mario Murillo, I have heard of and I think there might be some stuff on him, but I'm not quite sure.  He says a bunch about feeling that we can take back America, but that's really about it though.  David Hernandez goes on to recite a bunch of scripture that amounts to there is going to be a fresh beginning in 2020 and God's going to do something new.  And it seems like every year some supposed prophet says something similar about God doing something new.  the next lady we're all familiar with good ol cindy jacobs god's been saying it's the year of the voice and a new prophetic season a restoration of gifts abilities and finances greater than any time in the past.  then she goes on about some name it and claim it junk.  larry sparks does a humble intro.  as a publisher of destiny sparks and president of larry sparks ministries like that's gonna make me believe your prophecies.  anymore good grief.  god has told him we are moving into the third missing move of god.  he goes on to refer to a priest of the past babbling in tongues then the jesus people movement and now he prophesies the third missing move of the reformation and a whole bunch of feel-good pep talk.  The next guy, Tracy Cook, tells us what God's going to do.  God's going to tell us to expedite time.  Huh?  God told him that in 2020, he's going to expedite prophecy, dreams, visions, and desires.  God's going to raise up prophetic snipers.  Okay, I think that's all we need to hear.  Check out the link if you want to watch this whole thing.  Prophetic snipers?  What?  The final lady, Lana Vosser, who says that 2020 God has told her that everything changes.  We will see what God sees and the manifestation of things of God in our life.  A year for this and a year for that and blah, blah, blah, all the same stuff we've heard a million times before.  Sid Roth finishes off with some things God's been speaking to him about in 2020.  He got three prophetic words.  Number one, he is a kosher chauffeur.  Okay.  Number two is that Jew and Gentile come together as one in the spirit in Jerusalem.  and number three was that we will be unstoppable.  so a whole bunch more joel osteen positive thinking and self-appreciation.  he closes off with his free pdf download called connecting to god's frequency.  that will teach us how to tap in to god's frequency and hear him clearly Sounds like a bunch of New Age mumbo-jumbo to me.  So what do we make of all this?  Lots of buzzwords and general prophecy, but not like the prophecy we see in the Bible.  that was very specific and clear.  And the fact is that if y'all look long enough, you're going to find people's prophecies don't always match in what God supposedly said to them, which is a reason to run.  But that's it till next time.  So take care, God bless, and have a wonderful God-filled 2020. ",
