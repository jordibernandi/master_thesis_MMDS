            "text": "Hello, I would like to apologize.  I would like to apologize for all those black men who always end up apologizing.  And I'd like to apologize for the fact that they like to apologize twice.  Apologizing once ain't enough.  You gotta apologize twice, then you gotta get on your knees and you gotta go sniff somebody's butt crack and lick somebody's boot.  So I'd like to apologize for all that damn apologizing.  In fact, I wanna apologize for this black fist on my shirt.  I want to apologize for putting the word black in the name black business school.  I should have just called it the colorblind business school or the multicultural business school or the people of color business school or the diversity business school.  I want to apologize for the fact that my mama didn't abort me.  like they do all the other little black babies.  they were born in the hood.  I want to apologize for getting the education and reading books instead of rapping or playing ball or going to prison.  I want to apologize for not being dead.  I want to apologize for being smarter than you.  I want to apologize For the fact that I scare the hell out of you every time you see me.  I want to apologize for the fact that you ain't never going to stop me.  I want to apologize for the fact that you know and that I know and that you know that I know and I know that you know that I know that I know the history.  I want to apologize for powernomics.  I want to apologize for the fact that I have read this book.  And then I understand the history that you didn't teach me in school.  I want to apologize for reading books like Black Labor, White Wealth that explained to me all the terrible things you've done to black people that maybe you need to apologize for.  But I want to apologize for asking you to apologize.  I want to apologize if I hurt your feelings.  I want to apologize if my mere existence scares you.  I want to apologize if me being strong and black and incredible It just makes you nervous.  I want to apologize for all of that.  And after I finish apologizing, I ain't apologizing for shit.  Because you should be apologizing to me for what you're doing to black people.  I'm just joking.  I ain't apologizing to you for nothing.  You need to show up.  I'll be waiting for you to show up at my house and apologize to me.  Peace. ",
