            "text": "My video for March the 30th, 2020 is video number 3411.  The title is Gitmo, AKA Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.  There's no doubt in my mind that the swamp must be drained if humanity is ever going to see truth and justice prevail.  That's not easy on this planet of lies.  Draining the swamp is a monumental challenge that requires courage and commitment.  I have seen aerial photographs of Gitmo as it was under Obama and how it is now.  It does seem as if it has been greatly expanded, not shut down.  Of course, there is no way I can confirm the authenticity of the pictures nor the actual reason for such an expansion.  Nevertheless, I do hope it is true.  While some of my friends say we will not see real change for a long time, that does not give me any comfort in my conviction that my life has real meaning and that I will actually see at least the beginning stages of my heaven on earth dream and vision actually happening.  One friend recently sent me channeled messages that indicate Obama and Pelosi are on some sort of divine mission and are double agents.  I cannot see that.  They belong in the military trials for treason along with many other deep state players.  On this one, I am rooting for the Trump card being played for the benefit and liberation of humanity.  Yes, Trump continues to be an enigma for me, as I've said so many times now.  And I wish I could get completely on board with him, but I don't trust the whole political system.  It's interesting.  I mean, I did watch a video just a little while ago, actually, where Trump is saying it was approved 100%, no dissenters.  in the vote in Congress.  I assume he's meaning both houses, but I don't know that.  That wasn't stated in the video.  But to get 100% approval on anything is almost unbelievable, quite honestly.  Nevertheless, I believe that's what he said.  I did hear him say that as he was getting on the plane.  I'm assuming to fly to Florida, but I'm not sure where he's going.  It's none of my business.  It's his business.  Anyway, folks, I get things from friends all the time.  And one of my friends that I really respect a lot sends me channeled messages quite a bit.  He's very much into channeled information.  And one of the things indicated that Pelosi is and Obama, they're held up as some sort of double agents and that are really there to bring about positive change for humanity.  I'm sorry, I can't see that they are into anything positive.  I don't think I read this yet.  I did go on the internet to To see if I could find anything, and I did see this, the internet has been buzzing with rumors that high-level VIP members of the Deep State, also known as Cabal, Illuminati, Global Elite, are being detained for human rights abuses and corruption and are being taken by U.S.  special forces to military prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Gitmo, as a result of thousands of sealed indictments.  Multiple sources have been reporting on some of the key figures taken there.  While these are still only rumors, recent events point to their plausibility.  If accurate, these secret investigations, arrests, and extractions to Gitmo, where they face extended detention and military justice, has enormous political implications and makes possible the release of suppressed information previously withheld by the deep state.  I wish, I hope, I pray, I hope, I meditate on these things.  I think about these things regularly.  I'm not going to say that the political implications are every day, but the spiritual implications are definitely every day.  As I do my routine of praying for certain of my friends that I pray for all the time, day in and day out, and I've been doing that for a long time.  And I keep praying for God at the top of my list to actually take action.  Now, if some of these rumors are true, if the deep state is being rounded up and held for crimes against humanity, I'm applauding and cheering.  And that will go a great way in helping me trust Donald Trump and some of the players that are alleged to be working with him.  Can I prove any of it?  No.  And neither can anybody else that I'm aware of.  I did see a Patriot report.  just a little bit earlier, and it indicated that it's really revving up, that this whole thing is coming to a head, and it would mean that Nancy Pelosi and many other Democrats and Republicans are ultimately going to face charges of treason.  Treason has a death penalty attached to it.  Again, I would hope that at least most, if not all of these people could repent, but I see that as very unlikely because so many of them seem to be locked in to their dark agenda.  And we're talking about people in high places from the crown and political leaders and religious leaders all over the world, in all the religions, in most of the countries.  Will these promises and the expectations that I have that my life will have meaning by actually bringing about heaven on earth, I find it hard.  to believe some of what I hear and some of the people that are being put forth as mouthpieces, I don't have a resonance with them.  And I don't certainly have a resonance with any channeled message that paints Obama and Pelosi as some kind of heroes on a hero's journey or a hero's mission.  I just can't see that.  I can't get my mind around it.  And believe me, if there was a way that I could ascertain any truthfulness in it, I would be very happy to.  But I can't.  It just does not fit in with any of the information that I've been exposed to throughout my life when I've looked at things from very different points of view.  I want my life when it ends to have meaning.  I don't know that I want to live forever, but I wouldn't mind if I could be young and reverse aging and be in my prime and experience the joys and pleasures of life.  It seems like a lot of what many of us have experienced are the pains of life, not the pleasures.  And it's sad to me, it's very sad.  Have I wasted my life?  Will arrests actually be made?  Will people actually be brought to justice?  That would be a godsend.  Then I could say, finally, my prayers are being answered.  Finally, my life has meaning and I've not wasted it.  Thank you folks for listening and namaste. ",
