Sometimes those really bad ground-level apologetics are exactly what keep people entangled in bad thought processes.  So, let's roll the intro and figure out why if we all came from the same monkeys, why don't we speak the same language?  Alrighty, everybody.  So if you're new here, please go ahead and hit the subscribe button.  if you decide that you like the content you're gonna see.  But, like, after you see the content, because otherwise that's just a blank sub and you don't know what you're getting into.  Also, I'm gonna have an announcement video here in a few days to let people know what's been going on with the channel, so definitely keep an eye out for that.  That said, let's get into the fan art and then into the video proper.  So first off, we have Suras on a Sheep by DiscoSkone, then we have a Furry Suras by OwlShapeshifter, and then Suras on an Etch-A-Sketch by Derek.  As always, thank you all for your fan art submissions, and let's get right into the video, where today we'll figure out why we speak different languages.  Apparently. ",

Like, it's a pretty well-understood sociological concept that the evolution of language is its own thing.  Being human and having the genetics that we do means that we specifically have the ability to speak and perceive language as we currently understand it.  Like, again, the fact that we're all human just means we have the ability, the potential, for language.  It doesn't mean that we have to all speak the same language, it just means that we can speak a language.  Just like having opposable thumbs doesn't mean that we have to use those opposable thumbs in the same way.  For one person, an opposable thumb means that they're able to steadily handle tools and build, but for another person, opposable thumbs may mean that they're able to craft a quilt.  somebody like me it means i can keep hitting the space bar when playing league of legends to center the camera on myself because i can't play with locked camera.  having the ability to use a tool does it mean that everybody in the race is going to use the tool the same way?

We're able to see how certain languages come from Latin and Germanic roots, and then evolve into something completely different as time goes on.  If you want a very basic level of this?  Let's go ahead and take the difference between British English and American English.  Certain words are spelled completely differently between the two dialects.  Certain words mean something completely different here than they do in Great Britain.  If I say a biscuit, I'm talking about a piece of bread.  It may be buttery, it may be flaky, but it's gonna end up having a crust, and I'm probably gonna pile eggs, cheese, and bacon on it to make a sandwich.  But if I go to Britain, and I use the word biscuit, I could just as easily be talking about what I would refer to as a cookie, and if I want to get an actual biscuit there, at least as far as I understand the word, I'll probably have to ask for a scone.  Even certain base-level things that we take for granted, like our mannerisms, vary culture to culture.  And as these are all methods of communication, they are in and of themselves a type of language.  For instance, in my country, if I sit cross-legged and point my foot towards somebody, it doesn't mean anything.  But there are some countries where if I do that, I'm insulting them by saying that they are no better than the dirt on my feet.  That is another difference in language with something as subtle as how I'm operating my body.  And again, it's incredibly easy for us to actually trace these things back to their roots. ",

Once the minions of Noah unleashed to repopulate the earth, they did exactly what God told them not to do and stay in one spot.  And instead of being fruitful and multiplied, they stayed in one spot and tried to... This guy is a representation of a guy named Nimrod, dutifully named. ",

The nomenclature of Nimrod meaning stupid, at least in the English dialect, isn't something that really has a whole lot of merit.  But anyway, I think the more important thing here is noting that, one, if we're talking about Noah, they were fruitful and multiplied.  They just didn't spread as far as God wanted them to do, but they literally did multiply.  Moreover, and more importantly, you are aware that the genetic bottleneck that would have come from Noah means that we functionally wouldn't have a human race in a handful of generations, right?  I'm not meaning to actually insult the Bible when I call it a book of fairy tales in this particular instance.  It is a historical document, but it does contain myths and legend in it.  The problem is that when you try to take those myths and legends that cultures use to define themselves, and then try to argue that those are actual historical happenings, even when they're fantastical and certainly not comporting with reality, you start running to an issue where things that make absolutely no sense when you look at them under a microscope start to have to be justified.  Like two people populating the Earth with Adam and Eve, or eight people populating the Earth after Noah.  Not counting the amount of inbreeding that would have happened between the animals themselves, since there was only two of each.  But based on how you're wording this so far, it sounds like you're trying to treat this as a book filled with nothing but accurate history. ",

They weren't trying to reach the heavens to become supreme rulers of the world.  It was literally a story of God being upset that humans could accomplish things when united.  Now, in reality, we would be able to tell, based on how we know language works, that people would not suddenly lose the ability to communicate on a tower like this.  Not on a mass scale, anyways.  The story of the Tower of Babel has two purposes.  One, to show that God can and will subvert the human race if they try to blaspheme against him.  And two, it tries to work as a method of explaining why there are diverse languages in the human race.  And you can find similar stories in other religions and even mythoses behind different countries.  Culture works really hard to try to explain itself.  Trying to explain the reasons why you exist in the way that you do is part of being human.  Again, my issue is when you take those myths that obviously are there to try to be a stand-in with explanatory power, and argue that they are in fact historical reality.  And not just an elaborate metaphor or an extrapolation on a real event.  Like the difference between saying Alexander the Great existed and Alexander the Great existed and also had several divine accomplishments. ",

The existence of a place called Babel does not make the story of the Tower of Babel true.  Like I pointed out with Alexander the Great, simply having a man who existed who we know as Alexander the Great does not suddenly mean that all of his accomplishments that were documented are true.  Or let's take another local easy example.  A place exists called the United States.  We have a myth that we teach to children about the discovery of the United States by Christopher Columbus, the pilgrims escaping here and then befriending the Indians, and then settling.  That is a series of events that did in fact happen, but it is severely whitewashed to the point to be myth, while everything that I mentioned did technically happen in some aspect, it ignores other very important things, like the fact that the Americas were actually discovered by America Vespucci, and that the settling on Plymouth was a little more chaotic and less friendly than simply asking the local natives to pack up their shit and leave.  I could tell the realistic version of the story, and then I could tell the whitewashed mythological version of the story, and based on your logic, you wouldn't be able to determine which one is true.  because they both happened in the same places with the same people and the same moving parts.

There's also another dialect called Old Georgian, which was used for religious purposes.  They're actually part of what's called the South Caucasian language family.  And if you take the Old Georgian script, it actually is derivative of the Greek alphabet.  This is because the order of the alphabet is actually in the same sequence as the original Greek.  The shape of many of the characters is also very derivative of the Greek alphabet.  And Old Georgian is what we get the derivatives of later Georgian languages from.  So, uh, when you try to tell me that we don't know where that language came from, we do.  We literally do.
