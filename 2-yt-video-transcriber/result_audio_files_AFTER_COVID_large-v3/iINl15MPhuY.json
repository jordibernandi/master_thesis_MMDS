            "text": "Welcome back.  According to public records, Dominion voting machines are used in 2000 jurisdictions in 30 states.  According to experts, if one site has a flaw, other sites are likely to as well, which is why Texas rejected using Dominion software three times, raising concerns that the system was not safe from fraudulent or unauthorized manipulation.  That's troubling, given we already know that at least two software glitches in Georgia and Michigan occurred on election night.  Attorney Sidney Powell is leading the charge against Dominion, and she says she has enough evidence of fraud to launch a massive criminal investigation.  Sidney, thanks very much for being here.  We appreciate your time this morning.  I want to get right into it.  We just heard about the software made by Smartmatic from Rudy, and I want to get your take on what you and I spoke about just a few minutes ago, and that is a gentleman named Peter Neffinger.  Tell me how he fits into all of this. ",

And it just so happens.  he's on Mr.  Biden's presidential transition team.  that's going to be non-existent because we're fixing to overturn the results of the election in multiple states.  And President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes, but by millions of votes that were shifted by this software that was designed expressly for that purpose.  We have sworn witness testimony why the software was designed.  It was designed to rig elections.  He was fully briefed on it.  He saw it happen in other countries.  It was exported internationally for profit by the people that are behind Smartmatic and Dominion.  They did this on purpose.  It was calculated.  They've done it before.  We have evidence from 2016 in California.  We have so much evidence.  I feel like it's coming in through a fire hose. ",

Millions of Americans have written, I would say by now, definitely hundreds of thousands have stepped forward with their different experiences of voter fraud.  But this is a massive election fraud and I'm very concerned.  it involved not only Dominion and its Smartmatic software, but that the software essentially was used by other election machines also.  It's the software that was the problem.  Even their own manual explains how votes can be wiped away.  They can put it's like drag and drop Trump votes to a separate folder and then delete that folder.  It's absolutely brazen how people bought the system and why they bought the system.  In fact, every state that bought Dominion for sure should have a criminal investigation or at least a serious investigation of the federal of the officers in the states who bought the software.  We've even got evidence of some kickbacks.  essentially. ",
