My position isn't simply to say, I mean, I will say ACAB and I can describe it further if you guys would like, but that's a totally separate tangent.  But when it comes to defunding the police, I don't really care about the optics as far as I care more about making sure that people understand what it means.  Defunding the police means that we need to roll back the massive amount of spending that we have given two precincts all across the nation since the 60s by calling it community policing or any number of different reasons with very little accountability while changing legislation so that cops can pretty much get away with murder extra judiciously as long as they can state that they were in a reasonable fear for their lives or had a reasonable fear that this person that they were following was a threat to other people's safety.

On top of that, the fact that you think that cops are inherently bad because they have to enforce laws that you may or may not agree with is kind of fucking asinine, right?  Like, why don't you just, like, elect people who are going to systematically go after those laws and try to repeal them, right?

I think that I guess what it.  the thing that gets me those sushi is and the problem is kind of messaging is it seems to make it very difficult to discuss the issues that are bad about the police.  Like, for example, I did a video about police unions.  And how police unions basically make, they help make all cops bad in some degree.  And it's a very tight argument, right?  Because they make it so that some of the problems Hasan mentioned, for example, not all of them are enmeshed in law, but at least some of them are.  Some of them are enmeshed in police contracts, police union contracts that are negotiated by unions.  And they make it so that it's very difficult to fire police officers who commit crimes or break the law or whatever.  To the point where you can't. ",

This is a big problem.  But when we talk about defund the police, you absolutely hit the nail on the head here.  You start with the unions.  The unions have to protect members.  That's how a union works.  So it's the unions that basically empower bad police.  It's the unions who say, we will protect your job no matter what.  You've got to take their money away.  They're the people that are making the legal arguments, giving you the free high-powered lawyers.  You know, look at the guy that kneeled on George Floyd.

So, you know, that's the problem.  When in fact, the problem is that 85 percent of America's cities have police unions with police union contracts that give them something approaching meaningful immunity rights.  from not only being prosecuted, but being fired.  And again, that study I mentioned found that people like the officer who killed George Floyd are kept around, even though most cops don't have nearly as many use of force complaints.  Those who have lots of use of force complaints are nevertheless maintained because of these unions that protect them.  And more than that, these unions give them bad training.  In Minneapolis, the mayor had this program, tried to reject a training program called Killology that said that officers should not be afraid of using force, but the police union forced them on it anyway.

So if somebody is bad at their job because they don't have sufficient training, you either don't assign them to those roles, or if that's unavoidable, you must take them off the street and train them again.  You will require money to do that, but that undoubtedly makes society a better place.  Last point.  Last point, Nassan.  But if you are doing police brutality and breaking the law as a police officer when you should be held to a higher standard as a citizen, you should be in fucking prison and there should be no debate about this.  And again, it goes down these party lines of right and left.  So you can make the world a better place by taking incompetent police and training them.  That requires money, but you have to get rid of the unions and defund that aspect of the police if you want to get rid of the people who systemically brutalize the citizenry. ",

No, he's talking about training, but he doesn't understand fundamentally how long they actually have to train and what their background is, right?  First of all, you actually need, I don't know about any other world, but in West Virginia, right?  In my county with the officers that I work with, you need to have at least a bachelor's degree and you need to have 28 weeks of training in the police academy.  Then before you're even allowed to be alone, you need like another 28 weeks of training alongside a superior officer.  And then on top of that, you have bi-monthly training as well.  And then elective training that you can do on your own time that you get paid for.  So there's actually quite more training than most people think. ",
