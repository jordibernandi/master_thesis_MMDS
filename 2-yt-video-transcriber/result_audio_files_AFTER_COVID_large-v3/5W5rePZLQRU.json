            "text": "hey welcome back everyone.  some great stories to go over today.  first off we're going to jump into breaking news.  the ccp virus outbreak in china is continuing and questions are being raised on the whereabouts of seven of the top members of the chinese communist party.  also heavy rains are continuing along the yangtze river in china and many of these downstream reservoirs are overflowing.  also the US State Department has designated four major Chinese state-run media outlets as foreign missions of the Chinese Communist Party and in the United States protesters are trying to set up a new quote black house.  now some of the broader stories we'll be going over today.  the Chinese Communist Party is beginning to censor news of the floods in China and the censorship is coming as damage is increasing.  also the Chinese soldiers who killed these 20 Indian soldiers on the disputed border between India and China were allegedly quote new faces to the area.  also the Chinese Communist Party has issued an alert stating there is no epidemic in Beijing's 301 military hospital and that is now raising concerns among netizens that there is in fact an epidemic at that hospital.  we'll be going over these stories and more now before we jump into it.  folks this channel is being censored on youtube.  a lot of our advertisers are being restricted and so we've recently launched a patreon if you can please check it out in the link below.  and also every sunday we'll be doing a live q a for our patreon supporters.  now let's jump into the news.  so first off the Chinese Communist Party is now censoring news about these floods in China.  again.  this is taking place as the damage to the local areas are increasing and also amid local concerns over the integrity of the Three Gorges Dam.  now first off the economic loss currently is about 3.4 billion dollars and that's according to the ccp.  so take it for what it's worth.  more than 213,000 people have already needed emergency rescue 9,300 homes collapsed and 171,000 homes damaged and these are just the numbers we can get out.  and there are also concerns that flooding could get worse as the flooding is impacting 980 reservoirs that are in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river.  now a few points on this.  first off 11.2 million people hit by heavy rains in 26 provinces.  now local news is saying 300 reservoirs in Anhui have exceeded the flood control limit and many villages in Luan city were flooded.  and in just that area 9,500 people were evacuated.  and also Radio Free Asia is now reporting that the Chinese Communist Party is now censoring information on this flood.  news on the flood has been deemed quote sensitive information by the Chinese Communist Party.  also Taiwanese news is reporting.  quote expert warns China's Three Gorges Dam is in danger of collapse.  A prominent Chinese hydrologist, Wang Weiluo, is warning that the Three Gorges Dam could collapse at any moment.  Here's a quote from that article.  Wang pointed out that the dam's design, construction, and quality inspection were all carried out by the same group of people and that the project was finished too quickly.  He said that even Chinese Vice Minister of Water Resources Ye Yan Chun confessed at a June 10th press conference that water levels of at least 148 rivers in the country have risen above warning thresholds, which proves, he says, that the Three Gorges Dam has a limited effect on flood control.  In addition to this, Epoch Times has been doing some exclusive interviews on the ground.  Again, we're blacklisted in mainland China, but we can do phone interviews.  We also have a lot of sources in China.  According to Huang Yang, who grew up by the Zhaodu River, said that many local people have never seen such a large amount of water in their entire lifetimes.  now a big update on this conflict between India and China.  they're saying now that these soldiers who carried out the violence on these Indian soldiers were new faces to this region.  jumping into a report from Hong Kong Epoch Times it says many Chinese soldiers in the bloody conflict between China and India are new faces and it says quote when they arrived at the Chinese camps these Indian soldiers saw the Chinese had set up a new camp.  they went to investigate.  the first thing the Indian side noticed was that the Chinese army did not seem to be a familiar face.  they were not soldiers usually deployed in the area and Indian reports are saying that the 16th Infantry's battalion assessment of the conflict was that the Chinese army involved in the fighting was not a conventional force deployed on the front line of the actual control line and it did not belong to China's previous participation in multiple rounds of talks.  now this is raising some speculation on who these soldiers were why they were deployed to that actual area and why they were not seen before.  now a bit of broader context to this.  remember that reports recently came out saying the Chinese Communist Party gave the kill orders that the Chinese Communist Party ordered this to take place.  now Indian media are discussing this right now and this taken into context that these are new faces is raising further speculation of pre-planning for this violence by the Chinese Communist Party.  now we'll have to see what other information comes out on this.  moving on to some news in Beijing the Chinese Communist Party has issued this alert saying there's no epidemic in Beijing's 301 military hospital and the fact that they issued that alert is making many many netizens concerned that there is in fact an epidemic at that hospital.  Now, reports from Taiwan are stating, quote, the official microblog of the Haidan district government in Beijing released a, quote, rumor announcement early this morning.  It stated, quote, recently the news about the outbreak of 301 hospital and the list of more than 100 closed communities in Haidan district has spread on the Internet, which has aroused the attention of netizens.  check with the relevant department that the above are rumors and hope that the majority of netizens will not listen believe or spread it and at buck times has an exclusive story showing that the chinese communist party has in fact been covering up cases at that hospital and at local military compounds.  On June 23rd, a whistleblower at the Beijing military compound using the pseudonym Zhang Bo revealed information about the outbreaks.  in an interview with the Epoch Times.  He said on June 1st there were three men between the ages of 45 and 50 who were diagnosed at the military compound.  The Epoch Times also received a leaked internal document warning about the cases at the 301 Hospital.  It states that, quote, because of the outbreak in the 301 Hospital, many military camps and military restrooms have coronavirus patients and close contacts.  Please take extra precautions.  Now we'll be looking into that again as it develops.  Moving on though.  Now, so why do netizens not believe the Chinese Communist Party's narratives?  Why is it that when the Chinese Communist Party releases a statement saying everything's okay, stop spreading rumors, that it has the opposite result with Chinese netizens?  because over time they've understood that when the CCP says something isn't happening, when they find it important to come out and say, debunk a rumor, it usually means the rumor is true.  And this has been a pattern with the Chinese Communist Party, which many Chinese netizens and Chinese citizens overall are familiar with.  Many of them say, including dissidents I've spoken to, that if you want to read the truth, read the Chinese news outlets, and believe it's the opposite of what they're saying, then you might get an accurate picture of what's taking place in China.  And because the Chinese Communist Party has many systems in place to automatically censor keywords, much like, unfortunately, some of the social networks in the US apparently have, they've developed their own language when talking about these things and the humor can be pretty entertaining.  just some analysis too on why the CCP might not be forthcoming with outbreaks at these military compounds.  it is trying to protect the integrity of the Chinese military.  it's trying to protect the image of the Chinese military when it comes to the virus.  we might remember during the bigger outbreaks in China previously They were saying that many of the military branches had not had cases, and that was, say, going against facts on the ground that many cases were being seen in the military.  They've been trying to cover up especially virus outbreaks within their military ranks.  Now moving on to some news between China and Russia, Chinese citizens are being accused now of faking CCP virus tests in order to leave Russia.  Now some news on this, South China Morning Post is reporting, Chinese citizens have faked COVID-19 test reports so they can board flights home from Russia, prompting multiple warnings from Beijing's envoy to Moscow.  It says the embassy had issued nearly identical warnings going back to May 29th, but again recently on Sunday after discovering people had forged negative nucleic acid test results that the government requires passengers to take within five days of flying from Russia to China.  and it continues.  the embassy said the passengers had caused great harm to the health and safety of the passengers and crews of the flights and undermined china's domestic epidemic.  prevention work says the counterfeiters were under investigation and would quote bear corresponding legal responsibilities.  A bit of background on that.  Many Chinese citizens have been trapped in the China-Russia border region, and those not trapped at the border region are still trying to get back to China.  Many of them have become pseudo-displaced citizens in Russia.  They cannot go back to China, and Russia does not want them there anymore.  Russia had even stripped the citizenship of many Chinese living in Russia.  Another funny thing about these tensions between China and Russia is that normally when things like this happen between China and other countries, you have increased tensions.  We're not seeing that with China and Russia.  Instead, the Chinese Communist Party is defending the Russian decision.  now imagine if the United States stripped citizenship of Chinese nationals and sent them back to China or sent them to the border regions of China and China wouldn't let them back in right.  what would happen?  CCP would say oh you're being racist.  this is an attack of the United States on China.  they're not saying that when it comes to Russia and why is that?  and rather than criticize Russia for this decision it has been criticizing the Chinese nationals Trapped on the border region and unable to enter either country.  It's criticizing its own citizens and telling them they should stay in place and be Responsible to their countries and deal with the virus as they see fit where they're at and this of course shows the two-faced nature of Chinese Communist Party policy.  Again, the issue is not protecting the citizens.  The issue is protecting the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.  Now moving on to some updates from the United States. ",
