            "text": "Hey there internet, my name's Luxander, and today I would like to talk about Elliot Page having come out and how you can be trans and nonbinary at the same time.  I guess if you're not familiar with this news, Elliot Page, who is an actor, came out as trans and nonbinary.  You may know them from roles such as Juno and in The Umbrella Academy.  He wrote a letter in which they stated that, you know, trans and non-binary, and queer, I think, is another word that they use to describe themselves, and that their pronouns are he slash they.  I will just briefly say that I don't, I cannot say that I was totally surprised by this news.  It is very strange that I was a person who was really into the movie Juno as a young person, and, you know, I watched when Elliot Page came out as a lesbian and was like, oh, you know, that kind of makes sense.  I can see it.  And now that he's come out as trans, I'm like, oh, oh, there's weird queer vibrations through the universe going on right now that I don't know exactly how to explain, but I'm not the only transmasc person who feels this way.  It's an amusing thing from that perspective.  It is also spectacular news.  It is so great to have trans representation, you know, people being aware of transmasculine people in particular.  I don't know if Elliott would use this word to describe themselves, but on a broad categorization kind of way they were assigned female and now he identifies as trans, typically we would describe that as transmasculine.  I apologize if that is not a term that he would be comfortable with.  A lot of people's perception of what being trans is is, you know, the idea of a person who was assigned male, like a man becoming a woman.  This is the popular narrative.  Transgender women have always had much more visibility, they have always been you know, the butt of jokes in a lot of 90s movies, etc.  This is not always a good thing for them.  A lot of the time it draws unwanted scrutiny.  It makes it harder for trans women in the wild to continue to pass because attributes that would formerly have not been noted upon are now being commonly associated with being transgender because of this high-profile visibility, so it's not always good.  However, I personally am super enthused about the idea of having a person really, really out there in public who was assigned female and is coming out at the very least socially transitioning, changing name and pronouns.  Like honestly, the only representation that trans men and trans masculine people have really had publicly up to this point is like Buck Angel, which okay, I guess, in the sense that he presented the idea to people that you could be assigned female and then transition and be like a buff, very clearly masculine man, that's cool or whatever, but also he has a lot of shit opinions, and I would like for that to not be the only human person who is trans masculine or trans male to be in the public eye.  So it's really exciting to me, I'm super pleased for Elliot, and I hope that, you know, his life is spectacular and amazing, and that if they choose to medically transition, that it goes very well.  I totally understand if they want to be private about those things.  I would personally think it would be really fucking cool if he were somewhat public about those things.  It is absolutely no trans person's responsibility to let you know what they plan on doing or make any of their information public.  That's their private medical history.  I just think it would be cool.  All that being said, the main thrust of why I am making this video is that Elliot Page came out as trans and non-binary.  there seems to be some confusion about how that is a thing that you could be.  So I would love to kind of just address those points of confusion and see if we can make things a little bit more clear.  I think the easiest place to start here is is just with definitions.  Let us take a look at the word trans.  Trans is short for transgender the overwhelming majority of the time.  The word transsexual was primarily a medical term that many trans people who came out during that time still identify with the term transsexual, it's just not as common, and you really shouldn't assume that if someone identifies as trans, they are identifying as transsexual.  It's an older term, many people don't feel great about it, it's pretty safe to assume generally that transgender would apply, and many transsexual people also kind of consider themselves broadly transgender, but it's not the identity label they're comfortable with.  Looking at the definition of the word transgender, transgender just means you have, like, some kind of gender experience that is different than the one that you were assigned at birth or that is associated with your assigned sex.  I would like to state, just for ",
