And so here's an individual that actually did it.  And then she says to me, the black community has her back because I guess she's Joy Behar.  I don't know.  I don't know her very well.  But what I will say is, it didn't make any sense to me.  It was very unfit.  And this is kind of what we see in the media today.  You've got Megyn Kelly, who basically gets chastised and people are trying to cancel her for talking about or even asking the question.  And then you've got Joey Behar, on the other hand, who actually did it, but she should be able to do so because I guess she's on the left.  And so this is what I think we see a lot, media bias.

I can't tell a Jewish person how they should feel, you know, with the anti-Semitism that we see across the country.  You know, so we have to make sure we allow those people to still have a voice.  At the same time, I'm not the kind of person to put everybody in a box.  I think that's divisive.  But again, I was ready to talk about the policies.  I was ready to talk about career opportunities that I want to bring to Baltimore.  And I thought, you know what, this is a great time to talk to the other side of the aisle.  I never get invited to CNN or MSNBC or, you know, left wing media.  They don't even want me on there.

And they're talking about the fact that they were so excited that Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden's VP.  Right.  That was the whole thing.  But it's only win with black women.  If you are a Democrat, if you think like them, you know, if you're a black woman running as a Republican, that is like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe you're running.  You're a coon.  You're Uncle Tom.  You're all these things.  And so for me, you know, when you're in the black community and you've been voting for Democrats for over 50 years, they do take our vote for granted.  And that's what I was kind of showing in Baltimore.  You know, for us to move the needle, we have to have allies on both sides of the aisle.  So I don't understand why we do this.  We chastise each other because we want to run in a different party.  I noticed in the white community, you can run as a Democrat or Republican.  They don't actually, you know, chastise you for it.  But in the black community, we have something totally different going on.  So it's to me, you know, they just want you to think the same.  I guess they always want you to do it.  But I look at those women in The View and I know they are both or all of them are millionaires.  You know, they live in a different basically society than the people do in West Baltimore.  I know Sunny said she's from Baltimore.  I wanted to ask her when's the last time she's been to West Baltimore, because it is.  We've got 17,000 vacant homes.  We have a poor education system and we have crime and violence.  And so For me, it's like, I don't think they understand because they're not on the ground.  They don't feel it like we do here.

You have to think, first and foremost, a lot of people don't even want to admit it because, you know, the cancel culture and the backlash from it.  But people understand.  I mean, when you have President Trump tweeting out, look, District 7, if you vote for Kimberly Klasick, she wants to bring career opportunities.  She wants to bring businesses.  People understand that's basically him saying.  If she's elected and I'm reelected, we are going to make Baltimore great again.  You know, we were once a manufacturing powerhouse here and we allowed all those jobs to go overseas during the Clinton administration.  And I think Trump, you know, he's all about the economy and he wants to bring a lot of those jobs back.  I want to bring that biotech industry here to Baltimore and we can do that.  But at the same time, it's like, look, if you're not here on the ground and you don't understand firsthand what people are going through, then I really don't understand how you can comment on it.  You know, I know Sunny said she grew up in Baltimore.  I have not seen her in West Baltimore a day in my life.  And I've been in this area for 10 years now.  But at the same time, it's like, look, why don't we come up with solutions?  Why are we going back and forth basically saying who's black enough or who's not black enough?  That's just a distraction.  We gotta make some real results come to the area. ",

            "text": "Okay, so speaking of Baltimore, there was another moment in the clip today where when Sunny asks her first question, you know, she doesn't really say hello.  She basically kind of throws you under the bus.  Oh, you're not living in Baltimore right now.  She's from Baltimore.  And you had a great response to her, I thought.  Could you just kind of repeat what you've done in Baltimore and why you care about Baltimore? ",

It's kind of something that we did on our own, but we helped over 200 women become gainfully employed.  30% went on to be financially independent.  And so for me, that's what I'm trying to do as a member of Congress is bring those career opportunities, focus more on job training, putting apprenticeship programs to the high schools.  Like this is all stuff that I wanted to talk about on The View, but I wasn't given that opportunity.  But that's what it's about, getting people back to work, getting some of that crime and violence down because there are opportunities.  And so for me, I feel like, you know, Sunny, if she's from Baltimore and she sees how bad we're suffering here, why hasn't she tried to come home and do anything?  I haven't heard anything that she's tried to do on the ground here.  If this is really truly her home, you know, there's a lot of people suffering here.  So I don't know.  I don't even know why she threw that in there, but she did. ",

Gallup did a poll.  Eighty one percent of black Americans do not want to defund the police.  The only people talking about it are people that live in gated communities or they're running around with security themselves.  You know, there's not.  there's not the people living in these dangerous community that is saying defund the police.  And it doesn't make any sense.  If you want police to be better trained, you want police reform.  You need more funding.  So it makes absolutely no sense at all.  And nobody on the ground is saying that.  But, yeah, that's what we see.  You see the people that are living the elite life basically saying this is what people living in low income neighborhoods want.  And that's just not true.  They never take the cameras into these neighborhoods and talk to people on the ground.  They just act as if they know what they want. ",
