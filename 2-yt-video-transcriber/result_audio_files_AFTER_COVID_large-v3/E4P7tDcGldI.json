            "text": "Alert as follows, comrades.  This is an early alert of supposed activity this weekend on the 4th of July that would cause harm to our people on a very large scale.  The Huey P. Newton Gun Club has received intel from two credible sources that multiple white nationalist groups slash militias are planning a nationwide attack on all of our people over the 4th of July weekend.  The sources could not confirm the motives of the nationalists, but they might be tied to the events that have recently happened with the taking down of Confederate symbols across the United States and the retaliation against police brutality across the United States as well.  We as a preparedness group should take this threat very seriously for two reasons.  One, For the events that have sparked the epicenter in Minnesota with the murder of George Floyd.  And the sudden spike of clan recruitment in the southern states the past three months.  Please do not take this threat lightly.  OK.  Over the past couple of months, there has definitely been a spike in recruitment in this area.  It is my job to pay attention to these things and I have.  There's also been a uptick in rhetoric online threats from these different militia groups.  And again, this is not a training exercise.  This is real.  The threat is real this weekend.  Take precautions when you're out and about with your families.  You should avoid large crowds of people, which shouldn't be hard because we're still on a coronavirus protocol.  So staying away from large crowds should be easy.  Most of the fireworks events and so forth, I believe, have been canceled.  If not, you may want to consider staying away from those things.  And I know, like myself, we're not celebrating the Fourth of July, but I know people and their children like to see fireworks and may want to go out anyway.  I would advise you not to do it.  while you're out.  Be on the lookout for anyone that looks suspicious.  Yeah, a white person wearing a coat or anything that doesn't look appropriate for the weather because they might be carrying a firearm up under that jacket or whatever.  Also, any packages or anything like that that might be sitting around with no one attending it.  Just like the announcement in airports.  If you see a package, no one around it, get away from it.  Avoid being near trash cans, trash bins, things like that because these white nationalists and white supremacists have been known to put bombs inside those things with nails in them and things like that.  So the bottom line is protect your family, at all times.  Be on the lookout.  We all should be on a heightened state of awareness anyway with everything that's going on around the country right now.  But this weekend, you need to be on an extra high state of alert.  This threat is real.  This is not some conspiracy theory or anything like that.  This information comes from credible sources down through the Huey P. Newton Gun Club.  And It is important that you take whatever steps you deem necessary to protect yourselves and your families. ",
