            "text": "What can therapy do for you?  Well, I think we all have certain ideas about that.  I think an equally important question is, what can't therapy do for you?  And that's the topic we're going to be exploring today.  Hello once again from the Prim Reaper.  Wow, it's been a long time, hasn't it?  I've been off at my practicum developing actual concrete skills as a counselor, and what a ride that's been.  By no means am I coming out of this calling myself a seasoned professional or anything like that, but I can say that the experience that I have had has allowed me to be able to distinguish between the things that are completely unrealistic to expect out of therapy, and then some more realistic outcomes.  Before I get to that, I'd like to briefly remind everyone that this is going to be a call-in show, so I urge you all to click the link in the low bar leading to our call-in Discord, where our seasoned moderators will help you to get connected with us throughout the show.  Just thought I'd mention that here at the beginning so that we can try and get some folks lined up when the introduction is over.  So without further ado... Unfortunately, a common experience that I have seen from people coming to therapy is this idea that therapy can help them to magically come up with the solutions to all their life's problems, to be, or at least provide, the quick fix that they've been missing all this time that will help them solve everything that's been going wrong for them.  This is especially the case when people have certain types of problems related to at least partially external factors.  Crippling debt is a good example.  I'm sorry to say when someone's problem is related to the fact that they are unable to afford groceries.  the next week, even if I'm working pro bono, And let's be honest, it's not like I was working a paid internship, so everything I've done for the past half year has been pro bono.  Well, nothing that I'm going to be able to do in the room with you is going to be able to put those groceries on your table.  In this case, the closest thing that I'll be able to do is to offer referrals to resources that can give money to those who are struggling.  Another unrealistic example of something to expect out of therapy that is related to what I just mentioned is in those who are expecting help with legal issues.  This is especially the case for people who are going through custody battles.  Unfortunately, I have done a decent amount of research on the subject of custody battles and parental alienation, and this has given me a better sense of the kind of boundaries that counselors need to keep unless they have very particular training.  that is, to be able to complete parenting assessments.  Your average counselor will not be able to help you in these kinds of legal battles, and in fact may be putting themselves in considerable legal risk to do so.  An example of what I'm referring to is where someone asks their counselor to write a letter for the court stating that they think the client is fit to parent their child.  There are many factors to consider here.  First of all, if your counselor has only spoken to you alone, how are they going to comment on your parenting skills?  Second, even if you have attended counseling with your child, The counselor will have only seen a very small fragment of what your parenting looks like, and that will have been in a scenario that is unlikely to be reflective of your standard parenting environment.  Unfortunately, a general counselor would not be able to speak to much of anything at all in that case.  I hate to say all that because I know that those of you struggling with legal battles will be loath to have to spend more money for more specialized services like formal parenting assessment or any other kinds of service fit for the legal system.  But in those kinds of cases, it's really the best thing that you can do for yourself as much as it is a necessary evil in a system that doesn't have your best interests at heart.  But let's move on from such dour subjects and talk a little bit more about what therapy can do for you.  And before I get to that, this is all assuming that you can find a therapist that is ideologically aligned with you.  I've done a video on this subject a long time ago for HBR, so I won't cover it again, but I'll link it in the low bar in case you need a refresher on the best way to find a therapist.  This is going to be especially important going forward, given the new APA guidelines for men and boys.  But anyway, moving forward.  What therapy can do is to help you to organize and shift the way you're thinking about a given situation.  If you are stuck in unproductive thought patterns or cognitive distortions that are creating negative downward spirals in the way you see yourself and what is happening in your life, therapy can help to point that out and offer corrections.  Therapy can help you to reframe the way that you see things and to help you to think differently about what is going on for you so that you can help to move on with your life rather than getting stuck in a mental quagmire.  Therapy can offer a strong source of support in your life.  This is certainly the case for when you don't have access to many friends or family members, but even when you do, it's nice to have someone who will be in your corner working for you no matter what.  A colleague at my practicum site provided a humorous example.  A therapist is one of the few people who, barring obvious ethical circumstances, will provide support for you unconditionally.  Some people will challenge that by bringing up their spouse, but I challenge you to tell your spouse and your therapist that you are secretly having an affair and see which one will still be there for you in the end.  It's a unique kind of relationship where you can feel comfortable sharing your secrets and you know that therapists are bound by a strict code of ethics that, under most circumstances barring risk of physical violence, forbids them from sharing those secrets.  Therapy can help you to make sense of things that you have been struggling with.  For many of us, it is difficult, if not impossible, to look at our own situation objectively and recognize where we might be missing something or interpreting something in a more negative way than is necessary.  Getting help from friends and family can be useful in these situations, but often it's going to be difficult to get an objective opinion from them as well.  Obviously, those who care about you will want to offer you a supportive shoulder or will let you just vent uncritically, but with a therapist, it's different.  Due to their more distal proximity to your life, they will offer that objective viewpoint and can help to challenge you when you need to hear it.  They can help point out where you might be engaging in unproductive behavior and suggest changes that might be able to help you improve your situation.  Another interesting point is in the subject of advocacy.  Now, this is one that I've talked about a little bit on my own channel, because much of the education is now trying to push counselors to become social advocates.  While this can obviously be misused in many ways, There are some ways in which counselors might be able to advocate in a useful way on your behalf, such as helping you to get referrals to needed services or by speaking to people in your life, such as family members, about subjects that you may be having difficulty speaking to them yourself.  Now, I'm always of the opinion that the real power of therapy is in giving strength to the individual, not so much in advocating for larger systems.  But there are ways in which advocacy could be a thing that therapy could offer.  So these are just a few examples of things that you can expect to receive from therapy.  I think that this is an important subject to discuss because so many people have this rosy, unrealistic view of what to expect from it all.  I think that this is potentially damaging, because it can result in people going to therapy, finding that their long-term depression isn't magically gone after one or two sessions, finding that they're still feeling some immense grief over a loss in their life, or that their other persistent problems haven't gone away without any effort on their behalf.  That last point is particularly an important one because many people go to therapy thinking that it's the therapist's job to fix them and that they don't have to do any of the work for themselves.  Unfortunately, that's not the way it works.  For many people, they have become stuck in these mental ruts that it takes a lot of personal challenging to get out of.  I think, rather than assume a therapist is coming into your life as a Mr.  Fix-It with all the solutions, It's far more accurate to think of them as a coach and a guide to help you along your journey until you feel ready to go it alone.  And it's important to note, too, that not all therapists will work equally well with everyone.  You may find that one therapist has a style that doesn't work for you at all, but the next person is able to piece things together in just the right way to make things click.  I urge you to give it a shot a few times.  Of course, there are always other options worth considering as well.  Far be it from me to be the gatekeeper of mental health.  I may be a budding therapist, but I would never try to claim that counseling is the only way of developing a healthy mind.  There are all kinds of alternate activities, workshops, support groups, all sorts of things that might suit you better.  And hey, a therapist might be able to point you in some of those directions if you're finding that therapy isn't working for you.  It may be daunting that there are so many options to choose from, but I prefer to look at it in an optimistic light.  If one thing doesn't work for you, something else might.  Your mental health is worth the effort to try.  Now that we've discussed all of that, it's time for a call-in show.  Let's see how we can help you on today's episode of Men's Mental Health. ",
