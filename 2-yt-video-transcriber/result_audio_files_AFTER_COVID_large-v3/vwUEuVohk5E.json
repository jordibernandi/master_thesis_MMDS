            "text": "Okay, well, great questions.  Very, very difficult to answer, but I shall do my best.  Number one, why do I not debate people who actually have a clue?  Well, the simple answer to that is anybody who actually has a clue isn't a flat earther, and therefore, I don't debate them.  Number two, how do I fit a really long bridge onto one photograph?  Stand really far back.  That's a useful tip.  You can keep that one for free.  Number three, why does the horizon rise to eye level?  It doesn't.  But we both know you'll never, ever, ever go and get a theodolite and find that out for yourself.  Of course, I did ask Will to come onto the Agreed to Disagree Debates channel and debate me on these points, but he must have missed my reply.  Right, our next caller is another flat earther and friend of the channel, Fred.  My name is Dredd.  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway, let's see what he's got to say. ",

Yes, this flat-earther and friend of the channel, albeit not this channel, I'm sure he's a friend of some channel somewhere, has been making a whole lot of globe-destroying videos lately, and they're all to do with how the sun sets.  Now, I do hope that when we watch one of these videos, it doesn't turn out to be actual proof of the globe, because if it does, well, that's going to be a bit embarrassing.  Ah yes, filming the sun setting behind the horizon using a drone.  Very, very strong proof of the globe.  And there's probably only one thing he could have done here to make this worse for himself.  And that would have been, perhaps, if he'd have taken the drone and increased its altitude after the sun had set to show that we can then see the sun again over the curvature of the Earth and watch it set a second time.  But he wouldn't have done that.  What?  Okay, well that happened.  Thank you very much.  Our next caller has apparently a couple of questions to ask, but I've got a feeling he's asked these before.

And secondly, she's going to show us that she's got a microphone that is made out of a potato.  And I don't know which is more impressive.  Off we go.  Let me take something like my baton.  and uh create a little fulcrum for it.  and uh this is if i put it dead center or somewhere where the weight is distributed evenly.  it will it will it will okay.  so i mean the suspense is killing me.  you're going to take something and you're going to balance it on your finger like that.  and then what?  that's what happened?  no it isn't.  look anyway what is it you're supposed to be proving?  so?

            "text": "No, not okay.  Not okay at all.  Imbalance doesn't in any way, shape or form suggest that we can just throw away gravity and replace it with density and buoyancy.  And also this is kind of making me think you don't really know what buoyancy is, but one point at a time.  Let's start here.  Okay, here's a little thought experiment for you, and what I don't mean by that is that the experiment is actually trying to think, okay?  Imagine you have a massive pair of balanced scales, just like this one, and on one side you place a very, very large and heavy aircraft carrier, an aircraft carrier which floats on water because it's less dense than the water.  Now, on the other side, you place a bowling ball, which is much, much smaller, but it will sink in water because it is more dense than water.  Now I want you to ask yourself which side will the scales tip to?  Will they tip to the side where we have the much smaller yet more dense bowling ball?  Or will they tip to the side where we have the bigger, heavier yet much less dense aircraft carrier?  Now when you've figured that out you realise that your claim that gravity isn't needed and all that we need is density and buoyancy is wrong.  And then you'll realise that listening to flat earthers on YouTube that tell you stupid things like gravity doesn't exist is probably not the best idea.  Good luck.  Right, now we're fast coming to the end of the show.  I know we haven't seen any flat-earth proofs, and I'm sure we're all completely stunned and surprised by that, but we do have a couple of callers who are still, yeah, still on the line.  Now, we don't have a lot of time.  Let's just see what their main points are.  The first caller is Dr.  Andrew Kaufman.  His qualification is being one of the biggest spreaders of misinformation about viruses and diseases on the internet.  What have you got to say, pal? ",
