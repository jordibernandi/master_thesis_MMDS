And there's something deeply wrong when working class Americans have that response to a major party that theoretically is supposed to be fighting for them.  So you have to ask yourself, what has the Democratic Party been standing for in their minds?  And in their minds, the Democratic Party, unfortunately, has taken on this role of the coastal urban elites who are more concerned about policing various cultural issues than improving their way of life.  That has been declining for years.  And so if you're in that situation, This to me is a fundamental problem for the Democratic Party because if they don't figure this out, then this polarization and division will get worse, not better.

He's a naturally very unifying figure.  But then there's the reality on the ground where their way of life has been disintegrating for years.
