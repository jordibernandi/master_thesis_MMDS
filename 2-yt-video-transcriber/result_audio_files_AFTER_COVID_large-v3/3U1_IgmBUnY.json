Call it some sort of daddy issue.  Bill Gates Sr.  served on the board of Planned Parenthood during the group's infancy, a rebranded organisation birthed out of the American Eugenics Society.  Sr.  would continue his eugenicist efforts by becoming instrumental in the formation of a new philanthropic brainchild called the William H. Gates Foundation in 1994.  The company merged with the New Gates Learning Foundation to create the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000.  Today, it's the largest private foundation in the world, with over 46 billion dollars in assets.  The group is focused on many areas that drive continued work across the world.  These activities have given birth to new forms of technological, eugenic endeavours.  The organization is simply continuing the Gates family legacy of trying to control the world's systems, including the areas of technology, medicine, and now agriculture.  All you have to do is to look at what areas the Gates Foundation gives money to.  A quick search and you will find it in three key areas.  Education in the US, global health, and agriculture.  Agriculture is what made the inspired bill in 2010 to purchase 500,000 shares in Monsanto valued at more than 23 million dollars.  Monsanto has a bad reputation when it comes to health, evidence that GMOs cause disease has been piling up for decades as the list of countries banning their imports and cultivation grows. ",

These were contributions made by member states and that were given to a pooled fund that the World Health Organization had jurisdiction over dispersing.  In the past 30 years, we've seen a significant shift in that.  now 70% of the World Health Organization's budget comes from what are called voluntary contributions from bodies like the Gates Foundation.  those voluntary contributions can be stipulated for specific causes and programs that are indicated and directed by the donors themselves.  So we've seen a problem that the World Health Organization's priority setting has been in many ways distorted and in some ways perverted by the rise of voluntary contributions, which at face value seem irreproachable, because how can we argue against giving money to something as important as global health?  But at the same time, the way it's been donated has been done in a way that might be causing more disruption, more unhelpful disruption at the World Health Organization than is useful.  In a way... Mr.  Gates, he's become in a way a sort of unofficial global health czar.  He in some ways does act as a sort of honorific diplomatic envoy on behalf of corporations like Coca-Cola and to some extent Monsanto in sub-Saharan Africa.  And he was never elected or appointed to do so.  So it does raise some serious questions surrounding accountability. ",

And since everybody is giving Bill such a hard time, I implore you, dear listener, to consider everything I mention to be nothing but a series of coincidences.  I don't want to enter debates about Bill's intentions regarding vaccines, microchipping, tracing, ID2020, Monsanto, his relationship to Epstein, Covid, or any of the few controversies surrounding this man.  I'm just going to look into where his funding is going and maybe this will put things into perspective.  Through an investigation of more than 19,000 charitable grants the Gates Foundation has made over the last two decades, according to The Nation magazine, it has uncovered close to 2 billion in tax-deductible charitable donations to private companies.  including some of the largest businesses in the world, such as Glasgow, SmithKline, Unilever, and IBM.  They always say, follow the money.  Obviously, the Gates Foundation gives away billions of dollars to many public and private organisations, and I am positive, some do some good in the world.  However, when I look at the number of these organisations, a lot of them seem very familiar.  mainly because they are all involved in one way or another.  with the current situation that we are all in now and we've seen these faces and logos all around the news for the last three months the world health organization received 4.6 billion dollars in donations.  three billion to gavi the vaccination alliance with the goal of increasing immunizations in poor countries.  eight hundred and seventy million to john hopkins university which provides data statistics maps and covid resources.  two hundred and eighty million to imperial college london which created the wonderful computer models that predicted and miscalculated the spread impact and death rates of this pandemic.  so based on these models we decided to lock down 243 million to Oxford University for vaccine research and development.  40 million to the London School of Hygiene, led by Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer.  And the list goes on.  Some of you are wondering why there are so many TV broadcasters on the list of private companies receiving donations.  Just you think about it.  Bill needs someone to spread the good news about all this work, so the Gates Foundation adds the media to their list of charity.  You would think the funding support will go to broadcasters in poor countries to educate and promote health.  However, if you do a small search, you will see the donations went to major broadcasters.  The Foundation has given over $250 million to media companies and other groups to influence the news.  Some of the recipients are broadcasters such as NBC, ABC, MSNBC, The Guardian, and let's not forget the $53 million given to the BBC. ",
