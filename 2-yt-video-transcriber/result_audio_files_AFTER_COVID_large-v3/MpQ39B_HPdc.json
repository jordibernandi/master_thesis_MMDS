Schools should have stayed open like they did in Sweden.  Then you'd have this vast number of young people developing immunity and you get what you call herd immunity.  The stupidest ideas to send kids home.  But of course it came from Harvard because they're stupid at Harvard.  Do you understand that now?  My whole life I've known this since I was at Columbia.  Experts are stupid because they think knowledge gives them wisdom.  It gives them nothing but knowledge.  But I can get that knowledge from the Internet.  But the Internet doesn't make policy.  And all of my anger is on your behalf.  I am doing fine.  I have my job, I have my income, I have my family, I have my health, I have my home.  A vast number, hundreds of millions of human beings will not have food, will not have homes, will break up, will commit suicide because the experts scared you and you got spooked because you watched CNN all day.  That's an asshole.  CNN is an asshole.  God almighty.  Yeah, mayor of Vegas.  Yeah, let's hear another heroine.  Go ahead.  With Anderson Cooper on the network of fools. ",

Because in America, as opposed to the CNN socialist Soviet Republic, we believe that the individual makes those answers.  And you and the government do not tell me how to live my life.  That's the reason.  But this is so foreign to Anderson Cooper and every single person at CNN that the government would not tell you how to live your life that it sounds awful to him.  I see.  That's what they said.  The mayor of Vegas wants her people to be guinea pigs.  The mayor of Vegas believes that individuals should make their own response.  You see, she doesn't know.  It's too bad.  And if I could speak to Anderson Cooper, I would ask him a question.  I would not answer anything he wanted to ask me, but I would say, Anderson, in 1957, which has never been reported on CNN to the best of my knowledge, in 1957, 116,000 Americans, equivalent to about 180,000 Americans today, died of the flu.  Nothing was shut down.  What is the difference between America today, other than CNN being a scare-mongering, fear-inducing, irresponsible, demagogic place?  What is the difference between America in 1957 and America today?  And you could drop the part on my attack on CNN.  Just what is the difference, Anderson?  Why didn't they ruin everybody's life in 1957 with far more death?  Because it was a better country, Anderson.  Americans were not afraid.  You are.  Everyone on the left is afraid.  They're afraid of death and they're afraid of life.  That's why there are safe spaces at universities, because the left is scared.  When the scared run things, your society is over.  That is the end of society when the afraid run it.  You think he'll invite me on?  He should, right?  I have a large audience, billion views a year at PragerU, vast radio audience, big readership.  Do they have any dissenting voices on CNN?  This is an open question.  I thought dissent is patriotic.  That was the left's view.  Remember the bumper stickers when George W. Bush was president?  Dissent is patriotic.  Dissent is only patriotic when there's a Democrat in office.  I really am angry, I gotta say.  Not like me.  I'm angry on the world's behalf.  You've been screwed. ",
