            "text": "All right, guys.  Got a bunch of Macy PD down here.  There's nothing going on down here.  We met 1022 1837.  We got 1209, 5254, 1230, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.  Mesa PD top scores down here.  Probably a 420.  Yet another lady filming the police.  That's good.  He doesn't have a mask on and it's ordered that you're.  if you're in public you have to wear a mask.  I'll talk to him.  You can start.  I'll talk to him.  You can start.  Do that.  You can start.

And he's a training officer, I believe.  Hold out.  I'm telling you.  I'll sit right here.  Hold out.  I'm telling you.  They're trying to get their side out for you, okay?  You good there?  You can do that?  Got your commitment?  All right.  Cool.  All right.  So, one day in July, the same was made.  They called the phone a total of three times.  The first time, a male answered saying that they looked at the phone and they started cussing and swearing at the lady.  And the third time... There's nothing against the law with cussing and swearing.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five officers here.  Call the number.  Call the number.  We got five officers here.  I got my mask on.  It's the order that we wear it in public.  Hey!  Get your goddamn mask on!  It's the law.  I'm going to put a complaint in.  I guess there was some kind of confrontation with somebody over a phone.  Can you walk on it?  I want to go.  I have the right to go.  Now they're going over there having a powwow.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What's up?  He's saying you can go and he says, no, you can't.  You're detained.  Assault.  Assault.  Nothing's going to happen.  He's going to get away with this.  He's going to get away with this.  I have the right to go and leave.  Yeah.  I have the right to leave.  He's detaining me for no reason.  He's detaining me for no reason.  I want him arrested too.  Yeah, he wants me arrested.  He wants to detain me for no reason.  He's detaining me.  He's detaining me for no reason.  He says he's being detained for no reason, guys.  We'll find out.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Your name is?  Nevin.  B. Nevin.  Yes, sir.  You're getting a complaint for not wearing your mask.  Oh, it broke, actually.  There's no excuse.  He says it broke.  Be Nevin.  Be Nevin, Betsy.  Be Nevin.  He says, oh, it broke.  He says he's being detained for no reason.  I don't know why he's being detained.  I never get this guy's name.  And that's number B-neven.  What did I do?  What did I do?  that I'm being... What did I... Hey, man, what did I do?  that I'm being... Well, again, I'm not a news officer.  I know my friends do well, but they're... Because in their mind and in their want, they would like to search the person... Get that mask on.  Your mask isn't broke.  That's my understanding of what's going on.  He's in car 1230. ",
