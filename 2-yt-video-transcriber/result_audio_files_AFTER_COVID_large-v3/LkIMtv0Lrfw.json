And then you guys, maybe I thought you guys could ask me to say let's start the show.  So you guys say, hey, can you say let's start the show, and then I'll say it like a reversal.  Well, here's what's interesting.  I think our caller may have one of our sister stations in mind.  Oh.  Hello?  Sorry, can you just say to me, hey, can you say let's start the show?  Just ask me to say let's start the show.  Well, we'll go ahead and fade away from that call.  I think he wants our sister station, one of our sister stations.  Because that program's not on this station.  I'm not familiar with the show.  Yeah, I'm not either.  That's an interesting call.  So we've got his number.

Main Mustache Chris, a.k.a.  Mustache Man Chris.  And I'm here for another fantastic edition of the Not Even a Show.  And I will be taking a week off next week as the host because I lost a court case to Colonel Dufresne and him and Stoop will be taking over for one week.  I insisted on using the lawyer Matlock for my case.  Turns out he's a fake lawyer from the television and the guy who played him is dead.  But I dug his bones up anyways and brought him into the court and I was in trouble for that also and I lost because he was not a lawyer, he was a dead bag of bones.  Anyways, I'm here, though, for this week, and we have a wonderful episode for you, as we've got calls from the tailgater and tech head Terry.  Plus, we look in as a flat earther calls Goodyear stores to complain.  First, though, Rudy Giuliani is the former mayor of New York City and current senile old man, and he has a call-in radio show now, and it got absolutely bombarded by us this week.  Check it out.
