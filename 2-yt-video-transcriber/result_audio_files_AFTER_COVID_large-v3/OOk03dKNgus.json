            "text": "Hello and welcome back to the channel.  I'm going to be sharing a video with you that is very interesting indeed.  It's a video where a European is basically just spitting out a whole bunch of truth.  and even his shirt even what he has written on his t-shirt is very surprising to me because he's wearing it out in public but somehow he came across a black guy with a camera who kind of like gave him a little air time and so he's sharing his feelings about everything concerning black people and white people and what has been done in the past and the present, right?  And so I want to share this video with you and I want you to leave your thoughts and comments in the comment section.  What do you make of this Euro awakening.  And I don't want to just call it a Euro awakening because we see people of other cultures as well who are starting to speak up and speak out on behalf of not just black people, but other races of people too who have been marginalized.  or who have been discriminated against.  But anyway, it's a very interesting video.  Some of his language is sharp, so for those of you who have sensitive ears, I thought I'd let you know that part up front.  I may try to bleep some of it out, but if I don't, just know that it's there.  But anyway, here is the video. ",

And I will tell you that if my brother had been killed like that, I would do whatever that person did in China to create a pandemic.  Because as far as I'm concerned, if I had two buttons, one button, this will never happen to another Mr.  Floyd, or the other button, you, Nelson, can stop the pandemic forever.  or the world will end.  I would rather end this world and have us all die and have one more incident like that.  And I am so happy that finally, finally, after this was normalized for years, that this is the one that made the change.  And I figured that it would, because white people If you look funny at a guy in a high school, he brings back a gun and kills a whole bunch of people.  But black people have been putting up with shit.  And it's about time.  I would love to have black police officers do to Mel Gibson and all these rich white people in Malibu what white cops have done to black people.  So if this doesn't stop, I would love black cops to start doing the same thing to white people.  I respect that.  And I was born white, but the white race is sick because the reason that I'm here is because white people stole this continent from the Indians and enslaved people from Africa.  The reason a black person is here is not because they stole the land.  They were brought here against their will.  So if I'm black... I tell people, I'm legal.  White boy, you are illegal.  Don't you dare tell a Mexican that they're illegal, because I got more Indian blood than you do.  So go back to Scotland, Trump, you son of a bitch.  So that's how I feel.  I respect it, and I love it.  And I can't say how I really feel, because I do not want the FBI to take me to prison.  I hear you.  Well, I stand with you.  I know what should be done to Donald Trump, and it's not lock him up.  It's a lot worse.  I'm right there.  I stand with you, my man.  Good.  Appreciate it.  Have a good rest of the day.  I'll tell you something. ",
