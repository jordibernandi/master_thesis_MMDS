            "text": "Six hundred dollars!  I be she, I be she, I be she.  That's all, folks.  Six hundred is the best we can do.  The best we can do.  I mean, we gotta make a profit here, too.  You think we got into politics to be poor like you peasants?  House Trigger, people are starving and homeless.  Oh, you know, you don't represent these people.  I do, okay?  But they're hungry.  Maybe they want to be hungry.  You ever thought about that?  You're saying these people want to be hungry?  I know these people, and I know they don't need money.  What?  They don't need money?  Can I shut her?  All right, guys, we need a stimulus package.  Where's the money gonna go?  Well, we need $10 million for gender programs.  And $10 million needs to go to the big guy.  $400 million for hot dogs and pasta-eating contests.  We need to have, like, $10 gajillion for, like, the study of garbage disposals.  And $40 million to count lint.  We also need at least 500 million to study the effects of Captain Crunch and why it cuts the roof of your mouth.  And two bazillion gazillion to study the effects of motorcycle seat belts.  Keep the change, you filthy animal.  I gave Santa Claus a vaccine.  His life is more important than your grandparents'.  $600 is plenty of money.  Plenty of money?  Yes, plenty of money.  These peasants don't even know what it's like to be rich, okay?  But they're hungry.  Listen, I know what it's like to be rich, and I'm telling you this right now.  I'm not going to not be rich.  If you want my opinion, Americans only deserve 60 bucks.  They don't even do anything.  They don't even have jobs.  Why do they need money?  Right?  Assistant everyone, all the foreign sex needs to go out first, and then all you peasants can have whatever's left.  I'm rich.  You're poor.  The end.  Hashtag porkulous.  The porkulous package, while worthless and imperfect, still serves a purpose.  Jeez, this stimulus package is pretty porky.  Sorry about your luck, America, but here's $600.  This stimulus package sucks.  I mean, I can't even make a perfect phone call to the Ukraine without getting impeached!  And now these do-nothing Democrats want to give them $450 million!  Let's do it!  A donation of $700 million has been made to Sudan in your name!  Ha ha ha!  Okay.  These are my constituents.  I know what they want.  They want help.  Silence.  They want what I say they want.  And they won't get anything until I get what I want.  But they're hungry.  They're cold.  They're hungry.  They're cold.  How do you know these people don't want to be hungry and cold?  No one wants to be hungry and cold.  Yes, they do.  Who says?  I say.  That's true.  Look everyone.  I got my flu shot.  Oh Joe.  You're such a big boy.  What kind of pudding do you want?  I want a strawberry pudding with chocolate jello.  Step right up America.  Step right up and pick your prize.  You can get a lot of tickets with $600.  And Christmas is canceled!  You know, we should give all you illegal immigrants all the money, you know?  She's right.  These are real Americans.  Oh, I totally agree.  Illegal immigrants are Americans.  Illegal immigrants deserve the money more than anyone.  And we can, like, totally give, like, all the legal privileged citizens a $20 Amazon gift card or, like, whatever.  Or we could give them a $5 lottery.  That's a great idea, Adam!  $5 lottery tickets for all Americans!  All right!  $2,000 apiece, or I say veto!  $600 for all, and to all a good night.  Christmas is canceled! ",
