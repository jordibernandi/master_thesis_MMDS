            "text": "hey welcome back everybody.  my special guest is back.  hashtag aoc.  hi everybody.  now everybody knows you're a huge supporter of bernie sanders.  oh my gosh i love bernie.  we know i know right i know right.  so bernie sanders said last night at his debate that he wants minimum wage to be 15 per hour.  you Yes, it is a human right to make $15 an hour.  Yes, it's a human right.  Right?  Alexandria, being that you're a bartender slash waitress slash economics major slash congresswoman, maybe you can explain how the $15 minimum wage is going to work.  Oh my gosh, thank you so much for acknowledging my smartness.  You're welcome.  Okay, so like the way the $15 an hour thingy works is 15 times 40 equals $600, okay?  And that's like per week or so.  And like $600 times 52 weeks is like $31,200.  Wow.  $31,200.  That's a lot of money.  I know, right?  It's like a million dollars almost.  And you also said that you and Bernie want free health care for everyone.  Is that right?  Yes.  Health care is a human right.  I agree.  Nobody should pay for health care.  I know, right?  Nobody should pay for health care ever.  But people that don't really understand things are asking how Bernie's going to pay for all this.  That's a great question.  And what me and Bernie came up with with my expertise economics waitress bartender congresswoman degree, we're going to raise the taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 a year.  Wow.  29K.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah, it's almost like a trillion dollars.  I gotta be honest with you.  You and Bernie putting your heads together is the best thing that America could ever ask for.  I know, right?  I know, right?  So for us dummies out here, can you explain to all of us with your expertise how all of this is gonna work?  Yeah, sorry you guys are stupid and not smart like me.  I wish I was smart.  It's not easy being this smart, okay?  All right, well, I'll try to understand what you're about to say.  Okay, so this is gonna be like super easy for people who are smart like me to understand.  Okay, everybody, so try and keep up, okay?  52% of $31,200 equals $16,224 in taxes, okay?  Now, okay, so $31,200 subtracted by that tax of $16,224 equals $14,976 that you'll get paid.  Now that's huge.  Now you take that $14,976 and divide it by 52 weeks and that equals $288 per week.  Now that's awesome.  Now you take that $288 per week, okay?  And you divide it by 40 hours a week, okay?  And that equals, okay, are you ready for this, guys?  This is huge, $7.20 per hour, okay?  So, in reality, you're gonna be making $15 an hour, but in reality, you're gonna be making $7.20 per hour, plus you're gonna be getting free healthcare, okay?  I don't know about you, but I am super duper excited about this.  We literally helped everybody out.  You're welcome. ",
