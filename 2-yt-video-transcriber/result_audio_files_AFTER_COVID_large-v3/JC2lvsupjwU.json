It only implies that the interests of humanity and the interests of these corporations are to at least some degree distinct.  They don't perfectly overlap.  It doesn't imply that they are diametrically opposed.  Also, while by some measures the most extreme poverty, usually defined as people living on less than $1.90 a day, has declined, when you define poverty more broadly, the picture isn't as clear.  Here's a chart of income quintiles in the U.S.  from 1999 to 2018.  For all but the bottom 20% of incomes, the peak income was 2017 or 2018.  But for those in the bottom 20%, incomes were lower than they were in the previous 19 years.  Over that period, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.  Now, perhaps the economies worldwide are not as brutal as the American economy, so perhaps the bottom quintile worldwide isn't doing as badly, but this nonetheless illustrates that transnational corporations are not responsible for the decrease in poverty throughout humanity, because poverty hasn't decreased throughout humanity.  For the bottom 20% of incomes in the US over the last couple of decades, it's increased. ",
