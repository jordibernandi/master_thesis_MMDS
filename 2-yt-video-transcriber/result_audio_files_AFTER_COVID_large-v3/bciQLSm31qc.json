They pulled out their guns and said, give me your money, son.  I said, oh boy, you don't know what I am.  I'm a gun freak.  Gun freak.  I'm a gun freak.  Jumped you up, you up, you up, gun freak.  I'm a gun freak.  Later on that night, we were heading on home.  We found a peaceful protest in my living room.  They had black market guns and a criminal passport.  I said, give me your jewelry and make it fast.  Well, it said they were law-abiding criminals, and I got confused.  So I tried to call the police, but hell, they'd been defunded.  So I did the only logical thing I knew to do and reached into my big old T-shirt drawer and pulled out my damn .50 cap.  Now get on now, boy, Texas, America, America, Texas. ",
