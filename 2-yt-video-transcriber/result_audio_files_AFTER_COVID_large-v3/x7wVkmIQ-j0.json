            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session this time for real peel dose.  short videos.  right to the point today's topic is the one question that no simp can answer.  now before i get into that question that the simp can't answer let me set the scene like this guy meets girl gets the number takes her on a date spends money on a date take her back to her home and you may do this two or three times before you actually smash and sometimes several times lasting from weeks to months In some cases, when you do smash, you've already spent between 500 and $1,500 in some cases, right?  Let's not say that you spent that much, hypothetically.  Let's say it's just $300 for four dates, which is somewhat unrealistic, but let's go with that low number for the sake of argument, right?  That is still a lot of money, right?  But this is the expectation not only from her but society at large and especially the expectation of the SIMP because he believes that he must pay because he believes that her value is much higher.  Now, I haven't gotten to the question yet.  Listen to this clip. ",

            "text": "that's from tk kirkland from a video from vlog tv titled if you're a real man a fee fail is a bill.  well of course i am not this real man according to tk kirkland and according to society at large and that's fine Because I don't date, I recreate, I keep it casual and occasional and I pump and let her dump.  So I'm not taking her out to eat and I'm not taking her shopping.  I'm not paying her bills.  I'm not doing none of that.  And if I do decide to take her out to eat, if I do decide to buy a gift, you best believe she's doing the same thing for me.  But he said that she is a bill.  And that's a way of thinking about.  She's a bill yet.  She has a high body count.  She's a bill yet.  She has a bad attitude.  She's a bill yet.  She's the same as a professional.  The same fee fail that you took out to eat and bought us and took us shopping has a body count between 30 and 60 or higher because she's probably over age 30.  Super high body count.  Meanwhile, there's a streetwalker available for less and it's guaranteed.  I say again, the average fee fail has a body count of above 30, but she wants to be taken out to.  dinner and all of these other things.  so the question is the question that no simp can answer.  the question that some of your favorite dating coaches and youtubers cannot answer is how in the world is the average fee fail any different from the streetwalker when both expect to be paid in some way and both have a high body count?  riddle me that batman.  Explain that to me, bubba.  What is the difference?  Can you answer that?  How is there any difference between the two?  And the only difference that I can think of.  is that you pay more for one than the other.  The street walker is far cheaper.  Now I am not saying go get the street walker.  I am not promoting that here.  But my point with the analogy is that when you take an objective look at both of them, take your ego out, I know you think you full of game and I know you think you all this and you all that, But when you take your ego out and you look at the facts, how is your girl any different than the streetwalker?  You took your girl out several times and paid and you spent time with her and you lost whether you smashed or not.  The streetwalker can't pair bond just like your girl can't pair bond.  The streetwalker is doing it for the money And your girl is doing it for the money that she thinks she can get.  The streetwalker can't love you.  Neither does your girl.  The streetwalker ain't emotionally attached to you.  Neither is your girl because both have a high body count.  that prevents such.  So if there is essentially no difference between your girl and a streetwalker, then guess what that means?  The real trick is not the guy necessarily who hands her a few dollars, speaking of the streetwalker, handing her a few dollars to monkey dance with him.  At least the guy handing the streetwalker a few dollars knows what the subject is worth, which is only a few dollars.  He gets the service and he quickly leaves.  Now, you may say that's a trick and I wouldn't disagree with you.  But guess what?  The bigger trick, the real trick is not the one who pays, but the one who stays.  Think about it.  Now, that's my line.  You heard it here first.  I need to trademark that one.  But anyway, the real trick by definition is.  is the one sitting across the dinner table from her pretending or either not realizing that she who sits in front of him is absolutely no different than the professional streetwalker.  Tell me I'm lying.  Debate me on it if you disagree.  The guy sitting across the dinner table is tricking himself or being tricked into thinking that he has something of value sitting across from him as he pays for the dinner date.  As he spends time and money on her, he's tricking himself into believing that she's wifey material with the body count of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 plus high body count.  She wants to be protected and provided for.  She wants the bag just like the street walker.  They're both money hungry carousel writers.  Both do one nighters.  Both have high body counts.  Both are heavily damaged psychologically.  Both have a dumpster of a badge.  There is really no difference between the two, but the SIMP believes that this is untrue.  The succubus in many dating coaches.  They want you to believe that there is a difference between the two.  But those who can see know that there is obviously no difference.  The difference is that you've been brainwashed and programmed to think that since she's not walking down the street with a short dress.  Calling for it from the passersby.  You've been programmed to think that she is different from your girl who does the same thing.  Your girl who's on the dating sites.  Your girl who's had the one nighters.  Your girl who's gone from D to D to D, dating three, four, five, six guys in one year, sometimes 10, 15, 20.  You really think that there is a difference between the two, but there isn't.  So for the SIMP, the question that you cannot answer, is tell me, Mr.  Simpson, where is the difference between the professional streetwalker and your girl?  Answer that.  Black Ram, I'm out. ",
