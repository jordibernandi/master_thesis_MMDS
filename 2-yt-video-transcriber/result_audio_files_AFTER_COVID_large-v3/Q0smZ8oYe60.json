            "text": "Welcome to the Corporate Owned News Network's Town Hall on Police Brutality.  Tonight's topic, should the police be defunded?  Let's meet our esteemed debaters.  On the negative, he puts the thin and thin blue line, the mac daddy of law and order, it's Charles.  Thank you, thank you.  Happy to be here.  I never say no to a good debate.  Literally never.  And on the affirmative, he's trying to yank the Overton window with two lip wrists, it's Carl.  Nice zit.  You make me sick.  The rules are simple.  Three rounds of debate.  Each side will get 15 seconds to make their case, followed by a few agonizing seconds of incomprehensible crosstalk.  15 seconds?  At the end of the debate, the audience will decide who wins.  So make sure you pay close attention.  Now, are you ready to rumble?  Good.  But first, a quick look at what's coming up after the debate.  After the debate.  At eight, it's Law and Order Ball Busters.  A show where the police are always good, the violence is always justified, and due process is always getting in the way.  Did we mention the cops are hot?  At nine, it's Bad Boys.  The show that takes you into the high-stakes world of hunting humans for sport.  No need to empathize with these lowlives.  All you need to know is that they're bad.  And now, thanks to the cops, they're gone for good.  But first, it's your favorite nightly news team, ready to bombard you with the most horrific crime stories you've ever heard, straight from the mouth of your local police department.  Could you be in danger?  Only one way to find out, on CON.  If you can't sleep, you'll never stop watching.  Debaters, ready?  Hell yeah.  Oh fuuuck.  Oh, my sweet summer child.  First, the good news.  Crime rates are at historic lows.  Across the country, the rate of both violent crime and property crime has been steadily declining for the past few decades, which means Americans are safer now than we've been in a really long time.  Now, the bad news.  We're fucking terrified!  Most Americans are convinced that crime is getting worse, and they've believed that for years and years and years.  This disconnect between fear and reality is a product of what media theorist George Gerbner calls Mean World Syndrome, a bias in which people who watch a lot of crime TV overestimate how dangerous the world actually is.  Few topics are more ubiquitous in American media than crime.  I mean, just off the top of my head, we have NCIS, True Detective, CSI, NYPD.  We have so many true crime shows here, we now have a whole channel dedicated to them.  And that's not including unscripted shows like Cops and Live PD which... We'll get to.  Crime shows are popular for the same reason that horror movies and roller coasters are popular, because people are drawn to things that trigger their fear and anxiety.  Once you see an image of a grisly murder, intense police chase, or Chris Meloni doing basically anything, it's hard to look away.  Your brain wants to resolve the tension that images of violent crime create, which makes it really good TV, right?  As long as you introduce something stressful in the first act, audiences will typically sit through ads and bad writing to see what happens.  Wait a second.  Is that what I do in my show?  No.  I'm one of the good boys.  That fear equals attention.  formula isn't just true for crime shows, though.  It's also true for every single news program.  If it bleeds, it leads is a phrase that describes how news networks specifically seek out stories of extreme and violent crime to keep people watching.  Which is why, despite falling crime rates, Crime is often the dominant topic in all types of news coverage and why the more unusual the crime or violence, the more likely it is to be covered.  As Marty Haig once said, covering crime is the easiest, fastest, cheapest, most efficient kind of news coverage.  News directors love crime because it has a one-to-one ratio between making the assignment and getting a story on air.  But even then, not all crime stories are over-reported equally.  Studies show that crimes committed by black and Latino men tend to get more media coverage.  And those men are often depicted in a more threatening way, nameless and in police custody.  News outlets also pay special attention to crimes that have white victims but non-white perpetrators.  And if you think of the fear equals attention formula, it kind of makes sense.  If your goal is to scare your audience and your audience is predominantly white, you don't want to show them white criminals.  That might make viewers curious.  Or worse, empathetic.  But show them a black or brown face.  A face that triggers decades of stereotypes about minority crime.  And now you've got something to stay tuned for.  Now you've got some real... Tension.  Debaters, ready?  Hell yeah.  I mean, I guess.  Let's get it on.  Thanks, Neutral Moderator.  Look, I'll be the first to admit, the police need to be reformed.  In fact, I have a 45-point reform plan.  I would love to spend the rest of the night talking about, if you're interested.  But the fact remains, we need cops.  It is a mean world out there, and that thin blue line is the only thing standing between us, and anarchy.  Most of the reforms he's proposing have already been adopted in places where cops continue to kill people.  The problem isn't a few bad apples, it's that policing in general is kind of a shitty way to deal with crime.  We should be investing that money in social workers and mental health professionals who are actually trained.  Social workers?  This is the left's answer to everything.  A few therapists to ask why the bad guy did a boo-boo.  I hate to break it to you, Dr.  Feelgood, but a social worker isn't going to protect you the next time a lunatic decides to make you their next target.  Oh, and a cop is?  When was the last time you actually saw a cop stop a violent crime?  Most of what they do is stand around and harass people for petty bullshit.  You are defaming our boys in blue.  Police officers put their lives on the line to protect us.  Do they?  Crime has been going down for decades, and yet the number of people murdered by cops every year keeps going up.  Maybe sending armed goons to deal with every altercation is a bad way to keep the peace.  We have to die to keep us safe, Jesus.  This is exactly what criminals want you to think.  Things are better now, we can relax, and then the second we let our guards down, the second we start to doubt ourselves, they'll shrink.  Not now, Grandpa.  One side effect of Mean World Syndrome is that we end up overestimating the usefulness of police.  Studies have found that people who watch a lot of crime TV are more likely to support increased funding for police departments.  And it's not hard to imagine why.  On shows like CSI and Law and Order, cops are depicted as highly competent and virtuous do-gooders.  They are relentless in their hunt, working tirelessly to bring evildoers to justice.  Shows like Cops and Like PD only exist because police departments agree to them, which means you'll never see cops engage in excessive force, or plant evidence, or arrest the wrong person.  It's just crime, arrest.  Bad guy, good guy.  Tension, resolution.  But in reality, cops are kind of bad at their jobs.  At least when it comes to the kind of crimes we worry about.  A recent study found that only about 5% of all arrests cops make have to do with serious violent crime.  The vast majority are for low level offenses like drug violations and disorderly conduct.  That same study found that only about 25% of reported crimes are even closed by arrest.  And that's assuming they got the right person.  For property crimes, it's even worse.  Only 18% of property crimes are cleared with an arrest.  As criminologist Alex Vitale explained, we've all grown up on television shows in which the police are superheroes, but this is all a big myth.  The vast majority of police officers make one felony arrest a year, yet they make two their cop of the month.  If you're worried about a world where the cops aren't constantly hunting down bad guys, You're already living in it.  In cities across America, studies have shown that increasing or decreasing the amount of cops doesn't have a clear effect on the amount of crime that gets committed, even though that's literally their only job.  As police scholar David Bailey argues, the police do not prevent crime.  This is one of the best kept secrets of modern life.  Experts know it, the police know it, but the public does not know it.  And my favorite example of this is from right here in New York.  In 2014, the NYPD launched a work slowdown in order to protest a hostile anti-police environment in the city.  The cops said they would only perform their most essential duties, refusing to give out summonses and slowing down the response times.  Now you would expect that work stoppage to result in an increase in crime, kind of like The Purge.  But, um, the opposite happened?  Arrests dropped by 66%, but so did reports of major crimes, which fell by around 6% during the slowdown.  None of this is to say that cops do nothing to reduce crime.  Throwing lots of people in jail will stop a few of them from breaking the law.  The point is that policing is often the least efficient way of going about it.  Again and again, police have used extreme violence against children, the elderly, and people grappling with health crises during incidents that could have been deescalated through social workers or mental health professionals.  This isn't really a bad apple problem.  police are trained to use force to resolve conflict.  But most of the situations they respond to don't require force.  And while you might expect crime reporters to point out this escalation problem, local crime stories are usually based entirely on police department statements, which give news networks a quick and easy way to fill airtime.  As Teddy Guest, president of Criminal Justice Journalist admitted, a large percent of the stories you see are told totally 100% from the police viewpoint.  Which means if you're hearing a story about an arrest, it's usually because the cops want you to hear it.  Using force was always necessary.  Police say the suspect was pacing, acting very agitated and refusing to cooperate.  The suspect was always resisting arrest.  City police saying they had no choice but to shoot a man.  Forced to fire at a 71 year old man.  It's hard to even imagine a solution to crime that doesn't include cops because cops are usually the ones describing the problem.  Ghostwriting.  these simple and effective storylines were fed in between commercial breaks.  Round two, fight!  Look, defunding the police doesn't mean giving up on crime.  It means investing that money into the communities most affected by it.  So you can pay for things like affordable housing, jobs programs, better schools, free healthcare, public transportation, rehab centers.  Actually, can I put a graph up there?  Nope.  Gardens full of gumdrops and rivers made of chocolate.  Look, it's all very sweet, and I'm sure he'd love any excuse to make the government pay for his prep.  But the reality is you can't enjoy utopia if gangs of thugs are running around destroying all that precious community you just built.  But the whole point is that these programs reduce crime by making sure people's needs get met and giving them the tools and resources to feel invested in their communities.  Why do you think affluent suburbs with basically no cops have such low crime rates?  have already been chased out of those neighborhoods.  Wow, what the fuck?  Do you really think people become thugs because they're food insecure or have shitty libraries?  Some people are just evil and no amount of community investment or kumbaya bullshit is gonna stop bad boys from doing what they're hardwired to do.  Why is this plot device making me horny?  You know that chart I showed you earlier about how violent crime has been going down?  If you're like me, your first impulse was probably, wow, the cops must be doing their job.  But this decline has been happening everywhere, even in cities that haven't altered their police force.  And one of the leading explanations for why has nothing to do with police, it has to do with lead.  Studies have found that early exposure to lead is correlated with lower IQ and a higher propensity for juvenile delinquency.  And researchers noticed that areas with high levels of lead ended up having higher violent crime rates.  Cities that got rid of lead products quickly saw quick declines in crime, while those who couldn't afford to saw a much slower decline.  The city of Baltimore is often depicted as a violent hellscape in crime shows.  It's Baltimore, gentlemen.  The gods will not save you.  But the city is also plagued by high levels of lead poisoning due to lead paint on old buildings.  Freddie Gray, who was murdered by police in Baltimore, had nearly seven times the acceptable level of lead in his blood by the time he was two.  Findings like this are why organizations like the American Public Health Association recommend treating violence as a public health issue.  If a community is experiencing violent crime, it's often because there are broader issues like poverty, homelessness, crumbling schools, and a lack of access to healthcare.  It's hard to draw a one-to-one connection for any of these things, but the point of the community health model is that crime, like all human behavior, is complicated.  And while specific crimes might look random and thoughtless up close, they're often linked to bigger social problems we can understand and fix.  It makes sense then that more cops rarely means less crime.  It's like trying to fight a pandemic by executing everyone who coughs.  It might work in the short term, but after a while you just end up with a bunch of dead bodies.  And if you talk about crime this way, not as some nuisance to be snuffed out, but as a symptom of a series of underlying issues, people's response to crime changes.  A 2009 study looked at how people responded to complex crime stories that mentioned poverty, community health, and other systemic problems and found that those audiences became less interested in prison and more interested in preventative measures like job training, education, and economic justice.  The problem is it's boring, Brenda.  Nobody wants to hear that shit.  Imagine Mariska Hargitay trying to explain the lead thing to a judge.  Crime shows are supposed to be scary and anxiety inducing.  They need you to side with the good guys trying to resolve the tension.  Talking about crime as a public health issue ruins the spectacle.  So instead, these shows treat crime like an aberration.  Something done by psychopaths, sociopaths, and just plain bad dudes, motivated by nothing more than cruelty and malice.  On Cops and Life PD, there isn't even time for a motive.  You never see a drug user struggle to find access to addiction treatment.  You never see a gang member experiencing economic displacement.  Cops' theme song is Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do when they come for you?  Because that's all the information you're given.  All the thoughtfulness that format allows for.  And local news is even worse.  Many local papers have mugshot galleries where they just show images of people who've been arrested with no explanation of who they are.  One study found that the average local TV news story lasts about 30 seconds.  which is even shorter than a cop segment.  You might hear a police statement, see a mugshot, B-roll of yellow tape, and that's it.  On to the next horrific event.  This is literally called episodic news coverage because it works just like a TV episode.  Every crime is its own story, disconnected from every other crime story.  There's no sense of history or context or location.  It's just bad guy did crime.  Bad guy did crime.  Bad guy did crime.  Bad guy did crime.  Watch enough of this stuff and studies show you'll be more likely to support punitive responses like the death penalty.  And how could you not?  Without context, crime looks like it comes from nowhere.  You can't imagine why these people would do something so awful.  So after a while, you come up with your own explanations for crime.  It must be that these people are different.  Evil.  Monsters.  And there's really only one way to deal with monsters.  It's time for closing statements.  This is your last chance to make your case before the audience votes.  Charles, you're up first.  Look, I've really enjoyed this intellectual exercise.  And again, if you'd like to have me back to discuss my 45-point reform plan, I'd love to come.  But the question you need to ask yourself is, are you really ready to roll the dice on your safety?  Are you really ready to give up on protecting yourself or your children just because of a few bad apples?  This isn't about giving up.  It's about recognizing that the current approach isn't working.  You can't fix systemic issues by punishing everyone who experiences them.  And the sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can start imagining better, more ethical alternatives.  And how confident are you in those alternatives, Carl?  Admit it.  Social workers and better schools might stop some people from becoming criminals, but not all.  Of course not.  The goal is to minimize- See?  He admits it.  He can't promise you your security.  He talks a big game about compassion and ethics, but when a homophobe decides to follow you home from Zumba one day, you're gonna wish you had an armed cop on every corner, aren't you?  Nobody can promise total security, but these nightmare scenarios are not a good enough reason to keep things the way they are.  Admit it, part of you likes the idea of being able to call a cop when you feel in danger.  It makes you feel safer, just admit it.  Maybe it does, but it's not worth it.  Say more about that.  Preemptively shooting everyone who walks up to me on the street would also keep me safe.  But it's a bad way to live.  America has one of the highest incarceration rates on the planet.  It's not because we're more violent.  It's because we respond to every perceived threat by trying to crush it with force.  So what are you really proposing, Carl?  Intentional insecurity.  Letting go of the illusion of total safety and accepting that big, complex problems like crime don't have simple answers.  I can't promise you that defunding the police will create some crime-free utopia, okay?  I'm asking you to be brave enough to try something different.  To imagine a world where we respond to violence with thoughtfulness and restraint, instead of just more violence.  I think we're done here.  Indeed we are.  Audience, it's time to vote.  Voting completed.  The winner is Charles.  The police will not be defunded.  Congratulations, everybody.  You're safe now.  Not just from the bad guys on the street, but from the much scarier possibility that there are no bad guys.  That we invent monsters to avoid our responsibility to each other, and that peace cannot be won through the barrel of a gun or the crushing of a throat.  Don't worry.  This has nothing to do with you.  Criminals are nothing like you.  They do not want what you want.  They do not want to live a good life.  They want only to destroy.  And so they must be destroyed.  This is how it's always been.  It'll be over soon.  You're safe now.  You're safe now.  You're safe now.  Goodnight.  Tonight on CON Local News, somebody smashed a window at a CVS, and Jeff Bezos just became the world's first trillionaire.  Guess which one we'll frame as a danger to the public.  Good to be with you, Chuck.  You too, Bill.  We both went to J school.  We sure did.  Hey guys, thanks for watching.  Sorry if that video left you feeling a little tense.  I've got some pretty cool announcements.  One, I'll be doing a livestream this Friday, July 31st, here on YouTube to talk about this video and just generally get some human interaction.  It'll be at 6pm Eastern Time, and I'll stream for like an hour or more if you guys want to keep talking to me.  Two, if you liked the shirt I was wearing in this video, You can buy it because I have a merch store now!  I have four designs that I'm really proud of, including God is a Marxist, Comrades Stick Together, Antifa Super Soldier, and the one I'm wearing now, Be Queer, Do Socialism.  I'll make a post about pricing in the community tab for transparency, and every penny I make in July, August, and September will go directly to the Portland Protest Vale Fund.  Link to the merch store is in the description.  Three, Patreon asked me to document my production process for this video.  So if you've ever wanted to look behind the scenes at what it takes to make something like this, you can watch my first two videos on the Patreon YouTube channel now.  And they'll be releasing a few more in the next few weeks.  Okay, that's it.  Thanks for watching.  Be good.  And I'll see you soon. ",
