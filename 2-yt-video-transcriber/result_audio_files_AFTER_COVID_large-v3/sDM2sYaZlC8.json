            "text": "I have been asked a million times who I think the top presidents were, so today, we're going to tier rank the most notable presidents in American history.  Before we jump in, this video is sponsored by Ring.  On this tier list, we have five tiers.  We have S, which I suppose stands for superior since it's at the top of the list, and then we have A, B, C, and F. Now, I'm really missing the letter D here, I will admit to you, because there are a bunch of presidents here who I think are actually D, but because they are D, I'm going to put them in the F category.  We'll get to those in a moment.  So let's start with the presidents who are at the very tip top of the list, the best presidents in the history of the United States.  Obviously, on the top of the list, George Washington, our first president, kept the country together, left office peacefully.  the father of the country, a great man, easy pick, right?  George Washington as number one.  And then everybody knows that the other president, there are only two presidents in this top tier.  There are not three.  Okay.  I know the left thinks FDR is in that top tier.  I know some people on the right think that Reagan's in that top tier.  Neither one of them are Washington or Lincoln.  Lincoln is the other guy in that top tier beyond simply leading America through the civil war and to a new birth of freedom.  It was Lincoln who, as a thinker, helped to revivify the idea that the Declaration of Independence was an inherent part of the Constitution of the United States, that the two were inseparable, the ideas of liberty were not restricted to the Declaration of Independence as a non-operable piece of legislation, but actually infused the Constitution of the United States and the liberty principles were supposed to be extended to all people of the United States, not merely white Americans.  So for that reason, Abraham Lincoln is top of the heap, along with George Washington.  So that's the easy part, right?  That's what everybody does.  Washington and Lincoln are the two best presidents.  There's very little debate about this.  Then things start to get kind of interesting.  So I'm going to sort of do this in reverse order.  I'm going to start with the people who I think are just the worst presidents, like people who just were terrible.  So let's begin with the president who I think was... pretty easily the worst president of the United States without much of a question.  Woodrow Wilson.  Woodrow Wilson is a clear F. Woodrow Wilson is a garbagio.  Woodrow Wilson was a vicious racist who was in favor of radical expansion of the federal government.  He believed that the state should have no limits on it.  He was effectively a socialist.  He believed that the administrative government of the United States should be run top down by the elites.  He not only got us into World War I, he then used World War I as a pretext to basically go after his political opponents with the Sedition Act.  Woodrow Wilson was a horrible, horrible, horrible president.  And the fact that for a long time he was considered one of our better presidents speaks to how dumb America's historical class is.  The reason a lot of America's historical class likes him is because they, again, like the administrative state.  The administrative state, for those who don't know, that's the idea the executive branch really should run the government, that the legislature is sort of a vestigial organ.  The president should be, as Woodrow Wilson says, as big a man as he can be, as big a man as he's capable of filling the office.  He was a big fan of how German government was run.  He was a big fan of the idea that the government was sort of the be all end.  all was Woodrow Wilson.  Awful, awful person, awful president.  He is definitely in the F category.  Other presidents are in the F category.  So this is where I really wish that there was like a D category right here in what would be the D category.  But we're going to have to push him into the F category because we really have no other choice.  There is no D category here.  LBJ definitely goes in that category, in that F category.  So LBJ, awful president.  The sole bright spot in the LBJ administration was a bright spot, and that was the Civil Rights Act.  The Civil Rights Act, which is exactly right on banning all sorts of state practices of discrimination, is wrong when it comes to encroaching into private rights of association and is wrong in some of its broad dimensions.  outlines as far as how to deal with the private sector.  Everything else is garbage.  The extension of the welfare state is garbage.  The Vietnam War and his strategy in pursuing the Vietnam War graduated equilibrium.  Horrible, horrible garbage.  Right.  So LBJ, terrible president.  He definitely goes in that bottom tier, along with Woodrow Wilson.  Other people who belong in that bottom tier and the much beloved FDR goes in that bottom tier, despite historians attempts to paint FDR as a wonderful president.  It's pretty obvious that he lengthened the Great Depression by as much as eight years, according to a study from UCLA Anderson Business School.  Through his horrific economic policies, he basically portrayed anybody who was not under his thumb as a quote unquote malefactor of great wealth.  He was a class warrior.  in the extreme.  He really didn't know much about economic policy.  I'm glad that he was great on the radio, but aside from his pursuit of World War II, that's pretty much it.  Now, this is why, again, that D category would have been good because FDR as a World War II leader was good, except for the whole unfortunate imprisoning 100,000 Japanese Americans in camps.  That was not. ",
