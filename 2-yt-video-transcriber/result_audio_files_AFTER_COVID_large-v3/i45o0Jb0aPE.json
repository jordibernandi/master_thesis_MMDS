            "text": "So guys, we have to talk about this absolutely wild Borat story revolving Rudy Giuliani.  And the basics of it are that the actress that played Borat's daughter in Borat 2, Maria Bakalova, was also in at least one scene presenting herself as a conservative journalist.  doing an interview with Rudy Giuliani, and basically, during that interview, he thinks he's about to get himself somewhere exciting, but it was all fake, and Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, had to run into the room.  So I'm going to read you an excerpt from reporting that really gets that across, and as I do that, I'm going to put a couple of the pictures on the screen.  After she removes his microphone, Giuliani can be seen lying back on the bed, fiddling with his untucked shirt and reaching into his trousers.  They are then interrupted by Borat, who runs in and says, quote, she's 15.  She's too old for you.  And then Giuliani apparently storms out of the room, thus kind of ending the interview, if you will.  And obviously that's very concerning because even if the actress isn't actually 15, the actress Maria Bakalova is an adult, so we don't have to worry about that necessarily.  She's a young female journalist, clearly very young, and Rudy Giuliani is acting deeply inappropriately there.  And so it's funny in a way, but it's also very concerning.  And it's also really interesting because the way this was played up by Giuliani and some of his staff back when it happened, you know, earlier on in the year was that they were the ones that actually got Borat.  They saw this coming.  And they, you know, didn't play along.  And this made Borat's scene not work.  And this ruined Borat's efforts.  And they were proud that they, you know, saw through this clever ruse by Sacha Baron Cohen.  And here's a tweet by one of the staff people from, I believe, July saying just that, which has not aged particularly well.  And she basically said on Tuesday night at Mayor at Rudy Giuliani foiled Sacha Baron Cohen's attempt to scam interview.  ultimately ending in a stupefied Cohen.  That's not what happened.  That's not what happened at all.  Cohen was stupefied.  Yeah, I'm stupefied too.  You know, I'm stupefied, Rudy, but it's not because you saw through his ruse.  It's because of what you almost did or certainly would have done if it wasn't a ruse and you thought you could have gotten away with it, Rudy.  But again, I want to underline here that this is not purely a laughing matter.  Yeah, we can make fun of Rudy Giuliani, but this is somewhat serious.  And I want to read you a tweet by actor Josh Gad, who has seen the movie, and he says it's actually a lot worse than what the reporting is at least indicating, most of it anyway.  And I want to read that to you.  He says... Well, looks like the cat's out of the pants, having seen Hashtag Borat 2.  I can now safely tell you Rudy Giuliani is over in a very big way.  It's worse than you think and more uncomfortable than anything I've ever seen in a recent film, documentary, or otherwise.  And of course, Josh Gad, I'm guessing, sees his fair share of movies.  So we should, you know, yeah, have some fun here.  But this is a very serious moment where 15 or not, Giuliani saw a young woman journalist and basically treated her like a piece of meat.  Totally unprofessional, totally, you know, disrespectful to women of all sorts.  And it deserves to be called out.  And it's something that's not becoming of anyone, let alone somebody that's supposedly so close to the president.  So we're going to have to reserve full judgment until we've all had a chance to see the whole film and absorb it and get the full context.  But it looks like it could be more than a laughing matter.  One final thing.  I find it very interesting that, you know, while all the controversy has supposedly been from groups that support the president, that it's the Democratic Party that have politicians involved.  That sort of prey on younger people that really Rudy Giuliani just did it.  And what's certainly going to be a blockbuster film.  And I haven't heard a lot of criticism from Trump and the proud boys and Q and all those sorts of things.  I wonder if it's hypocrisy. ",
