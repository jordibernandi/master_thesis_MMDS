And look, the dude, man, up there in Minnesota, they arrested and charged a dude with some weak-ass third-degree murder charges and then put out some shit.  talking about the choking didn't kill him.  He had some pre-existing conditions.  So it's still disrespect.  They're already setting it up to let the dude go.  That's why the country's still turning up.  People see the con game for what it is.  They see it's a con game.  They're setting this dude up to walk already.  So that's why the streets are still turned up.  That little bullshit.  arrest didn't stop nothing.  That shit made everything turn up even more.  Look at this.  New Orleans rally tomorrow.  But yeah, it's happening again.  Brady.  the Grady Hospital van after Henry Grady.  That's named after Henry Grady, the hardcore white supremacist.  There's a statue of Henry Grady right around the corner.  who's a hardcore fucking white supremacist.  All right?  This is them, man.  Let me tell you something.  You see they down here.  They down here.  They not up there on the block with the rest of the streets.  You see they down here posted up chilling.  They ain't up there with the rest of the riders up there.  You know?

The Waffle House, all of them around here burn up and tow up.  And I need a snack.  Should I go in this little liquor store that got towed up and grab me some Hot Cheetos?  We got the car barrier.  What's up, Promise the Goddess?  I see you.  Let me wipe my damn, hot as hell out here.  My rag.  I see you.  What's up, court?  Court, I see you.  So, yeah, nigga.  It's still turning up tonight.  It's going to keep turning up, man.  This looks like it might be a regular thing, dude, if they want to play games with them charges.  If they're going to sit and play games with them charges, they're just going to keep making the streets hot.  You know what I mean?  You starting to go, what's up, Jay?  You almost came to Atlanta.  Go to Landmark Diner?  Yeah, that's right.  Up the street, as a matter of fact.  I wonder if they still open.  I don't want to go in there and somebody throw a brick in there and hit my grits.  Eh?  KK, hey, behind me.  No, I'm watching.  What's up, APX?  Yeah, I'm in town, man.  Y'all didn't know I was in town?  Yeah, I'm out here.  Yeah, I'm out here.  did y'all see keisha bottoms doing that press conference earlier talking that bullshit?  she was talking.  shout out to mike.  killer mike was on there.  i talked to killer mike yesterday but um you know killer mike made a very emotional plea and ti was on there and keisha bottom was on there talking that old tough talk.  y'all need to stop all this fighting.  y'all don't care they're talking like she.  everybody fucking mama fuck her damn keisha bottoms.  let me tell you something.  let me tell you something.  I've been out here for a few days and I've been seeing young black men out here struggling, man.  Everywhere I go downtown, brothers asking for money, brothers are homeless, brothers are begging.  And it shouldn't be like that, man.  Keisha Bottom sits up here talking about doing shit for the LGBT community and the immigrant community.  She don't talk about doing a fucking thing for foundational black Americans specifically.  So she want to wag her finger at people because of the benign neglect policy that people are reacting to.  Yeah?  So yeah, she's fully out.  That kills me with all that.  Y'all need to stop talking.  all that tough talk.  You don't sit your bobblehead ass down somewhere.  Yeah?  Man, she need to shut the fuck up.  Because your brothers and sisters out here in Atlanta are struggling.  In the state of Georgia, period.  Yeah?  So, you know, the whole country is turning up.  I'm watching my back, it's the light.  I mean, shit can just go any way.  I don't, I'm looking around, I mean.  Yeah, fire can pop off at any moment.  Watch your back.  You saw somebody walking past me looking funny?  All right, all right, all right.  Let me go back in the room and chill.  But yeah, everybody, man, look, don't let none of these fuckers try to shame people telling black folks how they shouldn't protest.  Look, when black folks protested in silence, taking a knee, they told us to shut the fuck up and sit down and stop whining.  When we march, they say, shut the fuck up, sit down, stop whining.  When we beg, they say, shut the fuck up, sit down and stop whining.  Now, when they just turn up a little bit, all of a sudden they want to try to acquiesce and, you know.  They want to compromise a little bit, but they ain't compromising enough.  We better lock these fucking race soldiers up and stop bullshitting.  Okay.  Okay, I see some moisture.  Let me show y'all the kind of shit that be running around Atlanta.  These niggas, boy.  Some of these niggas ain't about to show.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm gonna go to the room and get on.  I get back on when I get back upstairs.  But yeah, the shit is still going down tonight, man.  The middle of the night right here, downtown Atlanta, and the shit is still going on.  Over there by CNN, all that shit is tore up.  Over by the CNN building, they didn't bust the CNN windows.  They didn't let fires over there.  Buildings and windows and all that shit are busted up.  You know, so it's real heavy out here.  But look, when I get back upstairs... I'm going back to the room.  And I get back on.  live, man.  I get right back on.  There's a lot of y'all in here.  So I'll chop back up live with you guys in a minute.  So y'all hang tight, man.  All right. ",
