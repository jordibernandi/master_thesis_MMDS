I noticed we were at the Bernie debate watch party, and I was like the only one applauding some of the other candidates, but I think we should applaud them.  when they speak out against endless war, When Biden goes over and hugs Bernie, things like that, I thought it was good.  And Klobuchar, man, there's always a moment when a candidate is... I don't want to say it's over.  It's not over.  But boy, she put the slow knife with a smile on her face right in Pete Buttigieg.  And he looked every bit as not ready for prime time as he actually is.  And it wasn't her words.  She quoted his words.  While they were there taking their job seriously, her and Elizabeth and Bernie in the Senate with a Trump trial.  He was in Iowa mocking them and saying that he'd rather be watching cartoons.  This was one of the most important constitutional moments in our history.  there literally is a criminal in the White House who at least Nixon tried to cover up his crimes.  you know this guy is proud of them and has signaled that he's going to commit more of them.  so I wonder where the line is for most people and for Buttigieg to just kind of fluff it off like it was.

And that's pretty rotten and pretty scary.  That it would actually be better to have Trump than Bernie.  That's exactly what she said.  She didn't say it in those words, but that's what Biden said when he said he didn't know if he could commit to endorsing Bernie.  And on and on and on.  And that's why another whole segment of the Democratic Party hack establishment is backing Bloomberg.  He's now their great white hope because Biden isn't doing so well.

We've had a joke the last few days that whenever we see somebody like just total incompetence, there's a piece of the Iowa Democratic Party everywhere, it seems.  But beyond that, beyond the incompetence, we have to get to the bottom.  of why in those precincts, that were Bernie precincts, where there's all this miscalculation that the Times pointed out, we have to get to the...
