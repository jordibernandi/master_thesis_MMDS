            "text": "Welcome to the Shikama Live Show with your host, Shikama.  I'm a licensed journalist here in Las Vegas.  I have worked for such glorious companies as CNN.  I have not worked for Fox yet.  And when I say worked for, I mean I've done stories, submitted them, and was published by CNN.  99% of the news is kind of like that.  Most of the stories are done by people like me.  And then the anchor or whomever gets to report it.  Do me a favor and please interact with this video.  Interact means watch the whole video, click the thumbs up or thumbs down, leave a comment, share.  Oh, and all of my subscribers, please click the notification bell.  YouTube has come out flat on and said subscribing doesn't do anything.  The notification bell is the only thing that matters.  So please, all of you, click the notification bell under the subscribe tab.  Let's get right into it.  Or the new saying is, let's go.  Japan releases fully functioning female robots.  In the United States and most Western countries, any manufacturer that is successful in building an autonomous being, better known as robot, is impressed upon by the government or government agencies through grant money to come under the control of the federal government.  Of course, that means that the interest of the federal government is to provide military support by any means necessary.  With a million dollar grant up for grabs, you can see how U.S.  manufacturers are almost 100% beholden to the federal government.  Even if they aren't already under the federal government, that grant money makes them strive to get the prize of the grant money until they come under the federal government anyway.  Even though they don't win the grant money, they will keep trying and keep trying and keep trying to get the grant money, which means they solicit the federal government as how to improve their robots to such a degree to win the $1 million grant.  What does this mean?  Soft robotics, exoskeletons, robotics come to the forefront of research for federal government interest.  And stuff like social robots take an almost non-existent backseat far, far, far, far, far down the ladder.  So in the  U.S.,  social robots are sideshows, they appear on talk shows for your entertainment, or are relegated to the adult industry.  Let me back up.  I said exoskeletons.  Some of you might not understand, but exoskeletons that you attach to your body now walk on their own.  The exoskeleton itself is a form of a robot.  So grandma or grandpa who has trouble getting around or who have never walked can attach the exoskeleton to their legs, hips, chest, however they whatever configuration that they have and walk around like a normal human being.  okay because of this social robot manufacturers have a mass market mindset which is normal for american companies.  this means that they try to make social robots as cheap as possible to be available to many buyers as possible.  This means you end up with America being decades behind places like China and Japan, which pour millions into it.  That's millions into research, millions into development, millions into parts and labor, versus manufacturers here in the United States, selling their completed robot, social robot, for a cool $2,000.  Let me ask you folks, what do you think the prototype for the robot was if the end product was $2,000?  All of you car buffs, I want you to chime in right now.  How much is a prototype vehicle each and every year cost to sell something that costs $60,000 or $40,000 or, worse, $20,000?  Can you imagine something that costs retail $2,000.  What do you expect to get?  You can buy power tools that cost more than $2,000.  China announced publicly that it wants to be the world leader in robotics to the point that it wants to be the go-to place for robots.  Its neighbor, Japan, made no such announcement, but they are decades ahead of China and decades ahead Ahead, of course, of the U.S Japan has such things as mech suits for sale for a million bucks that you can get right now.  They have transformers, cars that transform into robots that you can drive and sit in for the entire process of them transforming from a car to a robot.  So no, Japan doesn't have to release public statements about its commitments to robotics.  Now, you will not find this in AP, which is the Associated Press.  You won't find this report on Reuters.  But I have secret information and secret sources.  Japan has rolled out brand new social robots, state-of-the-art robots, that is fully functioning wife robots.  It costs $345,000 to start, so the price is a sticking point for most men.  That being said, it serves as a self-funding point for the underground companies.  Meaning, if it's selling robots that start at $345,000... And robots can fetch up to a million dollars each when you customize the robot to your liking.  They don't have to get government grants.  They don't have to do anything, right?  They don't have to get outside funding at all because the product itself funds the company, funds the development, funds the research, right?  Let me tell you this.  In Japan, doll manufacturers are decades ahead of our doll manufacturers here.  Now, these social robots cook, clean, say nice things, perform wifely duties, and can bear children in an artificial womb without the input whatsoever of any human female DNA at all.  None.  You can now replicate yourself.  That does not mean clone.  It means replicate, reproduce yourself with just the DNA that's on your body.  Of course, you need a laboratory to do all of the lovely stuff to do that, but you can do it all by yourself.  Why?  Because men's DNA contains all of the products necessary to create both men and women.  Women's DNA does not.  By necessity, women's DNA needs male input if they were going to do that.  But now you can do it.  Just a man walks into the lab, brings his robot, sis boom pow, boom, she's carrying a baby inside of her when you walk out.  While it can perform all wifely duties, there are much more.  much cheaper full-size dolls that can be used in the bedroom.  In Asia, Japan, and China, men now take their dolls with them while shopping or to the park or on the beach.  It is now actually somewhat commonplace.  Of course, those men were embarrassed at first, but the public, after seeing a dozen or so, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand men with dolls, full-size dolls, they were okay with it.  That's what's going on.  And not only is it not stigmatized in Asia, you can have a doll even when you're married over there.  I can tell you tales of such couples and what the man says to the wife.  Adopting the doll as a companion paves the way to the much more expensive robot that can walk on her own and speak.  So if you buy the doll from the company... That means that they can eventually, if more men buy dolls from that company, they can eventually lower the price on the full-fledged robot.  And that's how things are done.  It's much cheaper than $345,000, but if millions buy dolls from that company, that $345 or $1 million, that's what we're really talking about, that price can be lowered eventually.  Now, the robot is programmable by the man.  Over the course of time, the robot learns the man's personality and develops her own personality.  to always please the man, to be complimentary, to be not stress-causing.  Understand that a lot of women cause stress to such a degree that The research has shown that women actually, the nagging and all of that stuff, actually reduces the lifespan of the man.  Such that men with nagging wives have shorter lifespans than single men.  Here's why this is important for all of you who all don't know.  The research initially was that married men live longer than single men.  Married women live longer than single women.  So now, after they have accepted that as scientific fact, they delved a little bit deeper and started looking at, is the man happy?  Does the woman cause stress in the home?  What's the lifespan of a man who lives in a stressful home?  And they found that men with nagging women as their wives or girlfriends have a shorter lifespan than single men, which was the bar, the low bar.  So now you have a robot that does the exact opposite and does it perfectly each and every time.  You don't have any sort of diversity in a robot that stresses the man out versus a robot that is kind and gentle to the man.  The robot is always kind and gentle as per the program.  to make the man actually live longer.  It's all psychology.  It's all chemicals in the brain.  I'm sorry to say, women, but your fight for the attention of a man and the very immature way that some women could go about it as nagging, did you take out the trash?  Did you buy me this?  Did you get that milk?  And what's funny is, It is so commonplace that physiologically men have developed a brain place where they relegate the nagging to, and that part of the brain goes dormant.  So that men physically cannot hear their nagging wife.  This is all documented medical evidence, medical science, biological science.  Isn't that interesting?  So now you would have a robot that is completely beholden to you, nice to you, cooks and cleans, says nice things, says she missed you.  Oh, she missed you all day long.  Oh, honey.  I'm so glad you're home.  I've been cleaning up all day long, waiting for your return.  Or if you work from home, oh, it's so great for you to come out of your home office.  Would you like a snack?  Right?  There are women who still do that.  Like I said, the research showed that some women who nag reduce their husband's lifespan and also their own lifespan.  Did you know that?  But that means that there are some women who do not.  The problem is the ones who nag and complain and seek attention at all times and have to be recognized and all of that sort of stuff.  They are plentiful.  They're everywhere.  Now, for all of you women who are not mature and who think that I'm talking about all women, I'm going to repeat.  There are women everywhere.  who act like this robot.  It was the standard developed for this robot.  Meaning that there are women on this planet somewhere who cook and clean and say nice things.  And you know what?  Those women love doing it.  And they love their husband.  And they love their children.  And if anything happens to them, their husband or children.  They are saddened by it.  The problem is the modern Western woman is the exact opposite.  This is why Western men are scrambling for this.  The problem is it's a million bucks.  That's the problem.  It's a million bucks.  So for most men, it is outside their own possibility.  Unless you have a very dedicated man who dedicates his life and goal to amassing a fortune.  And you can amass a fortune in 10 years, gentlemen.  Doesn't take much.  Takes sacrifice, takes discipline.  But you can amass a fortune in 10 years.  Thank you all for watching.  If you made it to this point in the video, I want you to say, I'm going to amass a fortune.  And do me a favor.
