            "text": "Forgive the vertical video, but I think you understand that this is the best I can do at the moment.  Just got news.  Joe Biden is officially going to be president-elected of the United States of America.  The comeback in Pennsylvania is official.  He just took the lead in Pennsylvania.  Earlier today, he took the lead in Georgia.  He's going to win Nevada as well.  Arizona has already been called for him by Fox News and AP.  Some of the other networks are being a little more hesitant with Arizona.  But, you know, there's a 95% chance he wins Arizona.  So that means of the remaining five states... Trump only will likely win North Carolina, loses Georgia, loses Arizona, loses Nevada, and now loses Pennsylvania.  Donald Trump has no path whatsoever.  Biden ultimately will win anywhere from 290 to 306 or 307 electoral votes.  It's going to be somewhere in that range, anywhere from 290 to 306 or 307.  And yeah.  That's it.  It's over.  I think that some outlets might be a little bit hesitant to make the official call now because it depends.  If you include Arizona, again, some networks don't include Arizona yet.  And it depends whether or not you want to actually call Georgia and Pennsylvania for Biden.  yet, because Trump was leading for a long time in both of these states.  But what happened was, as I told you, it would.  We hadn't counted the mail-in votes yet, and the more the mail-in votes came in, the more Biden closed the gap, and closed the gap more, and closed the gap more, and then eventually he surpassed, and I got news for you.  When all's said and done, especially in Pennsylvania, Georgia might be a little bit of a different situation, but when all's said and done in Pennsylvania, not only will Biden win, I think he's going to be outside of, like, the recount zone.  Like, he's going to win by more than a point.  So... I mean, listen, I'm perfectly comfortable saying it now.  There are some outlets that have already said it.  But Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States of America.  Again, it will be anywhere from 290 electoral votes to about 307 electoral votes.  Obviously, I'm driving.  I wanted to record this so you guys can get my initial reaction, my initial feelings on it.  Listen, I'm not going to lie.  I disclosed on Rogan that I live in New York.  Honestly, my vote doesn't really matter that much.  And I decided to sit it out because I couldn't get over the fact that Joe Biden had voted for the Iraq War.  That was part of my political awakening.  And I can't look past the 200,000 dead Iraqi civilians.  I can't get over the fact that I honestly think he should be in jail.  Is Donald Trump objectively worse than Joe Biden?  Yes.  If you go issue for issue, Biden versus Trump, I agree with Biden on a lot more than I agree with Trump on.  And Trump is continuing that Iraq war, so obviously voting for him is totally out of the question.  He's a standard establishment Republican in terms of how he governs.  But having said that, am I feeling a slight sense of relief that the Trump era is coming to an end?  I am.  I really am.  Do I think the Biden era will be good?  No.  Don't get it twisted.  And I just tweeted this before, but the general idea is I, um, I'm very happy that objectively horrendous things that were happening will now be replaced with slightly less or slightly fewer objectively horrendous things happening.  I still think objectively horrendous things are going to happen.  I just think they will be a little bit fewer and a little bit more far between.  And if you don't agree with me, then I just don't think you're being... thorough enough in going through the particular issues.  I mean, for example, Joe Biden is likely to get us back in the Iran deal.  That'll be amazing.  That'll be incredible.  We should have never gotten out of that deal, which means we move away from the brink of war with another country.  I think he'll continue Iraq and he'll continue Afghanistan, and I'm going to hammer him for it.  But I can't wait to get back in that Iran deal.  I can't wait to get back in the Paris Climate Agreement, which is absolutely necessary.  I can't wait to have judges that are not far-right lunatics being picked for the courts.  I don't want Federalist Society judges.  Listen, are they going to be centrist judges?  Yes.  But are centrist judges better than fucking far-right Federalist Society judges?  Yes.  There's no debate on that.  Like, there's absolutely no debate on that.  And the list goes on and on.  I could give you five or six issues where I think Joe Biden is just significantly better than Donald Trump.  So, I wanted to give you my live reaction.  I wanted you to see, you know, what I was feeling.  Do I think the Joe Biden era will be good, will be positive?  No, it won't.  You're crazy.  if you think he's going to be the next FDR, you're going to push him left.  Of course that's not going to happen.  But, but, Will there be fewer objectively horrendous things happening, even though objectively horrendous things will continue to happen?  Yes, I do think so.  And listen, I also think this is something I was talking about recently.  I predicted 351 electoral votes for Biden.  I was wrong.  I had a secondary prediction of 320 electoral votes.  Ultimately, the top end of his number will be, like I said, 307, and the low end is like 290.  So he underperformed from the polls, and Donald Trump overperformed from the polls.  Even when all the votes are counted, that will be the case at the end.  But honestly, what this really reflects is just a clear validation and verification of, I think, populist left politics.  And here's why I say that.  You have a president who's a reality show, game show host, like, human cartoon character, A guy who clearly doesn't know what he's doing.  He's incompetent.  He has no core ideology.  230,000 Americans died on his watch with this pandemic.  230,000 Americans and rising steadily because we keep breaking records for COVID every day.  Over 1,000 deaths every day.  It's just over 120,000 new cases in one day.  You have a guy who botched a pandemic response and who's overseeing a total economic collapse where working Americans are getting obliterated.  I mean, 30% of the country can't make rent, pay mortgage.  So given all of that, the best you could do was run a candidate like Joe Biden and barely eke out a win in what should have been 400 electoral votes.  And I think what that shows is, listen, we were right all along when we said you have to stand for something.  If you don't stand for something, then best case you'll ever get is just like a backlash election where people go, oh, at least you're not that guy.  And you barely beat a colossal idiot who's actually a horrendous politician and did a horrendous job governing.  So I do think this is a validation of left-wing politics.  I really do.  I do think that, you know, this shows that if he ran on a proactive agenda, if he ran on Bernie Sanders' agenda, that he would have won by a hell of a lot more.  If it wasn't for COVID, Trump would have cruised to reelection.  And those things that we were saying early on about how Biden has no chance of beating Trump, that is true bar any major disaster.  And what happened is we had a major disaster.  We had COVID.  So if COVID didn't happen, Trump would be cruising to reelection and he would have more electoral votes than he had previously.  He got more votes than he got in the last election.  He expanded his coalition.  He gained among Latinos.  He gained among black people.  He gained among women.  So he would have won reelection easily if it wasn't for COVID, but instead the Democrats are going to take the lesson away from this that, oh, Biden is awesome.  Sectarianism is awesome.  Corporatism is awesome.  Even though we barely beat Donald Trump.  And even though we underperformed massively, they lost seats in the House of Representatives, the Democrats did.  When it comes to the Senate, there looks like they're not going to win the Senate, or if they do, they will.  ever so, they will barely win it.  Um, so.  Biden wins, but really it's a validation of believing in something, running on something proactive, having an agenda, fighting for the people.  Because he certainly didn't fight for the people, and so he's basically eking out a win with anywhere from 290 to 307 electoral votes, when it should have been 400, it should have been 412, it should have been, you know, a real layup.  So, the wrong lessons will be learned, but that's okay, because we'll be here to give you what we think are the right lessons.  And I don't know how you guys are feeling at the moment, but, you know, the mood is a little bit more elevated for me today than it was, you know, originally.  And by the way, you go back and watch the podcast, the live podcast with Rogan, and you see, I'm happy that I stuck to my guns about the Red Mirage scenario, and I'm happy that when it looked like, oh my god, the map is red, I kept reminding everybody that, no, the way it works, those states, they're only counting the on-the-day votes first.  We haven't even gotten to the mail-ins yet.  And lo and behold, as soon as the mail-ins started coming in, Biden searches and wins, right?  So, but on the day, when you saw, you know, you saw Michigan and Wisconsin massively red, everybody's like, oh, no, Donald Trump's going to do it again.  And it's like, no, because you don't know the dynamics of it.  The dynamics of it are, those are the votes on the day, which we know lean Republican.  Biden's winning the mailings like 80% or something preposterous like that.  Are you kidding me?  So, um, there you have it.  President elect Joe Biden.  This is my real time reaction to it.  Don't worry.  We will continue to keep it real.  And, uh, I'll do my best to tell you guys the truth as I see it to hold Joe Biden accountable.  Um, but.  It is now a new era in American politics.  The Trump era is coming to a close.  And it'll be very interesting to see what happens with the Republican Party as well.  How fractured are they?  Are you going to have, in the same way you have that split in the Democratic Party of the left versus the corporatists, you might have the establishment Republicans versus the Trumpists.  And even though they don't necessarily disagree on policy, there'll be a giant rift culturally.  And Donald Trump threw a tantrum yesterday making stuff up about, oh, my God, they're rigged to vote and this and that, the mail-in votes, their illegal ballots.  He did that yesterday.  I expect him to throw another tantrum today, and we'll see how that gets handled.  But, look, it's clear.  It's not even like it's going to be Biden winning by one state and he gets 271 electoral votes.  Like I said, it's anywhere from 290 to 307.  So he's going to win by a little bit, enough where they can't do like what they did in 2000, where it was super sketchy, and they basically gave it to Bush.  Can't do that now.  So we'll see how much of a tantrum he throws, but wow.  What an election.  What a day.  Joe Biden is your next president of the United States of America.  He wins while eating ice cream in his basement on his couch, watching reruns of Law & Order, and calling his grandkid the wrong name.  That's how Joe Biden wins.  Listen, as a Bernie person, and I know most of you guys, if not all you guys, are Bernie people too, the overwhelming majority, now the Trump people get a taste of what we went through in the primary, right?  How Bernie won the first three primaries, and then like every single state from then on was like, All right, the polls have closed, and we're ready to make an official projection.  Joe Biden has won.  The next state, and we're ready to make an official projection.  Joe Biden has won.  It was one after the other after the other.  Joe Biden is the definition of a strong closer.  He's the comeback kid.  He's not a front-runner.  He doesn't come out of the gates hot.  He comes out of the gates dead, because he's half dead.  And then eventually, he just always ends up surging.  They did in the primary.  Some of it was sketchy.  Some of it not.  But now the Trump people are feeling what the Bernie people felt, where it's like, we were just up by the thing, and we were running up the scoreboard, and it looked like we were having a better night.  It looked like the 2016 wave, and I thought the thing, and oh my God, oh, why doesn't this guy ever stop losing?  Or winning, excuse me.  So anyway, there you have it.  President-elect Joe Biden.  What a world we live in. ",
