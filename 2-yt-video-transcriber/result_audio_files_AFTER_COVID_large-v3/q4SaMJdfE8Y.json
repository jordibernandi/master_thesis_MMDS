            "text": "I'm out on a road trip right now, and I realize I'm going to be on my way home pretty much driving right past Ken Ham's Ark Encounter.  So this place being on my bucket list, even though I am not enthusiastic about giving financial support to a creationist ministry, I've got to do this.  It's a bit ironic, having grown up as a devout creationist, that I'm only now, as a non-believer and proponent of evolution, going to go see, apparently, the most accurate representation or recreation of the biblical Noah's Ark.  I'm expecting some pretty serious flashbacks to my childhood as I walk through the exhibits, and that will probably be accompanied by some serious frustration over the pseudoscience that's going to be in there.  I wanted to share this experience with you guys, and since I didn't do anything special to celebrate 300,000 subscribers, I thought that it could be fun to just take some questions from across my social media that you guys have provided and answer them as we go on this weird little adventure together.  So, let's go.  Okay, voiceover Drew here.  This trip turned out very noisy, so while you'll hear the original audio from some clips, most questions will be answered in voiceover.  All right, we're almost there.  So first question, what is the meaning of your channel name?  The first meaning of the name is just a bit of a joke.  A lot of alternative medicine type people are really against genetically modified organisms, genetically modified food.  Anything that says genetically modified is scary to them.  So in beginning my channel, I was just... kind of trying to tell a joke, I guess, by saying I'm the genetically modified skeptic, like I'm the worst of the worst.  The second meaning of the name is to say that I come from a family of several generations of missionaries, and I'm the first person in my family in a long time not even just to be Christian.  And so there's, you could say that maybe being a missionary is in my blood, in my genes, but I guess there's something that changed about me.  That second meaning is a bit of a joke in itself.  I also just like names that have more than one meaning, and this one did, and so I picked it.  And there it is.  Oh, I am not ready for this.  We got our tickets, took a bus to the site, and were immediately greeted with a sermon from Ken Ham.  We hurried along to the Ark, though, where Taylor and I got the same first impression.  Next question, when you were a Christian, did you ever read the Bible all the way through, or did you just take everyone's word for it?  While I read through the Bible in its entirety multiple times by my teenage years, that doesn't quite constitute not taking others' word for it.  I studied the Bible on my own a good deal, I competed in some Bible knowledge and scripture recitation competitions as a kid, and have the equivalent of a minor in Bible.  I say equivalent because my Christian university made everyone take courses which added up to the equivalent of a minor in Bible.  That said, I did flat out trust what my pastors, parents, professors, and favorite apologists said because most people I knew did the exact same thing no matter how educated they were.  I can't fault myself for that either.  I mean, it wasn't that I thought all those people were infallible at all.  It's that I had no sources of information about theological or scientific issues outside of those people and their favorite books.  I grew up in a Christian bubble where I was told that anything outside that bubble was probably evil and could corrupt me.  I could have told you why I personally believed with none of those reasons being because they told me so, but when you have no access to or knowledge of other sources of information growing up while being taught to fear the outside world, you believe what you're told.  So First Impressions is extremely loud in here.  There's a lot of animal sounds and storm sounds.  I guess they're really getting you into the theme, right?  When you were Christian, what were the main reasons that you would use to justify why you believed?  My favorite places to start in defending the faith were often statements like, the accounts in the Bible match up perfectly to what we observe scientifically and historically.  It described the creation and the flood before scientists, not mainstream scientists mind you, came along and confirmed that the Earth is about 6,000 years old and was completely flooded about 4,000 years ago.  That suggests that those parts of the Bible were divinely inspired and historical.  I also liked saying, the Bible was written by over 40 different authors, many who had no knowledge of each other over a period of 1,500 years and still has no errors or contradictions at all.  Only God could make a document like that happen.  Of course, I also believed because of my own personal experience, but I didn't usually lead with that.  Note that I was a biblical literalist, creationist, and believed the Bible was inerrant.  I thought that if God really did inspire the Bible, we'd expect it to have absolutely no errors in any way.  Imagine my surprise when I realized evolution wasn't just some made-up conspiracy theory, that the Gospels were anonymously written accounts of popular oral traditions recorded decades after Jesus' time, and that biblical manuscripts have been copied and edited so many times that determining their exact original contents isn't really possible.  Walking to the next exhibit here, we could hear horrific screaming just growing louder and louder.  It turned out.  the exhibit making all the noise was one about what happens when people don't follow God, or at least the young earth creationist version of Yahweh.  When you were a Christian, how did people explain away the hard to believe bits in the Bible?  This is a point I really can't emphasize enough.  I didn't have enough access to or understanding of information or perspectives outside my Christian bubble to even bat an eye at the idea of a talking donkey or 900-year-old people or the idea that God sent himself to sacrifice himself to himself to save humanity from the torment.  he said we deserve for breaking rules he designed while knowing completely that we weren't even capable of following them to his satisfaction.  That said, in hindsight, I now see that one of the main ways my big questions were explained away as a Christian was the argument that if something is hard to understand or believe, that's only greater confirmation of God's word.  See, God is an intelligence far greater than human understanding, So we expect to lack understanding of his words and ways sometimes.  Just because it doesn't make sense to us doesn't mean it isn't true.  Now I realize that's a way of making one's beliefs unfalsifiable.  It's enough to chalk up all flaws and all fallacies and any theology to the ignorance of those asking questions.  Convenient, right?  When you first saw the Ken Ham-Bill Nye debate, what was your reaction?  I didn't watch it until a while after it had been released because, at that time, I was beginning to feel like creationists and evolutionists mostly talked past each other.  When I finally did watch it, that's exactly what I thought happened.  Even as a Christian, I was a bit embarrassed by how poorly I thought Ken Ham defended our worldview.  His, well, I have a book written by an eyewitness line made me mad because I realized it was just begging the question.  It just assumed the Bible was true instead of proving it, which I, at the time, thought could be done scientifically and historically.  I also had a problem with Ken saying that nothing could convince him that the Bible wasn't true.  I believed that if just one error was found in the Bible, that would destroy the case for literalist biblical inerrancy.  I just didn't think we'd ever found any of those errors or ever would, so I believed.  Until that moment, I thought that's what all of us creationists believed.  Apparently, some people are committed to believe even without reason.  Okay, the next exhibit we found was small but incredibly creepy.  It was there to point out that the Flood is not some children's fairy tale, but a true account of death and damnation.  I'm just gonna show you guys two short clips.  I shot in it, and to be clear, 100% of the sounds you will hear were playing from the exhibit speakers.  Oh, my God.  What's the best way to politely explain that you didn't just turn your entire life upside down and lose friends because you just didn't want to follow the laws or rules of your religion?  The you only left because you want to.  sin idea is a hard one to counter because overcoming it fundamentally threatens the worldview of the person asserting it.  Accepting that a person left the faith for actual reasons, not because of moral failings, not only goes against what many Christians are taught directly from Scripture about apostates, but also requires the understanding that sane, rational, good people can evaluate the evidence for your worldview and still reject it.  For a lot of people, admitting that someone can leave the faith for intellectual reasons, not moral failure, feels like admitting the weakness of their worldview.  That's a kind of arrogance we all have to overcome with respect to those who come to disagree with us.  My own personal experience says that the only way to deal with this accusation is to be consistently kind, patient, and open to calmly answering questions.  Instead of just explaining, show people that you aren't a moral monster and they'll have to process that somehow.  If they continue to say you left because you're weak or don't care about being a good person after that, that's their own problem in my opinion.  I don't allow one-sided relationships in my life, so if someone treats me with less respect than my character has earned, I don't bother with them anymore.  If you had the capability, would you go back to believing just for the supposed peace of mind that's supposed to come along with that?  I wouldn't go back.  I've experienced that peace of mind, and for me, it isn't something I can't get with the proper self-care and community as an atheist.  On top of that, the kind of God I believed in was one that demanded.  I trust authority, biblical or otherwise, even when that authority is demonstrably wrong.  That belief made me completely blind to humanity's tribalistic nature.  unable to acknowledge the bias of myself and those in my tribe, and therefore unable to cooperate with those outside of it.  Not every theistic position demands this kind of ignorance and arrogance, but mine did.  If people like my former self were in charge, climate change would be ignored, public science education would be abysmal, and anyone demanding equal treatment to Christians would be seen as persecutors of the faith rather than individuals who deserve the same rights and privileges as myself.  Oh, wait a minute.  After you intellectually left Christianity, how long did it take for you to emotionally leave religion?  I was very much of a. Christianity isn't a religion, it's a relationship kind of Christian.  So not attending church wasn't that difficult, but overcoming my habit of praying constantly, and I mean constantly, took me a long time.  It was probably two years before I completely stopped that.  Being comfortable as an atheist took me a while, but it's hard to say how much of that had to do with the fact that I kept it secret to everyone but my wife for the first year for fear of rejection.  After a few months as an atheist, really grappling with my mortality for the first time ever, I didn't long to believe again.  The only thing I missed was the community, and that need has since been met.  Okay, arc's closing in 15 minutes, so make sure that you get right with Ken Ham in your heart before the end, because I hear really bad things if you don't.  So just go ahead and do it.  I mean, what do you have to lose?  Alright guys, thanks for watching.  I've been Drew of Genetically Modified Skeptic.  I hope you guys enjoyed coming along as I crossed this place off my bucket list.  A special thanks to my patrons for making this trip possible.
