            "text": "If a white girl gets attention from a white guy, that's more of that.  OK, so now you have heard it straight from the horse's mouth.  Now, the next thing I want to address is why I cover these topics.  Some of you think that I cover them because there is this thing that black women have against white women.  They believe that black women are jealous and that people should be able to date, marry and love whoever they want.  I've made it very clear on this channel, even on our ministry channel, that many, many years ago, I didn't have an issue with it.  It wasn't for something that I wanted for myself, but it wasn't something that I frowned upon many, many years ago.  That's because I was a Christian and I had no understanding about any of this, you see.  And so, of course, without understanding, I didn't have a problem or an issue with it.  Now, it's not that I have a problem with it right now.  The issue that I have with it is because of what the Bible says.  And I've shared other videos where even some so-called white people are saying the same thing.  They're talking about what the Bible says concerning this.  Some of you don't care about that, but we've also talked about, even from a human standpoint, We are the only people, so-called black people, are the only people who find pride and privilege in marrying outside of our race.  We feel like we are getting a prize.  But what this woman said with her own mouth.  is that it is not a badge of honor to be with a black man.  It's not considered a badge of honor.  As a matter of fact, they feel like it's a step below, like it's a step down, not a step up.  But this black man, he couldn't even perceive of this.  He said he respectfully disagrees, even though she is telling you this is a white woman.  She says, well, I'm a white woman and I'm telling you how we view you.  And he just didn't want to accept it.  This is because, again, there's this pride that so-called black men have in themselves.  And then there's the whole thing of believing that a white woman makes him somehow better.  But she's telling him, no, it may make you better because you see me as the prize.  But on the flip side of that, I don't see you as the prize, black man.  She's telling you right there in your face.  Now, I read one of the comments under the video that was shared on social media.  And, you know, of course, the black man says a statement.  He says, well, she's still sitting in the car and I bet she'll change her mind if I pull out my so-and-so.  And you all can just fill in the blanks on that.  So, again, this is the black man thinking that his worth, that particular black man thinking that his worth is in what's between his legs.  What else do you have to offer in that woman's mind?  She knows she can get that anyway, even even if she tells you how she feels.  She knows that she can get that anyway.  As a matter of fact, I remember many years ago we saw a video where a white woman was just calling this guy the N word.  She was saying, look, N word, N word, N word, whatever.  And he said, I still want to sleep with you.  So it's like he put down any amount of self-esteem that he could have possibly had just to say, look, even though you feel that I'm the N-word, I still want to sleep with you because this is what he's thinking with.  Not thinking with his head, not thinking of the danger that could be attached to dealing with such a woman.  All he's thinking about is the joys of sin that only last for a season.  And again, I just want to touch again on why I deal with subjects such as this, because I know the spiritual consequences of this.  You can ignore it all you want, but there are spiritual consequences to this and physical consequences.  Many of our brothers are starting to see the judgment and the consequences that are spoken of in Scripture.  Whether you believe it or accept it or not, it is what it is.  And then when I think about the fact that men of other races, I'm going to just be honest with you right here.  Men of other races do not see it as a step up.  OK, to be with a black woman.  It is what it is.  OK, now there are rare occasions where some.  May have certain statements like one white guy actually was a group of white guys.  They said black women are for grownups.  You know, I remember I shared that statement years ago and our son, Aliyah, at the time, he was a teenager when he gave a comeback on that.  And I said, wow, this is this young man is really funny and smart at the same time.  But when we were talking about the statement that these these white billionaires and get this, these were not just white men.  These were white billionaire men.  They were saying, well, black women are for grownups.  And our son, Elias, said, and tricks are for kids.  And so I said, wow, that is so funny.  He's basically saying that, you know, black men who just go after anything.  Tricks are for kids.  You see, hey, these were the sons of our son.  I'm sorry.  These were the words of our son, Aliyah.  And so, again, the spiritual consequences outweigh any natural consequences.  But even if you look at only the natural from from a historical standpoint, what are we doing here?  We are trying to white ourselves out willingly.  before it wasn't willingly when the slave master would go in unto the women and have their way and produce, you know, this offspring.  Right.  But now that we don't have to do that and we can willingly be with our own and love our own and produce with our own.  Black men and black women are choosing to go to the other side because they don't want to produce anything that looks like them.  And they believe that it is a step up.  But see, only the black portion of that union believes that white men don't believe that is a step up to be with a black woman.  Okay.  Some of them, um, you know, I can't really speak for all, but some of them just feel like you're just, um, their mood for the day.  This is what I feel like doing.  Um, I'll even spend a few years, marry you and blah, blah, blah.  Um, one story we shared many years ago, my husband used to be in sales and he had a sales appointment at this, this one house in Michigan.  And the husband was white.  The wife was black.  The children were mixed of course, but As he's trying to give his sales pitch, the white husband was sitting there making statements like, yeah, I'm raising a couple of animals here myself, you know, and my wife and she's she's an animal.  And she's she she's.  my husband said she was just sitting there just looking so distraught and so sad and so.  just hurt by the words that her white husband was was speaking about her and the mixed children called referring to them as animals that he's raising you see and so sometimes people like to paint the picture that they have somehow crossed over into a better life and is not always as it seems.  And the same with black men.  Many of them, they will share their horror stories after the fact.  Well, you know, the whole time trying to make it seem like the reason they crossed over is because they believe that white women are more docile, more submissive, more loving, more caring, better mothers, better wives, better everything.  But then when the ship sinks, when that Titanic finally hits rock bottom, then they come out with the truth and say, oh, well, she did this and she did that.  And she called me this.  and she called me that because we don't know how to be honest with ourselves.  And I'm not saying that this is every relationship.  Now, this is me talking from a human standpoint.  But from a spiritual standpoint, the judgment of YAH is attached to this.  It's attached to it, whether we want to believe it or accept it or not.  I would encourage all of you to watch White It Out Part Five.  White It Out Part Five.  It's more than six hours long.  Okay.  It is the curse of generational curses.  In there, you will see all the scripture that you need to see to understand what I'm talking about.  And this is on our ministry channel as well.  Another one that you want to check out is the sins of Judah.  That's also on our ministry channel.  Watch me reports.  And again, I'm just trying to give you some spiritual understanding on why we talk about this so much.  Some of you believe.  now to the young lady who says, auntie, we should leave this alone.  Sweetheart, I have to do this.  OK, we've actually had.  Some of our brothers and some of our sisters who have repented and have told the truth about the nightmare that they were in.  As a matter of fact, there's a couple of testimonies on our ministry channel where brothers just literally laid it out and they explained the complete and total nightmare that they were involved in.  with Gentile women.  Okay.  It is what it is, family.  I do this for the sake of repentance.  I don't do this because of anything personal.  I'm married to a black man.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  Okay.  This has nothing to do With jealousy, people think that black women are jealous to see white women with black men.  That has absolutely nothing to do with it.  Like I said before, I didn't have an issue with it, but I see the spiritual ramifications of all of this.  I see the judgment attached to it is right there in scripture.  Even if you don't believe in the scripture, I mean, you can see with your own eyes back in the day.  And even now, they were saying that the majority of the brothers that have been found hanging from trees or whatever they were found hanging from or bridges or whatever, they said the majority of them, at least 75% or more, were either dating or married to a white woman.  OK, so try to figure that one out.  Look at back in the day.  Emmett Till, he whistles at one.  He loses his little 12 year old life.  OK, look at other incidents where like in Black Wall Street, supposedly a black man possibly bumped a white woman by mistake on an elevator and all.  Hell broke loose.  So even if you want to ignore the biblical aspect of things, look at the natural aspect of things.  It is not a good idea.  And many of these people, they tell you they don't want you dating their daughters.  You see, we know of situations right now where.  If they catch you dating their daughters, they will lie on you and try to ruin your life.  Even though their daughters are willing participants in these types of relationships, young black guy, young white girls, their fathers will spin that thing and make it seem like you are a criminal who coerced their daughters when their daughters were willing participants in these things.  understand where i am coming from.  save your life brothers.  Save the lives of your sons.  Tell them the truth.  You owe them the truth.  And if you don't want to accept it from me or believe it from me, listen to the lady in the beginning of this.  She just told you how they feel and what they think.  You are not the prize, okay?  You are not a come up for them.  You are not a badge of honor for them.  She said that the white man is their badge of honor.  Get that through your heads.  hear wisdom.  speak brothers.  okay stop thinking with the wrong head.  okay think with the right head and save your life.  i am done with this video.  I hope some of you can take something from it.  But as usual, I expect the rude, obnoxious, fleshly, ignorant comments that I get on video such as this, because this is what happens when you are not a spiritual being.  When you are a person who thinks in the carnal all of the time, the only thing that you can hurl are insults.  But guess what?  I just want to let you all know this.  Those of you who do this stuff that called me different names and say all kinds of things about me and say that my husband is a disgrace for letting me speak and all of this kind of stuff.  My husband is not afraid of the truth.  He's a very strong man.  And that is why he is with me because he's a very strong man.  He teaches this truth.  and we teach it together.  we don't have a problem with the truth neither one of us.  we know that there are some daughters of zion that are messed up.  we know that the brothers are messed up.  we know that our people in general the most high says that we are stiff necked hard headed and that The solution to that is to repent.  This is why we cry aloud and spare not and lift up our voices like trumpets in Zion and show our people their transgressions.  So for those of you who want to get in the comment section and say all kinds of things about Sister Deborah, guess what?  I don't care.  Okay.  I guess I can say I'm immune to it after all of this stuff that has been hurled over the years.  You're really just wasting your time.  And that's something you're going to need to get out of your heart and repent for.  Because guess what?  You will give an account for every idle word, whether you think it, speak it or type it.  It is what it is.  Okay.  I'm done with this video for real this time.  I love you all.  I say this in love, family, okay?  We have to start correcting the error among us.  We've got to, okay?  If you haven't already, subscribe to the channel, share and like this video.  And with that, I am out.  Be sure to ring the bell to be notified of new uploads on this channel, and also comment, share, like, and subscribe. ",
