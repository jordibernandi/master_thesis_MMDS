Wesley Lowe is a pro on the PBA Tour.  After setting pins so much, I got tired of that, and I was thinking, you know that little bowling alley at Incredible Pizza, they use strings.  So we used the strings, and one thing led to another.  We made another layer that kind of sets the pins.  And then after doing that, we were thinking, man, if we can figure out a ball return, and we were on the... at the aisle of Home Depot getting essential items and saw this plumber's PVC pipe, and my father-in-law was a plumber, and I kind of laughed.  I was like, I bet that would work for a ball return, so.  We just kind of every day started trying things and we learned about pulleys.  So it's like having school at home.  Eric's been learning how to use power tools, hammer, nail, screw gun, skill saw, jigsaw, all the things of a kind of like a carpenter. ",

Stay quarantined, but go to your backyard and do something.  Bowling Alley is kind of our family.  Mike Anderson, all those people that work there right now are out of work and it's closed.  But I play my saxophone there on Wednesday nights and Eric bowls every single day.  So we've kind of become Bowling Alley is our home.  So we're quarantined away from that home.  So we had to make Bowling Alley here our home.  Bring it to our home. ",
