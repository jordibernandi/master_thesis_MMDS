            "text": "I have some fascinating video to dig into today.  Donald Trump has been having trouble on the issue of race lately.  Donald Trump's reaction to huge national protests against police brutality after George Floyd was killed by police was to say, send in more force and have the military dominate the protesters.  That was the word he used last week or the week before on a call with governors.  So it's obviously not going well for Trump on race.  Donald Trump is polling eight percent with black voters, eight, eight percent, according to a new CNN poll.  So someone got the bright idea.  Let's send Trump to be interviewed on Fox News, but not by one of their ubiquitous white blonde anchors.  Have black woman Harris Faulkner interview Donald Trump.  This is going to be great.  It's going to help them with with black voters.  It was absolutely and utterly insane.  And I want to look at some clips with you today.  Here's Trump pulling out the cringe worthy claim.  about him doing more for black people than any other president.  And he weirdly says, let's not include Lincoln in that.  Although he adds, it is questionable how much Abraham Lincoln really did for black people, to which even Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner has to say, well, we are free, Mr.  President, like Lincoln freed the slaves.  You've done more for us.  Check out this first clip and strap in, folks, because it's going to be wild in general. ",

Now, if you have two people, and the case that we're talking about, four people.  Yeah.  And two of them, I guess, just pretty much started.  It's a very, very tricky situation.

The origins are a guy named Walter Headley, the police chief of Miami, Florida, who said it in the 60s when there was a violent outbreak of crime and it has a horribly racist history.  It was positioned against the battle for civil rights in the country at the time.  And Trump was asked about the origins and he kind of plays dumb.  He's like, well, other people also said it like.  Philly Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo used the term.  Now, Rizzo did not actually use the term, but he did encourage brutal police tactics.  And Trump just kind of says, like, well, Rizzo also said it, which is not technically true.  And then it gets just really awkward.
