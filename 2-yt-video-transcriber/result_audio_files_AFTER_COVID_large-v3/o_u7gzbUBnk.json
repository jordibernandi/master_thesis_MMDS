            "text": "Hey everyone!  You might notice that I'm in the same place.  I'm wearing the same clothes and makeup and everything as a few videos recently but since I don't have an editing computer and I can't really edit at the moment I'm just kind of putting a lot of effort into writing and researching and planning lots of videos and scripts and today I'm just having a big day of filming and I've got the energy to do this so we're just gonna get it all out in one go.  I don't know why I'm punching.  that's weird.  Let's talk about the transformed wife, Laurie Alexander.  If you're new to my channel, you might not know her, but she is a woman who is a very fundamental Christian blogger.  And sometimes I feel like she has something against me personally.  And I know that's not possible.  She probably doesn't have a clue who I am.  But it's like.  everything she despises in the world is exactly what I'm doing with my life and who I am.  And everything she writes about that she thinks women like me should be doing is my worst nightmare.  So it's hard sometimes not to read her blog posts and take it as a personal attack.  And I know that's more of a me problem.  but it doesn't stop what she's writing and saying and promoting and teaching to others being incredibly problematic.  Sometimes it's flat out harmful.  Sometimes it's just a bit rude, but either way, I think it's important to kind of critically analyze the views that she puts forward and say, well, why is she saying this?  But also what are the consequences of her saying this to people?  How do we counteract this?  Is she wrong?  Why is she wrong?  what can we do or learn or what should we be doing or encouraging people to do instead.  Does that make sense?  I hope that does.  So my big issue with the transformed wife, with Laurie Alexander, is that she thinks there's only one way for people, women in particular, she focuses mostly on women, to live.  And if you don't do that, in her eyes, you can't really be happy.  I have other issues with Laurie, for example, her not recognising that trans women exist, her not recognising that non-binary people exist, the fact that she often just equates biology and gender, she thinks genitals equal gender, lots and lots of issues there, which is why I often mock her in my videos, like, when she says, oh, women can only do this, I often make a lot of jokes being like, oh, you're right, my vagina stops me building a cabinet, you know, that kind of thing.  So on the whole, when she talks about women, she only ever really addresses biological women, which is problematic in itself.  But also the views she puts forward for these women are incredibly problematic.  She thinks there's only this one way to live, only this one way to be happy.  And she shames people who live in any way different to what she thinks you should be.  She lacks this ability to understand that other people are different from her and that other people can have different needs and values and interests and wants in life.  In this respect, I think it might sound cruel, but it's fair to say that the average octopus is more neurologically advanced than Laurie Alexander.  In a recent blog post, which is the one I want to talk about today, Laurie completely ignores the fact that people are happy doing different things.  Different people find happiness in different ways by doing different things in life.  She completely ignores the fact that it should be up to you as an individual to figure out what you want and what makes you happy.  Instead, she decides to critique women like me who prefer having a career over having kids.  Let's take a look at this in a little more detail.  She writes that according to the Federalist article, significantly more Americans aged 13 to 22 say it's important to buy a home and make a lot of money than to marry, have children, and commit to a faith, according to a new late April study of 1,600 randomly chosen participants.  Laurie comments on this saying, how is it going for these women who made that decision to pursue higher education and careers instead of families during this lockdown?  Well, Laurie, since you're asking.  As one of those women with a degree who doesn't want kids, who is fully focused on my career, I literally ended a long-term relationship for many reasons, but one of them was that I felt he was holding me back a little in my career, in my life, in my opportunities.  Anyway, not the point.  The fact is I chose myself and my independence over relationship and I definitely don't ever want children.  So I'm one of these women and during lockdown, I have to say, Yeah, it's going pretty great, I love it.  Yeah, I mean, I get lonely sometimes, because I'm not able to like go out and see my friends, especially the moving house as well now.  It's been a crazy time, but on the whole, I found that I am more appreciative than ever of the fact that I live alone, that I don't have housemates, I don't live with family, you know, knowing I have to stay in all the time.  and be here really makes me appreciate my space, my independence.  Knowing that I'm not living on top of other people, I really appreciate it, I love it.  The fact that I went to university and I have a good enough job doing this to be able to afford such a beautiful flat that isn't extravagant or over the top, but it's comfortable and it's lovely and I like it and I'm very happy here.  Yeah, I completely think I made the right choice.  What do you mean?  that's not the answer you were looking for?  Laurie goes on to write, are they enjoying their fancy apartment or house, an expensive car, clothes and shoes while living alone?  Well, I don't have a car but all the rest.  Yes, absolutely.  Do all these things bring meaning into their lives?  Do they enjoy being entertained by social media all day and going to bed every night alone?  Just how fulfilling is the stuff that they have accumulated since they decided stuff is more important than relationships?  Because this is in fact what they have decided.  I think she misses the point here.  I don't accumulate stuff.  to make myself feel better or for some kind of like status thing or to impress anyone or because I think I should like.  I don't know.  I don't buy stuff because I think it's more important than people not at all.  and I buy things when I feel they're gonna enhance my life and they do you know and that's why I spend my money on things like books and art supplies and playstation games and makeup that I love.  they're all things I find incredibly fulfilling and that inspire me creatively and that I enjoy and that help me develop new skills and learn things.  Like, you know, I spend my days working a job that I adore, seriously, creating content that I care so deeply about and in my spare time I read books that open my mind to wonderful things.  I paint and I make scrapbooks and I create all kinds of wonderful things.  I feel constantly inspired.  I play games alone and with my friends online so even when I'm home alone I'm still able to socialise that way.  I walk my dog, I play with her, I cuddle her, we have an amazing life together.  I love taking photos and learning new things and I'm never just stuck and bored with nothing to do.  In fact I can't remember the last time I felt bored.  Laurie thinks living alone means you just spend your days staring at social media and that is not true at all.  Sure I have to use social media for my job and for work and it's a nice way to reach out to my friends who live literally all over the world.  I have friends in Australia, I have friends in America, I have friends who live down in London still, I have friends all over the country, I have friends everywhere and social media allows me to keep in touch and connect with them.  so it's an important part of my life.  But that's not my day.  I don't spend my days staring at social media and going to bed alone.  I spend my days having fun and doing things I enjoy and that I feel make me a better person and that allow me to give back to other people and learning new things and growing as a person.  I don't go to bed alone.  I have my little Karuri bear.  Not only going to bed alone is a bad thing at all, I love sleeping alone.  It's one of the things that I love about being single.  It's just like having the bed to myself and stretching out and setting my own schedule and just, oh my God, I love my space.  I really love my space.  And I mean, let's be honest, sharing the bed with Kyra is more than enough for anyone.  She constantly steals my pillow anyway.  Imagine if I had a dog and a man trying to steal my pillows.  Too much.  I'm kidding.  Kyra can steal my pillows anytime.  But the thing is, like, I'm talking about this.  And, like, I know this is just me, though.  This is just what I want to do with my life and what makes me happy.  I know there's a lot of people out there who wouldn't be happy with the life that I lead.  But equally, I wouldn't be happy in the lives that other people choose to lead.  I would be miserable if I was stuck in a relationship I didn't want, having children and popping out babies that I don't want.  The idea of forfeiting a job that I love this for one that is safe but boring sounds like hell to me.  And at this point in my life, the idea of being married at just 27 sounds terrifying and restrictive and I don't want it.  And the idea of ever having kids is literally my worst nightmare.  And all that is okay.  All that is exactly why I'm living the life that I want to.  and why other people are free to live the lives that they want to.  We're so lucky that we live in a society that, well, like when I say we, I mean like me and Laurie, you know, she's in America, I'm in the UK.  We're both incredibly lucky that as women, we're able to choose the lives we want.  We have this freedom.  We can decide whether we want kids or not, whether we get married or not.  We can decide whether we want to have a job or not, whether we want to have an education or not.  That freedom to choose is so important and we are so lucky because not everyone has that.  And it's not something that should be taken for granted.  Laurie goes on to write that, I've heard from many women during this lockdown that they now love being home full time.  They love being the one home with their children.  They love learning new things to do around their homes.  They love the unhurried pace of life.  They love not running here and there in their cars and being away from their children all day.  Many are even deciding to homeschool their children.  And to these women, I'm happy for them.  Seriously, why wouldn't I be?  I love seeing people living lives that make them happy and fulfilled.  I love seeing people that have figured out what's the best thing for them, what they want in life, and not being afraid to go for it.  Why would I be unhappy about that?  Why would I want to change that?  And that's the difference between me and Laurie.  The fact that Laurie can't see this is genuinely bizarre to me.  She repeats herself a lot in this blog post, and she says a lot of the same sentiments.  For example, she says, are all of these young women who have put family life on hold, maybe even indefinitely, finding out how empty their lives are now?  Are they seeing that maybe, just maybe, they passed up the best things in life and believe the lies told to them by culture?  Are they reconsidering the direction their lives have taken?  Is living alone with a bunch of stuff a good thing?  I can't help but feel at this point like she's trying to convince herself more than anyone else, to be honest.  My life is not empty, not in any way.  I'm not missing out on anything when I choose to be single and not have kids.  I'm not reconsidering the direction of my future, not even a little bit at this point.  And yes, living alone with a bunch of stuff is wonderful.  I don't understand why she can't believe this and understand this.  Is it because she doesn't want to?  Is it because she's not that happy herself and she doesn't want to think that anyone can be happier than she is?  Is it because she's scared to admit there's another, maybe a better way to live?  I don't know.  I can't help but feel sorry for Lori.  It feels like a lot of her posts are written because she's unhappy with her life and she's trying to convince herself that she's not.  Maybe she's trying to convince herself that everyone else must be more unhappy than she is because that makes her feel better.  I don't know, I do feel sorry for her.  And I kind of wish I could help her, but Understanding where she's coming from does not excuse the years she spent belittling and shaming other people, mostly women.  I also just want to point out that even though she said this wasn't the point of her post, Laurie must be making people who want kids and families who can't have them or who like haven't found the right person yet, must be making them feel so awful.  And that's not a nice thing to do, is it?  Like, I have friends who are at this point, like, worried about where they are in their life.  They're worried about, like, time running out.  They're worried about being single or not being with the right person.  They're worried about, you know, when or if they can have kids.  And, you know, they, like, they know they want a family, but they don't.  have someone to have that family with right now, and it worries them.  And I can't imagine what a blog post like this would make them feel like.  It would just put so much unnecessary strain and pressure on them, and it's awful.  I mean, with my friends like that, when they try and talk to me about that sort of stuff, I try and tell them that, you know, it's okay to pursue that goal of wanting marriage and kids and stuff like that, and that they should go for it if they think it's gonna make them happy, but also, like, if it doesn't happen for whatever reason, still know that they're wonderful and amazing people with full incredible lives.  Does that make sense?  Basically what I'm saying is I think Laurie would make a lot of my friends feel really crappy and that really upsets me and it's not fair.  Laurie's posts would make someone who's already feeling insecure about this stuff feel even worse is what I'm trying to say.  So she ends this blog post by writing, I grew up without a lot.  My family didn't have a lot of money.  Didn't have much of anything.  I have, at times in my life, worked two jobs just to buy food and, you know, get by.  I've lived with having nothing and I've lived with being, while not rich, at least financially stable.  And I don't think I need to tell you which of those situations made me feel happier and less stressed and more fulfilled.  I will take financially stable and comfortable over scraping by any day.  I do actually kind of disagree with this, though, that families aren't always the ones that come through when you're in need.  People do, and having these good relationships, having these amazing networks of friends and people you can rely on and trust and who will support you and who you'll support is incredibly important.  Surrounding yourself with good people is important, but those people don't have to be family in terms of being blood relatives.  You don't have to have kids to have that kind of network of amazing people around you.  You don't need to have a partner to support you if you've got amazing wonderful friends.  I know Laurie wouldn't believe me saying this but I honestly think that me choosing the path that I have in life doing this and this job and everything has already given me more opportunity to help more people in bigger ways than having kids ever could have.  I mean my videos have been watched by literally like millions of people.  I've been involved in raising money for tons of charities like Secular Rescue and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and Cat for Kids.  And as a community, I feel like we've fostered a place where people hopefully feel safe and accepted and loved and cared for.  And that, you know, people can get through tough times in their lives and will be here for each other.  Through doing this job and through not having kids, I've been able to adopt this little one.  Yep.  And she was five years old.  Oh, you have a lipstick kiss on your head.  Oh, pico.  The flexibility I have in my working hours and working for myself and stuff means I have more time for my friends and family to help them with their work and their creative projects and help them through tough times if they're ill or struggling or sad or whatever, you know?  I mean I don't know where I'm gonna be in 5 or 10 or 20 years but I'm pretty sure I won't be a stay-at-home mum and I'm happy about that.  I'm so grateful for that.  I have absolutely no regrets about this path I've chosen to go down in life and I just hope that one day Laurie and people like her can understand that and appreciate that and accept that and not feel the need to shame people who are just doing something a little bit different to them, you know?  And I guess I just want to end this video by extending a little message to anyone who does feel scared or worried by Laurie's message and her teachings and whatever, you know, and that is just simply don't be scared.  You know you better than anyone else ever has or ever will.  You know what's gonna make you happy and what's not gonna make you happy and you shouldn't ever be afraid to just go for that.  It's okay to try out different things and see what makes you happy and it's okay to try something and hate it and start over.  It's okay to change your mind and take your time figuring things out.  It's okay to not know what you want yet.  It's okay to say I don't know or I'm still figuring things out but it's important to remember that there is more than one way to live your life and Not everyone is going to be happy in the same way, doing the same things, and that's okay.  As long as you are happy, that's what's important.  And I guess with that, that's where I'm going to end this today.  Thank you for watching.  Please let me know down in the comments what you thought of Laurie's blog post and what you think of her weird shaming people for caring more about making money than family, for caring more about jobs than babies and blah, blah, blah.  But carry on, baby.  Ciao.  making her bed like a little jumping bean, aren't you?  I love you.  So please let me know your comments down below.  Thank you for all your support and love and kindness.  And hopefully I'll see you guys again very, very, very soon.  Bye. ",
