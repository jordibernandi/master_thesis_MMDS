            "text": "Hey, yo, what it do, YouTube?  Drop Down TV.  Before I get this video started, I want to give a special shout out.  I met a couple of white, I mean, I ain't meet nobody.  I guess they met me from uploading these videos on Grandmaster J, but I got a couple of white boys out in Nebraska that always want to shoot me these emails every day.  I mean, on how idiotic this movement seem.  I mean, I understand y'all, y'all don't suppose to feel me.  I mean, I understand y'all shooting me emails talking about how much of a coon y'all are.  I mean, that's understandable coming from y'all.  I expect that.  What I don't expect is where is the hate coming in at amongst our own people?  Prime example, I was watching a video.  Tariq Nasheed went in on Meachie.  I mean, I'm not saying you're supposed to agree with it.  And shout out to Meachie because I listen to Meachie.  I mean, shout out to Meachie.  But at the end of the day, right about now, and then I understand Tyreek going to say, I mean, it goes deep in the rap with them.  I mean, it go back, I think this shit stemmed back about eight, nine months ago with them.  But at the end of the day, I don't think this is the time.  I mean, I can understand the hate coming from white people.  But under the same breath of hate coming from white people, man, I get the same hate coming in my inbox from brothers and sisters And there's more, not even sisters.  This is what makes it crazy.  It's the dudes.  It's like 2020 turned some of our strongest men to the most moistest dudes, man.  I mean, come on, man.  At the end of the day, I don't know if it's hatred towards Grandmaster J. Because if you know this dude, fan base is strong with women.  I mean, women feel this dude.  And I guess that's where the hatred comes with a lot of dudes.  It's because I feel y'all can't Make a powerful movement enough for your own.  So what you gonna do?  Hate on what this man do?  Can't hate on what that man do, yo.  I respect what that man do.  Shout out to Grandmaster J, man.  I respect that man, yo.  I mean, granted, this dude do things that 99 point, probably 5% of niggas won't even do.  So how can you shoot this dude down when y'all not even putting forth half the effort this man is doing?  I mean, no disrespect to Tyreek Nasheed.  No disrespect to Tyreek.  But, I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, like he said, man, Tyreek ain't out here on the front.  I mean, he's not saying he ain't on the front lines, but he ain't out here.  And the thing with him, because I saw a video with him, too.  And no disrespect to you, B. This ain't the time for disrespect.  I feel like if we're going to disrespect each other, wait until this movement is over.  Then we can get back to regular scheduled programming.  But until we get this situation of men's that we're going through right now, I feel like we don't have time for bickering back and forth.  And that's just my personal opinion.  You feel what I'm saying?  And especially don't go so hard on females, man.  I mean, directed towards Tyreek.  I mean, I just don't like the fact you go so hard towards females.  And granted, it ain't like she took it easy with you either.  But at the end of the day, we got to come to something outside of beefing with each other all day, yo.  That beefing shit ain't getting us nowhere.  It ain't getting us nowhere.  I mean, as far as the dudes were hating on Grandmaster Jay, let that, come on, man, you ain't got to agree with everything that man say.  I don't agree with everything that man say, but I agree with his movement.  I agree with what he stand for.  Why not?  I'm pretty sure it's a lot of things that we done tried out here since the beginning of time, and that shit is not working.  It's not working.  Let's see if we gonna make this work, B. Let's see if we can make this work.  If not, then try something different, but don't shoot it down.  Don't knock it.  You ever heard this tribute?  You ever heard?  they always say don't knock shit till you try?  Let's see what happens.  I stand strong behind my door.  You feel what I'm saying?  Wish I could have went out there this weekend, to be honest with you.  Let them come somewhere where I feel my funds will get me there.  And guess what, people?  I'm there.  That's just me.  I'm there.  I'm not going to sit and tell people to do something that I'm not even going to stand by myself.  At the end of the day, I will be there.  And I wish more people show up.  Well, I hope a lot of more people show up than expected.  But I know how black people are.  We do a lot of hating.  We hate amongst each other.  See what I'm saying?  That's why we can't get off the rivers, because we hate on each other.  We won't go nowhere because of the hate.  We can't get past another person having more attention than what you feel needs to be put upon yourself.  And I feel that's going to be our downfall.  Got to understand, maybe this dude ain't chose his path.  Maybe it was, I mean, maybe this path wasn't given to him.  Maybe somebody blessed him with the ability to, got to understand something.  Like I said, from the beginning of time, man, everybody wasn't made to travel certain paths, man.  You feel me?  I don't feel no kind of way about it.  I know this world is full of cat woolly ass men.  I understand that and I respect that.  But I just feel at the end of the day, These platforms that a lot of us have, and my channel ain't even that big, but I just feel like a lot of these channels that got a voice and all that, yo, we don't need to be harboring back and forth right about now.  I mean, we got plenty of time once we. ",
