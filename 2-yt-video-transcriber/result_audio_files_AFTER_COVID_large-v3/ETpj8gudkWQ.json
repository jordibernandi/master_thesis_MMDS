            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you.  TheMorganReport.com.  Friday, the 7th of August, 2020.  Well, let's start with the stock market where I usually like to.  And as most that follow the market knows, I'm talking U.S.  markets here, that the techs have been the leader in the market from the March washout.  And we have seen... the utilities and the industrials start to do well of late and getting some rotation.  And the other one I think is very interesting is that FedEx and UPS are just killing it.  And that's to be expected with what's going on with the pandemic situation where they're getting a lot more deliveries, people are staying home and B2B or business to business or business to individual is ramping up.  And of course, the FedEx hit a new all time high.  So that's a place to be.  And that will probably continue as the shutdown situation is still in force in a lot of areas.  So I just thought I'd bring that to everyone's attention.  There's always opportunities in the stock market.  You just need to know where to look and sometimes it's kind of right in front of you.  So let me pause there and start talking about the headlines for the week and then move into the metals.  First up from CNBC, most South Asian economies will struggle to grow even if some saw success in containing the virus.  This has many vectors off of it.  One that I've done when I interviewed ADAPT 2030, David Dubine, about the coming food crisis, which I've been harping on now for weeks and weeks.  What I'd like to point out, and this is a repeat to some of you that follow my work avidly, is that the  U.S.,  uses about 5% of their disposable income to eat for food.  But in the Asian countries, a lot of them are 30 or 40%.  So if food prices double across the board, that would mean 10% of your income in the U.S.  would be required to feed yourself or your family.  Whereas in Asia, it'd go from like 30% to 60%.  So there's a lot, like I said, of vectors besides food here, but I just wanted to point that out.  You can read the article.  Let me move on to the next.  You can choose almost any airline you wish and bring them up and... A search engine.  This happens to be Virgin.  This is from the International Business Times.  Virgin Australia Airlines cuts 3,000 jobs, reduces size of fleet, and discontinues the Tiger Air brand.  I mean, this is throughout the entire sector.  The airlines, in my view, will probably never come back to the 2019 level, or at least not for a very long time.  Let me touch on energy.  I like to do it at least once a month, if not more often.  It is so critical to all of us.  And this is from oilprice.com, which I often quote.  Exxon says 20% of global oil and gas reserves may be wiped out after a grim second quarter for big oil.  The world's third most valuable energy company is warning that 20% of the world's oil and gas reserves may no longer be viable, according to Bloomberg.  Now, remember, this is economic oil that we're talking about.  So price could influence that percentage.  Exxon recorded its worst quarterly loss in modern history in the second quarter of this year, booking a loss of $1.1 billion.  Exxon has been demoted from the world's second most valuable energy company last month as Reliance Industries unseated the supermajor from its long-held position.  So watch the oil market, watch the bond market, watch all markets, but bonds are king and oil is the king of the commodities.  This week, when I talk about food, I'm going to take a different tact from what I've already stated.  And this is from phys.org.  Research reveals microplastic content levels in seafood.  Levels of plastic contamination has been found in samples of popular seafood, such as prawns, oysters, and crabs, with the highest content found in sardines, according to the University of Queensland's research.  We found polyvinyl chloride, a widely used synthetic plastic polymer, in all samples we tested.  But the most common plastic in use today, polyurethane, was the highest concentrate we found.  From the edible marine species tested, sardines had the highest plastic content.  And you can read the rest of the article.  It's very short and I've really given you all of it that you need.  But this is something that I became aware of some time ago.  I just haven't voiced it on this platform.  My perspective is we're basically killing ourselves in subtle ways.  No one really looking at a nice fish dinner thinks too much about.  they're eating plastic, but you are.  So another thing about the situation we find ourselves in is thought I bring to everyone's attention, something to contemplate.  And someone I bring up often and admire, maybe I'll get to meet him, but Charles Hugh Smith of twominds.com.  If the market never goes down, the system is doomed.  Markets that never go down aren't markets.  They're signaling mechanisms of the powers that be.  Markets are fundamentally clearing houses of information on price, demand, sentiment, expectations, and so on.  Factual data on supply and demand, shipping costs, cost of credit.  and reflections of trader and consumer emotions and psychology.  If markets are never allowed to go down, the information clearinghouse has been effectively shut down.  Whenever information leaks out or has been edited to fit the prevailing narrative, which in this moment is, quote unquote, central banks will never let markets go down ever again.  So jump in and ride the guaranteed bull to easy gains.  The past 12 years offer ample evidence of this narrative.  Every dip draws a near instantaneous monetary policy response that reverses the dip and gooses the markets higher.  Definitely worth your time.  Almost anything he writes is well worth the read and contemplation.  Okay, this week I'm going to spend a little more time on the precious metals.  First of all, the biggest question I've been receiving over the last several days is, is it too late to buy gold?  Is it too late to buy silver?  And the answer is no.  And the proof is here.  You're looking at an inflation adjusted gold chart.  So what we've done is taken out the lie of inflation and One of my most often stated sentences is that you can't get something for nothing.  Fiat always fails.  And that we really don't know the true price of anything.  when it's the money supply or call it the currency supply is continually increased.  So if you take the lie of inflation out and you go back to the 1980 peak, and this is using government statistics to determine the CPI or the inflation rate, you would have roughly $2,400 gold.  And right now we're sitting at $2,000 in 2020.  This goes to 2010, but you get the idea.  We've come up.  So the price really adjusted to right now is actually $2,700.  So I'll make that clear.  Someone's going to say, wait, I did the inflation calculation.  David, you're wrong.  It's not $2,400.  It's $2,750 gold.  But the idea is, so we haven't really, 2000 is a nominal number that's higher than 850 number in 1980.  But again, if we take out the inflation lie, you've got to be up to 2750 to be equal to the previous high.  And again, that's using government statistics.  So if you use shadowstats.com, John Williams' website, and you do the inflation based on the way inflation was calculated in 1980, before they took out energy and food, the two things humans need most to survive, Then you will get a much, much higher number.  And I like to, I don't like to jump in the middle of everything, but I like to be conservative.  So if we took John's number and this number and kind of took the difference, you're probably looking at like four or 5,000.  And I think that's achievable.  Bank of America's talking 3,000 and they're not talking 3,000 in 10 years.  They're talking about 3,000 fairly soon.  So we do have a long ways to go, 2,000 to 3,000.  Well, that's only 33%, 34%, David.  And that's right.  Warren Buffett became a multi-billionaire compounding at 20% a year.  A lot of people don't take the average.  They add up and down years.  But if you look at the average, it's around 20% compounded.  So we're looking at... opportunity here especially to get a sizable pullback to what gold will look like going forward.  and of course there aren't going to be too many places to go as this system starts to unravel further with more stresses with unemployment supply chain breakdown food prices increasing people that were in homes and apartments that no longer can afford them and on and on it goes.  i hate to sound like mr doom but uh the reality is that hard times are here and they are probably going to be here for a while.  just picked another real quick inflation adjusted chart for silver and this one i think is even more impressive than the gold one and this goes to 2017. so it's um Not right up to date, but you can see where we're at.  And this, of course, is based on the shadow stats statistics.  So it's contrasting the one I showed you.  It's based on the CPI, and it's a silver chart, not a gold chart.  But you can just eyeball this.  That number is $600, by the way, which those that are familiar with Cliff High's work on the WebBot, he has talked about $600 silver, and it seems preposterous.  But if you use... The CPI 1980 formula from the 1980 high of $50, and you adjust it according to the way we calculated inflation, where we did include food and energy, you would have $600 silver.  I know that sounds absurd to those listening, even some of the silver bugs out there that are rabid silver bulls.  uh but you never know where it's gonna go.  i mean when i started investing at 16 i mean the thousand dollar level for the dow was like a ceiling.  it was never gonna get above a thousand.  now you know 24 25 000 i mean.  so i'm not saying it's getting to 600. what i am saying is that on a relative basis when the inflation lie is taken out of these charts and you get a really good solid look at them.  We have a long ways to go in the metals, and no, it's not too late to buy them.  Does that mean you sell everything and buy precious metals?  No, no.  How much is right?  Well, that's not an answer that's easy to give.  I have said publicly for years, 10%.  Maybe under these kind of financial stresses, 20%.  You start getting above that, most people can't handle the stress that's involved with the most volatile sector in all of finance, the precious metals.  Nothing moves with the volatility that the metals do, especially when they're moving either up or down.  They have very low volatility, obviously, when they're sideways, which silver tends to do for great lengths of time.  And then once it catches fire, it usually rockets up.  So that's it for this week.  David Morgan of themorganreport.com.  And I do want to finish off with one thing.  I did write an article, and I actually think I verbalized some of it recently, but I just want to finish off.  First of all, I want to sign off with.  there's nothing more powerful than the truth, but I just want to read a couple paragraphs of a recent public article that was published in a magazine called Executive Global.  And coming in near the end here, I talk about silver from the symbolic perspective.  To come back to early symbolism, silver, the color, means truth by some biblical scholars' accounts.  The silver medal is very closely associated in the scriptures with the subject of redemption.  Trumpets are closely related to the topic of redemption in the gospel.  In Hinduism, silver embodies spiritual enlightenment, eloquence, and encouragement.  Is it time to rethink silver?  The financial definition of redemption is paying off a mortgage, paying off a bond, or paying off a note.  Hmm.  And how would one pay off these items that are largely created out of nothing by a Babylonian banking system, fraction reserve lending?  From a natural law perspective, redemption can mean saved from sin, error, or evil.  At the risk of getting too close to the proverbial hot button for almost everyone, let me ask the undercurrent circumstances.  Isn't it time to redeem the monetary system and perhaps ourselves?  Is it time to rethink silver and what meaning it has for you?  That's it for this week.  I'll be back with you next week with another Weekly Perspective. ",
