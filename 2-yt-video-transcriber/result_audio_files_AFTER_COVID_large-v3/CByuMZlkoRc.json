And so, you know, he's expecting everybody to show up.  and the garment he provided and this guy shows up in his own duds, so to speak.  And so as we relate that in the spiritual realm, I believe it relates to salvation and that God has provided a salvation and he wants us to show up dressed in his righteousness, but a lot of people are trying to come in their own clothes, and there's gonna be somebody standing at the door saying, you can't get in, man.

Of course, God will receive me.  And Hebrews 12, 14, I'll take it a slightly different way.  It says that without holiness, it says that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.  Hebrews 12, 14.  And God has already provided a way.  Mm-hmm.  And everybody wants to do things their own way.  We talked about this in another segment where our culture is saying there's no absolute truth and there's this, that, and the other, and wants to get to God in their own way.  And God's saying, no, that doesn't work.  What you've got to do is you've got to do things my way.  I provided a way for you to become holy.  You can't do it on your own.  My son died on the cross for you.  And now if you accept that, then you're welcome to the wedding feast. ",

            "text": "It's such a powerful passage of scripture in Matthew 22.  There's so much involved in it.  One of the things I think is really neat that everyone was invited.  Everyone was prepared for.  Everyone was given the opportunity to receive what they needed.  And I love the fact that when the time was right, they all had to come to the door.  Jesus said that I'm the door.  And the only problem is, is that the apparel that you have, you know, we talked about this before too, about, well, what if I have a fight with my wife and then I get hit by a car, do I die?  And so now what we know, we've turned salvation into conduct rather than character.  So your go to heaven, not based upon your conduct, your works, but based upon your nature or your character, who you are in Christ.  And so I believe that that wedding garment is symbolic of who we have become by receiving Christ Jesus, our righteousness now within him.  And these people that showed up and who, I don't know who said it, his duds.  That was somebody, that's why he said, bind them, throw them away.  He said, friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?  He was speechless.  Why?  Because everything was completely provided.  And how dare you show up and say, I can just come, as you said, any old way and God will accept me when it's all been provided for.  And it was an insult.  And so we said to them at the door, G said, I'm the door.  No man cometh in.  At the door, he says, depart.  He said, bind him hand and foot and throw him into utter darkness and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ",

People are hearing it and he's preparing the wedding and he's got, I couldn't imagine showing up to there knowing I have an invite.  Had everything given to me, but can't come in because of that, because they made light of it, went their way.  and just went to their own business and then tried to show up any old way.

Well, I spent the first 20 years of my life believing that I could be good enough, that I could work hard enough because I'd achieved other things.  And it was because of hard work.  And I translated that into my theology.  And I was a good moral young man in a very turbulent time.  I was a good moral young man.  I didn't drink.  I didn't smoke.  I didn't chew tobacco.  I didn't take drugs.  I wasn't a womanizer.  And I didn't hang around with people who did.  But praise be to God, the truth of Ephesians 2, 8 and 9, for by grace have you been saved through faith and that not of yourselves.  It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.  Has been a blessing to me now for the last 44 years.  And God has just been using this lately, or I should say, I'm realizing that God is using that not only as my salvation verse, but but now is my sustaining verse.  That every one of these blessings that God is bringing into your life is the gift of God and not of works, lest any man should boast.  Gentlemen, thank you for being with us on the program today.
