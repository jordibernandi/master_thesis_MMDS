            "text": "Special greeting to everybody today.  It's me, Pastor Carter Conlon, here in New York City again.  Just coming to you online to give encouragement to your heart.  We're all living in a very fearful time.  You know that and I know that.  But I want to tell you why I'm not afraid.  And this is not just bravado on my part.  It's really a reality.  I'm not afraid of the days I'm living in.  I'm not afraid of tomorrow.  I'm not afraid of the coronavirus.  I'm not afraid of anything that the future is going to bring my way.  Let me tell you why.  I'm going to read it to you from Psalm 46 in the Old Testament.  This is what the Psalmist says, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  If you have a living relationship with God through His Son, Jesus Christ, the promise to you that He's a refuge to you, that means a place of safety in your heart, your mind, a security that only God can give, an eternal security.  actually, that's what the Bible promises to those who believe in Christ.  Not just a refuge, but He's a strength.  He gives power when you don't have any.  He gives sound thinking when your own thinking would want to trail off into fear.  And he's a very present help in trouble.  I thank God that he's with me every day, all day.  He's with me when I get up.  He's with me when I go through my day.  He's with me when my day comes to an end.  The promise of Christ is that you and I are sealed in the hand of God his Father.  And Jesus himself said, nobody can take you out of my Father's hand.  You're safe, my brother and my sister.  You're safe in the hand of God.  Even if this world shakes, as the psalmist said, if the seas begin to roar, if societies begin to collapse and crumble, there is a strength in God that cannot be taken away from you.  He promises it to you.  And it will give you a confidence even in the midst of the storm.  that the same Jesus who told the sea to be quiet and the waves to stop their roaring and the wind to stop blowing will speak into your spirit and into your mind.  And he will say, have confidence, have faith in God.  I will not forsake you.  I will not leave you.  I thank God for that.  You see, my days are in the hands of God.  I know that.  The Bible tells me that.  He knows the day that my heart beat its first beat.  He already foreknew the day it would beat its last.  So until the day that He takes me home, my life is in His hands.  And as I said earlier, no one can take you out of the hand of God.  So let Him become your confidence today.  The book of Hebrews says, when you come into these times of trouble and trial, don't throw away your confidence.  Hold to that confidence, hold to the promises of God, and you watch the peace that God will give you.  As a matter of fact, the Apostle Peter said, be ready to give every person an answer who asks for a reason for the hope that you have in your heart.  And when everyone around is losing heart and losing hope, God has a people.  Our confidence is secure.  Our hearts are strong.  Our focus is on things that are eternal.  And by the grace of God, you and I will make a difference in our generation.  Take courage.  Take courage.  Some rough days are ahead, but the one who can calm the wind still lives inside of us.  Love you.  Thank God for you.  Stay tuned.  We have a lot of things coming up in the future.  God bless you. ",
