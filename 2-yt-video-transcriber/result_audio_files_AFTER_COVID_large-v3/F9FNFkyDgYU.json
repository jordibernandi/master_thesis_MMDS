            "text": "You know, the Senate Republicans on the Intelligence Committee oversaw this three-year inquiry into the collusion.  It used to be called alleged collusion.  Now we can simply call it collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.  Trump's foreign policy advisor lied under oath about this.  and has been busted.  His national security advisor lied under oath about it and was sentenced to jail for it.  His campaign chairman lied under oath about this and was sent to prison for it.  Trump's deputy campaign chairman lied under oath for this and was convicted of it.  Trump's personal lawyer lied under oath about his contacts with Russia and went to prison for it.  His political consultant lied under oath about contacts with Russians.  His attorney general has repeatedly lied under oath before Congress, which is under oath.  And of course, the Republicans in their summary said that Donald Trump lied about it to Congress and to federal investigators.  I mean, that's some amazing Russia hoax, right?  It's looking increasingly like the Senate intelligence report.  And yesterday I just kind of brushed over it, in part because I was reading the initial news stories, which had been pre-spun by Republicans.  It's interesting that, you know, the Republicans on the Senate committee let this thing come out.  But, you know, some of these members like Tom Cotton are already trying to minimize it.  But, you know, there it is.  right that this this is actually what happened.  they in the senate report uh... mentions and this is the interesting thing between this and back uh... prior to adam schiff taking over the intelligence committee in the house it was devon nunes and so the republicans in the house.  they did a report on russian interference in the election and collaboration collusion with the trump campaign.  uh... they did that report while devon nunes was still running the house And the Senate took more time.  They took three and a half years to do their report, or three years.  And theirs just came out yesterday.  The Senate report mentions Konstantin Kalimnik, who is a Russian oligarch, a relatively young man, actually, who's also, according to the Senate report, almost certainly an intelligence operative or agent or asset of the Russian government.  The Senate report mentioned Konstantin Kalimnik 819 times.  He's the guy that Paul Manafort was delivering internal secret Republican polling data to in the last months of the campaign.  He was delivering it to Kalimnick, and Kalimnick was, you know, apparently, or the implication of this was passing it along to whoever was coordinating the social media campaigns to say, hey, we've got to get up in Wisconsin a point and a half, and hey, we've got to get another 300 people in Illinois or whatever it may be.  The House report that Devin Nunes did does not mention Kalimnick once.  I find that remarkable.  The Senate committee says that Paul Manafort is, quote, a grave counterintelligence threat who had worked with Russian operatives before the election as well.  Marco Rubio this morning said, we found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling.  So all this stuff is apparently real and apparently going on and stuff that we need to be talking about. ",
