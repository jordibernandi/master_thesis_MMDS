Misunderstood, we've been wounded and beat.  Traumatized from the stuff we had to do in the streets.  But what you expect after everything that was done?  They gave drugs to our parents.  Of course, they damaged their sons.  They told us we was inferior ever since we was young.  And that system said we wouldn't make it past 21.  Subjugation in this wicked nation.  The gates of hell won't prevail even with the eyes we facing.  The God that we serve bringing down their devastation.  That's why all my real saints gonna have patience.  You've already known.  already already Tenfold, it's a disturbance inside the matrix.  My kinfolk, the most high servants, finally awakened.  Our MO, reclaiming the heritage that was taken.  What you didn't know, we bringing honor back to the nation.  My ancestors' memories give me energy.  Every time I speak, I speak the truth in these similes.  I've seen people stand up against the enemy and watch their character get assassinated like entity to infinity and beyond the projects.  We were sent to the hood to refine your mindset, but they coming up in opposition against the one that was heaven sent.  I guess they did like.  they met us in subjugation in this wicked nation.  The gates of hell won't prevail even with the eyes we facing.  The God that we serve bringing down ain't devastation.  That's why all the real saints gonna have patience.  We already know. ",

Sweet words to the cheek, them kisses jaded just like the locks.  Taking over blocks, green lights, we are nonstop.  I tried to be a devil, got converted like drop tops.  If keys open doors like some dancers, we pop locks.  The Israelites is everywhere.  They know we a hot topic, I'm saying.  We make more change than counting 100 pennies.  Just someone who made a milli off selling his soul for dough.  We ain't niggas no more.  Don't use hands no more.  Rather the Bible to slap out all of that.  idol worship and devil courtship.  Ain't a game.  I don't need sportsmanship.  Especially after how you tortured us.  Damn.  This is the end of the road for you.  Kingdom coming down.  Forever smoke.  It's beautiful. ",
