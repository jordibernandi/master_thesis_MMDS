When I tell my story about being in the class at the church that would go on to become progressive, this was a theme that was pretty consistent.  And this is number 16.  And according to this progressive Christian platform, Christians should worship the true Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  not father, son, Holy Bible.  So what do you think about that one? ",

            "text": "Yeah, because I've often heard, too, the phrase, and I'm sure you've heard this, the phrase bibliolatry.  Like, in some way, we've made the Bible into some kind of an idol that we're worshiping in place of of the Holy Spirit or one of the members of the Trinity or that we've made the Bible the fourth member of the Trinity or something along those lines.  And I was always, always so confused by this claim when it would come about because that was my first thought.  Well, I don't worship the Bible, but that's where I get information, primary and authoritative information about God.  And honestly, if this claim is true, of us, then it's true of Jesus too, because we have Jesus, like you mentioned, saying the scriptures cannot be broken.  We have Jesus calling the Old Testament scriptures the word of God dozens of times.  This is the weapon he actually used to fight the temptation in the wilderness when the enemy was coming to him to try to get him to sin, his weapon against that was to quote scripture and to say, it is written.  And John Wenham, a great Bible scholar who wrote a book about Christ in the Bible and what Jesus' view of the Bible was, even said, when Jesus says, it is written, it's the equivalent of him saying, this is God's word.  This is inspired by God.  And he was using that in a very active way.  And so I was always so confused by that charge because I mean, it's not like I'm looking at my Bible singing worship songs to my Bible or singing the praises of my Bible.  I'm mining the truth out of there, like you said, because it is God's word to us and we should take it extremely seriously.  But again, I think it's this false dichotomy and a bit of a straw.  I know we use the word straw man so much, but it really is because I don't know any Christians that... would, A, agree that they're worshiping the Bible, and B, doing anything that would lead many to think that they actually are doing that.

So your pastor says something like, you know, Muslims worship and love God, you know, they don't need, you know, they're going to go to heaven, basically.  And then you go to him and you say, but pastor, it says here that no one can come except through Jesus and that the death and resurrection of Christ are essential and Muslims deny the death and the resurrection.  And then the pastor looks at you and says, you know, is it Father, Son, and Holy Bible?  The context of those conversations is always I have teaching that disagrees with Scripture. ",
