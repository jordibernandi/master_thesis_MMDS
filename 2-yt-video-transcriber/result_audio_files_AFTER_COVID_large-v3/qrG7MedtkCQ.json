            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with themorganreport.com with the weekly perspective for the week ending 28 August 2020.  Well, I want to start off with the silver chart here.  This came out in Forbes magazine after Warren Buffett bought silver, 130 million ounces off the COMEX around 1999.  This is a truth chart.  It is the price of silver in 1998 dollars, which I realize was 22 years ago.  But it's a constant dollar chart at that time.  So what you see is on an inflation adjusted basis, the inflation lie is taken out of this chart and Buffett bought down here where my cursor is, which is the all-time inflation adjusted low at that time.  Now, what I want to point out on this chart is that if you go to the all-time high, it's $1,477.  And that corresponds approximately to, good drawing there, let's say $1,470.  Now, you can also take a price in a long range like here, which is roughly, oh, I'm just going to guess, what is that, 170 an ounce?  And that, you know, varies between like 170 and 200.  Between what timeframe?  1604, I'm going to just make these up, you get the idea, and what, 1784.  Then we drop down into this range here, which as you can see from over here is probably 70 an ounce.  Remember, this is inflation adjusted prices.  So 70 here equals 70 here, 400 here equals 400 over here.  In other words, in the time scale, it's an accurate representation of the true price.  So it wasn't until, you know, our friends here in the 1873 range where you saw silver come way down after it was demonetized, We saw a spike when the Hunts bought silver for monetary reasons.  And then it fell off quite a bit to 1999, 2000, 2003, really.  And that's when Buffett bought low.  The reason I brought this up is for people to see that buying silver at, and this is 1998 dollars, but we'll pretend that they're the same value as they are in 2020 and they're not.  But let's just say, Um, that they are.  Okay.  So what we would do is if we're buying at $30 silver, which is right here, then we have the potential to go to where?  And the answer is no one knows.  I've said a hundred and 2003, many of my, I'd say more conservative, uh, peers are saying 200, which, you know, I could see that in constant dollars.  Right.  And then, you know, even higher.  But the point I'm making is very simple.  Is it too late to buy silver?  And the answer is no, it is not.  Not by a long, long ways.  So now that I've tried to make a case for silver being undervalued on a historical basis, I want to talk about the debt bomb.  This is Exeter's upside down pyramid.  It goes, as you can see with the red line here, from higher risk of default to lower risk of default.  Many of my peers say that gold is the only asset that is not simultaneously someone's liability.  That really isn't true.  It is that, but so is silver.  So it'd be platinum or palladium.  Actually, a lumber contract that was in a lumber yard or somebody's backyard fully paid for as an asset that isn't someone's liability.  So any worthwhile asset or commodity that's fully paid for doesn't have any encumbrances against.  it is a real asset or something of value.  Anyway, In the monetary realm, gold is the only asset that is simultaneously someone's liability.  Well, silver applies as well.  So let me get on with this.  We can see the biggest problem, as we all know, is derivatives.  And under there, these are the least liquid.  Next area that is illiquid is, of course, private businesses.  They're hard to sell.  Real estate, sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's not.  Corporate and uni bonds, securitized debt, stock markets are pretty liquid.  Government bonds and T-bills, very liquid.  Paper money, there's nothing better than that, purportedly, as people don't understand the true nature of the system.  And finally, gold.  And if you really want to get specific, you could actually put silver at the tip here.  When we zero in on that, we see what the value is of gold and the value of silver.  Silver is that little bitty tip of the pyramid, and it's got a lot of room to move as far as value is concerned.  So as we move down extras pyramid, which we're doing, you'll see a point where the smart money moves away from cash and into gold.  And that's taking place.  The reason we know it's taking place is because of what's happening in the main vaults that have good deliverable bars, which is the London bullion, LBMA, and the Chicago Mercantile or the COMEX.  And what we find, and thank you, Roland Manley from Bullion Star and my friend Jan, I want to say that he goes into this, and I want everyone to read it this weekend, about the fact that very recently, both the LBMA and the COMEX have approved 267 gold bar and silver bar brands.  In other words, they had a very limited amount of refiners that they would accept as good delivery bars.  Less than 10.  And now, what they're saying is... anyone basically that produces gold in a hundred ounce and silver in a thousand ounce bar form.  And even 400, as we know is we'll take it more or less.  I mean, there's not a lot of accreditation done here to approve that many different refiners coming in to the Comex or the LBMA.  I'm just going to read part of this.  Silver panic under the radar.  An even bigger bombshell arguably is that CME and LBMA actions are now signaling panic about future physical silver delivery.  Turning to the Silver Futures worksheet, we find on 27 July, the Comax eligible silver refiner brand list, which until then had listed 75 bar refiner brands, has also hugely expanded.  So I said 10.  I was thinking gold, and it might have been bigger, but there's the fact, so I can back up and say I was wrong on that, but you get the idea.  65 LBMA silver refiners have been added to the eligible brand list.  These 65 additional refinery brands are listed directly under the existing refiner list with a subheading added as of 27 July.  There were 75 prior to the 27 July.  There are now 140 current brands on the current SI Silver refiner list.  Of the 65 refiner brands added, the top three countries represented are 26 refineries from China, 11 from Japan, and 5 from Russia.  An additional 40 silver bar brands from the LBMA former good delivery list for silver have also been added to the silver brands tab as a separate list beside and to the right of the first list.  In total, 105 LBMA silver bar brands were added by COMEX on 27 July, taking the COMEX silver list to an additional 180 eligible silver bar brands.  That's an increase of 140%.  And this is absolutely not worth worthy.  In summary, on the 27th of July, the gold 100 ounce contract and the silver contractor refiner lists have been greatly expanded and you can get the details on this.  This is a new normal.  It shows how much silver has gone from place to place.  And it is appearing as though the whole physical market is tightening up to a degree that many of us, myself included, have talked about for years.  But perhaps the day has arrived.  And finally, I just want to talk a little bit about the warehouses, Comex warehouses, also known as the vaults.  this is very recent.  i pulled this up yesterday so the total amount of silver vaulted at comex still hasn't really changed much.  it's still 339.8 so i'm going to round up to 340 million ounces of silver and very little.  this has moved from these warehouses.  now i'm not saying that the snlv hasn't added a great deal of silver But remember who the custodian is, one of the custodians of the SLV.  And they did move more than that slightly.  I think it was 3 million more ounces than what I'm showing here into that category, which is required to be in a vault held by the dealers or the SLV.  It has to be registered.  so a lot going on.  we don't know is how much goes on in the over-the-counter market.  what we don't know is where exactly this silver goes.  we know where a lot of it goes because of reporting requirements for the slv for example.  but we don't know if some of this silver went from this entity to this entity And then back again.  We don't know.  I'm not saying that it did.  I'm just questioning everything.  What I do want to say about this entity is that they've said enough is enough and they're getting out of the business.  So another one bites the dust.  Interesting times, folks.  Let me know.  I leave the comments off for a variety of reasons.  I have a couple helpers that help me with social media.  But I do look at my Twitter account.  So if you like the idea of me doing like a silver update, say once a month out of the once a week weekly perspectives, just find me on Twitter and say, David, I like the idea that you're doing silver only or the precious metals only, you know, once a week on the weekly updates.  I appreciate it.  Or no, go back to the old method.  I want to hear the whole financial picture from your perspective.  Let me know on Twitter.  I'll leave it there.  Nothing more powerful than the truth.  It's in short supply, almost as short as silver.  It's David Morgan with TheMorganReport.com.  The next premium edition, the paid edition of The Morgan Report will be out a week from Monday.  It's the first Monday of every month, which I think is the 7th of September.  And we'll have a lot of interesting things to say about these markets in that report. ",
