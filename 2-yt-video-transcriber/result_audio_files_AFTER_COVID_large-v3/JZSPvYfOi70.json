            "text": "Early in the morning, I read the Truth For Life devotional, as I'm sure you all do.  And when I've done that, then I read newspapers, but not American newspapers, as it turns out, British newspapers, The Times of London, and then The Telegraph.  And just today in The Telegraph, one of the lead articles written by a fellow called Philip Johnson had the heading, At Times Like This, We Realize Just How Powerless Mankind Really Is.  And it's quite an excellent article, and in the course of that, he acknowledges the fact that a sort of humanistic, atheistic view of the world really has nowhere to go.  And he says, we've lived with the illusion for so long that science will fix everything, and yet it isn't fixing everything.  It seems to be compounding the problem.  And fascinatingly, he ends with just a sentence.  He says, well, I think maybe I'll have to go back to church.  And maybe you haven't been to church in a while.  Maybe you haven't even considered these things.  We'd love to help you do that.  You can find us here at truthforlife.org. ",
