I'm going to explain why.  I have some loose, some in a Ziploc bag and some in these little containers.  What inspired today's video was actually something that I briefly mentioned in yesterday's video.  If you watched my silver unboxing first one of July, 2020, if you haven't seen it, go check it out.  But in the video I talked about how I have three things in the mail on their way.  And one of those three, was some more silver because I am building my own bank.  One of those things were a book because I'm building my own library.  And one of those things is some workout equipment because I'm also building my own gym.  All those things here at my house.  And the first thing that I mentioned, silver, because I'm building my own bank, I thought that it would make for an interesting video today.  So sitting here in front of me, I have just a little bit of silver, gold, and cash, and I wanted to talk about not necessarily going completely bankless.  I know that's something that a lot of people talk about.  It is not something I agree with.  It is not something that I believe in.  I think that for just the sake of convenience, it's probably a smart idea to actually have a bank account, but I do not think it's a good idea to have abundant amounts of cash stored away in there.  I think that you're probably better off, at least in my opinion and from my perspective, hanging on to it yourself.  That's what I do for the most part.  I can take care of my own cash.  I could take care of my own money.  I don't need anybody watching over it for me.  I'm pretty sure I can take care of that on my own.  So that's what I wanted to talk about in today's video, banking on my own terms.  and You could do this very easily by converting your dollars, your cash, your fiat, your currency into silver and gold.  They could be coins, they could be rounds, they could be bars, larger denominations, smaller denominations, they could be little pieces of gold.  It doesn't have to be fractional.  It could be a troy ounce of gold.  and or hang on to some cash as well.  Now, what initially drew me to this concept was something that a very good friend of mine told me about, I don't know, maybe four years ago.  About a year and a half, two years before I actually started stacking, he introduced me to the silver stacking concept and how he doesn't really feel like it's the smartest idea to store all your cash in the bank.  And that wasn't anything far-fetched for me to hear because I had had previous experiences experiences with the bank that didn't really leave me with all that much confidence.  And it wasn't necessarily the bank's fault per se, but I always resort back to this.  I'll make it very, very quick.  Hurricane Sandy is what woke me up originally.  And I think that was back in like 2012 or something like that.  I remember seeing people who were upper middle class or maybe straight up upper class struggling because they had tons and tons of cash but it was all in the bank.  It was all on their debit card or maybe they had credit cards, but those are electronic payments.  Hurricane Sandy knocked out power here in my area of New Jersey for close to two weeks.  Now that's not a very long time.  That's obviously no SHTF scenario, but two weeks with absolutely no access to cash or money could lead to some problems.  and it's not like you can go on over to the ATM because that requires electricity too.  So you can't make electronic payments, you can't go into the bank, the bank is closed, blah, blah, blah, and then there's also you gotta worry about mobile banking not working from your phone or online banking not working from your computer.  There could be a ton of issues, but for the sake of convenience, I do think it's a good idea to have enough in there for the necessary bills month to month.  If you keep your monthly expenses in there at all times, you should be perfectly fine.  That's just my opinion though.  But now as for converting my dollars into silver and gold, predominantly silver for me anyway, because silver between the two metals makes far more sense for me and my lifestyle.  I do plan on getting more gold in the future.  This is not all the silver I have, and this is not all the gold that I have, but I would like to get tons and tons more.  And truth be told, I would like to get some more cash as well.  So the reason I have cash separated like this is this is just what I use for videos.  I just hang on to it and... I just always have it out and about for videos.  This right here, it's in a Ziploc bag because a couple months ago when the whole planet shut down, they said that cash could potentially be contaminated and they were saying, oh, leave it all in the bank, leave it all in the bank, we won't do anything with it.  That raised a little bit of a red flag for me.  So usually when they make that big of a fuss over not doing something, in my opinion, you should probably do it.  So just for the sake of safety reasons, I was like, all right, for all I know, maybe it is contaminated.  So went there with the gloves on, withdrew.  Not all that much cash, but just some.  Stuck it in a Ziploc bag, haven't opened it up since.  And the reason these are in these little... pill containers or whatever they're called.  This is something that my grandfather used to do.  He used to do it because it's water resistant.  Can't get away with calling it waterproof because water could technically get in there, but it's a whole lot safer in some type of water resistant container than it is just having the paper cash just laying around.  So I decided to actually make something and unfortunately I'm too ashamed of it because I have not yet invested the time into making a proper one.  I just made a concept one, and it's out of cardboard, so it's very, very far from finished, but there's basically going to be slots where you can put these in.  The singles, the fives, the tens, the twenties, the fifties, and the hundreds.  six different slots that perfectly fit these little containers and it's just something that i'm working on right now.  i haven't gotten around to making a proper one yet so i'm not going to show off the piece of cardboard that i have but in my opinion from my perspective i think diversification is key.  that's something that i learned a very long time ago.  it's never a good idea to have all your eggs in one basket which is why i am not 100 prioritizing silver.  I am prioritizing silver over cash and gold and pretty much most other things finance related.  But I do make a point to stack a little bit of gold just for the sake of diversification.  And I stack a little bit of cash as well because this stuff right here, this is for the short term.  This right here, this is not real true money.  This is just a piece of paper glorified IOU dollar.  That's what I like to call it.  It's currency.  It's fiat.  It's the ghost of money.  This is the system that we were handed and it's the system that we use.  So you gotta have a little bit of faith in the dollar.  I mean, it is the reason we go to work every day.  It's to get dollar bills, which we can then convert into actual money.  But for the time being, it's all about cash.  But for me personally, it's not all about cash.  I stack a little bit of cash, mostly for emergencies.  If something were to go down, if something were to go wrong, don't have to worry about oh let me go run on over to a coin shop or let me go put some of my silver up as a listing on ebay or something like that and then i gotta look for someone who's trying to convert their dollars into my silver and i i basically have to find a middleman.  I have no issue with that.  But then again, I have no intentions of really ever selling or parting ways with my silver goal, at least not for the next couple of decades at least.  But to completely remove the middleman, I decided to stack cash as well.  Because why go through the hassle of parting ways with your silver for cash when you just stack a little bit of cash on your own?  Now, do I mean or am I insinuating that you should be stacking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month Every month forever?  probably not but I think you should figure out what is a smart dollar amount for you.  There's a lot of things that you got to take into consideration when it comes to prepping this all.  by the way I consider to be Financial prepping.  there's a lot of thing you got to take into account.  One of those things is how many people you're prepping for.  how many people are you financially prepping for?  maybe you got a wife Maybe you got three kids.  I'm not married and I have no kids.  Not that I know of.  So there's not really a whole lot for me to worry about.  Just me and my dog.  Pretty simple.  Pretty easy.  I don't need to store away nearly as much cash as somebody else who might have a family of six for all I know.  so that person is probably also stocking up on six times the amount of food as i would need to if they're prepping in other ways as well.  so that's one thing that you got to take into consideration is how many people you are prepping for or i guess you can say how many people you are stacking for now if you want to remove cash from the picture and predominantly focus on silver and gold as your method of being your own bank There's nothing wrong with getting the middleman.  There's nothing wrong with heading on over to the coin shop.  There's nothing wrong with taking your silver over there, driving it over and parting ways with it like that, or putting it up online for sale on eBay or some social media platform or anything like that.  But one thing you got to take into consideration is that in an emergency situation, let's just say when the power goes out, you might have a little bit of trouble.  using the internet.  If the internet's down, if the power's out, you might have some issues there.  So that's one thing you gotta remember.  So the concept of being your own bank always interested me because I like doing things on my terms.  I like banking on my terms.  I'm building a gym for myself.  Because I want to work on strength training and physical preparedness on my terms.  I'm building my own library.  I think I have 49 books so far.  Planning on getting plenty more.  Got some coming in the mail.  Something else that I want to do on my own terms and try to be as self-sufficient as humanly possible.  Because if there's one thing I've learned... It's that relying on others, other people, other companies, other corporations, other entities is not good for the long term.  Sure, it's helpful, but I don't like crutches.  I don't need anybody helping me around, helping me out when it comes to my money, helping me out when it comes to fitness, helping me out when it comes to education.  I don't want all these unnecessary things people and things to rely on.  I want to do it all on my own terms.  So when I figured out that you could essentially be your own bank with silver and gold and cash, it fascinated me and I knew it was something that I wanted to do.  I knew it was something that I wanted to be a part of.  I knew it was something that I wanted to try out.  and not necessarily just try out, but I knew that it was something that I wanted to do for the long term, and I knew that it would be beneficial.  And not to mention, it's... Now, I know this might sound like I'm contradicting myself here because I'm making a YouTube video about it, but it's much more private than a bank account.  The average Joe who's stacking silver and gold is not making videos about their silver and their gold.  A lot of people are doing it completely privately.  Not to mention... Forget the silver and the gold.  Let's just talk about the cash for a second.  Let's just say instead of having a bank account or instead of keeping a majority of your cash in a bank account, you keep your cash in a safe or just somewhere in your house, statistically, you are far more likely to be the victim of a cyber crime such as somebody hacking into your bank account, stealing money from your bank account, hacking into your email or just something like that.  You're far more likely to have your money stolen from you digitally than you are to have your money stolen from you physically from your house.  It's easier, it's safer to commit these crimes online, it's quicker, it's more ideal for the criminals.  If you're going to break into somebody's house, you gotta worry about, oh, guys, the dog gonna come after me?  Does this guy have some type of home defense?  How do I know if it's actually an empty house?  Blah, blah, blah.  Not a lot of people are willing to do that.  Oh no, surveillance cameras, alarm systems, guy's got a German Shepherd, all these problems.  Oh no, the neighbors are gonna see me.  Oh no, what if I break a window and it's too loud and somebody hears me and I get caught?  People are not willing to do this as often as they are willing to hack into somebody's bank account.  Now again, I'm not a financial advisor.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice.  This is all for entertainment purposes only.  But in my opinion and from my perspective, looking at the statistics and knowing the fact that you are far more likely to have your money stolen from a bank account than you are to have your money stolen from your actual house, it made a lot more sense to me to store it on my own, take care of it on my own, and not leave it in someone else's possession.  What is the bank?  It's essentially saying to your friend, hey, can you hold on to this for me?  Because I want to hold on to it for myself.  Oh, yeah, sure.  I'll hang on to it for you.  I'll hang on to all those 50s over there as well.  I'll hang on to that silver and that gold too.  I'll hang on to it.  I'll take good care of it.  Don't worry about a thing.  It's the same as doing that.  And I see no purpose in putting my cash or my silver and gold in someone else's pocket.  That's what a bank account is, essentially.  In my opinion, that is.  And I'm curious, everybody watching this right now, what are your thoughts on bank accounts?  I know a lot of people have a bank account regardless just because making payments online, using a debit card, safer, more convenient than walking around with cash.  I know a lot of people have debit cards and credit cards for that reason alone.  You can order stuff online, quick and easy.  But for the most part, the people who watch my videos, that's pretty much all they use the bank for.  electronic transactions, whether it be paying a bill or buying something off of eBay or something like that, for the most part, based off of the comments that I've read from a lot of different people who have watched and commented on my videos, a lot of people, they don't keep a majority of their cash in the bank.  They keep enough in there to have just in case of any emergency.  They keep enough in there just for the monthly bills.  And really, that's it.  The rest is either cash at home or cash converted into silver and gold.  That's based off of the comments I've been reading.  I'm not sitting here making assumptions.  I'm going by what people are telling me.  And it seems as though the overwhelming majority of people who watch my videos are pretty much on board with most of the things that I say.  We might not be on the same page 100% of the time, but for the most part, we're in the same book.  So once again, I'm curious, what are your thoughts?
