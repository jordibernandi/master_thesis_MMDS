Bernie served on the Veterans Committee and got bills done.  I think people are ready for a call to action.  They want honest leadership who cares about them.  They want somebody who's going to fight for them.  And they will find it in Bernie.  That's where I feel the Bern.  I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approve this message. ",
