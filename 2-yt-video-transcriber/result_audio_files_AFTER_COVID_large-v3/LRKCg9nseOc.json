            "text": "Maybe we can have the conversation about dismantling the two-party system when a fascist isn't running!  I had to think twice about whether to respond to the creature.  And I know I could be accused of body slamming a mental midget.  Stupidity is a bad quality.  Rage is a bad quality.  But when you put the two together, it's downright toxic.  One plus one really equals three.  But the reason I want to do it is because this idea that Trump is a fascist is, of course, a pretty widespread belief on the left.  So let's examine it for a minute.  Fact number one, all the founders of fascism in every major country were leftists.  This was true of England and France and Italy and Germany and Belgium and Spain.  In France, for example, the founders of fascism, Marcel Diaz, a leftist.  Jean Allemand, the grandfather of French socialism in England.  Oswald Mosley, who was on the left wing, the far left wing of the British Labour Party.  Mussolini, the founder of fascism in Italy, was a Marxist.  And later, when Mussolini was in Salo, his chief advisor, Nicola Bambacci, was the founder of the Italian Communist Party and a pretty good friend of Lenin.  Number two, Mussolini said in defining fascism, everything in the state, nothing outside the state.  And here you get the idea of what fascism is.  It's state control.  You can confirm this, by the way, whip out your phone, take a minute, just Google the Nazi 20-point platform.  Nazi socialism wasn't just a matter of what's in the name, national socialism.  It's the actual platform that got the Nazis to become the largest party in Germany.  And look right down the list.  State control of the banks, state control of health care, state control of education, state control of the churches.  This does not sound like anything that Trump believes, but... It does sound an awful lot.  It does resemble what Elizabeth Warren believes and Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders.  Bottom line, fascism is clearly a phenomenon of the left.  The fascists thought of it that way.  So, by the way, did the anti-fascists.  The whole notion that fascism is somehow right-wing is a progressive lie and a progressive invention post-World War II.  It was designed to cover up the terrible record of fascism and sort of displace it from the left to the right.  Trump isn't a fascist, but some of the people calling him a fascist are. ",
