            "text": "But this man's life, George Floyd, is taken from him.  But in particular, he said, I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  Well, think about it.  The word breath is pneuma in the Hebrew.  And when we think about the fact that the Most High Yahweh, when he created Adam, he breathed life into him.  He became a living soul.  First, he was just an inanimate object as he sat there in the dust from which he was created.  But once he breathed his pneuma into him, he became a living soul.  That breath is key.  That breath is under attack.  But it is that very breath that the Most High Yah said to Ezekiel when he told him to prophesy to these dry bones, that he was going to breathe life into us once again.  Y'all, our people have been so destroyed, dismantled psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, physically have been destroyed.  We do look like dead men in many ways.  The breath is the key.  The breath is the key.  And we need the Holy Spirit.  We need the Ruach HaKadosh to breathe life back into us.  He's allowing us to see this in patterns so that we would understand who we are, that we would understand as a people why it is that it's time for us to wake up.  Now some people think, again, that it means wake up to black militia violence.  That's not what we are to be waking up to.  What we need to wake up to is the reality of our identity.  Because when we understand who we are as a people, then we will unite under the banner of the Most High Yah.  We will allow him to go before us and to be the man of war that he is so that he can judge this wicked nation.  We will allow him to do what he did the first time to our enemies in Egypt.  You see, it was not our ancestors who took up swords.  To protect themselves against the first Egyptian hostility against us.  And it is not in taking up swords.  It's going to free us this time either.  He freed us then and he'll free us now.  But we are the ones who have to wake up.  We are the ones who have to realize that our breath is being taken from us.  So we have to see the pattern.  We have to see what's going on so that we can have life breathe back into us.  But I tell you what.  We've got to wake up.  We've got to wake our brothers and sisters up all around us so that they would understand that what we're seeing are signs.  We're seeing the manifestation of the sons of God.  Do you not understand that?  the word says that the earth groans in anticipation for the manifestation of the sons of the most high Yah?  Earth isn't groaning over what is happening to us, what is happening to our men in the streets, what's happening to our women.  So we have to get to a point and a place where we begin to connect the dots for others so that they don't think that the answer is in physical retaliation.  Because the answer is not in physical retaliation.  We've got to allow the Most High Yah to be our defense.  Because when He does it, He's going to do it right.  You understand what I'm saying?  He's going to do it right and He's going to do it all the way, 100%.  I just wanted to come to y'all quickly with this, just to offer my perspective on it.  Because at the end of the day, I see that what we're dealing with is very spiritual.  We might look at this and say, oh, this is physical and we need to blow out the brains of these people.  But I'm telling you at the end of the day, we're just knocking off ponds and not dealing with the king.  We have to be able to see the forest for the trees.  It's not that one police officer that put his knee on George Floyd's neck.  It's not just him.  It's an entire demonic system.  that has been used against us.  But we have to wake up to the reality of who we are so that we will no longer succumb to the tactics and wiles of Satan.  So taking out a pawn does not win the chess game.  Taking out four pawns doesn't win the chess game.  We've got to go after the king.  And the only way we go after the king is if we align ourself with our king.  We've got to align ourselves with the king of kings in order to go after these lesser kings, these pharaohs, because they will come crashing down.  They will understand that the great I am will judge, that the great I am will deliver.  He will deliver his people. ",
