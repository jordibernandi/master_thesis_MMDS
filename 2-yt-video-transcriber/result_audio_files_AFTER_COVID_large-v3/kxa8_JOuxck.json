The program's clearly unconstitutional, which is why we're challenging it in court.  And we're here today to meet with a couple of our plaintiffs to talk about the impact the program's had on their lives.  So I'm going to go visit with our client, Melissa Ingram.  Melissa's car was seized a number of months ago after she lent it to her boyfriend, and then he was pulled over in an area known for prostitution.  Now, her boyfriend was never charged with a crime, but that doesn't matter, because obviously Melissa had nothing to do with it, but Michigan state law doesn't allow an innocent third-party owner to get their property back.  You've never been charged with a crime? ",
