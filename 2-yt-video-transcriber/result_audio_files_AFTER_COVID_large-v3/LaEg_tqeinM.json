            "text": "all right ladies and gentlemen collectors of all ages you guys ready to uh.  look for some more hidden gems in your coins?  then you've come to the right place.  i'm sean with blue ridge silverhound and today we are going to talk about probably a coin that you've come across during your searches quite often all right that's the 1946 jefferson nickel.  uh... there's a lot and plenty to say about this particular date of coin and we're going to cover quite a bit of it.  okay but i'm going to make you guys a promise.  in this video there is absolutely zero emphasis on full steps high grade top pop nickels okay something that i like talking about on other videos.  instead your main focus is going to be finding one of these three extremely valuable varieties.  Coins in which nobody ever looks for, especially in coins that look like this right here, right?  It took a second to go ahead and pan to the next page.  But if you're going through rolls of nickels, which is a very, very common, a very popular denomination of U.S.  coin to go through, more than likely you've probably come across a number of some of the older Jefferson nickels that look like this.  Okay, this one, well-loved during its day, worn.  I mean if you're coming across it and you're finding it today, more than likely it's still seeing quite a bit of action in the buying and selling of goods and services today.  But every single one of the varieties I'm going to be sharing with you in this video, I'm happy to say that even in this condition, if you're able to find one, congratulations.  You have made a little bit of money.  Okay.  And it doesn't hurt to find one that is in much nicer shape either.  Those coins can sell for thousands.  All right.  So, um, As always, if this is your first time here, like, share, subscribe to my channel.  The support goes a long way.  Appreciate all of your support through these last 10 years of being an active coin guru on YouTube.  So many thanks to you.  and how about we go ahead and get started.  with some hidden gems in the 1946 jefferson nickel.  but what i wanted to talk about and the reason why that this is a coin that you can find today in spite of its age is its composition guys okay from the earliest days of the nickel.  okay the same composition has always been used on these coins and it even holds true.  today you have a 75 copper 25% nickel composition for the nickel.  It's a coin that because of what it's made of, not a lot of people hoard them.  It's not like 90% silver or even the 35% manganese silver alloy that was used during the wartime age from 42 to 45.  So those coins are commonly pulled and hoarded because of the intrinsic value of the metal.  There's really not a whole lot here, you know, with this copper nickel composition other than the fact that it is a fantastic industrial metal and that's why people would save stuff like this.  Oh, by the way, it cost the U.S.  Mint approximately eight cents to make a nickel today.  All right.  So you never know.  They're going to find alternative metals to make our favorite five cent coin happen.  all right so there's three branch mints that we're going to be focusing on for this particular video.  now for the duration of the video we're going to take a look at relatively high grade specimens of each one of the varieties that you're going to look out for.  so we got the philadelphia minted 1946 we have a denver minted 1946 and finally we also have a san francisco minted coin of the same date.  all right and i'm happy to say that there is one significant variety that you're going to be on the lookout for for each one of those branch mints.  so let's go ahead and jump right into the 1946 philadelphia.  okay this is the highest minted out of the three minted coins.  this there's uh 161,116,000 pieces produced for the 1946 Philadelphia.  Typically on these coins, your mint mark will be just to the right of Monticello at the base of the monument.  So if you don't have a mid mark, you have a Philadelphia struck coin.  All right.  So what exactly are we looking for for this particular date?  Well, it's a doubled die reverse.  All right.  This is the FS801 Cherry Picker's Guide variety.  Okay.  This is a big one.  Now, there are a few other doubled dies that are known for this particular date and along with some of the other branch mints.  But those are considered minor.  Because these are published in the Cherry Pickers Guide, there's a lot more value, more credibility to these type of varieties because they are, in a way, much more dramatic and radical in terms of variety speed.  So what are we looking at here?  So we're looking at the word Monticello.  So you kind of have like a rotational doubling because you can see quite a bit of doubling here on E-L-L-O.  See how stretched out the O is?  The L, you have splitting serifs plus extra thickness.  And you also have that on the E as well.  All right.  So if you go over here to the M, you can tell that it is also stretched much more thicker, extra thickness there.  Same with the O and the N. All right.  And check out five cents.  All right.  See how much thicker the bottoms of each of the letters are.  Okay.  Plus on a earlier die state example, you also have very clear split serifs on all of these bottom feet of the letters.  So this is a really, really eye-catching double to die.  So here's another reference photo to consider.  I made it as easily as best as I can to show you the difference between a normal non-doubled die Jefferson nickel for the same date, it's a 46, and one with the doubling.  So the one on top is your normal coin.  The one on the bottom is going to be your doubled die reverse FS801.  All right, so on this one, check out the feet of all of the letters, okay?  You're going to notice that they're all pretty skinny.  It's most notable on, like, the I, the N, and the M, where you actually have big, bold feet on those letters.  Now, take a look at the doubled die version.  You have quite a bit of thickness right here on all of the bottom features of the letters, okay?  The coin, in essence, you know, when the... The hub was re-punched again onto the master die.  There was a little bit of an offset.  That's why you have this extra thickness on this double die right here.  So that's pretty clear.  You can find this even in the lowest grades.  Much like that coin that we saw at the beginning of the video.  you're going to be able to identify this particular double die, even on coins as low as like fine 12 and, uh, those particular types of grades.  So keep an eye out for this one.  All right.  So the next one we're going to look at is the 1946 D. All right.  Pretty cool coin.  Um, these are generally much well struck out of the three coins because the Denver minted examples, um, Just better quality control through that particular mint facility.  All right, so you have a letter D here to the right-hand side of Monticello.  You have some pretty nice steps.  So if you're able to find a really nice high-grade specimen, that's just going to be icing on an already sweet cake.  And what do we mean by that?  Well, you're going to be looking for this coin right here with a D over inverted D mint mark.  Okay, this is also referred to as the FS501 in the Cherry Pickers Guide.  So anything, any coin with an inverted mid mark is big money, ladies and gentlemen.  Okay, the coin before it, coins in low grades, you could sell for like 20 bucks of that double die Philadelphia coin.  If you're able to find this coin, and let's say it grades no better than like 515BF20, this is a coin, as long as it's readily identifiable, and you can tell, check out that extra loop here on the left bar of the D right here, you're gonna have a coin that you can easily sell for about 40 to 50 bucks raw.  how incredible is that?  that's like easy money guys.  if you're able to find this particular coin in a high-grade state all right like let's say mid-state 65 and 66 this is a coin that is worth many thousands of dollars.  okay and we're talking coins without the full steps.  so Depending on how good of a cherry picker you are, you can find something like this and hit it huge with a nice instant payday.  A few thousand dollars can go a long way.  So here's another schematic with an overlay of an upside down D. And this is what you would normally see on these.  Keeping in mind... the mint marks were punched independently into the dies.  all right.  so someone a mint employee would be sitting there with a long thin metal shaft with a little tiny letter d on the end and they would tap it in.  okay sometimes they'll get it wrong.  they'll do it upside down initially they'll flip that puppy over and then re-tap it again correctly.  okay and they won't rework the dies to eliminate the re-punching.  okay.  so Their mistakes, as collectors, it's going to be our gain.  So keep an eye out for this really cool D over inverted D mint mark variety.  And then finally, we got the 1946S.  Okay, San Francisco minted coin here for you.  This is the lowest minted out of the three at $13,560,000.  You would think it's pretty rare based off of that, but there is plenty of these available, even through searching roles.  I can't even tell you how many S minted 46s I've personally come across.  They are plentiful.  They are out there.  Keep in mind, however, this is a coin where the strike wasn't as good.  So it's the worst out of the three.  So finding one with full steps is going to be somewhat of a challenge.  So what are we looking for for this one?  Well, we're going to be looking at double die avers FS 101 into cherry pickers guide.  And come on, take a look at this thing.  You have clear doubling the separation line on every single one of the digits of the date for the six.  uh again every single one of these varieties are significant to this date.  they're all cherry picker sky varieties.  okay it's a whitman book for crying out loud.  these are coins that are worth a lot of money.  this is the most spectacular variety for the 1946 dated jefferson nickel.  this is the one you guys need to look out for.  it is uh is a coin that you can identify in grades as low as like bf25 bf30.  um you know with any more wear these separation lines disappear.  but you will notice that there's gonna be extra thickness plus when a coin gets to that kind of grade level there's also going to be other things to consider.  there's going to be dirt and grime build up like the this little inner enclosed area the four right here.  this little space generally would have a lot of dirt and guck in it.  all right that's just the way it is with these older coins.  they've been used you know quite often uh and but this is a spectacular double die.  even check out that star.  you have two stars.  you got two points right here to this star and you can notice that there is even a separation line in there as well.  all right so check out also liberty incredible How dramatic this doubling is on this coin.  Alright.  This is a no mistake.  No doubter.  If you come across one of these and you see this.  Congratulations.  That is one heck of a find.  And then finally to a lesser extent.  You are going to see a little bit of doubling on In God We Trust.  Not a whole lot.  Just some extra thickening.  No separation lines.  Although in INN you'll see some split serifs right here.  Okay.  And that's probably the least thrilling part.  of this doubled die.  But if you're able to find this coin, this is a coin that would easily sell in low grades for $50 to $100.  High grades, we're talking $1,000 to $1,500.  easy for a coin like this.  Now in low grades, you don't necessarily have to grade them.  I surely wouldn't.  If you want to keep it, fine.  If you want to go ahead and sell it, it's very liquid, even as a raw coin.  Just make sure you don't clean it or anything.  take great pictures.  that's going to be a key to being able to move all of these coins.  okay If you can't do that, you're going to have a tough time.  So make sure you get your photography taking skills good.  Make sure you get your lighting correct.  That's all going to play a huge role in how much these coins sell for.  So just to recap, we have the 1946P Double Die Reverse FS801.  Spectacular coin.  High mintage.  Those are available out there.  The next one, the 46D over inverted D, also the FS501 in the cherry pickers guide.  Another one to look out for.  Okay.  There's plenty of those out there as well.  And then finally, the big dog of it all, the 1946S doubled die obverse FS101 is going to be the crown jewel.  Just the big one out of the three for this particular date.  If it has a San Francisco mint mark on the reverse, check the front of that coin out.  If it exhibits some strong doubling, then you have hit pay dirt, ladies and gentlemen.
