            "text": "I'm Christy Whitman.  I was former governor of New Jersey and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush.  If anyone's read any of our history, you'll know that the Founding Fathers were very concerned about the presidency.  They had just fought a revolution to get out from under a king.  They did not want to see an all-powerful president.  And that's why they established three different branches.  The president, who was the executive, but they controlled the president's behavior by giving Congress the authority to have oversight, with the final stop being the courts.  So there are breaks on the president, but this president doesn't believe that that's true.  President Trump has seemed to deny any accountability for anything.  He said that very clearly during the campaign when he said he could shoot somebody on the middle of Fifth Avenue and nothing would happen.  unfortunately, it looks like maybe he's right.  He says on the one hand that the only people that can hold him accountable for his actions is the Congress through the impeachment process.  And when that goes forward, he says the only people that can actually do anything about his behavior is the court.  And so he's trying to have it both ways, saying that Congress is the only one.  And then when Congress starts to do it, no, they're not the only ones.  It's only the court.  And if a president is deemed to be a above the law, that no one can hold him accountable, then we're in a very dangerous position because that means a president could do whatever they want.  And any time you say that anyone is above the law, I believe that undermines our basic values as a nation and puts us in a very dangerous position. ",
