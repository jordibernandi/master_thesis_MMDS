            "text": "Hello, I'm Nicole Michelle, founder and femininity influencer for the Inner Beauty Movement.  Welcome back to another Ladylike Lessons.  I know it's been a while, but hey, we're back in the saddle.  So join us as we talk about modern women versus traditional women.  Stay tuned.  The beautiful part about being a woman is that you evolve.  We evolve.  We're just like seasons.  That's why femininity is often compared to seasons because we change and we're beautiful in each season.  And I want women to give themselves space to grow and evolve and not be so hard on themselves.  Femininity is a mindset.  It is a mindset.  It's how you view the world.  You view the world from a feminine standpoint, from a woman's standpoint, and you embrace that and you're okay with that, right?  Because that's where you get your fulfillment.  That's where you get.  your completeness is from accepting that you're a woman, accepting that you view the world differently than masculine, right?  And you appreciate the differences in the masculine.  Our lifestyle is not the definition of femininity, right?  So we have so many subsets of femininity and all of these subsets affect how we view femininity.  For instance, race, our neighborhood, our background, right?  Our socioeconomic status, all of these things, pedigree.  I mean, I can go on for days.  All of these things affect femininity.  how we view femininity, but they don't change the definition.  Some women will choose to have a more modern approach to femininity and some women will have a more traditional approach to femininity.  For example, a woman who's younger may be more modern and as she matures and experiences more out of life and has a little more experience under her belt, she may gravitate towards more traditional.  A traditional woman may have had some bad experiences.  She may have evolved.  Her personality starts to come out a little bit more.  She begins to feel like, wait a minute, I was kind of forced to be traditional.  I don't really want to do that.  I really want to be more expressive.  So she may gravitate back to modern.  So neither option or lifestyle is wrong.  All it simply means is that there are modern women and there are traditional women.  So then when they hear my traditional message, they go, No.  Okay, and then there are some women that go, eh, this sounds kinda good.  Let me integrate some of the things she's talking about and throw the rest out, right?  But modern women will question status quo and not to be rebellious, not to be confused with women who just wanna be rebellious, who are just in a masculine energy and they just wanna rebel against anything feminine.  or they identify more with masculine energy or they're more alpha.  That's not to be confused with that.  Modern women simply just wanna know who made these rules and why do I have to conform to them?  And why is this 20 blah, blah years and we're still doing X, Y, and Z. They will question tradition.  These women want to think outside the box.  They will not conform.  They're more apt to not really be pressed about marriage in the traditional sense.  They're okay with maybe living with their boyfriend before they get married.  If they get married at all, they're okay with.  they're not necessarily comfortable with doing the whole.  he pays all the bills and then i stay at home and do the focus on the domestic issues.  her approach to relationships life is more modern so she may not get married.  she may be okay with that.  um if she's still feminine yes she still has a lot of feminine traits.  she does want to be the feminine energy in the relationship.  She just doesn't want to approach it from the traditional standpoint.  It's real important that women who lean more towards being modern, it's important that they stay balanced, that they learn work and home balance is really important that they do that.  We talk a lot about that in the feminine elite and it's real important that they shun masculine traits.  There are going to be times, in situations where you have to jump in your masculine.  But overall, you're gonna be predominantly feminine.  Modern women do not fight feminine.  That's the difference between alphas and modern women.  Modern women don't fight the feminine.  Alpha women may tend to fight the feminine.  Modern women do not.  They embrace the feminine.  And as traditional women, we need to learn to respect those women who are modern.  All right, so let's talk about traditional women.  Now, traditional women are going to adhere strictly to gender roles.  The man is the head of the household.  The woman is his helpmate.  She is going to focus more on domestic, motherhood, working inside the home while he pays most of the bills.  She may help out here and there.  She may start an at-home business, whatever, but that's going to be her focus.  She may have been modern at one time, but she may gravitate towards traditional lifestyle because she's trying to raise a family.  She doesn't have an issue with modern living, but in terms of trying to raise a family, she kind of switches gears in her mind because she's going to be raising children.  Traditional women, stick to tradition, rules, heirlooms.  These are the women that are going to most likely try their best to conform to etiquette.  traditional manners and not to say modern women don't have manners and they don't care.  it's just not that big of a priority on their list but your traditional women they do pride themselves on trying to get it right trying to get the rules right and to a lot of people who are modern that may seem a little rigid right.  traditional women try to keep it close to home if possible and housewives, stay-at-home moms, homeschooling, the nine.  They pride themselves on motherhood, traditional gender roles.  The traditional woman is going to get her completeness from marriage and children, right?  That doesn't mean she's desperate.  It doesn't mean that she's less than or that she's not smart and intelligent.  She just gets her femininity completeness from being in the home, right?  Being married.  having children.  Nothing's wrong with that.  Just like modern women pride themselves on being artistic and free, the traditional woman prides herself on being in the home.  The traditional woman is going to be more conservative in her values.  She is going to bring it home.  She's going to be a little bit more reserved in terms of how she views the world because she's, in her mind, she's shifted to accommodate other personalities, her husband, her children, the homestead.  She's focused on nurturing others because she's in the home, so that's her primary focus.  Modern women, a lot of times, can overshadow the beautiful parts of being traditional.  They may tend to mock modesty.  They may tend to devalue homemaking.  They may tend to belittle women who want to be married, who want to be more traditional.  And I think as women we need to evolve and accept that your femininity may need to be completed with being modern and being free and questioning things and setting your own rules.  And I know why a lot of modern women may do that.  Typically because for the last few generations we've had women who were taught not to need a man.  I'm speaking to a lot of unhappy women and so that's why I'm harping on the feminist movement, the modern feminist movement, because I see a lot of unhappy women and I'm speaking to that.  And for a lot of these women, the return to traditional gender roles will be the answer for them.  Living a modern life will not make them happy.  It will not complete them.  A lot of us will never be happy in this world.  The best we can hope for is completeness.  Some women are just in a different place.  A lot of times they are having mental anguish and breakdown and they've dealt with trauma, they've dealt with pain and hurt and they've had bad experiences trying to be traditional.  They've had bad experiences trying to be modern.  And it's important that as women we be compassionate, we have grace, and we have understanding and empathize with women where they are.  But I want women to be supportive of women Even if we disagree with their choice of lifestyle, right?  I can support another woman that is completely non-traditional by supporting her in her femininity, not necessarily her lifestyle.  Just important that you look at yourself in the mirror and go, I'm okay, I'm growing, I'm getting better.  I'm not going to have all the answers today or maybe not even tomorrow, but one step at a time, one step at a time.  You're going to get there.  Just be who you are and develop your personality.  And remember the goal of this channel is faith, family, and femininity.  Thank you so much for watching me.  I appreciate you.  Thank you for sticking to the end.  And remember, I love you and Jesus Christ loves you.  And until the next time, keep the faith.  Bye. ",
