            "text": "Hey everyone, this is Turd Flinging Monkey and today I'm going to prove to you that only the top 20% of taxpayers are actually net taxpayers.  There was a guy on my live stream yesterday who just didn't believe me.  He thought I was full of shit.  And he's wrong and I'm going to prove it.  Ready?  Here we go.  Now, the reason why he's mistaken is because if you look up charts and you don't understand the data behind the chart, it can be deceiving.  For example, here is a chart.  that shows the share of market and after-tax income by market income group 2013.  And you can see in the fourth quintile, this would be the top 40%.  You have the highest quintile, which is the top 20%.  And the fourth quintile represents the next lower 20%.  And you can see that their after-tax income is lower than their pre-tax income.  Whereas the ones below that, the lower three quintiles, their income goes up after taxes.  Obviously, they are not net taxpayers.  But what about this fourth quintile?  It seems very interesting that they're barely breaking even.  And if you look at the actual data, that's pretty true.  They're barely breaking even.  In fact, if you look at the 2016 chart... you see the same thing.  Let me just zoom in.  So here we see in the lowest quintile, you can clearly see that they're making more from the income tax represented in pink than they paid in taxes representing in green.  The lowest quintile or the bottom 20% make basically double their income off the tax code.  The second quintile, the next 20% still make substantially more money than they paid in.  The next quintile again, But then the fourth quintile, if you zoom really close, you can see that they barely pay more than they get out.  Now, this is where this confusion comes from.  The person who thinks I don't know what I'm talking about said that this fourth quintile actually are net taxpayers.  Because as you can see, their income before taxes and transfers is higher than their income after taxes and transfers.  Thus, they are net taxpayers.  It's right there, look.  income before transfers and taxes.  income after taxes and transfers.  the green bar is higher than the pink bar.  you don't know what you're talking about.  tfm.  well luckily the cbo which is where all this data is coming from they don't just produce fun pds for you to read they also produce actual excel documents that have everything listed in them.  so let's look at the excel document where this chart came from.  So here is the Excel document.  This is downloaded directly from the CBO.  And you can see, if I zoom in, let's look at this fourth quintile.  Let's zoom in and you can see income before transfers and taxes, 20.5.  Income after transfers and taxes, 20.3.  It has gone down.  They have been net taxpayers.  Have not they?  Well, unfortunately, if you read this definition directly below the chart, this is also listed in the PDF, but I'm going to read it off here because it's literally on the same page as the chart in question.  It says, and I quote, income before transfers and taxes is market income plus social insurance benefits.  Market income consists of labor income, business income, capital income, including capital gains, income received in retirement for past services, and other non-governmental income sources.  Social insurance benefits consists of benefits provided through Social Security, old age survival and disability insurance, Medicare, measured as the average cost of the government of providing those services, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation.  Now, what immediately jumps out?  These are welfare programs.  Social Security, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance, and Workers' Comp are welfare programs.  Now, if you think Social Security is not a welfare program, I'm going to let the Gipper clue you in. ",

            "text": "They've called it insurance to us in 100 million pieces of literature.  But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program.  They only used the term insurance to sell it to the people.  And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government.  And the government has used that tax.  There is no fund.  Because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is $298 billion in the hold.  But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they had the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble.  And they're doing just that. ",

            "text": "All right.  Now that we're all on the same page, that Social Security, Medicare, and all those other programs are welfare programs, let's deduct social insurance from your income and see if you're a net taxpayer.  I'll spare you the trouble.  Here we go.  I already made the chart.  So let's talk about it.  Let's talk about it.  So all my sources are in the description.  if you want to check my numbers.  The poorest quintile, the bottom 20%.  They have a market income on average of $15,800.  This is in 2013 numbers.  The 2016 report was a lot more esoteric.  So I use the 2013 numbers, but it all matches up.  They paid $800 in federal taxes on average.  They received $9,600 in federal transfers, which are defined as Medicaid, CHIP, SNAP, SSI, and all other means-tested welfare programs.  They also received $4,200 in social insurance, which again is Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and workers' comp.  So they made $13,000 on the tax code.  The next quintile, the lower middle 20%, they have a market income of $31,300.  They paid $4,000 in federal taxes.  They received $16,200 in transfers.  And they received $11,900 in social insurance, meaning that they made $24,100 on the tax code.  The upper middle 20%, this would be the 40% to 60%.  They have a market income of $53,000.  They paid $8,900 in federal taxes.  They received $16,700 in federal transfers, and they received $12,600 in social insurance, meaning they made $20,400 on the tax code.  The quintile representing the upper 60% to 80% of taxpayers made $88,700 in market income.  They paid $17,600 in federal taxes.  They received $15,000 in federal transfers.  They received $12,600 in social insurance, meaning that they gained $10,000 on the tax code.  Meanwhile, the richest 20% made an average of $253,000 in market income.  They paid $69,700 in federal taxes.  They received $12,000 in federal transfers, and they received $10,300 in social insurance, meaning they actually paid into the system $47,400 on average.  These are the numbers.  The top 20%.  pay all the taxes, all of them.  This is why whenever there's a tax cut, there's all this talk of tax cuts for the rich.  Well, of course, any tax cut is going to be a tax cut for the rich because the rich are the only ones paying the taxes.  Nobody else pays taxes.  They all receive benefits in excess of the taxes they pay.  They are paying nothing into the system.  They are contributing nothing.  They are getting everything.  they pay back and more.  So there you go.  Unfortunately, again, I don't blame the person who was confused.  The CBO includes social insurance as income because reasons.  Because apparently the government can just arbitrarily decide that this welfare is not welfare.  But it is welfare.  The government is giving you someone else's money.  That's welfare.  Yeah, I know, right?  Crazy.  So there you go.  Now we know.  And knowing is half the battle.  This is Turd Flingy Monkey.  Thank you for watching.
