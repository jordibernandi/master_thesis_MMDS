Yes, I'm coming.  I'm coming.  You need your exercise.  We're trying to get Noble to lose a little bit of weight.  And he doesn't get table scraps like other people give their pigs.  He gets vegetables and pig feed and fruit.  So... Come here, Noble.  What's the matter?  Stick with us, Noble.  Stick with us.  No, come here, Noble.  We'll have to go through the forest.  Here, Noble.  Noble.  Do you want a grape?  Like, oh, excuse me.  I need a grape.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh, my gosh.  Noble is getting a custom coat made for him that's got like a little hood.  So that should be here soon.  Here we go.  Here's the stream.  This is the back of the property.  Noble's just looking for delicious weeds.  Did you find anything delicious?  See, I'm looking.  I'm looking, Mom, to see what's edible.  Yeah, hi.  Oh, Chris, please.  Maybe we shouldn't pull the branch down right now when Noble's near it.  Noble is going.  I'm following him.  He's going to the stream, actually.  He probably wants a drink.  Come on.  Come on.  Want a drink?  Are you eating, George?  Come on.  Here.  Give me a... Come on.  Water.  Yep, that was a grape.  Here, Noble.  Here.  Here.  Come on.  I'm trying to show you there's water there.  That was Chris disturbing the peace.  That's exactly what that was.  He's going to meander towards the water.  He knows there's water there.  He's like, well, let me move slow.  Come on, here.  Maybe if I drop the bag of grapes.  Nope, he's not interested.  These are grapery grapes.  Excuse me, grapery, but our pig loves your grapes.  Noble, what are you eating?  What are you crunching on?  Don't wag your tail at me.  Tell your mother.  What is this?  Oh, guys, look what I've discovered.  It's an abandoned bird's nest.  Look at that.  Yeah, when the tree branch must have fallen.  Here we go, look.  Yep, look at that.  Beautiful little bird's nest.  Maybe we could pluck it and put it by our trees.  Maybe a bird will use it.  So we have found a bird nest in our nature travels.  Welcome to the Chris and Amanda Grace Nature Caravan starring.  Noble the Pig.  He's getting closer to the water.  Yep, maybe we can reuse this.  I could put it in the pen for the sparrows that come in.  Oh, they used a lot of interesting materials.  Looks like they used a lot of fur from different animals to build this nest too.  Very resourceful.  There's Noble looking at the great frontier.  Okay, guys.  Okay, everyone.  We're going to start heading back.  God bless you.  Keep the faith.  Noble says bye. ",
