A terrible way to help those who need it.  Socialism for rich people is a terrible way to help the American families that are actually struggling. ",

            "text": "I'm delighted that after talking on the floor of the Senate for years about socialism for the rich, apparently that has gotten across to my Republican friends.  Of course, that's what we do every single day.  That's why we have the incredible level of income and wealth inequality that exists in this country, because decade after decade, We have used this body to provide massive tax breaks to the rich, provided corporate welfare to corporations who don't need it.  That is socialism for the rich.  The majority leader is right.  But let's talk about, in fact, what is in this bill.  According to the Tax Policy Center, less than 1% of the benefits of the direct payments, that's the $2,000 per working class adult that Senator Schumer and I are talking about, less than 1% would go to the top 5% of Americans.  Virtually nothing goes to the very, very rich.  Overwhelming majority of those funds go to the middle class, the working class, low income people who in the midst of this pandemic are in desperate economic conditions.  Now, again, I am delighted to hear the majority leader talking about socialism for the rich.  And I hope we will continue that discussion in the next session.  So let me talk about the socialism for the rich that the majority leader is enthusiastically supportive of.  Majority leader helped lead this body to pass Trump's tax bill.  Now, you want to talk about socialism for the rich, Mr.  Majority Leader?  Under that bill, Charles Koch, one of the very richest people in America, he has a net worth of $113 billion.  That bill gave Mr.  Koch a $1.4 billion tax break.  Majority Leader, that sounds to me like socialism for the rich.  You want to talk about socialism for the rich?  Senator McConnell had no problem giving a $104 million tax refund to Amazon over the past three years, despite the fact that that company made $30 billion in profits.  So the argument that this bill in any significant way benefits the rich is just not accurate. ",
