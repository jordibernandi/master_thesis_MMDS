            "text": "Hi, I'm Carlton Pearson, and I want to say something briefly to you about personality conflicts or dealing with other human beings, whether that's at home, on the job, church, sports, whatever it is, people getting along with people as an art, as well as a grace and a science.  The moment we become aware of our triggers or what triggers us, we have the power to heal them.  A lot of people are not aware of what triggers them, and they usually react when someone triggers an unhealed part inside of them.  A trigger is an unhealed part of ourselves.  Emotions like envy, jealousy, anger, even fear are some of the well-known triggers.  We can spot and heal the parts by which we get triggered if we are aware of them and only if we are aware of them.  Instead of reacting at that moment, we can find the root of our triggers by questioning them with awareness.  And the moment we find the root of our triggers, we have the power to heal them.  Think about that and be healed.  Love you.  See you next time. ",
