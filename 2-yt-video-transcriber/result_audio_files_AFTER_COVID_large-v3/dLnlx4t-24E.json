            "text": "Money is a tool.  Racism is a religious philosophy.  that's also a tool, but it is a superior philosophy to money.  Nothing is money.  You can say that a rock is money.  A diamond is a rock, a shiny rock, and they make it shiny because I understand the diamonds in the rough are not very shiny.  I don't know whether that's true or not.  But even if they did or didn't shine, what is money?  Money is whatever the white supremacists say that it is.  That's why the white supremacist philosophy is superior to money, because money doesn't make the white supremacists.  The white supremacists make money.  I worked in a place called the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  for many years.  And they printed something called money on paper.  It was blank paper, and then when they ran it through a press, it came out being money.  And it had $10 on it, $20, uh, $50, $100, sometimes called Benjamins, because it had Benjamin Franklin's name on it, whatnot.  And, uh, George Washington, number one, the $1 bill, a slave owner, Thomas Jefferson, a $2 bill, a slave owner.  So they have slave owners' pictures on money.  So what's the period?  The money or the person that owns the money?  The person who makes the money?  The person whose pictures go on the money?  So if I make something, I'm superior to the thing that I made.  So the money is not controlling me.  I'm controlling the money because I made the money.  That's obvious.  And so that's where I got that from.  I say that the system of white supremacy is the strongest religion in the world.  Because what is a religion?  A religion is a strong belief backed up by action.  and nobody has ever come up with a philosophy stronger than the system of white supremacy and put it into action.  Other people are running, trying to catch up.  They'll say, well, I have a religion, but I'm having problems trying to practice my religion.  Those people keep interfering with my religion, and my religion is at a disadvantage.  Say, for example, I'm a Christian, but people are always opposing me as a Christian, and this is a real struggle trying to keep this Christianity thing going, and I'm having problems trying to get people to follow the Christian religion, and they're being persecuted.  Well, the white supremacists don't have that problem because ain't nobody persecuting them.  I mean, hey, they don't take no guff from nobody.  I don't care what your religion is, your philosophy, or how much money you got if you're black.  The white supremacists said, hey, You ain't seen money like me.  I'm a white person in the system of white supremacy, and I am money.  I'm walking money.  Any money that you have doesn't mean anything until I say so with your black self.  That's why the code says the system of white supremacy is the most powerful religion ever thought up.  in the minds of the people of this planet.  I don't know about other planets, but on this planet they prove it every minute of every day. ",
