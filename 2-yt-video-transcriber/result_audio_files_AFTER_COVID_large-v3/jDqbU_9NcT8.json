            "text": "Hello there, my friends.  Chris Marcus here with you for Arcadia Economics and a quick video today to share some good news in that my book, The Big Silver Short, the audio version is finally ready, going to be released on Friday, March 27th.  And if you've been following the silver market or the gold market, but especially silver, I think you're going to love what you're about to hear.  Because basically the book used the interview format to talk with 15 of the world's top silver experts.  We had Craig Hemke, David Morgan, Andrew McGuire, Ted Butler, the Bart Shelton interview where he confirmed that JP Morgan was in violation of what Bart Shelton had told them was law.  All of that's in the book.  really getting to the heart of why did the price get crushed for all the people who bought gold and silver in response to what happened in 2007, 2008, 2009, all the money printing then and got clobbered on their trade?  and you're wondering why.  Well, this is the book for you.  You can find out how to get more information or to get your own copy in the link below.  That's right, right down there.  Go and click on it.  And with that said, again, I was really fortunate to have all these great experts together.  And as I've been doing one final proof through the audio version, it's really fascinating to me hearing the conclusions each person draws from their own perspective and how they all seem to match.  And especially at this particular time when we're seeing so much chaos in the gold and silver markets.  Once again, the Fed printing, demand surging, the world basically running out of physical metal.  So really excited to have the audio version of the book ready to go this Friday, March 27th.  Fortunately, the print version only a couple of weeks behind.  But if you wanted to hear more about why all this is happening this weekend, while it's happening, Well, again, click that link below.  Get your audio copy of The Big Silver Short.  And with that said, thank you for watching, and I think you're going to love it. ",
