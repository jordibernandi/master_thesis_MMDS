But if I'm being honest, I didn't have time to find the National Geographic Tucker's talking about, but only because he didn't show the article or say what issue it was from.  But I did find that the majority he's referring to is 52%.  OK, so Tucker, go on. ",

I'm not bigoted, I think most immigrants are nice.  Except a simple web crawler search would discover your video from two months ago about how immigrants are more violent and commit more crimes than non-immigrants.  It is 11 minutes longer than the segment where you say you're not bigoted and also most immigrants are nice.  Anyway, in this other video, after first casually saying that Democrats need illegal immigrants here for votes, he claimed that Democrats are now saying this.  First of all, Okay, Tucker.  Second of all, what you're actually talking about is Democrats saying that Dreamers should stay because they're not criminals.  It's literally a requirement of DACA.  But, sorry, go on. ",

But it seems to be from a study by John Lott from the Conservative Crime Prevention Research Center, a study which has been called into question, a study that's only about Arizona, and a study that is notably an outlier.  So, despite all of the evidence showing immigrants don't commit more crimes than non-immigrants, Tucker, sure, most immigrants aren't nice.  Go on.  Yeah, of course it's in just one state, because it's the only state mentioned in the only study you could find that would let you spend the next 10 minutes talking about how immigrants are criminals and diversity is bad.  Oh, you have more, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.  Oh, it's just one dude?  You're citing an outlier study that's methods have been called into question and one dude from California?  Cool, man.  Real good.  The point is, in your other video, when you say, most immigrants are nice, you don't really believe it.  And you're only saying it so you sound less biggity when you complain about immigrants.  But sorry, that was my point.  You're talking about this town's influx of Hispanic immigrants.  What's your point? ",

What are you talking about?  We went to the moon.  Shut up, Tucker.  You think human beings aren't designed to handle change or migration or learning languages or adapting to our environments or... Meeting people?  This is more change than human beings are designed to digest!  You made that up, Tucker!  You made it up!  You f***ing Claude!  Anyway, this concludes our one-time segment that we like to call, So I guess just maybe cool it on the white supremacist stuff, Tucker.  Yes, that is what it is.  And I did find the article, and I read it, and you definitely stopped reading after the seventh paragraph when they mentioned the demographic shift, Tucker.  It's 66 paragraphs, Tucker, and you only read seven of them.  One of them later on reads, while the angst over the coming demographic shift might make for more uncomfortable race relations, it might finally usher in a reckoning in which America faces hard truths.  The founding fathers built white dominance into the fabric and laws of the nation, and a country that proclaims to love freedom and liberty is still struggling with its roots in the original sin of slavery.  Tucker, didn't your show get canceled after a guest went on your show and just described your show to you?  You'd think with all that spare time, you could have actually read past the seventh paragraph of the 66 paragraph article, which I know you didn't do because in your clip, you mentioned how people returning to Hazleton can't communicate with people when they return, except the only mention of people returning to Hazleton is in the third paragraph where a woman talks about a yearly festival and how lately she doesn't want to go because she feels like a minority.  And sorry to say, Tucker, the only mentions of communication in the article were passed where you read in the 53rd paragraph where a bartender talks about warming up to learning Spanish.  and in the 14th paragraph about how in 2010, Hazelton's mayor at the time tried to pass an anti-immigration law that also would have made English the official language of the town, but it didn't pass because it violated US law.  Also, that guy's a congressman.  now, Tucker.  You craven dunce.  Please have a guest on your show.  describe your show to you again.  Wow, what a clip that was from the show.
