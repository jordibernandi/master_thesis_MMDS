            "text": "Hi, I'm Lance of the Serfs.  You might know me from such classics as the YouTube cancellation of April Fools.  It wasn't an April Fools prank, we actually got cancelled.  And of course, who can forget the Vosh saga, where playing Vosh on stream resulted in our channel getting taken down for seven days.  So yeah, we've been cancelled and resurrected a number of times, and this one is a little bit different, but it's in a similar vein.  So recently we were watching the Democratic Debate, streaming it live on the old Twitch channel, and all of a sudden the stream went dark.  And myself, as well as a whole bunch of other lefty streamers, Majority Report, Chapo Trap House, David Pakman, Central Planning Committee, Justin R. Young, Bad Bunny, and TriHex all got taken down.  One after the other.  Well, I shouldn't say one after the other.  It's just like all of a sudden, boom, they all got taken down.  And there's one thing, and I think one thing that's pretty distinct that unites all these streamers, It's drugs. ",

            "text": "I mean, I guess the only thing that really associates them all is they're all political streamers who are pretty firmly in the Bernie Sanders camp.  It was pretty interesting.  It's almost as if all the new media streams, or at least a lot of the prominent ones, in relation to leftist discourse were all taken down simultaneously.  Two biggest exceptions being, like, Destiny and Hassan.  I don't even bring my... I don't have any guns on me.  Why are you saying... Of course, yeah, there's a lot of theories you could put forward if you wanted to.  I'm not going to really speculate on any of that.  There was a commonality between them all.  They all happened to be Bernie Sanders supporters.  They were all on various different positions in the political pentagram.  I don't know if I would go as far as characterizing this as a deliberate attack.  Things do get strange.  They do get strange.  It's almost as strange as the fact that you carried all that paper.  There's a lot of paper down there.  Seriously, what?  They can't all have pertinent information on it.  You can't.  It's political.  Of course, consulting and legal services.  Let's check out the events section.  We help ensure your data, content, and other work remains yours and is utilized in an optimal fashion.  We are your stalwart advocate.  Praxis protects our clients' work and content in a heavily competitive and sometimes ugly marketplace.  All this of course is made with CARD, which if you check out what is CARD, it's just a simple, free, fully responsive one page site for pretty much anything.  It's basically how to make a website in two seconds with no skill.  And so yeah, not really any information, no employees, not much, sure.  Click on contact.  It says, contact, questions, contact us, offices, Washington,  D.C.,  Jersey City, New Jersey, Reno, Nevada.  Wow, three offices, three.  That's incredible.  They have multiple satellite offices.  Who knew?  Amazing.  Again, made with Caird.  This contact doesn't have an email, which seems odd.  That's because I'm showing you the most recent version of this website.  It's the one that you would see if you clicked on it right now.  However... The links for all of this I'll put right in the description of this video so you can check it for yourself.  But both the links here, which is legal at praxispole.com, as well as contact at praxispole.com, are not real email addresses.  They go nowhere.  I can't stress this enough.  These were the email addresses used to file all these DCMA claims.  So they're coming from a website that was established 12 days ago that has satellite offices, apparently, in three different major cities, has two email addresses, neither of which work, and now both of which have been deleted from their website.  I mean, normal stuff.  Long story short, we don't have any conclusive evidence that this was a coordinated attack on all these... specific news programs.  I mean, I'm a dumpster fire.  I completely accept that.  That's totally fine.  But still, I don't think you should be allowed to do a DCMA attack without any kind of verifiable evidence behind it on a streamer and shut their entire livelihood down.  I mean, for myself, it's a 24 hour ban, so it's not that bad.  But for other people, this could risk their entire livelihoods.  And it's just because someone randomly who may not agree with you politically had the ability to do that strike on your channel.  And for certain people who already have DCMA strikes, this could risk making them lose their livelihoods altogether.  Which, I don't know.  Free speech warriors, are you out there?  Every single one of you should probably have something to say about this.  I mean, it's not like you want to come across as hypocrites, is it? ",
