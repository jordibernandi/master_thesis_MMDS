            "text": "Followers of Christ were never meant to be closed-minded religious fundamentalists.  That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Anytime somebody talks about our father, mother, or some genderless deity, they are speaking the language of paganism.  They are speaking doctrines of devils.  This is paganism.  Where did you get that from, sir?  Well, hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  There was a man in the New Testament named the Apostle Paul, and he had a couple of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the ministry.  One of them was a younger preacher named Timothy.  And he wrote two letters to Timothy, and he placed a heavy emphasis to this young preacher, telling him that he needs to emphasize doctrine.  And he did it right here, of course.  I'll just show you in the eSword program.  1 Timothy 1.3 talked about doctrine.  1 Timothy 1.10, 1 Timothy 4.6, 1 Timothy 4.13, 4.16, 5.17, 6.1, 6.3.  In 2 Timothy 3.10, 3.16, 4.2, 4.3, he all talks about doctrine, doctrine, doctrine, doctrine.  In the first century church, they heavily emphasized doctrine.  That is abundantly clear.  But the modern church is not doing that.  The modern church is treating doctrine like it's some sort of relic.  It's almost as if it's a very conservative grandma in a very liberal family.  It's, you know, we love you.  We're glad you're here.  We understand why you're here.  But we have a lot more fun when you're not here.  And so with that, the emphasis is not really on doctrine anymore in Western churches.  The emphasis is on entertainment and flashiness, feel-good dynamic messages. ",
