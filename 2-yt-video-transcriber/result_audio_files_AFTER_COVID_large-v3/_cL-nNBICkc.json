            "text": "The President has asked me to give you a status update on his historic landslide victory over Joe Biden.  As everyone knows, things are going perfectly as we move towards our glorious leader's next term.  The next of many, many, many more terms to come.  Glory!  What was that?  Yes, technically we have lost almost all of our lawsuits challenging the fact that once again black people were allowed to vote this year.  The cheek.  But we always planned to lose every case.  No follow-up questions.  Because we love democracy so much, we are working around the clock to get inconvenient votes nullified on technicalities.  What was that?  well, technicalities like they were for Biden.  And towards this effort, I would like to give a special thanks to Lindsey Graham.  He's been so tireless in undermining the so-called results of the Georgia election.  Goodness, I don't know where the poor thing finds time for gentleman callers.  But the dollars on the nightstand tell another story.  Please.  Stop asking me about all those lawsuits.  Judges rather rudely laughed out of court.  We are confident in the outcome of our legal strategy.  What could go wrong?  Our elite strike force.  Legal team is headed by the brilliant minds of Rudy Giuliani, seen recently in a major motion picture diddling himself in a hotel room.  And Jenna Ellis, a creationist obsessed with micropenises, recently seen on RT, the Russian propaganda channel.  What was that, Sidney Powell?  The gal who shows up to press conferences in a metallic velour leopard print bathrobe?  As Mariah Carey might say, we don't know her.  No, I am not a real lawyer, which technically makes me indistinguishable from Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani.  The important thing I want to remind our glorious leaders cult evaded followers is while we drag out the process with disposable lawsuits, important thing is that you keep giving Mr.  Trump your rent money.  What's the point of keeping your lights from going out if the light of our lives is going out of office, friends?  If you get an email from Lara Trump saying, dear, your name, at dinner tonight, Eric asked, has your name given any money to daddy?  And I checked.  We were disappointed to find that your name, you haven't your name.  If we always have 1000% matching funds lying around, why are we so thirsty for cash?  We send 17 emails a day begging for $5 donation.  That was a very rude question.  And I don't have time for your negativity.  because I am concentrating on the next phase of this project, shaking down the mega cult for contributions for Mr.  Trump's second and third inaugurations, also known as the Family's Legal Defense Fund.  Glory! ",
