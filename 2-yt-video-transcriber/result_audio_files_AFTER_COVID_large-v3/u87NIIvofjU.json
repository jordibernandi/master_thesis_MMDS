            "text": "Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premier source for Second Amendment news.  We have some breaking news here.  I've been watching the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation craziness that's going on right now on the Senate floor, but I just got off the phone with Tim from the Military Arms Channel and he got some information today.  that is unbelievable if you're not in the game, but if you're in the firearms community, It's to be expected, unfortunately.  We're talking about the ATF again.  The same ATF that has done a 180 on just about everything.  They're also deciding that any braced AR, AK, pistol, similar type weapons are now considered AOWs, any other weapons, and that would put them all under the NFA, subject to a tax stamp.  So Tim was contacted earlier by one of the largest attorneys in the firearms industry.  And the information that Tim got that absolutely needs to go public, I need you guys to share this video.  Please, share this video.  But the information that we now have is serious.  First off, I get a lot of people in the videos I do about the ATF that say Trump's not doing anything.  And I am the first to tell you, look up my videos.  I criticize President Trump every chance I get when he does anything against the second.  In fact, it's some of my best viewed videos with the most hate.  So you're not talking to a full-blown Trump fan here.  So make that number one.  If you're new to the channel, understand that, please.  What I'm telling you is that President Trump did sign an executive order to have all these alphabet agencies cease their regulatory practices.  He signed an executive order to stop that.  But the ATF is thumbing their nose at the President and the DOJ and going around this executive order by saying that their decisions are fluid and not formal.  And that's allowing them to get around this executive order and not be held accountable.  So there's a lot of stuff in this letter.  If a gun is too heavy, or the barrel is too long, the ATF will not consider it anymore for importation.  That means that no more pistol versions of those rifles will be importable.  And a lot of the stuff in this letter is hinging on Joe Biden becoming president.  So what would happen?  Why is that a thing?  Because Joe Biden would rescind that executive order and all this stuff becomes law and everything that we've been talking about on the ATF the last week on this channel is going to affect us seriously.  We also now know that the ATF has been writing private letters and correspondence and messages to companies revoking their approval to manufacture certain weapons.  Basically, no new firearms with braces.  Which means that if a company is manufacturing those or if you have already purchased one or built one then you're either possessing or manufacturing an any other weapon, which would make you a felon for illegally possessing an AOW and violating the NFA.  Tim wrote on his Facebook, and I agree with him, when the bump stock issue happened, a lot of people that are pro 2A said, ah, I don't use a bump stock.  It's stupid anyway.  It doesn't make a gun accurate.  It's just a toy.  It wastes ammo.  Who cares?  It's not the hill to die on.  And a lot of us were saying, dude, you don't understand that if we allow the government to do this, to rename a piece of plastic as a machine gun, then where will they stop?  Now, in the last couple weeks, we've seen the issue with Q and the pistol brace, and I've gotten a lot of feedback on my videos from people saying, wow, why would you use a pistol brace?  They're stupid.  It's just a person who wants to have an SBR.  yeah all right we get it but however we just can't turn our back every time there's a friggin infringement now.  how is this going to be informed?  a lot of people I know want to know this and they're asking the same thing like who's going to come do this?  it's going to be enforced on the local level?  all right you're going to have cops who don't know what they're doing who aren't sure what a pistol brace is who could potentially lock you up for an illegal SBR and they'll submit that to the ATF.  and the ATF is left to go.  you know what?  Yes, that's an any other weapon, and they didn't have a tax stamp.  And that's who's gonna enforce the NFA, guys and gals.  A majority of the cases that are dealing with the NFA when it's criminal charges are done by the states.  What they're ultimately after is they want no more AR pistols.  They want no more AK pistols.  We've also learned this week that they want universal background checks.  Don't forget that the 4473 form recently changed and all the information on your name and the firearms that you purchased with a serial number etc.  are all on the front page and they're gonna record that.  What's that?  That's an illegal registry.  guys and gals.  The ATF is way, way beyond their means right now.  They need to be reeled in something fierce.  And I need every single one of you watching right now, and everybody who watches this one, you all forward it, hopefully.  Please do, please forward it.  You all need to contact your local representatives.  Now, I don't want to hear, that's not going to work.  We need to put the pressure on.  We did it with the pistol brace issue, and it was changed.  However, they're waiting for Joe Biden to win.  And if he wins, we are in for the fight of fights.  Believe me when I tell you.  If you haven't already, get out and vote accordingly.  Vote like your guns depend on it because they absolutely do.  I'll have a link down below so you can figure out who your representatives in Congress are and how to get ahold of them.  I need you guys to get on the ball.  It's time to put some pressure on these people, tell them they're real in the ATF, and it's time to let them know that we the people are sick and tired of their constant infringements, and we the people aren't going away.  Tim, I wanna thank you, my friend, for getting the information to me and allowing me to bring some of it out here, guys and gals.  If you're not following Military Arms Channel, you're crazy.  Check him out.  He's gonna have more on this as time goes by, and he does a hell of a job.  Tim, thank you, my brother.  Ladies and gentlemen, fellow patriots, please like this video, share this video.  This needs to crush the algorithm because they're not gonna want this to be seen.  And subscribe to the channel if you haven't already.  Until we see each other again, my brothers and sisters in arms, be safe, stay vigilant, and carry a weapon.  I'll see you on the next one.  Take care, everybody. ",
