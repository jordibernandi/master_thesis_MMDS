            "text": "The power of walking away.  So the first part here is going to be about men just walking away in general from what society tells you is supposed to be important.  So an example here is that, you know, the power we have as men of walking away and just, Hey, I'm out, I'm out.  That is one of those things that in your own life, you'll be able to, um, use that power, harness it for great things in your own life.  When you walk away from society's expectations of you, when you walk away from having to please everybody, when you walk away from having to please women, when you walk away from having to deal with, let's just say this, walking away from a job that you no longer, it's no longer benefiting you or you're no longer passionate about.  When you walk away in general in your own life you can take a lot of power back individually because you realize you have the power to walk away.  You literally have the power to do it.  It's a choice.  It's a mindset.  It's a philosophy you live.  It's a lifestyle.  The ability to walk away is powerful.  So in your own life, you walking away, you're gonna be able to take back power.  because when you walk away from one thing, all right, let's just say that you go, hey, marriage is never for me, and you walk away from that whole thing.  You now can just rid your mind of a lot of crap that the average guy has to hold on to.  You know, all that crap about, hey, well, when are you gonna find that girl?  And then it's like, how long do I date her before I propose to her?  And then when I propose to her, we get married, and then what kind of house are we gonna get?  How many kids are we gonna have?  All of that crap you no longer have to deal with because you individually just walk away.  That adds power to your life because now you go, whoa, those are questions I don't even have to worry about now.  Now I get to literally just focus on what do I want to do?  What do I want to do in my life right now?  I don't have to worry about other people's expectations.  So the first part is like when you just walk away from society, you gain a lot of personal power back and you is a whole of society.  when enough men do this, then yes, there will actually be a big shift in society because men are important.  We create everything.  typically i can't say everything but most things that are important men create.  so as men start to walk away in larger and larger larger numbers there will be an effect.  so the first part again is you walk away from society's expectations.  you do your own thing in your life and you gain back a lot of personal power because now you can invest your time and effort into things that you actually care about, not other people's dreams, not her dreams of a perfect wedding, not your parents' dreams of having grandkids and all that stuff.  You finally get to take back Your power and decide where you want to invest it in.  That is a big benefit when you just walk away from society's expectations.  Just a beautiful thing about men going their own way.  But now let's go more individual.  When you walk away from an individual relationship or when you walk away from even just... Some girl matched with you on online dating and you like her.  Oh, you're getting excited.  And then you decide, you know, I'm going to walk away.  Okay.  Here's why I think walking away is the best medicine for anything.  Because we know that.  women get a lot of attention from men.  We just know that.  Day to day, they're gonna get a lot of attention, but we also know that women love attention more than anything.  Whether it's negative attention or positive attention, they love attention.  So here is why walking away on an individual basis in your individual relationships is far, far better than like tornadoing away, all right?  When you're able to just literally just, okay, a girl's not playing back.  She's not texting you back like you want.  She's not asking you questions, all that.  Instead of trying to tornado away and like getting angry at her, you think you're better than me?  Well, screw you.  You're going to hit the wall someday and then you're going to wish that you had a chance with me, right?  That would be tornadoing away.  You're causing this big ruckus.  When you do that, you're giving her negative attention.  She knows that she affects you.  She knows that in some part she controlled you because she controlled your emotions.  She made you react.  So when I say walk away, and I mean quietly walk away, it's so peaceful on your own sanity.  when okay a girl i don't like how a girl treated me.  i just don't text her back i don't respond to her message and guess what i never have to.  she might come back and apologize to me.  she might send me three or four texts again every time i can decide whether i want to um engage in that text or just walk away ghost basically right ghost or ghost her out.  That, guys, is so much more powerful when you ghost, when you walk away silently than when you tornado away.  That is what I really want this message to get across.  because, again, when I do give strategy videos out and I get a lot of guys that are just like, whatever, if she's not giving me what I want, then I call her out because I'm doing men a good thing.  I'm calling her out because she needs to know she can't get away with that.  It's like... She understands she can't get away with that when everyone in her life ghosts her.  They just don't even give her that negative attention either.  That is what I mean by walking away as opposed to tornadoing away.  That is far more powerful than stomping your feet, throwing a fit.  and reacting because that reaction is negative attention.  That is still her winning in that case.  So for your own sanity, And if you actually want to make a statement, literally silently just walk away.  Don't text your back.  Don't tell her why you're gone.  Let her figure that out on her own.  And maybe she doesn't care, but guess what?  You don't give her that negative attention that she can feed off of by tornadoing and throwing a fit.  That makes you look off your center and all that.  And why would you give her your precious energy?  Energy is a thing, right?  Even though you can go, I just sent her that and that made me feel good.  It's like, no, no, you just built up all that anger and frustration into that text and you send it to her.  You just gave her your energy.  You gave her attention.  So my, again, my kind of strategy is walk away, but do it silently.  Do it on your own terms.  This is again why as a whole, when men just literally walk away, Yeah, it might not seem like it's gonna make a difference with one person doing this.  But when women walk around and they can no longer get positive or negative attention from men, that is when a huge shift will happen because women thrive on attention.  But right now, what a woman can do is she can go out to the bar, she can get all dressed, she can wear a low cut, low, you know, showing off her cleavage.  She could wear that out to the bar.  And if a guy comes up to her and gives her positive attention, she wins.  she gets the attention she wanted.  If a guy comes up and gives her negative attention, walking up and just going like, why are you wearing that?  You look like a slut.  Something like that, right?  She wins, she's getting attention, she's getting noticed.  So how do us men win?  Is silently walk away and improve your life.  Make your life better and on a maximum scale.  when men do this and they don't throw fits, right?  That is why if you're a guy that comments on all the MGTO posts and it's like very hateful, very much like women are evil, they ruin your life, all that stuff.  It's like all that negative attention is still, you're investing that into women as opposed to like, hey, ah, I just do my own thing now.  Eh, yeah, oh well.  Just like me, like girl doesn't text me back, I don't care.  I don't text her, hey, why didn't you text me back?  I don't go, oh, hey, should I have done something differently?  It's like I just go, eh, I don't care.  I don't give any type of attention.  That is the power of walking away.  So to just recap that, here's my question to you.  Do you think it's more powerful for men Is it whole to silently walk away?  Or do you think it actually is more powerful for men to storm away?  And like the girl that doesn't reply to you on online dating, do you think it's more powerful for you to put her in her place and tell her, you're gonna hit the wall and all that crap?  Do you think that's more powerful?  Or do you think it's more powerful to just give her zero attention and silently walk your own way?  that's what.  um you know that's a question i'm proposing to you guys.  is it better to walk away silently or to walk away in a fit?  what do you guys think?  let me know below.  but either way hey walking away taking back your power is a beautiful thing and you can invent and i guys i know that on my channel that i talk about women a lot And a lot of you guys already know this, that if you're doing your own thing, you're walking away, it's like, you have plenty of time to do whatever you want.  It doesn't have to be to date women.  I spend such a small minority of my time actually dating women.  I do such little effort in the whole process that that's just a really small part of my life.  A lot bigger part of my life is running this business, coaching men, reading, hanging out with my family, hanging out with my friends.  Much bigger part, but obviously when you come to my channel, It's all focused on this area of basically dating bachelor women, but understand that that's because that's what my channel's about, but in your own life, right?  When you remove your attention from society's expectations, you can put your attention on so many other cool things that will benefit your life in a lot of ways that you didn't even think before.
