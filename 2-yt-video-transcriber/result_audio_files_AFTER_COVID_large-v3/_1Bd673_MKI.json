            "text": "Good morning, everyone.  I hope you all had some sort of a sleep at this point in time because that's important in this crazy world, crazy situation we're going through.  And I'm barely getting like an hour here or there.  And there's reasons because of that.  And I feel charged at the moment.  There's a lot I want to say.  There's a lot I want to get at.  And to me, the best outlet to do that is by videos and by making content.  And I want to address something first.  I got a message the other day from Debra.  Debra was saying, where's Edge?  Now, Edge and I still run this channel together.  She's still here.  She's just got a lot going on at the moment.  Things that she's sorting out.  But we're still doing the weekly podcast every week, and we actually record in about six hours for our next podcast, which is going to be Pills of the Matrix, where we talk about the red pill, the blue pill, and some other obscure ones that maybe you people haven't heard of.  That's all playing a part in the global consciousness at the moment.  The reason I wanted to make this video is because There's a lot going on when it comes to censorship and what we're seeing with big tech.  They're full draconian moves at the moment to silence a lot of dissenting voices.  And we have to find a way because this is just the reality of it right now.  We have to play smart when it comes to these big tech platforms.  Places like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, if you're still on it.  I don't know why you'd still be on it.  It's a dinosaur.  But I understand Facebook for family communication and stuff like that.  It's hard for us to completely go off all these platforms.  But we have to be smart how we conduct ourselves because at the moment, during this purge they've got their bots running trying to pick up keywords or certain things that we say in the videos and that's why we always try to be very careful with the content that we make on here.  and there's certain things we don't say and there's certain things we don't mention and that's very important in the comments to certain mantras because they're hunting real two groups at the moment.  they're hunting any large right-wing commentator or anybody that is associated with a magic letter.  That's the reality of it.  We have to put ourselves or try to put ourselves into their mindset.  And their mindset is this group is extremist.  Now, this is just the way they think.  So that's why they're hunting it.  And that's why they're trying to take it down in any way, shape or form.  So just be careful how you play your games because we have to play our moves very careful.  Have you ever seen the movie called The Boat That Rocked with pirate radio?  I definitely suggest watching it.  But that's how I feel at the moment, trying to navigate ourselves around this minefield, this digital minefield, because that's what we're in.  A lot of people are strictly going to old tech platforms and that's a good thing.  It's really important to grow old tech.  Really important.  It's one of the main moves that we have to do at the moment to try to break away from the monopoly that is big tech.  But it is also very important to have a presence on sites like YouTube because that is where the bulk of either young people or uninformed people or people that just are confused or trying to find information.  Sometimes there's some videos every now and then that can break through the shadow banning, that can break through the censorship.  And we've had a couple of videos do that.  So there is still a way to get new eyes on people that want to listen or the people that are interested or people searching for some form of truth or just a different narrative.  And like Edge and I's goal on this channel, kind of our mission statement when we started making content was the main reason we wanted to do this is because we wanted to change hearts and minds.  We didn't want to make it strictly political or strictly one way or the other, but we wanted to try to create a space where people could come to learn or maybe change their opinion or just find something new or find something different that is not getting elevated and pushed up by either big tech or certain political parties.  Because dissenting voices at this point in time is one thing they do not want.  They do not want people to challenge the narrative.  And they do not want people to look any further into certain situations or certain events.  Now, on alt tech, unload.  Do what you want to do.  Say what you want to say.  But just be careful on these mainstream platforms.  Because as soon as they pick you up, they'll take your channel list.  They'll take everything.  This is full Gestapo purge at the moment.  And it comes in waves.  at the moment they're hunting and even on your personal accounts there's.  there's a lot of channels that i've found lately that are really good at navigating the wave.  they're really good at staying moderately in the middle and really really well at playing their tos even though in the end it's probably not going to matter.  maybe on the worst timeline this is, it's probably not going to matter.  They'll come for everyone.  That's on the worst timeline.  But in the meantime, we can try to hold this for as long as we can get more people over, grow a bigger, larger community.  with the diversified vids that we put out like if you've known if you've seen over the last few days you know i've jumbled a few different things.  i'm trying a few different things.  our podcast is still once a week with edge and hopefully what i'm hopefully hoping in time when ed has a bit more a bit more space to navigate things, that she will also start doing videos like this as well on her own.  So that's the goal going into the long run, me making independent vids like this, her doing that as well, and having our podcast once a week.  And that's how we kind of want to push this.  And we also want to talk about different subjects.  We're not always going to be covering what... certain news or what's fresh, but we are going to try to give people a break.  Like our new podcast that should be out in a couple of days.  That is something a little bit different to listen to instead of getting too caught up in this narrative of what's going on now.  So be safe.  Watch yourself online.  Tip tone.  Be like a digital ninja at the moment.  Because that's how we're just going to have to do this.  It sucks.  We shouldn't have to.  But that's the reality of it.  And that's the perception that we're getting from the world at the moment.  Just be smart.  Hold yourself.  Alt tech.  Unleash.  Do what you want.  On these mainstream media platforms, slowly, slowly, just be undercover a little bit.  Um... And another thing, and I keep saying this every video, and I will always try to put this in when it comes to my mind.  I know this time's hard at the moment with people juggling different emotions and a lot of people taking the black pill, a lot of people taking the white pill.  A lot of... Different mindsets going around about what's going to happen, what's not going to happen.  Worst case scenario, best case scenario.  The only thing that we control at the moment is ourselves and what we do.  How we react to the situation.  And if those things don't work in our way, then... how we conduct ourselves from there.  It has to be about yourself first.  That's why I always say try to go back to the gym.  Try to grow your inner world because that's extremely important today, tomorrow, and for the future.  You've got to build up that inner kingdom.  It's going to be so important moving forward because this fight, this battle that we're in, it's going to be a long one.  It's going to be a long one.  And we have to dig in and do everything we can in our power to come out on top, to witness, to change hearts and minds, and to change ourselves in the process and the world.  So focus on that.  Try to have a good day.  This is the speaker.  Stay ravenous. ",
