Obviously, it was very interesting last night from Bloomberg accidentally admitting the bought politicians.  But everyone else is talking about that, too.

Biden's always been known for gaffes, right?  But I think there's a little, there's a little bit more, by the way, than gaffes.  In the past, Joe Biden, like people may say, like Barack Obama said 57 states, or George W. Bush would say nuclear.  President Donald Trump, I'm sure there are some in there.  Cafe Fe, okay, that's a tweet, really, but that's just probably, he just was like, I don't need auto-correct.  He thinks that he's better.  He thinks he can beat the system.  He's the kind of guy to have Google Maps, and he thinks he can beat the map.  You can never beat the maps.  It's true.  Which doesn't give you a lot of hope for AI.  But Joe Biden would make up stories about times that never happened with people he's never met in places that don't even exist.  And it used to be just a guy with no accountability who didn't think that anyone was going to fact check him at all.  But I don't see that anymore.  I really don't think that he's in on the joke.

And this is an example right there of someone who doesn't have any self-awareness, Joe Biden.  I think Joe Biden thought he was going to waltz through this.  And so like JFK with the jaundice and all the painkillers and all the affairs and the venereal diseases, he just thought no one's ever going to know because everyone loves me.

He does not know that the internet exists and that this will exist in perpetuity, and he just doesn't realize that people are going to be fact-checking.  him, and that's really been his Achilles heel here, is just that people can say, rewind.

I often say, by the way, or we've talked about this.  But that word whisker is me trying to encourage you to think.  Check this show.  We've talked about this.

I don't want to play by a double standard.  I don't think Vice President Joe Biden is racist.  I really don't.  I think that's kind of just a little bit tone deaf, like a somewhat ignorant aunt who might not be super familiar with black people, confuse them because she thinks they all look alike, you know, that kind of thing.  It doesn't mean that this person is racist.  I just think that it is piss your pants funny.  And here's another one.  that's, again, I don't know if it's just a word whisker with Vice President Joe Biden, because he doesn't correct himself.  Do you notice that?  No.  The one time actually he corrected himself yesterday.  He said, oh, no, wait, let me, and he corrected himself and repeated the exact same thing.  Oh, boy.  So you have to look up to him for the consistency.  Even his corrections, we need to know how many Pinocchios.  And he said, well, that's the same amount of Pinocchios as before he made the correction, because there wasn't a correction.  It's just, it's still Pinocchios.  This one, I don't know.  He never corrected it, so I don't know if he believes it, if he was poorly equipped, or again, when you add this up cumulatively, just like cumulative concussive syndrome, maybe he has some dementia going on.  where he talks about gun violence.

Could you imagine if President Donald Trump, or let's just go back to George W. Bush.  Yeah.  had something that wrong, you know, had it off by, say, 150 million?  Because at that point, I think the number is 400,000.  I don't have the sources with me.  Again, I'm going by rote here.  You guys fact check me.  I think it's 400,000 total gun deaths since 2007.  I could be off plus or minus a few.  Let's even say a couple hundred thousand.  But with 150 million, that's not even a rounding error.  He's basically off by $150 million.  No correction.  And I watched the post-game round.  I watched Anderson Cooper.  I watched him and Don Lemon, you know, the hosts you could fit in your back pocket who all saunter.  They all sashay on back to their homes and their old repurposed firehouses in the West Village and then wonder why they're out of touch as to anyone who could be voting Donald Trump.  I watched those shows, and none of them said $150 million.  Wait a second.  Here's the thing.  I don't expect much from you, CNN, or ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, anyone.  Just how about every now and then?  Every now and then?  just a little, huh?  That's all I want.  I just want, huh?  Not even a syllable, really.  Just a guttural, huh?  Even, you know what, in, hmm, would suffice.  Hmm.  That's it.  You don't even have to repeat what he said to force him to question whether he's right or wrong.  You know, if someone just maybe said with Joe Biden in his meetings, 150 million?  If someone said that to me in our pitch meetings, I would say 150 million dead.  If someone said 150 million, I would go, wait, is that wrong?  You're off by 149.5 million.  Thank you for correcting me, quarter black hair.  I would have embarrassed myself on national television.  Well, the internet, but let's be honest, more people are watching this in the debates at this point.  It didn't even trend for the first hour.  Nobody cares anymore.  Just break off some pool cues.

The soundbite is funny, right?  Makes no sense.  But then he almost seems as though he drank a bucket of salt water.
