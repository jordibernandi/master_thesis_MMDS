            "text": "Let me propose to you a paradoxical statement.  If you ask today majority of people, they would have probably said in Europe, yeah, in some sense we are Christian.  Then if you ask them, but Christianity means a certain set of theses.  Do you remember, do you, sorry, do you really believe that 2,000 years ago a guy was walking around in Palestina?  who was God?  15%.  They did in Slovenia, maybe we are a perverted nation.  You know what I mean?  Read the book by, I think it was Pierre Vidal-Nacquet, Did the Ancient Greeks Believe in Their Gods?  Where he demonstrates that it's clear that belief in practice means something else.  They were not stupid.  They didn't think.  if you climb on the top of Olympus, you would see there, I don't know, Zeus screwing Aphrodite or whatever.  It's not, it was something much more mysterious, it's more, you know, the paradox of belief, and here I think you should search for absolute, is that first, we unconditionally want meaning.  Let me give you an example where I hope we'll agree, and I think it's a nice example of ideology today.  Why do we eat organic apples and buy them?  I think most of us know probably this is to a large extent bullshit.  But it makes us feel good.  You buy organic apples, so, my God, I'm doing something great.  I'm helping Mother Nature.  It's a big solidarity movement.  I'm sorry, I don't buy organic apples.  Neither do I, my God.  No, I like genetic, nice.  No, sorry, but let me go on very briefly so that I stop.  But at some point, You know what's for me nonetheless the problem, and I appeal here again to you in all this.  Listen, let's be clear.  Something is happening today, nothing religious or whatever, which may affect the very meaning status of being human.  Our very sensitivity... feeling of ourselves.  doesn't it imply I'm here.  I think reality is out there.  the moment you can reach up to a certain extent they can already do I think directly link to a computer your thinking so that for example you no longer even need the famous Stephen Hawking.  But I told my god in London, I saw it myself, they presented machine for crippled, I don't know what's the politically correct term, where you just think forward and the machine moves.  It's still very elementary, but all these genetic manipulations, this is what I see as the real problem, not any metaphysical nonsense of Nietzsche's \u00dcbermensch.  something will probably emerge, I'm not talking anything great, which is in conflict with many of very fundamental representations of what we think is to be human.
