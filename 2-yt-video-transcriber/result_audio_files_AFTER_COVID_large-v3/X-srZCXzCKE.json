It has nothing to do with Dankula's comedy.  Wink, wink.  You know, and I said it was unrelated, so what are you talking about, man?  If you're going to lie, at least be good at it.

But in case I offended anyone, I should clarify that I don't think Dankula is a white supremacist or that he has anything to do with the BNP.  Nor did I ever say he did.  Apparently I ignored the much more central point that the black man was being racist towards white people and... I had thought about doing the whole response where I watch his video and then pause and say, that's wrong.  and here's why.  But for the sake of my audience, I'm just going to put it in a pinned comment below so I can talk about something more interesting.  And if you think that makes me a soft boy, beta Marxist soy brain, you're wrong.  I was already all of those things.  Instead, I thought I'd talk about something that's a bit closer to home, freedom of speech.  Because Marcus isn't just a comedian.  He's also an activist who opposes British hate speech laws on the grounds that they allow the government to infringe on people's human rights.  Here he is in a recent video where he offers his seasoned activist perspective on the matter. ",

I could get bogged down here and question exactly how left-wing he thinks Tony Blair's government was, but maybe I don't need to.  Because what he probably won't tell you is that the Communications Act was mostly made up of laws that already existed, but had to be repurposed for the internet and to consolidate regulatory powers under a new organization called Ofcom.  These laws came under the Telecommunications Act, section 43 of which contained this very familiar passage, which deemed it criminal for someone to send a message or other matter.  that is grossly offensive.  Quite poetically, because I know how much Dankula likes his Orwell references, The Telecommunications Act was passed in 1984 under a conservative government.  Of course, this was a long time ago, but as for the conservatives today, Dangula had this to say about them. ",

And whilst the Tories aren't doing anything to help, they're also not doing anything to make matters worse.  However, since the return to power in 2010, the Conservative Party have also introduced laws such as the Snoopers Charter, which requires internet providers and phone companies to hold people's data for at least 12 months.  In 2014, they briefly banned British porn producers from depicting what they deemed content that is not acceptable.  Their list of categories which met this definition included face-sitting and female ejaculation.  And they say we don't need feminism anymore.  And in 2015, they radically expanded on Tony Blair's prevent strategy by making it the duty of schools and universities to denounce people who were showing signs of extremism.  The policy has been frequently criticized for having little success in catching extremists despite being fairly aggressive.  People as young as 13 have found themselves detained and questioned. ",
