            "text": "Thank you.  Thank you.  How you doing, sir?  You all right?  Yeah.  What's going on?  You tell me.  What's the reported for?  Who are you with?  San Antonio Police.  San Antonio Police?  Yes, sir.  I was trying to find out, speak to an officer.  Where do I need to go?  Do me a favor real quick.  Yeah.  Hands out of your pockets.  No, I'm not going to take my hands out of my pockets.  Hands out of your pockets.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What are you doing here?  Where do I need to go?  What are you doing here?  I'm part Scottish and I'm part Ireland.  Do I need to go back to Ireland or Scotland?  Because you guys told some Mexican to go back to Mexico.  Okay.  So I'm just trying to figure out where I need to go.  You need to go.  Follow that road.  Shut up.  Scotland or Ireland.  Those are your two choices.  Otherwise, I don't want to hear your mouth.  You get out of here.  You get out of here.  You get out of here.  Shut the fuck up and get out of here.  Bye.  Goodbye.  You're going to leave before I do.  And you're going to leave.  And you're going to leave.  And all those folks are going to leave before I do.  Guarantee you.  What's your name and badge number?  Can you see it?  I can't read it from here.  What's your name and badge number?  Your policy requires you to give name and badge number.  And you guys violating your policy is what's causing everything that's going on right now.  It's in your manual, bud.  What manual?  It's in your operating manual.  What operating manual?  When a citizen requests name and badge number, you are to provide it in a courteous manner.  Where did you see that up in the manual?  It's in your manual.  Which manual?  What's your name and badge number?  Somebody want to let him know that in your policy manual, when a citizen requests name and badge number, you're supposed to provide it in a courteous manner.  I cannot read it from here.  I'm not going to get close to him.  So I just need a name and badge number.  I can see McKenzie 600.  I can't read.  You got your phone in front of your name tag, dumbass.  So what's your name and what's your badge number?  This is why these things are going on.  I just want to know, do you know where I need to go?  I got Ireland in my blood and I got Scottish in my blood.  You guys told a Mexican to go back to Mexico.  You did.  So I'm just here to find out where I need to go.  Ireland or Scotland?  Who told you that?  we said that?  It's all over the news, man.  I haven't followed it, so I've been here.  Chief McManus said that should have never happened, but you guys told him to go back to Mexico, and I just want to know where I need to go.  Where are you trying to get to?  Scotland or Ireland?  Where are you trying to get to?  Well, I'm Scottish and I'm Irish.  But so you're in San Antonio.  Like those Mexican guys needed to go back to Mexico.  That's what you told them.  So where, I mean, here, where are you trying to get to?  I'm just trying to find out from the police where I need to go.  You guys tell Mexicans to go back to Mexico.  It's all over the news.  So I'm just trying to figure out where I need to go.  Do you have anything to say about those officers that told those Mexicans to go back to Mexico?  Nothing.  You're going to cover for them?  You're going to cover for them, right?  That's the problem.  You're in danger right now because of bullshit like this.  So get the fuck out of here.  I don't talk to bad cops.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Keep covering for the bad cops, bro.  This ain't going to stop.  And you're going to leave before I do.  What time you get off?  What's your name and badge number?  If I can't read, I got a personal problem.  You see?  Hey, man, this is the jackass.  Jackasses like this endanger your lives.  You want to know why bottles and shit are getting thrown at you?  It's jackasses like this.  You're a jackass.  Fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Shut up.  Shut up, bitch.  Get the fuck out of here.  Go back to work.  Fuck out of here.  Anybody else that wants to cover for bad cops, get the fuck out of here.  If you're not going to cover for bad cops, I'd love to talk to you.  I'll talk to you politely all day long.  But if you're going to do some shit like that and cover for people like that, I've got nothing to say to you.  You guys know exactly what I'm doing.  Did you guys see on the news?  The San Antonio police officer?  A Mexican man was walking up to a shooting and said, hey, why are you guys so quick to pull out your guns?  And the cop told him, we do what we got to do.  You don't like it, go back to Mexico.  That's what he told him.  It's all over Kins 5 and Channel 12.  So I just came out to talk to a police officer and find out where I need to go.  I thought you were talking about the center.  This has nothing to do with the center, man.  Hey, the center does a great job.  That's what I thought it was about.  I was like, oh man, who is rude?  so we can get that straightened out?  No, no, no, no.  The center is great, man.  I know what you guys do here.  I've been here before.  He doesn't know who I am.  Okay.  I don't know you either.  No, you guys do a great job.  This has nothing to do with the center.  I just wanted to find out where I was going to go.  Okay.  They don't support you, man.  Get the fuck out of here.  Don't step on this property.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't hear what you said.  I said, don't step on the property or you're being warned to be arrested.  Why don't you issue me a trespass warning?  I already did.  How do you know who the fuck I am?  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.  Bye.  I told you you were going to leave before me.  See, guys, cops like that is what causes bottles and shit to be thrown at them.  Yeah, you're killing your own people, man.  You're killing good cops.  That's what you're doing.  Hey, hey, I bet you I talked to the director and they let me back on here.  I bet you I do.  Watch.  Mark my words.  You're a bad cop.  Trespass me because you don't like what I'm saying.  Bad cop.  You got blood on your hands, brother.  Blood on your hands.  He's explaining to him right now.  that if I step on the property, I'm going to go to jail?  I ask a simple question.  Where do I need to go?  Hey, man.  If I come on the property, you better call him.  You lay your hands on me.  That'll be the last time you lay hands on somebody.  Guaranteed.  Be the last time.  Bye-bye. ",
