            "text": "Good morning.  Welcome to Viking Preparedness.  I am Pastor Joe Fox.  Gonna talk today about the coronavirus and the threat of the coronavirus, and it's not what most people think it is.  So we're gonna do that.  As I've been thinking about this video, I think this video I'm also going to share with YouTube on Widio Wednesday.  And so because of that, today we will inaugurate another thing here on Viking Preparedness.  After this video, I'm gonna shoot Tactical Techniques Tuesday.  Yes, a second video in the same day, two days in a row.  So that'll come up after this one.  And so because this is going to YouTube, YouTube, we shoot videos like this every day.  Almost.  Every now and then I don't shoot one.  I don't shoot them for Shabbat Saturdays.  But generally speaking, and if you average it, it's more than a video a day.  We have write-ups for the Warriors, Jarls, and Berserkers.  I put my novel out there in little segments for people to read.  You should come check us out.  It's a whole dollar a month.  It costs, what, three cents a day.  A little bit more in February.  Because there's not 30 days or whatever.  So, if you like this, you should come.  All right.  Wuhan Corona Virus.  Not the flu.  Got it.  Lots of people in China sick.  Lots of garbage going on around the internet about this, that, and the other thing.  And people just lap it up like hungry, you know, doomer dogs wanting more and more.  Scare me more.  Scare me more.  It's significant.  On the worldwide scope, the sickness from the Wuhan Corona virus.  And really, it doesn't matter how or why it started.  Not to you, it doesn't.  Not unless you're some kind of microbiologist or something working on a cure.  If you're just Joe or Jane Everyman, it just doesn't matter, right, how this thing started. ",
