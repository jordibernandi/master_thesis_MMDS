            "text": "For what?  For what?  For what?  For not having plates?  I don't get it.  What am I being detained for?  Yeah, I'm going to listen.  Okay, I work.  I just told a long hanger right there.  Okay.  I have a police officer.  I have a regional belief that you may have been committing some kind of crime.  What'd you pull me over for?  Because you don't have place.  Okay.  You're uncooperative with me.  I asked you if you could roll down the driver's side window.  By law, am I required to roll that window down?  I'm talking to you right here.  That's fine.  You can ask me all the things you want to ask me.  I'm in the car.  My partner's closer over there.  That's fine.  It's not reasonable for you to have the window down or up.  Well, if you want, I'll roll this one up.  You come talk to me over there.  Whatever you want, man.  I'm not going to step out of the car because you pulled me over for a traffic, I guess, violation or something.  And it has nothing to do with a criminal investigation.  I just told you for once for not going to court for a stupid traffic ticket.  Okay, listen to me, okay?  I'm listening.  Okay.  What do you use that clothes hanger there for?  What do you mean?  You know what?  I don't even... Wait, why do you have a clothes hanger in the back seat?  I'm done.  I go to the gym.  I go to the gym.  I go to the gym.  You have wrists like you're going to the gym right now.  i'm not going to the gym right now.  i go to the gym.  that's why i got towels.  okay what's up with those mechanic gloves?  what?  so what did i just tell you?  i do look that's fine.  man.  i know you want to find a stupid excuse to get in my car.  it's not going to happen today i'm not.  it's not going to happen today.  i'm letting you know that right now.  i don't know why this fool's all up in my car right here.  you're talking to me right here.  what's going on?  man i know you want to pull me out the car for for nothing.  you you you saw my my record.  you saw what's up.  I didn't look at your record.  Well, you should.  You should go back and check it out.  My partner checked it out.  Well, then he has no probable cause to get in my car.  Other than... We don't want to search your car.  I'm asking you to step out, man.  That's good.  No.  As soon as I step out, you guys do whatever you want.  I'm not stepping out.  I'm not stepping out.  I'm not being aggressive.  You guys are not showing any act of aggression either.  So let's just keep it peaceful.  Like, we're good.  Like, you pulled me over for no plates?  Okay.  Do what you got to do.  It looks like you're writing me a ticket already.  Continue.  Finish.  You can't tell me what to do, man.  Okay, well, hey.  I'm done answering questions.  It sounds like you just want to take me out the car for no reason.  This shit happens all the time, man.  I already know.  Regardless of what you tell me, whatever stuff happens all the time, I'm telling you as a police officer's perspective, people who break into cars, I'm not saying you are, but from what I'm seeing in your car, you're not saying I am.  You're not saying I am?  Okay, thank you very much.  That's fine.  I don't believe that's a probable cause to pull anyone out of their car.  Yeah, just leave it alone, man.  Look, write me the ticket and I'll be on my way.  I'll sign that shit.  I don't care.  Hey, look, listen, man.  I'm gonna explain to you one more time.  Okay, listen, you got no plates on the car, okay?  You got a clothes hanger there.  that's extended.  Okay, you got gloves.  You got towels.  Okay, start, start.  paint a picture in your head that's fine.  you can paint whatever picture you want.  what if i was an old lady driving with the same stuff?  i'm not gonna get into what if what ifs.  but that's not what it is.  it's just.  i know i'm young i i got it.  okay i got a white t-shirt.  okay.  well why are you mentioning the stuff in the car?  don't worry about the stuff in the car.  i don't have a there's.  there's not a look i don't have anything.  i don't have anything with parking issues.  I don't have anything illegal that you can see.  I'm not asking if you have anything illegal.  And there's no probable cause for you to get me out of the car.  Detain me, nothing.  I haven't done anything wrong other than there's no plates on the car.  I don't need probable cause to detain, okay?  I need reasonable suspicion.  So you can go over there and just tell that lady, hey, I'm detaining you.  I'm not here to deal with that old lady.  Okay.  I'm here to deal with you.  Okay, well, deal with it.  All right.  Deal with it.  Well, I'm not letting you take me out of this car.  I'm my own supervisor current right now.  and address to you what's going to happen.  You're going to bring in a supervisor, you said?  I'm having a supervisor right now.  Okay, that's cool.  Bring more people.  Hey, you know this window doesn't roll down or you don't want to roll it down?  You refuse to roll it down.  Okay, I'm going to stand right here until my supervisor gets here.  You're being uncooperative with me, man.  By law, am I supposed to cooperate?  By law?  You know law, right?  You know about reasonable suspicion.  Hey, I'm not a lawyer.  I'm not a cop.  I'm none of that.  So let's see what's up.  I'm on my lunch break, by the way, so you guys are just delaying me.  You're causing it, man.  By what?  By doing what?  How am I causing this delay?  You're making it harder than it has to be, man.  I don't want to search your car.  Okay, good.  Then don't.  Why do you need me to get out of the car?  For what?  I don't get it.  What do you need?  Why can't you identify me?  I got my ID.  I gave you my license, my registration.  What else do you need?  Man.  Okay.  Look, this window is wide open, man.  I don't get what... Yeah, but you're causing an officer's safety to me.  Okay, look.  We'll go over there to the sidewalk.  Go to the sidewalk.  And I'll roll the window down.  But you roll it down and I walk around.  Walk around.  Go.  I'm going to roll this one up.  And then I'll open this one.  What's up, man?  What?  What?  Dude, I don't get it.  What?  You're making it difficult, man.  I don't get it, man.  I don't get what you guys want.  Look, man, you're videotaping yourself.  Talking to me, that's fine.  I'm crazy.  I like videotaping myself.  What's up?  Listen, I don't care.  I'm not asking you your mental capacity, nothing like that, okay?  Mental capacity?  What's that got to do with anything that's going on right now?  What are you trying to take me out?  What are you trying to take me out of the car right now?  God, listen.  Come on, man.  You're an adult, right?  You're an adult, too, man.  Exactly act like one.  Okay, you got it, man.  Roll down the window.  There you go.  Walk around.  This guy.  Dude, you're making me fear for my life right now.  Making you fear for your life?  Yeah, you guys are up to something fishy.  I don't know what's going on.  Why are you guys playing musical windows over here?  You're the one that's rolling one window, rolling one down.  I don't want my windows all down.  For what?  I don't need you guys sticking your hands in here.  For what?  Come on, man.  Just look.  Make it easier for both of you.  I don't get it man. ",
