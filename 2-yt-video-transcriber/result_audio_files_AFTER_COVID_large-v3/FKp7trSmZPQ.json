It's a circular calendar as opposed to the solar calendar, which is the Greek and the Roman calendar or the Gregorian calendar.  And that is a linear calendar.  So one is seasons.  The other one is times.  Times are always linear and seasons are always circular.  Okay, so it's important that we do understand both, both calendars.  From the 5780, we moved into not just the year, but the decade of the pay.  The 80 represents, actually represents a mouth.  It represents a mouth or a pay.  And how fascinating is it that the year we moved into the decade of lining up the mouth of God, that our mouths are commanded to be covered all over the world?  How amazing is it that as we enter into the year where we're supposed to declare the breath of God, the saying that everyone has heard of for justice is, I can't breathe.  Immediately, immediately, as soon as we entered into this, there was something different that began to take place.  Huge opposition.  But in the year, in the year 5780, which is the year 2020, we saw the changing of the wineskin like we've never, ever, ever seen.  We have seen a worldwide mandate that you must change your wineskin because I believe that there's about to be an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the Lord doesn't want to waste this wine.  So He caused us all to change our wineskins.  IT'S NEVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH THAT THE ENTIRE PLANET EARTH ACTUALLY HAD TO CHANGE ALL THEIR METHODS, HOW THEY DO EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE BODY OF JESUS ALL OVER THE WORLD HAS HAD TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. ",

But brother, we live in a very different world.  Now, so we move from.  it's not just the year of the pay, it's the decade of the pay.  So we're still in that.  But now we have a one attached to it.  Fifty seven.  Eighty one.  And we know the one is the head.  It's it's the it's the beginning.  It's the head.  It's the authority.  So if we look at if we just look at the numbers five, seven, eight, one.  And I know that, you know, this brother, but I'm just going to explain it for the sake of anybody that doesn't.  ANY SINGLE HEBREW LETTER HAS THREE DIFFERENT VALUES.  IT HAS A PHONIC SOUND, OKAY, AND THEN IT HAS A NUMERICAL VALUE.  BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE NUMERAL SYSTEM, THEY USE A LETTER SYSTEM, AND THEN IT ALSO HAS A PROPHETIC PICTURE.  SO IF WE LOOK AT 5, 7, 8, 1, THERE'S ALREADY A HUGE REVELATION.  IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES A FIVE MEAN, THE SEVEN AND THE EIGHTY-ONE.  OKAY, SO THE NUMBER FIVE IN HEBREW LITERALLY IS, WELL IT'S A HEY, AND I'M GOING TO BUTCHER THE HEBREW LANGUAGE.

The eye means you need to look and you need to be watchful.  The plow means you need to take action and you have to be a part of the harvest.  You have to be a part of the harvest.  You have to be connected to the kingdom and you have to take action.  The next one is a fence.  You have to be separate.  You're going to have to have a different spirit.  You're going to have to have, you're going to have to, your new source is going to have to be a different new source this year.  And then the ox means to be strong and to lead.  I think that we're going to see some of the same things this year.  that's going to carry over from last year.  But I can tell you this, there's also going to be a new thing.  There's going to be a definite separation of Kingdom people this year like we have not seen before and an authority that is given unto Kingdom people towards the harvest.  REMEMBER, SAID, WE ALL HAD TO CHANGE OUR WINE SKINS.  AND JESUS SAYS, IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THE WINE SKIN, WHENEVER HE GETS READY TO GIVE YOU NEW WINE, THEN YOU RUIN BOTH THE WINE SKIN AND THE NEW WINE.  THIS NEW WINE THAT IS ABOUT TO BE POURED OUT WILL NOT BE WASTED.  THERE'S ANOTHER FASCINATING THING, TOO, WHENEVER I LOOK AT THIS, BECAUSE If I look at eight plus one, eighty one, that equals nine.  And then I also know that nine times nine equals eighty one and nine is a biblical kingdom number for fruit bearing.  OK, so the redeemed version of that is, of course, you know, there are nine fruit of the Holy Spirit.  That's Galatians 522.  And by the way, five plus two plus two equals nine.  And Galatians is the ninth book.  within the New Testament. ",

Galatians is actually like the manifesto of Christian freedom.  You can be free, right?  So in the midst of all that, I'm telling you that nine is fruit bearing all the way through the Bible.  It has to do with fruit.  And by the way, it takes a woman nine months to have a child.  Of course.  So this is a year that a baby is born.  And if you're not sure of that, if you're not sure of that, the 81st verse in the Bible, remember, it's 5781.  The 81st verse in the entire Bible is Genesis 4-1.  And Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain.  And she said, I have acquired a man from the Lord.  There's going to be a lot of people this year that's going to say my baby has finally been born.  The thing that was hidden within me, the thing I had always hoped for, the thing I have labored for.
