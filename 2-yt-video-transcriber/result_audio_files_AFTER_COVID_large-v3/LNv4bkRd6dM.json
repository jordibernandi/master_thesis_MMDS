            "text": "Do you believe you're treated differently in the workplace because of being black and female?  100%.  Matter of fact, 200%.  Mind you, I am a project manager.  One.  So automatically when people hear that, they're like, oh, okay.  And then they're like, oh, you're in pharmaceuticals on top of that.  So if you know pharma, that's big money.  And I am, as always, even back in school, the one black female in the company, not even in the department, the company, everybody else is white or Asian.  That's it.  A couple of Hispanics, you know, here and there peppered in, but it's really just me and It's always been that way in my life.  So it was, it's just, I know how to navigate those waters.  It's, it's just, you know what I mean?  Like I don't even think about it.  However, I am very conscious of when I'm being mistreated, slighted, pushed aside, discriminated against because it's obvious, you know, if you're not black, you can not see it.  I don't want to hear shit.  Okay.  Period.  If you're black, you know it and you see it.  And when I experienced stuff like that, I'm not talking to other non-black people about it because they don't see it.  And it's incredibly frustrating in the workplace.  And I experienced that at my last job, you know, not from the company, but from my boss.  She was the worst, fortunately.  I had an incredible staff that, you know, cradled me and protected me because they knew she was just, you know, not playing with the full deck.  But eventually I had to leave because it was just abusive.  And that's what Black people experience in the workplace where it's not really diverse racially.  There is this underlying, you know, level of abuse that black people deal with.  That is just disgusting, but it's not like we can talk about it because HR ain't black.  Okay.  The CEO ain't black.  No one, the VP is not black.  You know what I mean?  So who can you talk to with power to help you?  Nobody.  So you're on your own.  That's what it's like. ",
