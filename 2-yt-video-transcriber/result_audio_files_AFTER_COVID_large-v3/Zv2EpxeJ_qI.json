            "text": "Hi, I'm JustSomeGuy and today I'm going to talk about The Last of Us Part 2 leaks and rumors.  So if you don't want to hear those, here are some nice videos you can watch instead.  Feel free to like and subscribe.  if you enjoy those videos, and if you think you're subscribed, double check, YouTube is doing its thing again.  In the meantime, let's spoil this alleged shit show.  In my previous video about The Last of Us Part II, I said that if the rumors about the game weren't true, then Naughty Dog should release a statement clarifying that because otherwise the rumors would turn people off.  Well, they released a statement.  Quote, We know that the last few days have been incredibly difficult for you.  We feel the same.  It's disappointing to see the release and sharing of pre-release footage from development.  Do your best to avoid spoilers, and we ask that you don't spoil it for others.  The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands soon.  No matter what you see and hear, the final experience will be worth it.  That's not exactly a denial baby.  Oh fuck it's all true ain't it?  Like I said in my first video, I figured they'd kill Joel, the main character from the first game.  That just seemed like the direction they would go in.  I also assumed they'd play up Ellie's sexuality since they made a big deal of it after the first game's initial release.  They put out another short game section where you play as Ellie hiding out with her girlfriend, and this made the rounds as the most important GLBTQMNOP plus asterisk hashtag up down left right whole day press start moment in gaming history, when it's really just an excuse to have two little girls kiss.  The new leaks though really make Part 2 look worse than before.  Some disgruntled employee released actual rendered cutscenes showing Joel getting beaten by whatever the fuck this is supposed to be.  Rumor has it that Abby, yes this is supposed to be the woman, you heard that.  right, that's supposed to be a woman, I know it doesn't look like a woman but that's what it's supposed to be, the woman who kills Joel, and is also supposedly transgender.  There's no confirmation of that.  It appears to come from a site called Sausage Roll which claims that some unnamed source who worked on the game gave them this info.  I wouldn't trust it.  However, I wouldn't put it past Naughty Dog given that literally no one's come out and said that any of the rumors are false.  We've gotten the pre-release footage from development line which only means that at some point this was the plot.  We've also gotten this response from Neil Druckmann, writer and co-director of the game.  Quote, heartbroken for the team, heartbroken for our fans.  We're still incredibly excited to get the game into your hands.  Nigga, is that a haiku?  Your game is about the bomb.  You don't have time for haikus.  Then we've got the other director, Kurt Marganaw.  Endure and survive.  And mute.  Dude, stop reciting lesbian slam poetry.  Next you're going to be telling us all about your angry vaginas.  This is a complete mess.  The worst kind of PR nightmare for a game.  Not only has the plot been leaked, but you delayed responding to the leak, allowing the rumors to spread.  You've got people flipping out over how this allegedly transgender character basically murders a lesbian couple because she got rejected, which is what the internet came up with all on its own.  The information leaked from the employee states that after Abby kills Joel, the player then switches from playing as Ellie to playing as Abby, who chases her down for the second half of the game, eventually killing Ellie, meaning you as the player have to kill the main character you've grown to love.  And the game ends with Ellie's friends wanting to get revenge against Abby.  Mind you, this is set in the middle of a flower zombie dystopia.  But instead of dealing with that and how to cure it, we've got alt-right Christian homophobes, a clam-slammer spectacular, a psychotic, it's ma'am, and a ridiculous revenge plot that feels more out of place than a hot woman in a western game.  The character design alone is bad enough.  Yes, there's probably not a lot of makeup post-apocalypse, but there's a disturbing trend in Western games of presenting women not only as mannish in their physical build, but deliberately unattractive.  I can show plenty of examples of this overt decision to un-woman female characters.  And when compared with Japanese character designs, it's a stark contrast.  That doesn't mean that every Western game features ugly women.  only that there's a clear intent to make the women, and only the women, look unattractive.  This is done under the claim of diversity because all women don't have to be feminine.  However, when so many female characters end up looking like this, or basically being male characters wearing a female skin personality and plot-wise, it's hard to say that this is about diversity and not really about pushing an ironically feminist agenda.  But to take a very simple premise, Survive a zombie apocalypse and try to find a cure and then ignore that premise so you can bitch about evil Christians and pretend that every woman is a button pusher is just ridiculous.  It's entirely possible that the rumors and leaks are complete bullshit, but it's not very likely.  If they were total nonsense, somebody would have said something by now.  At this point, it looks like the rumors and leaks are more likely true than false, at least plot-wise with Joel and Ellie's death and the Christian nutjobs.  The rest of it may be bullshit, but the damage is already done.  I'm not buying this game.  I may download it if it's made free on PlayStation Store, but I'm not spending a dime on this thing until I know exactly what happens.  And thousands of other people are reacting the same way.  I really enjoyed the first game.  And to take this interesting story and butcher it just to play politics is a testament to what happens when you listen to con artists like Nia Sarkeesian and other feminist busybodies.  Let this be a lesson to developers.  The time for playing politics is over.  People are tired of being lectured and they're tired of the far-left propaganda.  Focus on making good games with great gameplay and solid stories or you'll find yourself more unwanted than a lesbian at a Catholic seminary.  But what do I know?  I'm just some guy. ",
