            "text": "I am literally telling you that they're murdering these people and nobody will listen to me.  These people aren't dying from COVID.  They don't care what is happening to these people.  They don't.  I'm literally coming here every day and watching them kill them.  It's like going in the fucking twilight zone.  Like everyone here is okay with this.  the only way i can kind of put this into context for everybody is and this is going to be kind of an extreme example.  this is like really the only thing i can come up with is like if we were in nazi germany and they were like taking the jews to go put them in a gas chamber.  i'm the one like they're saying hey this is not good this is bad this is wrong we should not be doing this.  and then everyone tells me hang in there You're doing a great job.  You can't save everybody.  But these people aren't dying from COVID.  Let me give you several examples here.  An anesthesiologist intubated the patient's, I think it was right, bronchi of a patient, and they couldn't get the SATs up.  And for about five hours, we were waiting on a chest X-ray.  to confirm that the placement was wrong and in the meantime while we're waiting for that and we've told the anesthesiologist that it was placed wrong because like literally only one side of his fucking chest is like inflating.  Um, he dies.  A patient had a heart rate of 40 and the resident starts doing chest compressions on him, which is not what you do.  You just externally pace them or you give them some atropine.  And then, you know, I run in there to stop him from doing chest compressions on somebody with a fucking pulse.  And then he decides to push epi.  He throws some pads on them, on him to defibrillate the guy in bradycardia.  Okay.  He has a heart rate of 40. in a stable you know bradycardic rhythm.  we just need to give him like some atropine and pay some.  he defibrillates him and kills him.  and i was literally ran out of like the patient's room to get.  like the director of nursing was standing out there and i'm like can you stop him?  he's going to kill that patient.  he's going to kill that patient if he defibrillates him with bradycardia and a heart rate of 40. and the director of nursing just shook his head and i turned around and he killed the dude.  There was a nurse who placed an NG tube into some guy's lungs and filled his lungs with tube feeding.  There was a nurse who confused a long-acting insulin with a short-acting insulin and gave 30 units of a fast-acting insulin and killed the guy.  It's just here.  they're just gonna let them rot on the vent.  They're medically mismanaging these patients.  And, like, I'm not a doctor, guys.  I'm not professing to be a doctor by any means.  But there's, like I said, basic standards of care that we have to do.  When somebody's low on blood, like literally on the brink of a critical low blood level, we should replace the blood.  But I asked the residents and they're like, does he have internal bleeding?  And I said, no.  Then they're like, well, we're not replacing the blood.  Well, here's the thing.  And these COVID patients, they all eventually need a blood transfusion.  Their blood, like, if you don't have enough blood to actually oxygenate your body, the vent settings don't fucking matter.  Because you have no oxygen carrying capacity of your blood.  We have a nurse who fell asleep at the fucking nurse's station.  while we were all in rooms and her norepinephrine ran out and the guy had no fucking blood pressure and didn't perfuse his brain and i'm pretty sure his brain did.  that same nurse is now running a crrt machine a dialysis like machine that she has never done before.  she said she'll figure it out.  i'm pretty fucking smart and i figure a lot of shit out but i would never attempt to try and figure out a CRRT machine on the fly.  We are adequately staffed.  There's a shit ton of staff in there.  And we have a nurse who does CRRT in there.  She has a different patient load.  We told them, like, hey, let's just swap these nurses so the one that knows how to work this machine can work this machine.  But they didn't want to do that.  So I'm pretty sure that patient will be dead here in a couple hours.  Nobody is listening.  They don't care what is happening to these people.  They don't.  I'm literally coming here every day and watching them kill them. ",
