So I thought, what the heck, I'll check with Antifa.  So I typed in antifa.com.  I wanted to go to the Antifa website.  You might want to try that for yourself right now, just for giggles.  Just get a web browser open and type in antifa.com.  For those of you that are watching this on a computer but don't have a computer handy, if you do that, you will be immediately directed to Joe Biden for President website.  It's too good to be true.  So it is, guys.  Undoubtedly, they're being trolled.  But the fact that they're allowing themselves to be trolled like this, the fact that it's a Democrat being controlled by controlled by conservatives is is crazy to begin with.  But what ended up happening, guys, was that it.  by accident took me to the biden harris official website and i have to say seriously.  now in all in all honesty this is just awful.  it is just just awful.  uh steve uh when we talked about this on our backstage show you uh you had the uh the singular pleasure of of making me laugh by um And then make me cry.  So why don't we just kind of walk through that procedure?  As far as the making me laugh part goes, what happens if you go to DonaldTrump.com and you find yourself with a 404 error?  The kind of thing where the page is missing. ",

And this campaign is going from.  we don't condemn the riots, so we do condemn the riots, except we haven't gotten Kamala Harris on board with the condemning the riots yet because there's nobody in charge.  Biden is just too frail these days to be the firm hand on his own campaign's rudder.  And so the campaign kind of just drifts along depending on who is trying to be in charge on any given day.  And that is a preview of what a Biden presidency would be like.  Whoever was the last cabinet officer or policies are to talk to him would be the guy effectively in charge of the White House until the next guy. ",

There's about seven or eight of them.  And the reason that I want an NDA on this is because I am now going to give you a master's class on how you tell stories with pictures and what a picture actually says to you subliminally.  When you get a message subliminally, it means it comes in below your liminally.  And it means that you're not going to be able to really know what it's saying.  But I'm looking at this website and it is unspeakably awful.  So even though this is a like a little running video, we're just going to grab stills and we're going to put them up there for you.  And I'm going to tell you what these pictures say to me subliminally.  And the guys are going to play along.  So we start off with this first video here.  It's a Biden crowd at a rally.  And I can say it's a crowd because I can see one, two, three, four, five, six people in it.  Six people in this crowd.  There's nobody standing behind them.  And here's something interesting that's gonna be something you're gonna see a lot of.  It's a low angle.  It's a low angle of a front row looking up at the sky.  What does that mean?  Well, the only reason you would do that was to hide the fact that there's nobody behind the front row.  Because if you had a gigantic crowd of people, you'd want a high angle looking down so that you could show the enormous crowds of enthusiastic people.  It's a bit strange.  And by the way, these people look like they just waited in line to see some minor celebrity and they ended up getting, you know... Tila Tequila or something like that.  There's not a whole lot of enthusiasm there.  Let's go to the next one.  So this one.  Now, this person looks genuinely enthusiastic and excited.  And my only concern about this particular picture is she is by herself.  There's nobody around her.  It looks like they found one person who was having an actual moment.  The guy in the background is looking in the other direction.  There's somebody in the other background.  Looks like they're being attacked from something just off camera.  But again, where is everybody?  Now, here's a picture of Joe Biden doing the big kind of handshake with a regular guy.  And I have to tell you that the makeup on Biden on this one is just terrific.  I mean, they didn't spare any expense.  They got the guy who does Lenin in the Mona Lisa.  They flew him in.  He looks so lifelike in this picture.  It's really astonishing.  Let's move on.  Here's a picture of Joe Biden, again, by himself in a drug store, talking to somebody with his box of Metamucil.  And I don't see a great deal of enthusiasm or crowd support here.  Now, this next one's really telling.  It's Joe Biden, again, he's always, he's never shaking hands.  He's always doing the kind of solid thing with the woman who appears to be Native American.  And that's great.  But take a look at this picture, folks.  You're in a yellow room that is the color of mustard.  I don't know what the room is, but it looks like a maybe a decent sized like faculty lounge or something.  And there's nobody there.  It's empty.  There's no one there.  There's Biden.  There's the cameraman.  There's a guy in between them.  And that's it.  That's the rally.  Not it's not working for me.  Here's a picture of Joe.  This is my favorite.  Here's a picture of Joe Biden talking to construction workers.  He saw by himself.  There's nobody in the background.  And if you look at the expression on this woman's face of the red jacket, it's like this is the booster.  These are the people that they look like the old man and up.  She's like, can you contain your enthusiasm for this candidate?  Please, please don't want you to have a heart attack.  Here's a picture of somebody walking down a desolated field, talking to somebody who's not Joe Biden, While on the left, Boston Robotics has their latest version of the animatronic Joe Biden that seems to be managing level terrain fairly well.  There's a similar picture of Kamala Harris.  I love this picture for many reasons.  First of all, it looks like it's the first time Kamala Harris has ever been outdoors.  Secondly, she's not looking at the farmer.  She's looking past him and she seems to be saying, you know, if we were to blow that dam up over there, we could probably put this guy out of business as well.  This is the only shot I actually thought had some soul.  and that I really liked.  You get the general idea.  But the final one is this weird shot of Kamala Harris going like this.  And Joe Biden is looking down.  He's got that look that you would have if you're cornered by somebody after a speaking event and you don't want to hurt their feelings, but you just kind of wish they'd go away.  So you don't really give them a whole lot of feedback.  I'll just close by saying, as I saw this site, there's a picture.  I think it'll probably be gone by the time you check it out.  But it's a. it's a picture from from the campaign.  And it says Joe and Kamala.  It's a picture of them.  They just did a live interview.  And it says a socially distanced conversation.  And I understand social distancing and stuff, Joe.  But if you're going to be talking to your vice presidential candidate, just because you don't want to spread the COVID-19 virus doesn't mean that she has to be in the next county.  You could have her six feet away instead of 40 feet away.  The whole thing is just aching, aching bizarre.  And to me, folks, this is an indication that this thing's just going to be just a blowout.

I've never seen such bad messaging, and I'm used to looking at Republican websites.  The very, very bottom of the Joe Biden website, it says this site is made possible by this, this, this, and this, and contains absolutely no malarkey.  And the final thought I had on this was whoever designed this website was saying, please, Joe, nobody's going to know what malarkey is.  And he's saying, no, no, we got to get that malarkey in there somewhere.  How are we going to get the kids otherwise?  Anyway, that'll do it for this no malarkey edition of Right Angle brought to you by the members at BillWhittle.com who are just the bee's knees.
