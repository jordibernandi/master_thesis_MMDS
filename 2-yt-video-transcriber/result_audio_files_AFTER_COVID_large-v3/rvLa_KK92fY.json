            "text": "can be used and held against you in a court of law.  Hold on.  So what I didn't realize is that's the... I'm going to politely ask a question.  I'm going to politely ask a question.  I'm talking.  I'm narrating right now.  I'm talking.  I'm talking.  Please stop talking.  Please stop talking.  You're ruining it.  So in that Miranda warning, so in that Miranda warning.  Oh no he didn't.  We're way ahead of all the cops.  We were literally right on top of the scene.  I'm going to keep my distance.  There's a guy with his arm around a guy.  So he keeps hugging the old man.  So he's giving him one of the bro hugs too.  So here's PD now.  Two more units.  There's a sergeant on scene, female.  Here comes the fourth unit.  Actually, I'm going to go over here so there's no fence in the way.  Okay, we got a second sergeant on scene.  look at that cop.  cop just stood in my way.  I'll stand right here dude.  Jesus Christ.  We'll play this game dude.  Of course, cops do that shit all the time.  Copy.  Copy.  The older woman in the blue dress is yelling at me.  She's pointing at me.  That's okay.  We're all good.  We're all good.  Uh-oh.  You know, the woman is livid.  The woman wants a piece of me.  You saying you want a piece of me?  I could drop you like a bag of dirt.  You want a piece of me?  You got it!  He has no business taking a picture of me in my house.  I don't have my listening ears on today.  I won't be engaging with any police today.  So this is the cop who got in my way.  I was standing over here and didn't have her in the shot, but he stood in my way, so I had to move.  And so now this is the same cop who is telling me, can you do me a favor and move back?  Move back off the sidewalk.  Yep, he has no right, but she's waving an American flag on her house.  Do you see that?  Poorly.  She's waving it poorly.  Lady, these are T.I.  confirmed.  Genocide.  Yeah, these are matters of public interest.  She's still going, look at her.  Her husband is restraining, physically restraining her.  No, I'm not taking pictures, I'm taking video.  60 frames per second if you really want to get technical.  That's whiskey drunk.  Boiled corruption.  Look at her, look at her.  So she's not upset about the five guys with guns ready to kill her son.  She's worried about the guy with the camera who might actually document the execution of her son.  Oh, I get it now.  Bootlicker logic.  Well, I was doing fine.  I was doing fine standing over there earlier, you guys, but you guys stood in my way, so... I haven't said a word.  Well, how does a cop know that I don't have dementia?  I mean, seriously.  Yeah, Tony G, you have the right to remain silent.  Remember, anything you say can and will... be used against you in a court of law.  That has to do with during the initial interaction.  So when I was a kid and into my adult life, I thought that that Miranda warning, what you said, once you were placed under arrest, was what can be held against you.  but no it's everything that you've said prior to that can be used and held against you in a court of law.  hold on.  so what i didn't realize is that's the um i'm gonna politely ask.  I'm talking.  I'm narrating right now.  I'm talking.  I'm talking.  please please stop talking.  please stop talking.  you're ruining it.  so in that Miranda warning so in that Miranda warning that can be used and held against you in a court of law.  Hold on.  So what I didn't realize is that's the... I'm going to politely ask a question.  I'm going to politely ask a question.  I'm talking.  I'm narrating right now.  I'm talking.  I'm talking.  Please, please stop talking.  Please stop talking.  You're ruining it.  So in that Miranda warning, it's the anything you say can and will be used against you.  Because let's face it, the police are more than eager at every time to... So it's probably a really good idea not to have any interaction whatsoever.  I don't think they're going to be arresting this guy.  I mean, this has got to be one of the longest investigations.  We've got two sergeants here.  We've got two other officers.  We've got a corporal and a regular officer.  We've got four units here.  And it doesn't appear that... It doesn't seem like this guy is going to be arrested, so I think their investigation is probably wrapping up here.  Go ahead.  Okay, give me one.  Just give me one second with this female.  This is kind of golden.  Just give me like two minutes.  They're wrapping it up.  No.  So... Yeah, no, I'm narrating here, yeah.  Oh, I take that back.  There's five officers, so... I wonder if that guy could get a tighter-fitting shirt here with a short sleeve.  He's ready to be featured on the 18 month calendar of Van Nuys PD.  Alright, I guarantee you we're going to.  We're definitely going to hear from this address again here today.  Sorry to bring you guys out here.  We're all good.  We're all good.  God bless you guys.  I'm going to take a walk down the street.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey.  Hey.  So I hope she doesn't drive off while she's operating her vehicle on her mobile phone.  All right, kids.  Listen, and that's why you stick through the call because you're never sure what's going to happen.  They had to give the directive.  And you guys saw that for yourselves.  I had a shot.  of I was off to the side here, that sergeant walked in front of my camera to block the guy that they were investigating.  And that's what made me move over to the TI area of the driveway.  And then they want to give directives as to how I'm not acting right on a public sidewalk. ",
