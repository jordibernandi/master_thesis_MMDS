I mean, do you believe that we have responsibility for our choices?  And how do you square that?  How do you explain that?  And here's how she answers. ",

            "text": "Well, the same thing with Jesus said, a tree will be known by its fruit.  And I mean, the Bible is filled with directives.  The New Testament is filled with directives.  The epistles by Paul are filled with directives, things that we are supposed to do.  We are supposed to align our lives with Christ because of our salvation.  Ephesians 2 says that we were dead in our sins, but we were saved by grace.  It's not your own doing so that no man can boast.  And so I think that's pretty clear that it wasn't our own doing for salvation, but because we were saved by Christ, we kind of live up to that salvation through something called sanctification, which is the pursuit of holiness and the pursuit of a righteous life, which does include all the things that, a lot of the things that you believe in, which not the cleansing laws, but a lot of the moral laws, which is giving to the poor and helping your community and living a life that mirrors Christ.  So are you choosing to do that or is that just something that you were already going to do and you're basically kind of just living it out? ",

            "text": "Okay, so you see he's still trying to push on the point because she didn't really answer the question.  She just points out that there are a lot of directives in Scripture.  We should be pursuing these things.  We are responsible for the fruit that we bear.  But he's still going back to, okay, but is that something you're actually responsible for?  Are you able to respond to those directives?  That's what responsible means to most people.  And so when somebody outside of the Calvinistic world hears Calvinism being proffered, they begin to go, okay, well, how do you square that circle?  How do you deal with human responsibility?  If God's just predetermined how you will live based upon some irresistible working within you, then How do you hold somebody accountable who's not given the necessary grace or the necessary revelation or the ability, morally speaking, to reply positively to those directives that are in Scripture?  How do you deal with that?  So that's what he's pushing on because she didn't really give an answer to the idea of human responsibility.  And this is where she's about to get into the conundrum issue.  And before she goes there, let's go to the namesake of the Calvinistic worldview, John Calvin himself, and remember what he said about this.  He says, What man's future was without God being implicated as an associate in the fault as author or approver of transgression is clearly a secret so much excelling the inside of the human mind that I'm not ashamed to confess ignorance.  Okay, so notice what he's doing here.  He's confessing ignorance about what?  Now, when you're reading old English kind of statements from Puritans and people who spoke different languages and it's translated in such a way, sometimes it's hard to follow the logic here.  So go back for what he's confessing ignorance on.  He's confessing ignorance as to how God could ordain everything, could bring about everything.  without being implicated as the fault or the author or approver of transgressions.  In other words, I don't know how God's character is not maligned in this system.  I don't know how we can say God is really good and that he's not at fault for sin.  I just, I don't know.  I believe that he is holy.  I just don't know how he's holy if this is true.  If Calvinism is true, I don't know how God's holy.  I don't know how his character's good.  That's his mystery here.  So he's appealing to the mystery of how God's good.  I just don't know.  I believe he's good, but I can't get my brain around how he's good if this is true.  That's what John Calvin is saying.  That's the conundrum.  John Calvin himself admits.  He even says, And there are quotes from Piper and MacArthur and Sproul who virtually all said the same thing.  This is the conundrum.  This is the antinomy, as J.I.  Packer points out, says it is.  It is a paradox, MacArthur calls it, as we just recently went over in a previous broadcast just a couple of weeks ago.  This is the conundrum.  This is the problem of the Calvinistic worldview.  And it's exactly what Ali is about to reflect on here as well. ",

            "text": "There is a balance that I think a lot of people get confused on.  when you hear Calvinist and you hear preordained, you think, oh, well, you don't believe in any free will at all.  And that's not true.  Now, I will say there is what kind of seems like a conundrum or a conflict between personal responsibility and absolute sovereignty of God.  So we believe that God is absolutely sovereign over everything.  There is no point whatsoever where he sits back and he just lets things happen or says, oh, whoops, like I didn't see that coming.  We believe in the absolute sovereignty of God over everything.  And yet the Bible is very clear that people have personal responsibility and that the Christians believe if you don't accept Christ, which accept is kind of a word that we don't really use in Calvinism, but that there is punishment.  There's eternal punishment for that.  There's eternal separation from God.  And so you are held to the consequences of your sin, to the consequences of the life that you live, and yet God is sovereign over all of that. ",

            "text": "Okay.  He's about to ask how to square that circle, and we'll get there.  But let's go over what she just said.  OK, so she first hits on free will.  She says, no, no, we do believe in free will.  Now, remember, Calvinists believe in compatibilistic free will, not libertarian free will.  Now, free will is typically talked of in a libertarian sense, meaning you have the ability of self.  In other words, you're self-determined.  Your choices are not determined by factors beyond your control or by factors outside of yourself.  In other words, God is not determining certain factors to make you only be able to choose A and not B or C or D or any other option, okay?  So when most of us think about libertarian choice, we think about contra-causal choice, ability to choose other than what we chose.  So if somebody rejected Christ, then the contra-causal ability would have been to have accepted Christ.  In other words, they had the capacity both morally and physically, not just the natural capacity, but both morally.  They were able to humble themselves and confess their sin or to suppress the truth and unrighteousness and grow hardened and calloused to that truth.  They had either option on our view, on Ali's view, on compatibilistic Calvinism, which is the free will that she's talking about, which is not free will at all as far as I can tell.  It's this.  You're free to do what you want.  Okay, so you're free as long as you're doing what you want.  Now, the problem with that view is that what your wants are are determined by something outside of yourself,  i.e.,  God's decree.  So God has determined what you will ultimately want.  by your nature, either from birth, you will hate God because that's not a factor within your control.  You're born a hater of God under Calvinism.  You can't control that.  You're just born that way because of the sin of Adam, because of the natural, quote-unquote, natural result of the fall, which, by the way, When a Calvinist says the natural, that's just another word for the decree of God because even nature is all decreed by God.  And so if they just say, well, that's the natural result.  Just remember that the natural result is what God has decreed.  So God has decreed for all people to be born because of the sin of Adam, to be born in a condition where they cannot be reconciled, where they cannot come to God's appeal to be reconciled from that fall.  That's by God's decree.  And so they're born in that condition for factors beyond their control.  They can't help the fact that they're born that way.  And they are ultimately condemned for something they have absolutely no control over.  They're born as a God-hater and God has passed over them.  God has rejected them before they were ever born or did anything good or bad.  In other words, God is not looking through the quarters of time on Calvinism and seeing how good or bad they are and therefore making his choice.  But his choice is completely and totally of himself.  In other words, it's what arbitrary means.  They don't like the word arbitrary, but that's what it means.  To make a choice without any outside influence whatsoever, but for his own glory, for his own good, for his own self-interest, he makes a choice to irresistibly, effectually change some people and leave all other people to go their own direction and to be God-haters as they were born.  And so when she says, yeah, we believe in free will, what she means is compatibilistic free will which is no less deterministic than hard determinism,  i.e.,  monergism.com.  That's the way they describe it.  It's no less deterministic than hard determinism.  They are born as God-haters by nature,  i.e.,  according to God's decree.  Their desire is such that they could not do anything but hate God.  unless God steps in and changes their nature and makes them want him, makes them have a new nature where they do want him, and then those are the elect ones.  Those are the ones who come.  Now, You hear that and you go, oh, my goodness, that seems very contradictory.  to hold somebody responsible for something that's beyond their control.  That's almost like racism.  And again, I know that's a touchy subject, but I don't hold somebody accountable for their skin color or judge them or treat them badly for their skin color.  Why?  Because that's a factor beyond their control.  that detests us.  But if Calvinism is true, how does a non-elect person have any more control over his natural condition than a person has over the color of their skin?  The reason we reject racism so vehemently is because of the fact that you're judging somebody for a factor that's beyond their control versus judging them for the content of their character.  Why is the content of their character more important?  Because we actually believe they're responsible for the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  Well, if Calvinism is true, then a person is born for factors beyond their control.  a God-hater, and he has no control over his ability or lack thereof to love, to follow God, or to hear his commands, or to humble himself and recognize his need for salvation.  And so it seems like how in the world can you hold somebody responsible for something they have no ability to respond to?  And that's the conundrum that she's talking about.  Now, she, like many Calvinists, sets up a false dichotomy.  Either God is in complete control, i.e.  determinism.  That's what she calls sovereignty.  which, by the way, sovereignty does not mean to control things, okay?  There's nowhere in any dictionary or lexicon where the word sovereignty, where you'll see the word control.  Go to any thesaurus and type in sovereignty, and you will not find the word control, okay?  Sovereignty means to rule as one wishes, to rule as one wants, okay?  He can rule however he wants to.  He sits in heavens and does as he pleases, Psalm 115.3.  That's sovereignty.  Verse 16 of that same chapter says that he gives the earth over to man.  So in his sovereignty, he can choose to grant a level of control or autonomy to his creatures as he chooses.  That's sovereignty.  In his sovereign right, he gives the ability of creatures to rule over their own decisions and choices for which they're held morally accountable.  That makes sense.  But to say that God is sovereign does not equal that God is completely sovereign.  meticulously controlling every thought, action, and deed of every single creature on this earth.  That's never established in the Bible, as far as I can tell. ",
