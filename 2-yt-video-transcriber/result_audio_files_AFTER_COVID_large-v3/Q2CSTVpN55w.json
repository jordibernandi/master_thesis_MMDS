            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.  The goal of these briefings and my weekly radio show, Operation Freedom, is to provide you information.  the bought-off, lamestream, fake media will not present or will not touch.  And boy, is that the case of late.  You saw the announcement the past day about how on this platform, if you have or speak anything about what occurred in this country on November 3rd, heretofore named 11.3, that, well, the video will be taken down.  And then after January 20th, you're going to get a strike.  And as you mount up the strikes, your channel goes away.  Okay.  So what are we going to do?  Well, here's what we're going to do.  We have davejanna.com where we have all of our content, the free content as well as the subscription content.  You're always welcome there.  We hope you'll become part of our Freedom family and become a subscriber and support what we do and how we do it.  The radio show is free.  So every Sunday from 2 to 5, go to davejanna.com, hit the Listen Live button.  They'll take you to WAMP Talk 1600 streaming service.  Hit that and you're with us.  Great guests, great analysis.  2 to 5 Eastern, we're there.  If you want the podcast, that's part of the subscription service.  if you miss the show.  Now, what are we gonna do about this video situation on this platform?  We're gonna keep it going, we're gonna keep adding to it, but it's ridiculous, a criminal, for me not to be able to speak about what occurred on 11-3 in this country.  This is off the charts.  So what we're doing, is we're declaring our independence.  So what we've done is we've set up on a different platform, Rumble, at Rumble.com, R-U-M-B-L-E, Rumble.com.  The name of the channel is Operation Freedom.  We hope every one of the subscribers from this platform goes to Rumble and joins us there, where obviously free speech is embraced.  Imagine that.  How unique.  If you told me 20 years ago that we would be in this situation today, very similar to Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, I would have told you you're nuts.  You know, before the election, any video I did on Hunter Biden and his money laundering activities was demonetized, pushed down in the search engines, you name it, essentially tried to make non-existent.  Now, all of a sudden, oh, look at the revelations about Hunt.  Stop it.  And here we go again.  If you missed the interview I did with Patrick Byrne, that, as of this minute, is still on this platform, but we've also moved it to Rumble, rumble.com, type in Operation Freedom Channel, and we're there.  And what I'm going to do is, I can't do this in the description section, or else this will get us bounced, so I'm going to put it in the first pinned comment, the first pinned comment underneath this video, I'm going to put the link.  to the Operation Freedom channel on Rumble.  Otherwise, just go to rumble.com, type in Operation Freedom channel, and then hit subscribe.  And there you go.  They seem to be very efficient, and it seems to be a very user-friendly channel that we've utilized so far.  And again, the Patrick interview, Byrne interview, is there.  Please watch it.  It's really, really important about what happened on 11.3 and coming attractions in the near future.  You know, I was going through some quotes, and now that we've declared our independence from this particular platform and censorship, a couple interesting quotes I want to pass on to you.  My mom was great at historical quotes.  She was a history teacher, as you know, and passing these on.  So here we go.  From H.L.  Mencken, a journalist and essayist.  The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed.  Sound familiar?  And hence, clamorous to be led to safety.  Oh, just give me one of these.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Safety.  Yeah.  Right.  By menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.  H.L.  Mencken.  Something to ponder.  From Ronald Reagan.  Quote, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.  Boy, seems pretty close now, doesn't it?  We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream.  It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.  Or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men and women were free.  End quote.  That's where we are right now.  That's where we are right now.  Crucial point.  Which is why, well, censorship is alive and well for the deep state and their puppets and their puppet organizations.  From Samuel Adams.  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires of freedom in the minds of  men.\"  Samuel Adams.  Two more.  This is from President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.  I think he was telling us something.  Quote, behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.  To destroy this invisible government, to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt business, yeah, like censorship, and corrupt politics, yeah, like what happened on 11-3, is the first task of the statesmanship of today, end quote.  Exactly why President Donald Trump is getting grief for the exposure of this entire goat rodeo as of 11-3, and even before.  From Alexander Solzhenitsyn, from the Gulag Archipelago.  Quote, in keeping silent about evil, in bearing it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it and will rise up a thousand fold in the future.  When we neither punish nor reproach evil doers, we are not simply protecting their trivial old age.  We are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations, end quote, which is exactly why we declare our independence at Operation Freedom, period.  It's why I started the radio show 10 years ago.  It's why I've continued the radio show in spite of all the threats, in spite of all the harassment, in spite of all the deep state garbage that they've spewed.  It's why I've kept it going.  Because I believe people need to be be provided information which empowers them, which enhances their freedoms and liberties.  And I'm not going to stop now.  So, DaveJanda.com.  We're there for you 24-7.  I'm going to continue on this platform, but I am limited in what I can speak about or else this channel goes away.  So, we have to modify some things.  And Rumble.com.  Channel name, Operation Freedom, just like this channel.  Go there, please.  Hit the subscribe button.  No censorship.  And you're going to hear a lot more about 11.3 before and after.  George Washington.  I will die on my feet before I live on my knees.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Until next time, Dave Janda signing off.  Dream big and dare to fail.  Looking forward for you to join us on Rumble.com, Operation Freedom Channel.  Thanks for your time today. ",
