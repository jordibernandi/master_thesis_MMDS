That's important though, because no matter what happens when you're in this situation, this is a crazy, you know, 20 plus years ago.  What happens is, Everyone says to you the prevailing wisdom across the board is you gotta lay low You just have to be quiet because anything you say will keep it in the news.  and and III I just I think a human being and I think a country for that matter defines themselves on what they are willing to fight for and and and the lines they're willing to defend.  yeah, and and so for me I I'm not going to do that.  And because I didn't do this, and I'm not guilty of this.  And so for me, I thought to myself, if I don't stand up the number of people that I know, that have gone through something similar, who've reached out, or just people in general said, please, please be the person to stand up and at least talk about this, right?  Because nobody wants to talk about the fact that we are losing due process.  And I don't think anything anyone is necessarily to blame.  But look, you have two factors.  One is social media.  If someone and it doesn't matter who they are, it could be from 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, it could be whatever.  If somebody says something about you, And they said that you said something, that you did something.  That's all that it takes for your livelihood to stop.  Right.

And that is a fact and that is happening.  And I think it's a function of one, whatever happened in social media, it is this sort of mob rule, this sort of thing that people jump on.  But also, you have publications, you have credible publications that used to be really good newspapers and stuff that are desperate to get online subscribers, paying online subscribers.  And these newspapers are in real trouble.  I mean, desperate trouble.  And so what happens is there's enormous pressure on journalists to create clickbait, to create sensation.

They're terrified.  Listen, I know what you're talking about.  We just got remonetized today and then Verge, Vox, Mashable, they all have these articles that they're going to YouTube saying that my video when transgenders attack is hate speech where I was literally physically battered and assaulted by two transgender individuals.  I guess they would have preferred when transgenders batter.  which just sounds like a Ben and Jerry's flavor at that point.  My issue here is that there's an inaccuracy and there is a lack of accountability.  Now, they've kind of acknowledged that, Brian.  And so I will say this.  I've never seen allegations or a story like this go away so quickly as with yours.  And I think that's because you came out strong and forceful.  Also, just because there was no substantiation, right?  And the problem now is the media realizes they don't have the power.  There are people who can fact check them.  So rather than try and go back and forth, they just throw spaghetti at a wall and then they move on.  And so they've moved on from this because there was nothing really there.  And let me, this is one thing, and I know you have your stuff to say, but I do know that there's a history here, okay?  And I've had my own history with this lovely lady, Amy Schumer.  I know that you and her have kind of, what should I say, gotten under each other's skin, in her case, more of it.  I don't know her.  Well, I know.  Come on, bro.  People can run a search and see that you've said, like, she's an okay comedian.  I don't think she's the best.  Is that what I said?
