            "text": "Greece has suspended the asylum process for one month.  Anyone caught entering Greece over the course of the next month without the proper paperwork will not be allowed to apply for asylum.  and will be deported.  The Greek army and navy are being deployed.  There is a live-fire military exercise going on near the border right now.  Turkey is also waging a two-front information war.  On one hand, the Turkish government is telling people locally that hundreds of thousands of migrants are on the move and that they are successfully pouring across the borders of Greece and Bulgaria right now.  This is false information, but this narrative is being used to continue to entice more people to join the mob at the border.  Turkey is trying to make the situation as dangerous and violent as possible.  Secondly, the Turkish government is broadcasting claims internationally that the Greek authorities are brutalizing innocent and desperate refugees.  An army of people on social media are amplifying these claims in numerous languages.  These include blatantly fake stories.  The Turkish government claimed that the Greek Coast Guard purposely capsized a rubber dinghy, causing a small child to drown.  The Greek government issued an official statement saying this never happened.  Greece says that around 25,000 people are massed at the border now.  Thousands are involved in rioting.  They have started fires and they're throwing rocks at the border guards.  While the economic migrants travel with little to no luggage, many have been seen using gas masks and cutting tools.  Of course, you also have the never-ending supply of rubber dinghies and life jackets along the coast.  It is also being alleged that Turkey is releasing people from prisons and busing them to the border.  There is also new video of Turks rioting in a Syrian immigrant ghetto area.  Many can be seen flashing the gray wolves hand gesture.  This is actually not a new thing.  There have been anti-Syrian riots in Turkey before, but this time it is being claimed that the motive is to drive more people to join the mob at the border.  In Lesbos, there was an arson attack on a reception center.  It is also being alleged that residents of the Greek islands have physically assaulted members of the leftist NGOs as well as journos.  There is video showing two migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa being coached to act hysterical by a gaggle of journos.  This is a usual tactic and the staged, choreographed video they took has already ended up in European media clips.  Once again, the reason that Turkey is doing this is to try to extort Europe into supporting Turkey's military adventures in the Middle East.  Turkey is currently engaged in two different military conflicts in Syria, as well as military conflicts in Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Libya, not to mention the occupation of Cyprus.
