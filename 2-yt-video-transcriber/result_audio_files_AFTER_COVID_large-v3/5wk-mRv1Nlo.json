            "text": "Yeah.  Where are we in our political discourse here in the United ... States?  well we're in the phase where it's okay to ... discriminate against someone because of their skin color ... yes that's where we are as well as destroying history ... and art all throughout this country including those ... that literally defeated the Confederacy and fought off ... many individual hate groups.  yes the statues of Ulysses S.  ... Critter going down.  okay but I am curious if they would ... allow Rachel Dolezal or Talcum X in whoever thought ... participation trophies would lead to all of this all of ... which by the way is getting fully supported by the ... mainstream media that is spinning and twisting facts in ... order to push a narrative onto you as well as the support of ... some of the largest multinational corporations out ... there that placate to you so you buy more of their slave ... goods.  and of course let's not forget the full support of ... many governments all across the country that are promoting ... protests while of course still shutting down businesses.  so ... So yeah I'll be honest here when it comes to renaming ... things destroying history art supporting neoconservative ... warmongers like John Bolton all the while blaming one race ... as fully responsible for all your problems.  I'm sorry but if ... those are the hallmarks of your movement.  no thank you.  I ... don't want any part of that since of course it doesn't ... that actually do affect us that actually matter in our ... lives which should hold government accountable which ... should be seriously discussed and debated but or not and ... that's why in this video specifically we will be ... talking about two very important stories one very ... important one with a lot of implications from Canada and ... another one about a very bad person that should be in jail ... but is running around free right now.  all of that plus a lot more on this independent media ... organization that is here not because of you know the ... mainstream media or any multinational corporations ... property supporting us.  they're actually doing the ... quite opposite of that but because of you and your ... support and one way to very easily support us is by using ... an internet browser called brave.  it is a privacy crypto ... rewards you.  yes you get rewarded with crypto currencies ... if you use this platform by using our referral link we get a ... small Commission of these crypto currencies which earn ... us and you rewards that you could transfer to real dollars ... this is a service very similar to Mozilla Firefox ... Google Chrome and after using it it's one of the best out ... there.  in my opinion I like it a lot.  I think you will too.  it ... doesn't cost you anything to use it.  it's a win-win for ... check out the brave browser with our referral link down ... below.  if you use this for over a month which means you're ... gonna have to like it for over a month I'm confident that you ... will.  this of course benefits and sustains this independent ... media organization.  so thank you everyone for doing that now ... that has been significantly underplayed is of course the ... story about Jeffrey Epstein or even still current to this day ... many documentaries and media publications refuse to ... investigate the intelligence agency ties that this man had ... while of course he was hurting thousands we're talking about thousands.  children in ways that they could never heal from ever ... since after his mystery alleged.  Suicide which of course prevented him from speaking ... out in court before his court hearings which he was very.  optimistic about which would explain a lot of his ... connections that he had with many powerful individuals like ... Bill Gates Bill Clinton the Trump's Kevin Spacey Harvey ... Weinstein.  yes this man was into in the center of it all ... with the help of the mainstream media that was ... writing gloating pieces about how great of an ... entrepreneur he was.  in part the mainstream media actually ... aided Epstein in his abuse of children not only covering up his crimes but promoting him local ... police departments looked the other way.  many times he was ... tipped off before any raids that took place on his ... property and one of the people in the center of this huge ... Hollywood government connected extortion racket ... which is believed to have been run by some intelligence ... Maxwell the daughter of Robert Maxwell an individual who was ... connected to intelligence agencies who also died ... mysteriously but according to the many victims out there it ... was Ghislaine Maxwell the partner of Jeffrey Epstein ... that was actually a person that was above Jeffrey ... witnesses and victims in this case that pointed her as the ... main pimp.  and after the mysterious end of Jeffrey ... Epstein this person staged a very mysterious fake photo op ... that even had product placement in it paid for by ... some corporations.  and after this mysterious photo signal ... was sent this woman disappeared.  she was nowhere ... to be found leaving the world to ask where was.  Maxwell no one could find out as of course he was escaping ... justice for all the accusations of the horrible ... crimes that she committed.  And now as reported by some media publications she has ... been found hiding out in a luxurious.  Paris apartment not so far away from Jeffrey Epstein's old ... house.  a wealthy part of the city would up market retail ... shops.  that is where she is now but according to many ... sources she is changing locations every month to quote ... private investigators off her tail and she is crashing at ... the house of trusted colleagues and contacts or as ... they should have put it here accomplices to a crime ... happening here now.  the reason Glenn Maxwell is hiding out in ... France is because of the extradition laws in France ... which protect her from of course any kind of legal ... recourse against her.  under French law anyone born on ... French soil is safe from extradition to another country regardless.  of the alleged crime.  now this is huge.  this is very ... important because if you remember from the legal ... proceeding court cases that were happening with Epstein's ... estate which glaine wants a large portion of the glaine is ... saying that Epstein owed her a lot of money and she wants ... some of that money so it doesn't go to the victims but ... this is important because previously court rulings have ... decided that glaine doesn't need to be at her own court ... said that they can't even find her current location that they ... are communicating via email.  but the one big question that ... should be asked throughout all of this is when you have the ... strong arm of the law when you have the intelligence ... agencies that could spy and track and have satellites and ... have drones and have the best capabilities to find out ... anything and everything on this planet when you have ... find Ghislaine Maxwell but a newspaper can and again this is ... not an average person.  if this was a regular Joe Schmoe with ... the accusations against them they would have been in jail ... with the key thrown away a long time ago.  but we have to ... remember that Ghislaine is friends with the Clintons is ... friends with a lot of inner circle elites and also knows a ... lot of the secrets that Jeffrey Epstein knew which ended up.  him being suicided.  so is Glenn hiding from the federal ... authorities from Justice?  or is she hiding from the ... individuals that she might believe took out her partner ... while all of that is still very unclear we don't know for ... being able to contact her but a newspaper being able to find ... her.  I do believe one theory is stronger than the other.  with ... that background of information.  it doesn't of course prove it ... but it suggests that that is the case again.  Maxwell is ... wanted for questioning by the FBI but for the time being ... unless there is enough public pressure.  it looks like she is ... real judicial hearings from here and this should all be a ... huge rotten egg on the face of federal authorities that ... have allowed these victims thousands of children from ... never getting justice.  they still don't have it and ... unless there's more public pressure there never will be ... and this is why this story is important.  it matters dives deep into the corruption of government and ... it needs to be exposed with disinfectant with light with ... the truth of what the government is actually up to ... and again if there ever was a major protest movement in the ... streets that deserved all of its support it is for many of ... the victims here that still have no justice.  so yeah until ... we have any accountability and clarity of all.  government horrible actions.  with this case it's it's best ... not to trust government.  another reason is they've ... historically do atrocious horrible things.  again if you ... look at history if you read what governments have done all ... throughout our recorded human existence if you look up ... what democide means.  this is one of the biggest red pills ... that you could take and with that.  this is why it's ... important to be skeptical of government especially with ... some of the latest news we're getting surrounding the ... Nova Scotia shooting.  a major recent event in Canada ... that led to 22 people being killed others injured after ... what is believed to be a senseless attack by a madman.  But there's very serious questions to the official ... story of what actually happened here.  that should have ... everyone concerned since of course this is the event that ... is leading to major gun confiscation in Canada ... because of this event.  honest good citizens don't have the ... right to self-defense and the government is going around ... disarming them.  because of this one particular event.  ... where now we are finding out has the exact hallmarks of ... of an undercover operation and this is according to many ... police sources and the fact that the shooter that's ... implicated in all of this.  right before this horrific ... act went to the bank and got.  475. hundred thousand dollars out of the bank.  now I don't know ... about you but if I go to the bank I can't withdraw $10,000 ... without alarm sounding off inside of the frickin back.  I ... don't know how this 50 year old something dentist was ... able to go to the bank and literally withdraw close to ... half a million dollars in cash.  right before a major horrific event this man also had ties ... and associated with police officers from other police ... agencies and according to many police sources this ... withdrawal or match the method that the Royal Canadian ... Mounted Police use to send money to confidential ... informants.  it's also important to note that ... during this heinous act he was dressed.  police uniform and driving a replica police car and ... according to many sources the way that he got his money is ... the same exact way that the authorities in Canada conduct ... their business with undercover secret operations ... again links to police officers links to organized ... crimes being seen with other police officers getting the ... uniform having the replica car.  I mean my goodness.  Of course you don't have a smoking gun here but with just ... some of the circumstantial evidence presented here ... especially with the fact that you as a citizen can't even ... take out $10,000 in your own bank and this is the event ... that's leading to major gun confiscation.  I mean there's a ... lot of alarm bells that should be ringing right now as well as a major.  investigation into what actually happened here and ... before we get any legitimate answers from the authorities.  Which I highly doubt we will because again this has their ... fingerprints all over it.  but until we get some legitimate ... answers there's no reason to participate in their ... confiscation program since of course if this is a ... potentially undercover operation that hurt innocent ... people if you have a government that is literally ... this is not the time to give away more of your rights to ... those same awful monsters that some people call politicians ... now I know that might be hard for some people to believe ... again no smoking gun.  we just have some circumstantial ... evidence here but it's especially worth considering ... when again.  not only when you look at history but also when ... that are continuing to happen.  when you see regimes that are ... continued to be propped up by your tax dollars that do the ... most God awful horrible things.  In this world.  you look at American foreign policy which ... predominantly has been matched by Canadian foreign ... policy the Iraq war.  specifically here politicians ... have caused immense human suffering all for political ... gain and to think that they can't do it against you.  naively.  this is why I do what I do.  this is why I cover the ... stories that I find most important.  if you found these ... stories important if they're something that you believe ... people should be aware of and a part of the discussion ... about share this video with them since of course our ... political discourse is absolutely insane and never ... deals with these legitimate problems that do affect us ... Don't let them control the narrative.  they're pushing the ... most idiotic insane ideas onto you.  YouTube is doing this as ... well promoting the mainstream media trash that is pushing.  divide and conquer agenda on you.  in the best way to fight ... back against this utter insane lunacy is to speak up and to ... not be afraid to raise your voice.  that's why sharing this ... video is more important than ever.  for the few of you who do ... this is why I am still here against all the odds and it ... definitely hasn't been an easy.  Road that I've been on.  I definitely haven't chosen the easy route here but I've chosen the one that allows me to sleep at night and to fulfill my life with work that I find important and you're part of that and because of that I love you guys.  stay tuned for more here on.  we are change.org.
