            "text": "Shalom.  First and foremost, we give all praises to Yehawah, to his son, Yehawah Shai, for allowing this word to come out.  And I hope you sincere brothers and sisters are edified by this word.  And the name of the lesson is called Breaking News.  One Wes Ariah says, children of Israel were black folks.  He said it again.  Name of the lesson is called Breaking News.  One Wes Arias says the children of Israel were all so-called black folks.  All right.  Now this is an old video.  So the quality is real bad.  But hopefully you guys will be able to hear some of the points that this dude is going to talk about.  that contradicts everything.  uh we've been saying um or most of the things we've been saying in regards to this 12 tribe sign.  you did so.  uh it's four different things we're going to point out in this lesson.  and the first thing we're going to point out is um the 12 tribes, how he break down who Reuben is, who Gad is, who Asher is, who Naphtali is, and who Issachar is.  Alright?  Now let's play this once.  About Christ, you gotta go back to the law of justice.  The Bible says if you move another man's plot, move his insignia from his plot, from his plot of land, that is wrong.  And you have to pay.  Okay, now, this is a 12-tribe sign from back in the day.  You can't really see it, but I want you to listen.  This is the part of the video where he's going to run down who Reuben is, who Gad is, who Asher is, who Naftali is, and who Issachar is.  Quite interesting.  Check this out.  Reuben is a Seminole Indian.  Gad is a North American Indian.  Asher is a Brazilian Indian.  Natalie... You hear that?  He said, Ruben is the Seminole Indians.  Gad is the North American Indians.  Asher is the Brazilian Indians.  Naftali is the Artina Indians.  Issachar is the Mexican Indians.  And these are the tribes, are the real tribes of Israel, according to the scriptures.  That is amazing.  We're going to touch on this.  We're going to come back to this later.  Let's continue on.  Now, if the cameraman can come back to this, I'd like to focus on this.  The real Jews are black, like this relief from the walls of the tombs of Egypt shows.  See that?  It clearly shows that they're black people.  Now, the caption under this says, brick making by the Jews in Egypt.  Now, this is in the back of a Bible.  Through the Bible, they got pictures of Europeans, false pictures, like this picture here of Christ.  That's a false image.  Christ is not a so-called white man.  Matter of fact, we're going to go and read.  Okay, now we're going into point number two.  This is where I almost jumped out of my seat when I heard Arias say this.  This is point number two we're going to touch on.  Check this out.  Listen up close.  Oh, wow.  Did you hear that?  He said all the children of Israel were so-called black people.  Hold on, man.  Y'all think I'm making this up.  Hold on once.  Jeremiah's image. ",

If you dig up the earth, it's different shades of brown.  Now we're going to the book of Amos.  And we're going to find out the color of the whole nation of Israel.  Okay.  So, so far, he's told you that all the children of Israel were so-called black people.  All right.  Now we're going into point number three.  All right.  To find out the whole color of Israel.  Let's go.  You see that?  He said that, he just told you, Amos 9 and 7 is going to allow you to find out what color the people were of Israel, right?  And he said what?  According to Amos 9 and 7, the Israelites look like the Ethiopians.  So that further supports his stance that all Israel... This so-called black people, right?  Now, he's going to get into the description of Yahushua.  Now, this is very interesting.  Check this out.  Now, he's going into the book of Revelations.  Okay, to read the description of Yahushua.  Now, what's interesting about this is, according to Great Millstone, isn't Ariah John the Revelator?  So, you see, Ariah is going to read the Bible about himself, giving his description of Yahushua, because he's John the Revelator, remember? ",

Remember, he said that all the children of Israel were so-called black people.  And then he went to Amos 9 and 7 to furthermore validate that the Israelites look like the Ethiopians, which furthermore supports his claim of all Israel were black people.  And he just read the description of Yahushua, which we already knew.  All right.  Now, the interesting thing about him reading that Revelations is he, according to Great Millstone, he's John the Revelator.  Okay.  So when he read the description of Yahushua, he was reading the Bible about himself, given a description of Yahushua.  That's amazing, ain't it?  Well, hold on, man.  Hold on.  We about to close it out.  Hold on once.  We about to close it out here.  Yeah.  Check that out right there.  See that?  That's that 12 tribe sign again.  All right.  Now check it out.  In the beginning of the lesson, Ariah said Reuben was a Seminole Indian.  When you look on there, you see Ruben?  Seminole Indians, right?  Then he said Gad was the North American Indians.  See that?  That lines up, you see it?  But then he said Asher is the Brazilian Indians.  But when you go on here and look for Asher, well, you can't see it.  Hold on, it's on here, gotta make it smaller.  When you go to Asher, it says Colombian, Puraway.  Okay, it don't say Indians.  Then he said Naftali was the Argentinian Indians.  When you go to Argentina, let's see Argentina.  When you go to Argentina, right?  Did I pass it?  Bear with me, y'all.  Naftali, right?  See Naftali?  It says the Argentinian Chileans.  But he said Naftali was the Indians, Argentinian Indians.  You see that?  Then for Issachar, he said that they were the Mexican Indians.  But right here, it just say Mexican.  See that?  Naftali.  Let's go back to Naftali.  It says what?  The Argentinian to Chileans.  But Arias said that Naftali was the Argentinian Indians.  When you go to Asher, it says Colombian to Uruguayans.  I hope I said that right.  But Arias said it's the Brazilian.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, Asher would be Brazilian Indians.  But look what it says right here on the sign.  It says Colombians.  You see that?  Wow.  See that?  That don't add up, man.  That don't add up, man.  You see that?  So this is why we're poking at this 12 Tribe sign, man.  Because it's flawed.  And the man that's responsible for the 12 Tribe sign just showed y'all proof that he even contradicted the 12 Tribe sign himself.  The man said, Asher is the Brazilian Indians in the video, but on the sign, what do it say?  For Asher.  For Asher, it says... colombians.  you see that naftali was the argentinian indians and he got the argentinian to chileans.  but there's no indians.  they're the only indians that's being applied to on this 12 tribe sign is gad and ruben.  come on man.  what's the name of the lesson?  breaking news man aria one west aria say all the children of israel were black folks.  You see this shit, man?  It's fucking ridiculous, man.  Choose my French.  I'm just going to come out with one scripture that's John 8 and 4.  And I ain't going to even read the scripture.  I'm going to just give you the highlights.  Because Great Millstone, this is y'all.  Y'all are the children of y'all father, the devil.  Y'all always hated the truth.  Ain't no truth in you.  And y'all constantly lying, just like y'all father lying, the devil.  All y'all fucking false prophets, man.  It's ridiculous, man.  So rap for you niggas.  Shalawan. ",
