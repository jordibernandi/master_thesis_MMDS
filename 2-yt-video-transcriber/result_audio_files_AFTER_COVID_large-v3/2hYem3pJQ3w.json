            "text": "I have a friend in the Los Angeles music scene.  He happens to be black.  A few years ago, during another protest slash riot, he supported the Black Lives Matter narrative.  Freddie Gray, a guy with a long police record, was being made into a dead celebrity by left-wing activists.  I asked my friend why Black protests always revolve around these bottom feeders.  I said, why present these petty criminals as being typical of Black men in general?  I mean, we have our share of white fuck-ups who get killed by cops, but we don't paint murals in their honor.  Black Lives Matter does.  Let me be frank.  The American left controls the thinking of many Black Americans through the media.  They hugely amplify every episode of a Black man dying in custody while refusing to acknowledge the much higher rates of Black criminality.  They seek always to keep inner city Blacks in victim mode, to make them feel like they've been robbed, that they're owed something.  This endlessly stimulates the very human desire to get something for nothing.  What is looting really except taking things that other people have paid for?  It's just leftism without the middleman.  The martyrdom of George Floyd.  What is a martyr anyway?  A martyr is somebody who is inspirational for his or her courage or faith or leadership.  Martyrdom literally means self-sacrifice, doing the hard thing, people who risk their lives and lose their lives for the good of others.  Michael Brown and Freddie Gray and Eric Garner and George Floyd may very well have been good people in some ways, and they may have died unjustly, but they didn't die advancing the cause of goodness.  They died tangling with the law while breaking the law for short-term personal gain.  That's pretty much the opposite of martyrdom.  Martin Luther King was not perfect, but he did die advancing the cause of goodness.  He is a legitimate martyr.  redefining martyrdom downward.  That has been one of Black Lives Matter's primary tactics.  Every time you legitimize a criminal, you lower the standards for everybody.  In order to be like Dr.  King, you'd have to really reach, find something great inside yourself.  But a kid today saying he wants to be like George Floyd, no offense intended toward Floyd's family, but that's a pretty low bar.  This is George Floyd's police record.  I count nine.  That's one less than Freddie Gray.  But we're not exactly in pillar of the community territory.  Look, I myself was arrested a few times when I was young and stupid.  I got knocked around pretty good by the cops once, too.  If I had died in that encounter, my family would have mourned me.  My friends would have missed me.  But society would not have lost very much.  All lives do matter, but let's face it.  Some lives matter more than others.  A person who contributes greatly to their community is more important than a person who contributes very little.  And a person who doesn't contribute anything, but instead takes away from the community by stealing, that person doesn't really matter very much.  Does this mean it's okay to kill those people?  Of course not.  But it does mean that you shouldn't bestow sainthood on one of them if their lives end early, black or white.  I don't want the Black children in my neighborhood aspiring to be like George Floyd, but apparently these protesters and their progressive bootlickers do.  This is George Floyd's daughter reciting what she's obviously been told to say.  That's right.  Daddy changed the world.  He did what?  Daddy changed the world.  Daddy changed the world.  Black Lives Matter is run by radical lesbians.  They don't have any particular interest even in good men.  So why does BLM focused almost exclusively on canonizing the kind of men that they themselves wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole?  Low-level urban hustlers with criminal records.  Why?  Do they want kids to think that living as an outlaw and dying as a victim is how one changes the world?  BLM is just the racialized version of what all leftists are.  They aren't leaders.  They're needy people with low self-esteem.  They're desperate to make themselves look heroic.  So they have to find some poor slob who never found his way and ended up dead.  And they have to pretend that that is a turning point in history so that they can look important for yelling about it.  And this is why the little social justice warriors all come running.  They haven't done anything either except spout off about oppression.  Rushing into the streets, screaming about injustice allows them one more day in the fantasy world of themselves as saviors.  I was driving home from the demonstrations in Hollywood a couple of weeks ago and I looked over to my left.  I saw a black guy about 40 driving a silver Camry.  He had on a shirt and tie.  He looked tired, probably coming home from a long, frustrating day of trying to get ahead in the real world where people have to suit up and show up every damn day to provide for their families.  Just a few blocks to the south, white social justice idiots were joined up with black social justice idiots demanding payback for a guy who once invaded a pregnant woman's home and stole her stuff while an accomplice pistol whipped her in the face.  All across town on that warm spring night, fatherless boys with heads full of gutter rap music were torching police cars and ransacking the businesses of people who get up every blessed morning and contribute.  That ordinary guy in the 10-year-old sedan on his way home to his kids is twice the man that George Floyd was, 10 times the man.  Where are his murals?  Where are the T-shirts with his face on them?  And what the hell is wrong with us that we pay a second's lip service to any of this BLM bullshit.  What has Black Lives Matter done to make a better world?  Nothing.  All they've done is incite bitterness, violence, murder, and massive property damage.  All they've done is scream fire in a crowded theater.  They shouldn't be getting rich on the guilt offerings of enormous companies.  They should be going to jail.  And they should take about 25% of all Democrats with them.  I like to let juries decide these things, but Derek Chauvin was almost certainly wrong to pin George Floyd down with a knee to his neck, and he will pay the price according to the law.  But to my way of thinking, every Democrat joining with BLM to further diminish Black America with the bigotry of low expectations has a knee on the necks of a whole people.
