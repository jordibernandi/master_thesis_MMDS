            "text": "15 days are not enough.  We need to go 30 days.  I was working full time and my health was fine.  In comes a little man, Dr.  Fauci.  He told me several times he didn't like my kind.  Cause my mask game wasn't in line.  First they said it's silly.  The mask does almost nothing.  Now the rules are different than before.  That's when I saw the top half of her face Walking in through the wrong door, wrong door.  She wore a surgical mask on her face.  Walking around at the grocery store.  A silly piece of cloth on her face.  But if the TV said she wouldn't wear it no more.  A surgical mask on her face.  I think they fooled her.  Masked as she was She had the nerve to ask me Why I'm there to do her harm.  I put a diaper on my face.  We went riding my bike.  It sure beats wearing one in the car.  I said now hide case numbers Never turn me on.  But the TV set has her transfix.  She isn't too bright, I could tell when she sneezed That her mask wouldn't catch all the spit.  She wore a non-surgical mask on her face The kind Alyssa Milano and Joe Biden adore.  A diaper tied on her face.  But we'll be back to normal on November 4th Any random cloth on her face.  I think they lied to her.  The mask doesn't stop it though you want to believe It's the only thing that keeps you alive.  TV drowns out what truth and logic sees And makes them feel like wearing one when they drive.  Common cold symptoms are no need for alarm.  You're freaking out about the flu when it's warm.  The virus stayed the same, only the message changed.  Now wearing PPE is the norm.  She wore a surgical mask on her face.  The kind that science says don't do anything at all.  A virtue mask on her face.  But if the science ain't there, she shouldn't wear it no more.  A silly little mask on her face.  I think I love her.  A surgical mask on her face.  Walking around at the grocery store Silly piece of cloth on her face.  But if the TV said she wouldn't wear it no more.  A surgical mask on her face.  I think they fooled her.  Thank you. ",
