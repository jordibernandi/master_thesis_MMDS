This month we're looking at Oh Madeline, a sitcom that Madeline Kahn used to give a national platform to her old college friend Charles Ludlam, a performer who revolutionized queer theater in New York, and whose influence can still be found in your drag race faves to this day.  It was in all the magazines at the  time.\".  Culture Cruise is made possible by members on Patreon, folks like Hiri Kuoka, Alexandra Kwan, and James P. Smith.  If you're enjoying these videos, head over to Patreon.com slash Matt Baume to check out the rewards for backers.  On September 27, 1983, the show Oh Madeline premiered on ABC.  Madeline Kahn was at this point a huge movie star, famous for Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, an Oscar nomination for Paper Moon, and of course What's Up Doc, where she appeared with fellow gay icon Barbra Streisand.  Who is this  person?\".  Oh Madeline was her attempt to get into television.  It was based on a bawdy British sitcom called Pig in the Middle, but ABC executives insisted that they tone down the sex and turn it into something a little more like I Love Lucy.  After an onslaught of network notes, the show became a bit of a mess.  It's a mishmash of recycled, zany sitcom schemes.  Like, Madeline promises to get Johnny Mathis to sing at her high school reunion, and then she can't get him, so she hires an imposter.  But the real Johnny Mathis shows up, but she thinks he's the imposter.  You get the idea.  Critics and viewers agreed, MadelineCon was great.  But Oh Madeline the show was\u2026.  well, there's a reason it didn't stick around.  Midway through the first season, ratings were so low that ABC told the cast and crew the show was getting canceled, but they could still shoot the last few episodes of the season.  And that's when Madeline hatched a plan that was zanier than anything her character on the show ever attempted.  She insisted that they write an episode for one of her old drama department friends from college, Charles Ludlam, who by then was known for producing outrageous plays in New York featuring sex and drugs and nudity and lots and lots of cross-dressing.  Madeline later told interviewers that she was fed up with the network constantly interfering with the show.  She wanted to try something truly risky.  So that's how we wound up with the second-to-last episode of Oh Madeline, a bizarre drag farce entitled Play Crystal for Me that brought subversive queer theater into America's living rooms.  The episode starts with an extremely sitcom-y setup.  Madeline's husband is a romance novelist who writes as a woman under the pen name Crystal Love.  He's got a problem.  Crystal is being outsold by a competing author named Tiffany Knight.  You're kidding. ",

            "text": "Tiffany Knight!  OK, let's pause here to talk about Charles Ludlam, one of the greatest drag performers of the 20th century who you've probably never heard of.  Charles and Madeleine were both classmates at Hofstra New York in the early 1960s, and they both had a terrible time there.  They were funny and creative and weird, but their teachers kept insisting on seriousness and normalcy.  Today, we know and love Madeleine for how unique and hilarious she is, but in college, instructors barraged her with constant criticism for not fitting in.  And eventually, she left the theater department altogether and got a degree in speech therapy.  Her friend Charles, meanwhile, loved camp and over-the-top flamboyance.  He got low grades for having a rebellious attitude, which was maybe just code for being too gay at a time when that was literally against the law.  And so, of course, Madeline and Charles struck up a friendship and mutual respect for each other's work.  After college, Madeleine headed to Broadway and then motion pictures, but Charles headed to Greenwich Village of the mid-1960s, that's a few years before Stonewall, and helped found a new style of performance called Theater of the Ridiculous.  Theater of the Ridiculous style was what we'd probably call alt-theater today.  It was scrappy and cheap and homemade, super sexual, very queer, and sometimes so weird.  it didn't always make sense.  But Charles figured out a format that worked.  With his ridiculous theatrical company, he wrote and produced over two dozen plays with titles like When Queens Collide and Eunuchs of the Forbidden City.  Charles often played female parts, and he also played around with gender presentation in ways that still feel modern.  Exposing his hairy chest while in drag, for example, like today's bearded queens.  But those shows were more than just drag comedies.  Remember, this was pre-Stonewall, when gays could be arrested just for hanging out together.  Back then, New York had what was informally called a three-piece law.  If police stopped you and you weren't wearing three pieces of clothing that aligned with what they thought your gender should be, you went to jail.  Here's how the show.  Barney Miller explained that kind of thing at the time. ",

They just did a whole episode on this Barney Miller episode.  Charles' plays were among the first to tell gay stories without shame at a time when society heaped shame on gay people.  In 1970, the first commemoration of Stonewall is credited as coining the term gay pride, but Charles' shows had been bringing a feeling of pride to gay audiences for the better part of a decade at that point, and he kept at it through the 70s and into the early 80s.  It's thanks to the rowdy movement that he helped create that Broadway started opening up to explicitly queer shows to reach mainstream audiences, shows like The Boys in the Band and Torch Song Trilogy, Angels in America.  So that's the friend that Madeleine Kahn, annoyed at network meddling, insisted ABC hire and broadcast into America's homes, playing a female romance novelist.  Ludlam loved old movies and Hollywood stars.  And he plays Tiffany Knight with a sort of Tallulah bankhead vamp with lots of sexual innuendo.  Here's Tallulah flirting with Frank Sinatra. ",

In 1980, she took a role in an indie film called Happy Birthday, Gemini, about a college kid who's stressed about coming out as gay.  Making a gay film at that time was a big risk, but one reason Madeline took the job was because she knew her gay fans were among her most loyal.  She wanted to do something specifically for them.  And maybe that's why she wanted to do something.  queer when she found out her show was getting canceled.  By insisting that ABC air an episode with Charles Ludlam, Madeline was taking a step that not a lot of other shows dared take at that time.  In the early 80s, queer TV characters were virtually nonexistent, aside from a few very special episodes of shows like Cheers and Kate and Ally.  Drag performers on TV could probably be counted on one hand, intended to be established male comics dressing up in frumpy dresses for a laugh.  But there were a very small handful of female impersonators, as they were called at that time, on television.  And in a strange coincidence, one of the other female impersonators was also named Charles.  Charles Pierce.  Charles Pierce started performing live in Altadena, California in the 1950s.  His dream then was to break into TV and film, but at that time it wasn't just hard for gay actors to find work in mainstream entertainment.  It was impossible.  Pierce couldn't get cast in anything, until he discovered that he had a talent for drag impressions of old-timey Hollywood stars.  And so he started doing stand-up in San Francisco gay bars in the 1960s, and became sort of a West Coast version of Charles Ludlam.  And gradually, through the 50s and 60s, he became famous for his impressions of classic film stars like Tallulah, Mae West, and Joan Crawford, and his trademark impression, Bette Davis.  As Pierce was getting famous for his live shows, television was slowly Very slowly, evolving, and drag started to shift from something taboo to something daring and fun.  By the 1970s, Charles Spears started getting hired by shows like Starsky and Hutch. ",

Robert was talking about Madeline's husband, who actually writes the books, But Tiffany thought he was talking about the woman who's been appearing as Crystal.  And I know, this is a very stupid premise.  Why would Robert have phrased it that way?  But it's what he needed to say in order to light the farce's act three fuse.  Crystal and Tiffany are scheduled to appear that night on a local talk show.  Again, please do not think too hard about the plausibility of that.  And Tiffany plots to reveal, incorrectly, that Crystal is a man as the cameras roll.  This setup has some echoes of the movie Tootsie, which came out just a year before.  In that film, Dustin Hoffman plays a man who plays a woman who plays a different woman on a soap opera, culminating in a shocking on-camera reveal that.  I'm not going to spoil for you in case you haven't seen it yet, but oh boy, it's really good.  Tootsie takes place in New York, and focuses on a struggling actor who's having trouble getting the roles he wants, so he decides to try out four female parts.  The movie was a huge hit, and it's possible.  this episode of Oh Madeline wouldn't have happened if there hadn't been a successful cross-dressing farce a year before.  But Tootsie might not have happened either if a pathway hadn't been cleared by performers like Charles Ludlam and Charles Pierce, as well as a third actor named Charles, Charles Bush.  Charles Bush started his career a bit later than Charles Ludlam and Charles Pierce, but the details are remarkably similar.  He was inspired by Ludlam and Pierce, and even performed in Ludlam's company at one point.  But mostly, he was a struggling actor and playwright who had difficulty landing the gigs he wanted.  At one point in 1985, he created a ridiculous campy skit.  Someone gave it the catchy title, Vampire Lesbians of Sodom, and it just happened to catch the attention of a theater critic at the New York Times.  The show hit some of the same notes that worked for Theater of the Ridiculous.  It was campy, over-the-top, gender-bending, full of old-timey references.  And Vampire Lesbians of Sodom was a huge hit.  Like performers who came before, Bush discovered he had a great gift, playing extravagant grand dames inspired by ostentatious female stars of the past.

His plays delved deep into lost theater and brought old characters and acting styles back to life in campy shows like Psycho Beach Party, Die Mommy Die, and Kiss the Blood Off My Castanets.  This time, it's for me, for me, for me!  But Bush's plays weren't just imitations of old-fashioned stories and stars.  He used the drag elements to create something new, adding a twist by playing with gender in a way that would have been considered taboo in decades past.  Chick-fil-A, you can't take your top off here!  Oh, just hold the blacktop around me.  Bush's shows have been turned into films and turned into Tony nominations.  Vampire Lesbians of Sodom is one of the longest-running plays in off-Broadway history.  The qualities that at first seemed like they made him unemployable as an actor turned out to be Charles's superpower, just as happened to Charles Pierce and to Charles Ludlam.  And Charles Bush is still working to this day.  He recently stopped by my podcast, The Sewers of Paris, where I talk to queer folks about entertainment that changed their lives.  Check out that full interview at SewersOfParis.com, and look for episode 283.

Of course, this leaves the initial problem of Tiffany's books outselling Crystal still unresolved, but let's just add that to the list of things we shouldn't think too hard about.  The impact of these Charleses, and performers like them, is still felt to this day in performances of modern-day drag artists.  Remember, back in season 5 of Drag Race, everyone thought Jinx Monsoon was making a terrible choice to portray Little Edie from Grey Gardens.  But she knocked it out of the park.  It was in all the magazines at the time.  And after taking home that season's crown, Jinx made a name for herself with a performance style that's very much in the tradition of theater of the ridiculous.  Body, unpredictable, and paying tribute to actresses and styles of old, whether playing Marlena Dietrich, or Liza, or Bette Davis.  Jinx's longtime friend and collaborator Ben de la Creme works in these traditions, too.  Dayla as a character is big and campy and fun, and she's clearly inspired by classic film.  I can't say enough good things about Dayla's one-woman show Inferno A Go-Go, and my favorite of her works is her annual Halloween spectacular, Beware the Terror of Gaylord Manor, which is full of references to classic horror films like The Haunting.  I think live shows like these would have absolutely delighted Charles Ludlam.  To see performers today following in the footsteps he blazed when there was virtually no one else there to do it?  He once wrote that his goal was to focus on those things held in low esteem by society, and reveal them, give them new meaning, new worth, by changing their context.  Drag performances inspired by faded Hollywood stars were held in pretty low regard when he started his career, when drag was literally a crime.  Bit by bit, over the years, with the help of friends like Madeline, those pioneers found creative ways to get queer camp theatricality on television, opening the door for other types of queer entertainment.  As Ludlam himself put it, When the audience willingly allows themselves to be deceived, ",
