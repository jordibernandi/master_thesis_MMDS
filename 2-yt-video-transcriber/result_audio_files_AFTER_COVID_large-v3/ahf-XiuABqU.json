            "text": "Hey, my friends.  Welcome to another Dumb Things People Say to Atheists, the series that's on a playlist so you can hear me say welcome to another Dumb Things People Say to Atheists several times in one day, a comforting ritual that I'm sure never gets obnoxious.  On this particular day, we're going to be looking at another one of those dumb things that, like Stop Pushing Your Atheistic Worldview, you're not as likely to hear in as many words directly from a Christian.  You might run into the occasional personal anecdote, as I have, but you're much more likely to hear it woven into the totally real backstory of a professional apologist.  And that is, I used to be an atheist.  Yes, of course you did.  Now on the most superficial level, the reason for and appeal of this claim is obvious.  Everybody likes to hear stories of how someone on the opposite side of the argument changed their mind and now agrees with their side.  Knowing that people disagree with you, especially on a topic you feel strongly about, can rattle your cage a little, making you at least subconsciously wonder about something you want to feel certain of.  So hearing about how someone used to disagree but changed their mind can feel very satisfying.  It alleviates this tension and shores up a group narrative about how obviously right your side is and how anybody would agree with you if only they knew what you know.  This is something we all, to one extent or another, whether or not we want to admit it, enjoy.  But for Christians, the pressure to hold on to this narrative is even more intense.  As I've explained in past videos, they believe that their God wants us all to have the truth and is perfectly capable of passing it on to us.  so the idea that atheists are sincerely mistaken can be hard for them to swallow because it implied that God fails to give us this truth and then punishes us for not having it.  Also, you know, the Bible says we only disbelieve because we're willfully horrible, so their perspective's kind of poisoned from the start.  On top of this, I think deep down many of them struggle with the plausibility of what they believe and are neurotic about making sure they and especially their kids keep believing it.  Add to this the fact that they see belief itself as a virtue, and you can imagine how they might be especially invested in a clean-cut, obviously right versus obviously wrong narrative.  Thus, there's a huge tendency within modern evangelicalism to want to believe a few things about non-believers.  One, we tend to be bad, often horrifying people because of atheism.  Of course, they'll admit some of us can sometimes be good people, how very magnanimous of them to grant that.  atheism gives us no reason to be decent and every reason to be plain evil.  Two, we mainly became atheists and stay atheists for some stereotypical combination of irrational or ill-intentioned reasons.  And three, the evidence in favor of God and Jesus and the Bible is so blindingly obvious that it should instantly change any honest person's mind the moment they hear it.  Now a lot of people are tempted to characterize their opposition like this to some extent, But evangelicals lean into this narrative so hard and focus on it so obsessively that it becomes the lens through which they view atheists and their interactions with atheists.  Just look at how they approach this topic in practically, if not literally, every piece of popular Christian media.  the main atheist is always portrayed as an insufferable asshole.  If the movie bothers fleshing out further motivation for his non-belief, it will be some form of personal tragedy, career or financial opportunity, desire to party or otherwise sin, unwillingness to let go of some personal status, and so on, sometimes in conjunction with the fact that he's apparently never heard a simple argument for Christianity in his entire life.  It's always some of these and usually more than one.  Unless, of course, they write the character so flatly that he's an asshole is the only explanation.  And sadly that's explanation enough for too many Christians.  At some point in the movie this caricature, I mean character, actually no I did mean caricature, will be confronted by what any real life atheist will recognize as an eye-rollingly tired, sophomoric apologetic that Christians have been repeating verbatim for decades.  And of course the movie atheist, since he's not a real life one, will immediately if only deep down see the argument as a mind-blowing slam dunk that should compel him to start believing in God right then and there.  But he won't believe yet, because first he has to brood and get really sad and maybe lash out at people in astonishingly inappropriate ways because atheism is so empty and unfulfilling.  yet he also doesn't want to let go of the superficial benefits like pride and sin.  It's here that his actual journey begins, because his journey, and the story's main arc, is not about working through what he should believe based on a thoughtful exploration of actual arguments and evidence.  It's about how he works through whatever shitty personality traits made him an atheist after the writers rush him through an obligatory paper-thin parody of the arguments and straight to God.  So why did I spend all this time talking about Christian media?  Well, to illustrate a very simple point.  That, by all appearances, I used to be an atheist.  backstories are themselves scripted Christian media, and they follow the same absurd, insulting formula as Christian movies.  Seriously, read any of them, and you'll find they go through some version of these points with uncanny predictability.  And their former atheist selves bumble through this routine with such inability to articulate even basic atheist positions or anticipate the most mundane Christian argument that I can't even find them believable as dumb atheists.  Now by this do I mean these apologists are all lying?  Well I guess my answer would be a very begrudging.  not necessarily.  I'm fairly certain most of them are at least fudging if not entirely fabricating their backstories, but I can't read minds, so I don't know this and don't want to assume as much.  Who knows, maybe elements of some other stories are true to some extent.  And I can see how a Christian might, over the course of years, revisit his past experiences, filling in gaps with impressions he got from theology, apologetics and other people's testimonies until he started seeing his own personal journey in cartoonishly stereotypical terms.  It sounds a little far-fetched, at least divorced from any kind of deep-seated narrative-building motivation, but we can rarely know to what extent any of them are consciously lying and I'm sure it varies a lot by degree.  In the end, though, the relevant point is that these stories are so implausible, self-serving, and just plain stupid that for all practical purposes they serve the function of lies whether or not they are.  Take these quotes by Lee Strobel from his student edition of The Case for Christ, for example.  Our teacher explained that life originated millions of years ago when chemicals randomly reacted with each other in a warm yadda yadda yadda.  If evolution explains the origin and development of life, then God was out of a job.  What did we need God for?  Life was just the natural result of the random interaction of chemicals.  To my mind this was great news.  Finally, here was my rational basis for atheism.  If evolution explains life, then the first chapters of the Bible must be mythology or wishful thinking.  For the first time I had a rational reason to abandon Christianity.  After that day in biology class I had even more reason to party.  After all, I'd figured out that God did not exist, and that meant I was not accountable to him.  I would not have to stand before him someday to be judged.  I was free to live according to my rules, not his dusty commandments that I had been force-fed in confirmation class.  To me, all this meant that nobody else mattered until they made me happy.  But after a while, I noticed I really didn't care about other people.  I once interviewed a grieving woman whose young daughter had been raped and murdered.  As she poured out her pain, I was thinking, Wow, these are great quotes, and I'm the only reporter who's got them.  I didn't care about her daughter or her despair.  I was after a front page byline and another bonus from the boss.  What finally brought me to faith in God was truth.  I was a journalist.  I had legal training from Yale blah blah blah.  And of course he'll go on to investigate how obvious the truth is once he can bring himself to see it.  Now while I can't know what Strobel intended when he wrote this, it's clear that, with maybe a couple weird exceptions just to cover my bases, no plausible version of any real-life person has ever thought or behaved this way, and it falls so cleanly in line with childish Christian stereotypes that I don't know how to interpret it as anything other than at least semi-deliberately constructed fiction designed to reinforce these stereotypes.  Essentially, this kind of I used to be an atheist story is written to portray the apologist's past self as the same villainous buffoon we see in God's Not Dead and practically every other Christian movie for the purpose of making the same point.  But it carries more weight because it's purported to have happened in real life.  and the apologist is admitting it about himself.  The apologist tells how he discovered some routine level 1 idiocy about the Kalam cosmological argument, or the number of New Testament manuscripts, or the number of eyewitnesses who saw the resurrected Jesus, or the evidence for the empty tomb or whatever.  And even though any halfway engaged atheist has heard and debunked these arguments a thousand times, he's writing the story, so he gets to show himself discovering them on some long-involved quest and putting them into writing as if for the first time.  Even though he could have found the same thing said in the exact same words by wandering into any church library and picking a book at random, with his mind of course being blown by every discovery.  And of course we all but know it's bullsh-.  But the problem is when he models himself succumbing to these arguments, he trains Christians to think that any atheist should succumb to the same arguments just as easily.  Which is a large part of why, when you don't, they get agitated and think you're just being stubborn.  After all, if this top-notch atheist, who might have been, for example, a hard-boiled reporter or a no-nonsense tough-as-nails detective, even though these jobs have nothing to do with evaluating ancient textual evidence and no ethical member of either profession would claim he's qualified to do so, immediately changed his mind when someone told him the disciples wouldn't have died for a lie, then why won't you?  And of course, since the apologist, again as in the movies, depicted his past self only resisting the arguments because of past hurts or a desire to sin or some similar nonsense, The answer is that you're only ignoring the evidence for the same stereotypical reasons.  See, a lot of elaborately clever stuff is built into these narratives, which is why they so effectively undermine Christians' interactions with atheists.  The fact is, Christians aren't all just trying to be shits toward us.  They've just been so drilled in this absurd narrative that they really expect you to live up to weird stereotypes and be convinced by weirdly easy arguments.  But there's an area where this gets muddy.  A lot of Christians can honestly say they used to be an atheist.  depending on how they use the word.  See, while we often associate the word atheist with someone who thoughtfully and for rational reasons rejects belief in God, the broader definition of atheism as without theism or without God can accommodate many other kinds of people, including people who casually just aren't religious and maybe haven't encountered much religion, people who reject religion but just don't think much about why, People who indeed did leave religion in anger or due to a change in lifestyle, or even as far as that goes, people who never disavowed God but kind of quit going to church and ignored religion for a few years while they backslid and partied or whatever.  And finally, people who casually throw out some basic, dismissive, often embarrassing reason for not believing in God without really thinking through the issue.  The problem is, while these people can be construed as atheists, and while a Christian might sincerely say he was an atheist during a time he was running around partying or drinking or whatever, this turns atheism into a dumping ground for practically any kind of non-religious person, making things tricky because it gives former atheist street cred to any Christian who used to be any kind of non-religious idiot, thus attaching a lot of stereotypical attitudes to atheism.  Of course, Christians hate when this tactic is turned against them, and rightly so.  When they hear about one of their own deconverting and becoming atheists, which happens a ton more than the reverse, a lot of them will rush to assume that the person had a shallow and unsophisticated understanding of Christianity, or wasn't really saved or whatever, and that if they fully understood Christianity's position and or knew Christ, they never would have been seduced by atheism's easy answers.  This is clearly and explicitly illustrated by what William Lane Craig, who I won't call a dirty of a man who sold out so he could repackage dumb arguments for Christianity like a used car salesman because I'm too polite to talk like that, said about my friend Paula Gia.

            "text": "Now, yes, this is obviously a bunch of no-true Scotsman bullshit, but it should show us, and more to the point Christians, something valuable.  True, Christians can't just say that anybody from their ranks who became an atheist couldn't have ever been a true Christian.  However, we have to acknowledge that when they say this, they're reacting to what feels like and might be a dismissive insinuation about their beliefs.  That the case for Christianity is so feeble and the arguments for atheism so obviously strong, that anybody who receives proper exposure to and acknowledges our arguments would be so blown away that they'd instantly switch sides.  Now is there any truth to this?  I would honestly have to say yes, a little.  Christianity indeed depends on sheltering people and keeping their thought processes looped into prepackaged arguments and statements of dogma, and mere exposure to contrary ideas, properly considered, will almost always erode at their faith.  However, this can never be anything more than an anecdotal and internal understanding we hold.  And when it happens, it happens by degrees, often resulting in the person just shifting to a different understanding of their own faith.  It certainly doesn't happen as quickly and neatly as an I used to be a Christian narrative can imply.  And more to the point, it wouldn't be a useful phrase for us to throw at Christians.  And when we did, they would naturally, understandably, chafe at the insinuation that one person's story of leaving the faith because it's so obviously wrong says anything about how dumb their faith is or whether they're rational for remaining in it.  weren't really a true Christian is obviously a fallacious overreaction to this insinuation, but I can honestly understand it, depending on how it's used.  It's a grossly blunt and yes, wrong version of a better retort, which would be, all kinds of people, with all kinds of practices, level of intelligence, and depth of understanding of their own faith, fall under the label of Christian, so it means very little about me when another person steps out from under this label.  Now yes, that was a lot about Christians, but I was obviously just exploring the same concept in reverse.  Which is a valuable thing to do, both to show them how their line sounds to our ears and, if we're to be charitable and fair, be on guard against throwing our version of this dumb thing back at them.  Obviously we can't claim that a mere anecdote about a Christian becoming an atheist says anything about the strength of the Christian position.  But conversely and just as obviously, a Christian can't claim that an anecdote about an atheist becoming a Christian says anything about the strength of the atheist position.  We have to suspect that all kinds of people from both sides will bring forward testimonials about how they used to be on the other side but learned something and switched.  It's so obviously going to happen.  it's kind of mundane, and bringing it up proves nothing and will only trigger endless arguments over whether the person was a true or qualified Christian or a true or qualified atheist.  Now these stories might help us better understand our own personal journeys.  But we all, Christian and atheist both, need to avoid the temptation to take more solace in them than we should, to see them as an object lesson in how obviously right we are and how obviously wrong the other side is.  And we most certainly need to avoid wielding them as rhetorical weapons as if our specific anecdotes prove anything.  Thus, when you hear any version of, I used to be an atheist, you might calmly and politely say, 1.  Clarify that the word atheist can describe a lot of people, not all of whom are like you.  2.  Explain that a lot of atheists and Christians switch sides, so this really means nothing, and that.  3.  You're best off refocusing on the actual arguments instead of what other people claim to have been convinced by.  And if you feel it's constructive with a person you're speaking to, you might also, four, try to convey something of how implausible and formulaic apologist backstories often are and how this undermines the conversation.  Hopefully, especially if you can get across something about how I used to be a Christian can sound to a believer, you can shed some realistic light on this truly dumb thing people say to atheists.
