As police officers grow accustomed to being recorded in public these days we continue to investigate issues related to the police that are not always captured on camera.  that means how they treat their spouses their children their neighbors and their friends and how they behave in the community where they work.  We also investigate their training, how they investigate crimes, and how they respond to crime victims and write their police reports, because it is the police officers who will appear in court cases as witnesses, and their police reports are evidence, and that, and any bias that they have, is more important than you can imagine.  This is Officer Ray.  He is the supervisor in the Santa Clara County Family Courthouse.  That means that he's in charge of all the bailiffs who work in the courtrooms where a number of issues related to domestic violence are addressed.
