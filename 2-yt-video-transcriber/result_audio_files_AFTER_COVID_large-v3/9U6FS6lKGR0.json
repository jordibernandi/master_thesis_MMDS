So when you'll see these stories, and it's funny, I think the way Pew framed it was Gen Z is just as progressive as millennials or whatever.  And then you look and it's like they are, they are, they are.  Oh, a little bit more conservative.  Oh, a little bit more conservative.  That's interesting.  I think that's the framing you should go with, that there's something that happened that's very different.  It used to be every generation was way more progressive, way more progressive.  And now it's stagnant and slightly receding.  And so I remember when I saw this research and I was like, I wonder what's causing Gen Z to start rejecting these ideas.  There's nothing.  You want to know why Gen Z is slightly more conservative?  In the late 90s and early 2000s, several researchers were talking about birth rates between ideologies and found that liberal couples were having 1.7 kids on average versus conservatives 2.01.  Wow.  which meant that in 20 years, you would have a generation that was slightly more conservative than the last because liberals are less likely to have kids and now more likely to say get an abortion.  This resulted in the Gen Z being slightly more conservative simply because there are more of them. ",

You can't look at race and admissions.  And consequently, and if you look at the social science data, it's, I think, highly correlated with the number of hours per week that they're studying.  Asian-Americans do really well.  They get college admissions at the highest kind of public universities in Washington State.  They dominate.  That's just a fact.  It is.  It is what it is.  And the progressives, I guess now a year ago, two years ago, I can't quite remember.  They said, we're going to get rid of that and we're going to reinstate race based admissions.  And and again, Washington State has a high Asian-American population.  These are people who had never been involved in politics.  You know, we come from, you know, in large cases, these are Chinese Americans.  They said we come from a place where politics is dangerous.  They'll get you killed.  So we are.  we're just here to focus on our families, focus on education, focus on working hard, focus on businesses.  And I got involved with these people in this campaign to stop this.  And and you know what?  What happened was really a remarkable testament to American democracy.  These first generation Asian-American immigrants are.  Literally noodle shop owners, computer people, you know, kind of someone that said that they were, you know, transporting frozen meat.  I mean, like people who work hard.  They came together.  They had some people kind of advise them.  They put together a campaign to collect signatures to get this thing out of there because they said, hey, wait a minute.  We come from this country.  We come to this country.  We work hard.  We send our kids to college.  That's how it works.  This is the American dream.  And these folks are trying to take us away from it to help minorities.  What does it make sense?  And and they laughed at them.  The legislators literally mocked them in public.  Wow.  You, you know, noodle shop owners will never put this thing together.  Ha ha ha.  We have power.  This is a blue state.  We're going to dominate the noodle shop owners.  Oh, boy.  They went crazy.  They organized.  They hustled.  They got donations.  They got small donors.  The corporations all donated against them.  Wow.  The people called them white supremacists.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, these Asian white supremacists, noodle shop owners.  And and they won by two points.  Wow.  The first time in in Washington state history that a ethnic minority group ran a ballot measure and won and won.  Hats off to him. ",
