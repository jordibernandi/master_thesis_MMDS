            "text": "Hello everybody, are you tired of ancaps, libertarians and neo-fascists telling you that you don't understand basic economics?  Have you been wondering what they mean by that?  Well, fear no longer for I have compiled 7 very helpful videos by libertarians and conservatives which totally weren't just the top result of what youtube returned when I typed, socialists don't understand basic economics.  So, strap yourselves in, we're gonna learn some stuff today.  This video is called leftists don't understand basic economics and it's a video of this very sympathetic looking man watching a video where someone mentions the fact that inequality has been growing in the past and then he says that they have been creating 25 million jobs since the 80s and that most of our poor people live better than most of the people who live in the third world.  He also says that middle class is a Marxist term but that's a whole new level of wrong and let's ignore that.  Basic economics lesson 1.  Inequality isn't growing, don't you see the new jobs?  Silly socialists are saying inequality is getting worse even though the economy is growing.  What?  You googled it and it turns out unemployment can be low and inequality can be high?  At the same time?  Are you saying that there can be more than two things existing at the same time and that the facts show that I am wrong?  Uhhh, let's quickly move on before the viewers realize I'm talking crap. ",
