Okay, so a lot of you have been asking me to comment on Mike Todd.  Mike Todd is an author and co pastor of the transformation church alongside his wife, Natalie.  I don't know too much about this couple or this church, but I can tell you one positive.  I love their stance on online services in the middle of COVID.  Praise Jesus.  Seriously, I know we're exhausted.  I know there's so much controversy surrounding masks and the COVID crisis, but it feels so good to see a church standing up for protecting humankind.  We know a lot of churches out there have not been doing the same thing.  That said, it appears the Todds went viral with their series Relationship Goals, which has since become a book.  Their channel boasts over 1 million subscribers, and the first things I noticed were superficial, to be honest, meaning Todd is handsome, fashionable, and well-lit.  This presentation is not new to me, Being an ex-evangelical, I am very used to seeing churches that look like concerts and pastors who look like pop stars.  And those churches were not healthy for my walk with God.  So when I see that, I usually get immediately wary.  But my hope obviously is that transformation is a place where people are in healthy community and in healthy relationship with Jesus.  But I have only seen Todd's sermons on sexuality and they are deep in purity culture.  First, Todd says this. ",

In the simplest explanation, purity culture is the teaching of abstinence until marriage.  This culture enjoyed a major surge in the eighties and nineties with true love waits and then became even more extreme with joshua harris's i kiss dating goodbye which harris has since apologized for.  i'm going to give you four major themes that will help you recognize when you're being given a purity culture message so you can recognize and reject it.  the first major theme of purity culture is that sexual acts will make you lose pieces of yourself that you'll be damaged that you'll be less than for having sex.

He created us in his image.  We are not things.  Two, sexual connection is a renewable resource.  I should know.  I have had a lot of sex and my life is also a testament to number three, which is that having sex outside of marriage does not diminish our capacity for love or our ability to be in future healthy relationships.  The second major theme of purity culture is that it attempts to build a sexual ethic on fear.  Y'all fear is not a foundation.  Love is second Timothy one seven for God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.  When you rely on fear to motivate your choices or to motivate the choices of your congregation, you are building a sexual ethic on fear and that foundation will crumble.  And it is not of God.

Those negative emotions arrive because of shame and fear because church is not traditionally a safe place to have honest, truly honest conversations about sex.  This is because in church we've created a black and white sexual ethic.  I truly did on this 12 year journey exactly what Pastor Mike is saying here. ",

And this is why I promote sexual integrity.  RIP purity culture.  Purity culture is built on fear.  Sexual integrity is built on love of yourself and others.  And if you're a spiritual person, God, And you might realize the best thing for you is to save sexual experiences for marriage.  And that is not only beautiful, but it is perfectly okay.  Because like Pastor Mike Todd said, Sex was God's idea.  And if you want to learn more about sexual integrity, here are some principles of my own.  And that's it.
