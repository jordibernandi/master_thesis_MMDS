            "text": "Are you calling me?  What are you guys doing?  Sir, what are y'all guys doing?  What are you doing?  What are y'all doing with the camera?  Yeah, I see that, but why?  4K!  What are y'all doing?  You're not deaf.  You can understand me.  What are y'all doing?  Get out of my face.  What?  First off, you don't have my permission.  Have y'all called?  Like, do we need to call someone?  What?  What are you guys doing?  Good morning, Sonny.  You know, let's see what all you got.  Bigger?  Thank you.  Hey, bud.  Hello.  Can I help you?  Can I ask who you are and what you're doing?  Can you not hear me?  Did I ask who you guys are and what you're doing?  Is there a reason why you're taking pictures?  I'm not going to move until you talk to me.  I'm not doing anything.  Why are you not talking to me?  Do you not speak English?  I don't understand what your hands are doing to me.  I don't know what's over there.  Wall?  Flowers?  Grass?  I don't know what you're saying.  Do you speak English?  Do you speak English?  Can I call the police, since you're harassing me?  I'm not moving anywhere until you talk to me and tell me who you are.  I'm asking you to leave now.  You're trespassing on private property.  So if you don't want to leave, I have them calling the police and I'll have the police escort you out.  Since you won't notify me and tell you who you are.  You don't have the right to take my picture.  And here's the police now.  Hello?  What's the fucking guys doing?  Yeah, the police are right here.  What are these fucking guys doing?  The police are here.  Thank you.  Who are you?  I don't know what the fuck that means.  I don't speak that language.  Where the fuck are these guys?  They apparently don't speak.  You sound like a little bitch right now, man.  Oh, there we go.  Why don't you talk to me when I ask you a question?  You sound like a little bitch, man.  Stop crying.  Stop crying.  Well, don't worry about that.  Well, don't.  Don't.  My business is not your business.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  Are you going to build the wall in front of your business so nobody can see it, or what?  All right, so they came up here.  Taking pictures, videos, asking me to move.  What do you mean?  come here?  No, you come here.  What the hell?  Who the hell do you guys think you are?  What are you guys doing?  What company are you with?  That's none of your business, ma'am.  It is because they called us.  Hold on, hold on.  Go ahead and record.  We're recording too.  We're just trying to find out what you're doing here.  that's causing these people to call the police.  That's not my concern, ma'am.  Their feelings are not my concern.  They can call a bitch and complain to anybody.  I don't care about that.  It's none of your business.  I'm out here.  I'm a photographer.  I'm out here taking pictures, and that's all you got to know.  Do you have any ID on you?  No, I don't.  What crime have I committed for you to ID me?  No, you don't have permission to search me or to run my record.  I don't give you permission to look me up in any way or search me or ask me any other questions.  I plead the fifth.  Have a good day, ma'am.  Have a good day.  Bye-bye.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Are you leaving?  No, are you?  Yes, sir.  You're not in charge.  What's up?  You're not in charge.  Oh, you're in charge?  You're in charge?  Who's in charge there?  I don't get it.  What crime has been committed here?  Why are you trying to illegally ID me then?  No, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  You contact somebody when they've committed a crime, then you ask them for ID.  What crime has been committed here today?  Yet.  Here's the deal, guys.  I'll make this easy.  It's not against the law to film or do whatever you want out here on the street.  But if you get on their property, they have the right to arrest you guys for trespassing if you don't leave.  Yeah.  So when did we go on their property?  I didn't say you did.  Have your property investigated for you to be making statements like that?  He was in charge.  All right.  Don't make your statements until you know the fact, man.  All I said is just don't.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Respectfully, have a good day, sir.  Respectfully, you understand that?  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day.  Okay.  Have a good day.  Good luck.  Don't get close to me.  Six feet, man.  Al Laz, what's your badge number, Al Laz?  It's right here?  You're part of the, it's right here, it's right here, it's right there?  Yeah.  You can't just tell me what your badge number is, ma'am?  You can't just tell me what your ID is.  You're a public servant.  I'm asking you for your ID number.  You need to ID yourself.  What's on my badge?  Which is?  You can read it.  You don't know your own badge number?  Okay, turn around so I can, yeah, okay, there you go.  Choo-choo and choo-choo.  I don't want you to claim anything's going on here.  I'm just trying to get your badge number, okay?  Let me see your name now.  Tits and tits.  Right there, as you said.  I know.  Big tits?  Yep.  My tits.  Somebody's got them here.  Yeah, at least you have the balls.  These guys don't have the balls.  You got the front, but you don't got the back.  Is that down?  Correct.  Yep, we're good.  We're good, huh?  Ain't that right, sir?  There he goes.  Ain't that right?  You too.  Damn, what happened?  You guys make yourselves look kind of wacko.  There's nothing wrong with that.  What do you mean?  What's normal?  What's normal today?  Explain that to me.  This is technology.  What's normal?  We're using technology.  She's filming.  Oh, let's call the cop on her.  Problems?  What?  Problems?  What are you talking about?  When did we say anything to you guys to cause a problem?  What's wrong with you guys?  Now you're making stuff up?  Dang.  Lady.  Lady, come on.  Hey, why is she filming us?  Hey, that's kind of weird.  That lady's filming us, don't you think?  Hey, why are you filming this lady walking around?  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Dad.  Hi, Dad.

Learn the law.  You try to invite me in, then you want to trespass?  Get out of here.  Dummy.  You just made yourself look like a fool.  Get out of here.  Get back to work, lady.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yada, yada, yada.  That's all you guys did.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Get out of here.  Yeah, so go away.  If we don't respect them, we don't respect you for being a little crybaby bitch.  Pussy.  What?  You called me a little bitch?  Yeah, I did.  For being a little crybaby bitch.  Being a crybaby little bitch.  Horrible.  Horrible attitude.  Wow.  Is the whole community like this?  Yeah, they don't like Latinos here, though.  I wonder if the whole community is like this.
