The honest teaching of the British Empire is, is to say, quite simply, it is the first key stage of world globalization.  It's probably the most important moment in human history, and it is still with us.  Its consequences are still on, and generally speaking, in most ways, actually fruitful.  There are downsides, again, as the Brexit vote demonstrated.  So that's how you go about tackling it.  And as for the idea, as I said, that slavery... is this kind of terrible disease that dare not speak its name.  It only dare not speak its name, Darren, because we settled it nearly 200 years ago.  We don't normally go on about the fact that Roman Catholics once upon a time didn't have the vote and weren't allowed to have their own churches because we had Catholic emancipation.  And do you know what?  We had Catholic emancipation at pretty much exactly the same time that we got rid of slavery in the 1830s.  We don't go on about that. ",

They said, we need to exterminate these people.  And the Brits were like, well, you guys are great.  The white settlers had, surprise, surprise, a settler ideology.

So obviously surviving that journey doesn't mean you're excluded from the crime against humanity.  That was slavery.  The other stupid thing, obviously, in that video was the idea that why don't we talk about Catholic emancipation as much as we talk about the slave trade, right?  Catholics were oppressed in British history, but the Emancipation Act meant Catholics could sit in Parliament.  So it was about political exclusion.  It wasn't about owning people as objects.  And it wasn't about a system which killed millions and millions of Catholics.  It was political exclusion from the political system.  partly because, you know, the government at that period in time wanted distance from the Pope and the Catholic Church,  etc.,  etc.  Obviously, terrible discrimination, but it wasn't slavery.

Junior Harley Brewer, Isabel Oakeshaw, David Starkey.  uh these these kind of real mad cranks by the way.  the worst one melanie phillips she's.  i'm waiting for melanie phillips to be cancelled because melanie phillips she's quoted at length.  she's quoted at length by anders brevik in his manifesto.  this is the guy that slaughtered what 60 70 kids on the island of These were social democrats.  They were white Norwegian kids, right?  This is guys worried about Muslims and, you know, white genocide.  He's killing white people.  Why is he killing white people?  Because they were members of a reformist social democratic party.  You get there, what?  You get the language of anti-communism and so on.

Douglas Murray, he's got a huge following on YouTube.

Something that he will not recognize.  We're going to go on to sort of like lighter stuff.  which is the Darren Grimes element of this whole shit show, really.  So Darren Grimes, he's often a sort of comedy figure that we bring up on this show every now and again.  He's a bit of a... I mean, he's kind of the dumbest guy on Twitter in a way, although he still gets platformed quite a lot on Sky News.  He obviously gave that interview... now there's been this backlash.  everyone sort of universally saying what david starkey said was completely racist.  it's one of the first interviews they've done on this new platform reasoned which is you know supposed to be a space.  um for people where you know in in darren grimes word are you sick of getting accused of being a racist?  then come and speak on this channel.  what happens?  you get someone on.  they're incredibly racist.  he doesn't know to see everyone else does.  he's very embarrassed.  let's take a look at his apology.  Hand on heart, I wasn't engaged enough in this interview as I should have been.  It goes about saying that Reasoned UK does not support or condone David Starkey's words.  I'm very new to being the interviewer rather than the interviewee, and I should have robustly questioned Dr.  Starkey about his comments.  However, whether it's on BBC, ITV, Sky News, or on YouTube, no interviewer is responsible for the views expressed by their guests.  As Reasoned UK, you'll always find unfiltered opinions allowing the audience to make up their own minds.  That said, in future, I can promise that there will be a host who is much more willing to challenge those opinions.  Now, that's sort of Darren Grimes saying, I just wasn't concentrating in that particular period.  I mean, it's a live interview.  These things happen.  What could I have done?  I should have challenged him in that moment.  Now, I mean, one problem with this is if you want to be an interviewer, you know, fix up to, you know, if you're creating a space which is for people who've been accused of racism.  I mean.  it's not a surprise when some of them spout racist nonsense.  but also let's look at this tweet um that he sent 24 hours before that apology.  um slightly at odds with what he says afterwards.  so he says they say never meet your heroes.  well i virtually met one of mine and it was bloody fantastic.  dr david starkey and i discussed the scholarship behind the laudable slogan of black lives matter compared to the movement seeking to delegitimize british history.  have a watch.  We can also get up his tweet from Parler, the sort of right wing version of Twitter that we talked about on a previous show.  It's so good.  I'm watching it back again.  This is not a guy who disagrees with anything David Starkey said.  He was nodding along as he was saying it all.  I mean, obviously, I can't confirm he agrees it, but the evidence is pointing in one direction, isn't it?  The dumbest take, I think, was from Julia Hartley Brewer.  Let's get this up.  So she was defending Darren Grimes.  Remember when everyone attacked Emily Maitlis?  about what Prince Andrew said in that interview she did with him on Newsnight?  No, me neither, right?  The point there she's making is, look, it's not the responsibility of the interviewer what the interviewee says.  Now, I think if Emily Maitlis, straight after doing that interview, had tweeted, they say never meet your heroes.  Well, I virtually met one of mine and it was bloody fantastic, right?  I think people would have had something to say if after that interview she called Prince Andrew one of her heroes. ",

And then afterwards, and then sharing the interview afterwards going, you know, had to watch it again.  Brilliant.  What an amazing man.  That's the equivalent.  I mean, Julia Hartley knows what she's doing.  Fine.  You know, again, she's another one stealing and living.  Fine.  Let her do it.  Again, the thing is, when you look at a free country, you can spout all the bullshit you like.  The thing that I don't like is the BBC kind of giving it a veneer of legitimacy.  It's ridiculous.  And it's not just a one-off.  You know, people from Novara go on the BBC, whatever.  She's one of the mainstays, right?  There's four or five people who basically every week are on BBC Question Time.  And they say really batshit crazy things.  All I want to say is, look, if you're going to have one of those from the right, have one of them from the left.  right and actually there's not many batshit crazy people on the left.  there's not really an analog because guess what the market doesn't really pay for that stuff.  so it tends to be like the spectator or rupert murdoch that pays for these people because their role is primarily political to take the country's conversation a particular direction.  And it's the same with Darren Grimes, by the way.  This Reason channel, it's really professionally done.  It's come out of nowhere.  They're using Twitter advertising.  I've seen some of their, for instance, when you go on Darren Grimes' Twitter, he's posting from Instagram, from YouTube, and they get a preview card and it says Twitter advertisers.  They're spending big money on this.  Where's that coming from?  They're spending big money on this.  And at the same time, they get the foot up from the BBC, which the rest of us are paying for.

But let's get it up.  If you're on the right and want to help counter left wing propaganda on the Internet, here's how you can do it.  Help grow reasoned.  Again, this is for reasonable people to counter the sort of hostile left-wing agenda which is encroaching on our right to talk honestly about things.  But now let's look at his follow-up tweet to this, his tail between his legs.  Just to clarify, I tweeted a link to a GoFundMe page for a reason.  I have not seen the interview, but now have.  The views expressed in it should have been taken apart in no way.  Do I associate myself with them?  But if you look at their crowdfunder, it seems like he has associated with them in another way.  So there is a \u00a3100 donation from someone called Ian Dale.  It could be, obviously, I don't know, maybe this is someone who's wasted \u00a3100 to try and pretend to be Ian Dale and give them some money.  But ultimately, what does this whole Sorry Affair show... it's that when people say you know it's not a coincidence that this platform was started for people who get accused of racism And when they're allowed to talk openly, they do a big racism, right?  It's people who say that people call people racist too often.  I mean, often what they want to do is be completely racist.  And I feel like Ian Dale, someone who's been in the mainstream media for decades, should understand what people like Darren Grimes are about.  This is not someone who's trying to say, oh, we should be able to speak freely about things.  Council culture's got too extreme.  This is someone who will nod along While a guest, who he has sort of said, you know, you can speak freely on this platform, a guest is saying there are too many damn blacks, or why are there so many, implying there are too many damn blacks in Africa and Europe, because the slave trade wasn't quite violent enough, right?
