            "text": "About a year ago, I ended up going out with a group of friends for a birthday party in which I ended up very, very drunk and sleeping with a man who had been flirting with me the entire night.  It was the first time I felt so good in many years and I can't explain why.  what's going on?  everybody?  hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  like usual you guys read the title.  let's get into it and this one has an update as well.  so let's check this out.  so i a 29 year old female cheated on my husband who's 30 over a year ago and he has been punishing me since.  Can I still save the marriage?  So just reading the title, it sounds like, you know, she cheated, he found out, and he's just been torturing her.  But let's get into the story and see what's going on.  Here's some backstory.  I have been with my husband for almost seven years in total.  We got married within a year of meeting and have two children together.  He is an amazing man and an amazing person.  Handsome, well educated, good paying job, and he has never cheated or disrespected me in any way before all this happened.  My close friends and family always remind me of how lucky I have been in life to meet him and what an amazing guy he is.  I used to look at us like soul mates.  About a year ago, I ended up going out with a group of friends for a birthday party.  in which I ended up very, very drunk, and sleeping with a man who had been flirting with me the entire night.  It was the first time I felt so good in many years, and I can't explain why, but I ended up going home with him.  Within minutes of realizing what mistake I had done, I ordered a taxi home and confessed to my husband, crying, feeling incredible regret, and literally hating myself for it.  He initially stayed quiet and calm, but let me know he wanted a divorce.  But after begging and begging, we ended up going to counseling.  When at counseling sessions, he never seems to be coherent and just sits and scrolls on his mobile.  Whenever he gets a question about his feelings or what he can do to improve, he says something along the lines of, divorcing a whore maybe, or very negative answers directed towards me.  Most of the time he does not even seem to care and just stays quiet even when he's questioned and when we are trying to engage him into the conversation.  I realized the mistake I had done and I have spent the past year doing everything I can to save the marriage.  It has gotten to the point where I even agreed to do sexual acts which I despise for him such as backdoor sex.  I have been cleaning the house, cooking and all chores in the house by myself, with no help on the side.  Whatever he's asking for, you name it, I have done it all.  He has these outbursts in which he calls me horrible names.  Sometimes the children can hear it from their bedrooms.  in moments in which he just completely ignores me, walks through the house as if I don't exist.  He always treats the children with love and never badmouths me to them and tries to keep them away from our arguments.  Sometimes if I do not perform certain things, no matter the time, such as backdoor sex or other things, he starts telling me he will divorce me and leave me.  Or he begins mentioning my infidelity, telling me this is all my fault.  He says he did a mistake marrying me and calls me a whore or other words.  I also know he has been speaking to women.  And when I confront him about it, he literally starts mentioning my infidelity.  I have no proof whether he has met anyone behind my back, but I just want everything to go back to where it was.  One time when I brought up a message I had seen from another woman on his phone, he grabbed my hand and took me to the main hall and pointed to the door and told me the exit is right there.  I feel as if I have lost the caring, loving husband I once had and turned him into this monster.  I love him to death and can't imagine myself with anyone else.  I regret my mistake every single day and just want my family back.  I don't know if I can save this marriage, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes.  I don't know what I'm asking for.  Maybe I just need to vent out, but I just wish I could go back in time and reverse all of this.  wow now remember i don't know if uh some of the newer people probably haven't heard it but i did a story once before where a woman was saying like yo i i cheated and i turned him into.  a monster like this one is seeming more savage than that one and like i said all my old videos i will put them back up and i'll let you guys know where they are.  but man this is.  this guy is more savage than that guy was.  but uh let's check out the comments.  Someone said, give him his divorce.  I'm trying to sympathize with you.  You're trying to make it work, but you made a huge mistake by going home with another man because of your drunk feelings.  You categorized him as a perfect man.  I believe he's trying to piece together the logic to your infidelity to which there is none.  You single-handedly ruined your family.  He has to come to terms with the person you are now from the person he married.  I agree his outbursts are concerning around your children and they are valid concerns, but he's also human.  He has to live with the fact that the person he promised to love, cherish, and be faithful to in front of your family and friends and also the mother of his children willingly chose to put herself above what you two built together.  His feelings of frustration and wanting to divorce are reactions to your night of fun.  I can't imagine what he is going through.  You've tried now.  It's time to understand some things.  when broken cannot be fixed.  Someone else said, It will never turn back to how it was before.  Never.  It is forever damaged.  And it seems that he has completely checked out.  The relationship has now become toxic and will never recover.  You will have to divorce.  I'm sorry, but you made a mistake that killed his love for you.  I know you regret it, but there is no going back.  Someone else said, First off, let me say that you need to stop lying to yourself about the cheating.  You started this off by writing literally a paragraph discussing how amazing he is and for what.  You clearly didn't give it ish enough to honor a pact you made in front of your friends and family and whatever God you believe in.  So when you say it felt good for the first time in a while, don't call it anything other than it is.  You cheated and you liked it.  For you two to think that you doing all the chores and letting him F you in the behind was going to build trust in a relationship, then you're both stupid and need to get divorced.  Wow.  Someone else said, your mistake has made his love for you disappear.  He will most likely never want to actually be in a relationship with you ever again.  He probably has no trust in you.  I suggest divorce.  Let him be happy.  Someone else said, it's like an inside out how all the character's happy moments of home and playing with friends became sad because she moved away.  Same thing, but with infidelity of a wife.  Let's check out the update.  All right, so update.  I, a 29-year-old female, cheated on my husband who's 30 over a year ago, and he has been punishing me since.  Can I still save the marriage?  Update.  So she says, I confronted my husband today.  As many people have stated, I have had a feeling he doesn't want to try anymore and that he just wants to move on.  Initially, I walked up to him and wanted to explain the entire situation about how I understand his pain and how I understand that he no longer wants to work on the marriage and move on.  So I told him if this is what he truly wants, I will accept it and let him move on with his life.  But that I truly love him and forever will.  He just stood silent and looked at me, came up and hugged me and started to cry.  Wow.  i started to cry as well.  this was the first time i felt genuine loving the hug and emotion from him in a long time.  after what i felt like a few minutes of crying and hugging he finally let go and was asking me to come sit down with him.  He started letting me know that he still loves me with all his heart and that he loves our children but he has a hard time forgetting and moving on from what happened.  He said he has these angry raging moments not only because he has the hatred of what I had done but also because he has these images in his head of what I had done.  He can't forget about them.  He told me he had plenty of women flirting with him over the years, and that he had plenty of chances to stray away from loyalty, but that I and the kids always meant more for him than a few moments of pleasure.  He also said that he loved me too much to hurt me.  I broke down even more when I heard him saying this.  He then kept on telling me how something is broken within him that cannot be fixed.  He said he had been chatting with other women these months but never actually slept or done anything physical with them because he did not feel it was the right thing to do.  Hearing me tell him that he can move on was the first time he felt I finally understood how he is feeling inside and how broken he is.  He told me that he does not know what the future holds for us but he for the moment being wants to be single, explore his own life and maybe we will end up together in the future.  But for the time being, he needs to work on himself away from me.  I told him I would agree to sign the divorce papers if he wanted a divorce and that I did not want anything from him.  What he brought into the marriage is his and I don't want to take that away from him.  He earns much more money than me.  But I still don't want him to have to use that money on me.  So I don't want child support as well.  Hearing all of this made him cry.  And he said he hopes he can forgive me one day.  But that time apart would do us both good and let us both reflect on our lives.  He said that he will get a lawyer and bring the divorce papers in a week or so.  I will not meet anyone else after the divorce and I don't want to either.  I truly hope he comes back to me one day so we can have our family again.  I wish I could take back everything.  I really have huge feelings of remorse and just lost the one person that truly is my soulmate.  I guess I am getting divorced now, guys.  Thank you for the comments and feedback.  Dang.  Let's check out these comments.  Let's see, this comment calls out something.  She says, you said I would not meet anyone else after the divorce and I don't want to either.  I truly hope he comes back to me one day so we can have our old family back.  I wish I could take back everything.  I really have huge feelings of remorse and just lost the one person that truly is my soulmate.  Well, this is the result of cheating.  Anyway, good luck.  Someone else said, divorcing him is the best thing you could do for the poor guy.  He's probably feeling so emasculated, belittled, humiliated, even one year later.  You regretted it only after the fact, not in the cab, not in his house, not even during.  Using alcohol as a reason doesn't fly here since you went home immediately afterwards and confessed.  absolutely like she was still a little drunk when she told him so you can't use that as an excuse.  you wanted to get it in real quick.  you said it was amazing.  you hadn't felt like that in years.  you wanted to do that.  don't use the alcohol as an excuse.  But, um, declaring you aren't going to be seeing anyone hoping he'll eventually get back with you is ludicrous as well.  You cheated so easily on a random night out with some guy that flirted with you.  I'd have a heck of a tough time believing it wouldn't happen again, especially if you're single.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I was reading that, too.  It was like, come on now.  Somebody, within a week's time, she'll be with somebody else.  Like, I don't know why she's trying to fool herself.  Um... Healing can take years.  Might want to check out Surviving Infidelity for some insight into how those who were cheated on cope with it.  Someone said, child support isn't for you.  It's for your child.  You cheated.  It ended the marriage.  But your soon-to-be ex is still a father.  Someone said, if your husband was the one who cheated, how would you have reacted?  Would you have taken him back?  In case he sleeps around during this period of finding himself, would you still take him back?  Someone said, oh, you know he's going to go crazy with other women.  Probably.  Someone said, well, you reap what you sow.  Remember that you made the decision to cheat on him.  Drunk or not, it doesn't matter.  You were the one who destroyed your marriage and family.  If you truly loved him, you wouldn't have cheated or put yourself in a situation where that could have happened.  You say you can't see yourself with anyone else, but you were with someone else.  I can't blame him for his anger and hurt because I couldn't forgive something like that either.  So with that in mind, a divorce is the best and only option.  Personally, I don't see you two getting back together, especially if he finds someone else who won't ever dream of hurting him that way.  You also need to wrap your head around the fact that he is going to date and sleep around with other women.  If you don't want to date, that's your business.  But just know that he will.  In the meantime, sign the divorce papers and move on with your life.  Don't wish and hope for something that may or may not ever happen.  Wow.  And on that note, guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  Dang.  He was... In that first one, he was a savage.  He was a savage.  He was making her pay.  He was making her suffer.  But... I'm glad.  I'm actually glad he went through because for a minute on this update, I thought he was going to.  OK, I love you.  Let's work it out.  No, I was scared he was going to do that.  I'm glad he was going with a divorce and he needs to go work on himself, you know, go be by himself.  That's good for him.  So let me know what you think about this in the comments, guys.  I will put the link to this in the description like usual, and I will catch you guys at the next one. ",
