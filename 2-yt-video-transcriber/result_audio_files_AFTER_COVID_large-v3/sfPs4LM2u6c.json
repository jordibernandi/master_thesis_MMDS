Since the vaccine is such a hot topic right now, we're going to be talking about it a bit more, but this time we'll go into a lot more detail than the previous video.  And of course, I didn't think it was a good idea to give an unedited video again, so I'll respond to something this time.  There's a video that has quite a few views from the Vax channel.  It was released over a month ago, be mindful of that.  Also, it involves a very angry woman. ",

Don't get me wrong, that's a lot of people, and I mean a lot.  But if you're trying to vaccinate someone in the population, there will always be room for things you don't expect.  There will always be the adverse events that we don't expect, which is why there needs to be a thorough tracking process that keeps a record of all these adverse events, and it seems like the UK will be doing that.  Another thing is, for example, children haven't been tested much for this vaccine, so it may be a good idea to wait before vaccinating your kids.  Not like kids would be high up in the priority list anyway.  Well, by the time you watch this video, we would have known more about the vaccine.

You're protecting others who otherwise would have received the virus from you.  It's simple.  When you meet your Meemaw for the holidays, you could be in a scenario that you would potentially transfer the virus to her if you were infected.  And if you're vaccinated, you most likely will be immune, so you won't become a vector or medium for this virus to jump over.  It's not rocket science, it's common sense.  Now, what Boris Johnson said is pretty simple.  But, you know, if he made some other claims about, say, higher level stuff, then yeah, I would want to see his sources.  So, I guess we can agree on one thing.  Don't blindly trust politicians.  I'd much rather have an infectious disease expert come to the podium and tell us his or her thoughts instead of a politician.  I mean, I get it, the Prime Minister is going to hold more influential power, but we still want to listen to people who actually study this field.

The most common adverse events are fatigue, headache, and the most common, pain at injection site, or in other words, the little bitch effect.  These adverse events are less than 5% of the trial participants, so there's no need to worry.  And even if you get it, it's not bad at all.  Moderna has a few higher rates of adverse events and also includes muscle and joint pain.  You can find the full list through Google.  You don't need to sit here listening to me name them all.  Now, adverse events are adverse events.  They aren't too concerning, but we need to document them.  Serious adverse events, however, are game changers.  If someone has a serious adverse event, it could potentially shut down the entire trial.  These are usually things where the patient needs immediate medical attention and is hospitalized for whatever reason.  Then you have to determine if the serious adverse event is related to your vaccine or not.  You know, send the drug back to the production company and have them investigate.  There's a whole process involved, and if it's really bad, the entire trial could go down.  Luckily, Pfizer seems to have not reported any serious adverse events, so we seem to be in pretty good shape in that regard.  Anyway, enough of that.  We're going to respond to a different anti-vax channel now.  And while we do it, I'm going to go into a lot more detail on how mRNA vaccines work, so stay tuned, and I think you will learn some valuable information. ",

But yeah, let's not get into it right now since that's an entirely different topic by itself.  But anyway, the point is that even if we wanted to rewrite your DNA, it's just simply not possible right now.  mRNAs do indeed contain a sequence of nucleotides, but it's not going to do anything remotely close to what you're claiming.

            "text": "That's simply not true.  The ingredients are fully disclosed.  So what's in it, you may ask?  I think this is a good idea to look into the vaccine and explain how this works.  So I found an official source from the NIH which contains the prescription information, and luckily for us, they have a section that contains the ingredients of this vaccine.  Let's go down the list real quick, starting at the top.  First off is the main part of the vaccine.  It is mRNA-BNT162b2.  I explained it briefly in my previous video on Pfizer, but this is just a regular mRNA.  No tricks.  I don't know the exact sequence, but it translates into something similar to the spike protein found on SARS-CoV-2.  No surprises there.  But of course, the mRNA by itself is not very useful, hence the other ingredients.  ALC0315.  This isn't showing its full name, so I'm going to switch it to this public user guide given to recipients in the UK.  Don't worry, they're the same thing.  ALC0315 has such a crazy IUPAC name, and ALC0159 as well.  I'm not even going to try to pronounce that.  Wow, such scary looking.  Surely this can't be good for you.  Well, it turns out that these are lipid nanoparticles.  Lipid basically meaning a hydrophobic substance, nanoparticle because it has to be less than about 200 nanometers in size.  And from that, it is pretty obvious what it does.  These two lipids serve as a vector for moving the mRNA through the cell membrane.  Now, as explained in my previous video, mRNA vaccines must be read by your own cells, and then your cells produce the spike protein.  The spike protein then circulates the blood to be recognized by your immune system.  However, this would only be possible if the mRNA can get into the cells.  And by itself, it's not possible, which is why we need the lipid nanoparticle vector.  Hydrophobic substances are generally pretty good at passing through the cell membrane due to its water-hating bilayer, and it isn't something that we just do based off theory.  This has been tested in many experimental treatments in the past, such as ones for cancer.  The lipid can structurally interact with the mRNA at low pH, transporting it into the cell.  I think, but I'm not sure, that a low dosage of cholesterol helps with that process, which by the way is one of the ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine.  Now let's move on to 1,2-diesteryl-SN-glyceryl-3-phosphochlorine, or DSPC.  I don't even think I pronounced that right.  This is actually another molecule that helps in the delivery system I just mentioned.  Wow, at least half of these are for that purpose.  Basically, it helps in creating a bilayer structure in combination with the ingredients listed above.  Very common in delivering any sort of drug into cell bodies, not just RNA.  Potassium chloride, next on the list, is very interesting.  It is very, very common in a lot of vaccines and you can sort of think of it as a life-sustaining substance.  In the blood, it dissolves into potassium and chloride.  Both are essential for properly maintaining the negative internal charges of cells.  Basically, think of it as an ingredient to help nourish and keep cells alive, such as the immune cells, for example.  Going down, we have the less active ingredients.  Potassium dihydrogen sulfate is found in just a few other vaccines.  To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what this does, but I think it acts as a buffer.  If you don't know what a buffer is, it is a solution that helps maintain and resist change in pH.  Next, we have sodium chloride, just a pinch of table salt, probably to control ion concentrations in the preservation of the vaccine.  Disodium hydrogen phosphate is found in many places, including your food and water, which is used for adjusting pH and removal of metal cations.  I believe it is used in combination with potassium dihydrogen phosphate as a pH regulator.  Finally, sucrose, basically just table sugar, is found quite commonly in vaccines because of its ability to stabilize viral particles.  So in this case, the viral proteins created from the BNT162b2 RNA wouldn't denature in the bloodstream that quickly, since sucrose helps to increase its half-life.  Well, that's basically the gist of it.  So as you can see, there's no trickery, there's no harmful substances, and keep in mind that each of these are in very low doses, so even if they had detrimental effects, they wouldn't be large enough in concentration to do anything.  So yeah, that's basically how this vaccine works.  The RNA moves in two cells, especially your nearby muscle cells at site injection, creates the viral spike protein, which then your immune system recognizes and produces a secondary response.  I did expect some sort of adjuvant, but I guess it's not needed here, and the scientists who developed this are definitely more knowledgeable in vaccines than I am, so yeah, no surprises. ",
