            "text": "It's been a tough couple of days for gold and silver prices.  In global markets, gold prices have fallen for the third time in four days.  Well, losses in gold were capped due to China-US tensions, as we just spoke to Christy, protests in the United States, and a weaker dollar.  Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,738.12 per ounce.  Platinum was up 0.3% to $850.19.  And silver fell 0.5% to $18.17.  We're joining me now to discuss Boomba's co-host and investigative journalist Ben Swan and Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital.  Ben or Peter, I'm sorry, let's start with you.  Let me ask you how much of the slowing of this gold and silver prices is due to the easing of the coronavirus restrictions and not just in the United States, but globally? ",

            "text": "Well, I don't think it really relates to that at all.  I think what we have had is a rally in global stock markets.  We've also seen a bit of a sell-off in the dollar and some of the other safe haven currencies, like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.  And I think that gold got caught up in that a little bit, as well as enthusiasm for the U.S.  stock market.  But remember, the only reason the U.S.  stock market is going up is because of the Fed.  We have bad economic news.  Now we have the riots diluting, which is making a bad economy worse.  And so the worse the economy gets, the more money the Federal Reserve prints, and so the more stocks investors want to buy.  But when the Fed is creating inflation, you're better off buying gold than the S&P 500. ",

            "text": "And we're looking at a possibility of some hyperinflation here with that.  Speaking of the Federal Reserve, Ben, there's a talk that the Fed is going to go to negative interest rates.  If that happens, what kind of effect might it have on these prices for gold? ",

            "text": "Well, I think if that happens and we're going to see, it'd be very good for gold because, you know, gold, there are some analysts who are looking at it saying that if that happens, gold could actually hit an all-time high simply because of the fact that negative interest rates would have that effect on safe haven assets.  But again, I think what Peter's saying is very true.  There's a whole series of issues that deal with the Federal Reserve and how the Federal Reserve has been conducting itself over the past few weeks and months and really years, but especially hyped up during coronavirus.  And I think what we're going to see is that the more moves the Fed makes, the better it is for any kind of safe haven asset, because the Fed continually demonstrates that it is erratic in its behavior.  It's not based in any kind of sound fiscal policy.  It's not based in anything that deals with the future and what future economies will look like.  It's all knee-jerk reactions to prop up an economy that is almost on life support. ",

            "text": "These metals seem to be a pretty safe haven, but staying with Ben, silver is in a different space than gold because it is an industrial metal.  And there are analysts who are predicting that silver is poised to go through the roof.  Why is that? ",

            "text": "Well, because of exactly what you just said.  So silver is different from gold in that it is an industrial metal and it is used for industrial purposes.  So right now, while silver is certainly cheaper than gold, as we watch the economies around the world start back up again, there are a lot of analysts who believe that they will see a huge push into silver from a lot of folks simply because there are actual functions for it in the industrial sector, as opposed to gold, where gold is more of the store of value, precious metals.  it's very possible we'll see silver rise to maybe even all-time highs on its own.

            "text": "I think silver has certainly bottomed out, not only in dollar terms, but in terms of gold.  Silver recently hit all-time record lows and priced in gold.  You could buy 120 ounces of silver for one ounce of gold.  That had never happened before, I think, in the history of mankind, or at least since we've been keeping records.  Right now, that ratio is about 95 to 1, but that still means you get a lot of silver for one ounce of gold.  And I agree with Ben.  I think the silver price is going to go much higher.  It could take a little while before it hits a record high.  Remember, in 2011, it got up to $50 an ounce.  So we need to triple approximately to get up there now.  But I think that is going to happen.  And it's going to be a general commodity bull market that's going to include a lot of commodities and the precious metals.  when we really start to see the consequences of all the inflation that the federal reserve is not only created in the past that is creating now but even more inflation that it's going to create in the future.  that is going to manifest itself in a sharply lower dollar against other fiat currencies.  that's going to really drive the demand for safe havens like gold and silver.  And we're also going to see big increases in consumer prices, whether we see negative nominal interest rates.  It's still a coin toss, but we already have negative real interest rates.  And that's going to get bigger and bigger because the rate of inflation is going to keep going up.  Yet the Fed is going to be stuck at zero because if they raise rates to fight inflation, they collapse the bubble economy. ",
