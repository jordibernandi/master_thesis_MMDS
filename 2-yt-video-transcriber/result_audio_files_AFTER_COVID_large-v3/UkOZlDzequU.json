            "text": "As-salamu alaykum.  You're absolutely right that John McCain has not talked about my Muslim faith, and you're absolutely right that that has not become my Christian faith.  We are no longer a Christian nation.  We do not consider ourselves a Christian nation.  Many other Americans have Muslims in their families or have lived in a Muslim-majority country.  I know because I am one of them.  Lots of ups, lots of downs, except for my approval ratings, which have just gone down.  But that's politics.  It doesn't bother me.  Besides, I happen to know that my approval ratings are still very high in the country of my birth.  Now, three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first Sitting American president to come from Kenya When we took our trip to Africa and visited his home country.  in Kenya Ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs.  That order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign.  and My last question.  After my election, I am more flexible.  I understand.  I transmit this information to Vladimir.  I understand.  Thank you.  Thank you.  ... ... ... ... There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections.  No, no, no!  God bless America!  God damn America!  ... ... ... ... ... ... Thank you. ",
