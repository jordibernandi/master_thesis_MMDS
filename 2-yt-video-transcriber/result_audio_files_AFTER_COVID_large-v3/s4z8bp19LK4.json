            "text": "Recently, we've all been very much aware of evangelical leaders and evangelical people becoming enamored with Roman Catholicism.  And the question comes up, why is that happening when there is a clear difference between the true gospel and the false gospel of Roman Catholicism?  What in the world is causing evangelicals to be attracted to Catholicism, to even be apparently embracing Catholicism as if it's one and the same as true Christianity?  I think reason number one is because there's a lack of doctrinal clarity, a lack of doctrinal clarity.  People don't understand sound doctrine, so they can't spot error.  Number two, there's a lack of courage.  There's a lack of willingness to be bold and say, this is the truth and Roman Catholicism is not the truth.  Roman Catholicism is heretical.  That takes courage.  And it's not popular to be that dogmatic and consequently that divisive.  And thirdly, I think there's pressure toward unity.  You know, we all talk about Christ, we all talk about His death and resurrection, so why can't we just be one with Catholics?  and wouldn't that be wonderful if we all showed kind of a single front to the world?  So that pressure toward a false unity is causing some people to be driven toward embracing Roman Catholicism as if it were one and the same in the true gospel.  So what's the solution?  We need to know what true unity is in the gospel.  We need to have the courage of our convictions and we need to be sure we're faithful to doctrinal clarity. ",
