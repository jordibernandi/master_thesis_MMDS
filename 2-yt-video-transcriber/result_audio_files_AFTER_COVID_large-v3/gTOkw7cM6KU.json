            "text": "If you have a problem with Candace, you have a problem with me.  This video is brought to you by the Officer Tatum store, the Officer Tatum store.  Get the merch link in the description section.  Make sure you like and subscribe to the channel.  Hit the bell so you get notifications.  Anytime I go live, I make a video.  Like this video, comment on this video, share this video, and let's get into this.  I want to make this very clear so there is no ambiguity.  You are not confused about what B Tatum says or where he stands.  If you have a problem with Candace, then you have a problem with Brandon Tatum.  Let me add this quick message to you haters out there that are claiming to be conservative, hating on Candace Owens.  Look, you have your right to have a perspective, and so do Candace Owens.  And because your perspectives are different, don't make her right and make you wrong and make you right and make her wrong.  Quit being soft.  You're just mad because she got a bigger platform than you do.  You just mad because real recognize real and people can recognize that you fake.  Some of y'all running for office and you sitting there talking more about Candace Owens than the person that you running against.  Now let's get into the facts.  Candace Owens made a video about George Floyd.  Candace Owens made a factual video about George Floyd.  There is a lot of people in America that love what Candace Owens said, that believes that she is a honorable individual for being bold enough and strong enough to tell the truth, even though it hurts some of y'all feelings.  Now, there's a population amongst us who are afraid of the truth.  They're afraid of being honest, even though they know that Candace Owens is telling the truth, even though they know the statistical data proves her right.  They are disingenuous in their approach because they're afraid to expose the problems in the black community to everybody else.  Now, I'll say this.  I and Candace Owens alike, and she said it in the video.  Now, I don't want to play the video.  I'll put the video in the description section.  But she said it in the video, and I will give anybody on here that can prove that she did not say what I'm about to say on that video, I will give you $20,000.  $20,000.  Candace Owens said on the video, which is unequivocal, that the man didn't deserve to die, that justice will be served, and that the police officer will face the court of law based on the decisions that he made.  She said unequivocally that her argument about martyrdom is separate from the argument of him dying and whether or not he deserved to die or not.  Now, there's two arguments that need to be had, but people don't want to have them because they don't want to be honest.  The police officer made poor decisions.  In my personal opinion, that has nothing to do with the court of law.  He is presumed innocent.  It's a proven guilty in the court of law.  We shall find out.  According to 12 people who are considered his peers are jurors that will determine his fate.  Now, the other conversation that Candace Owens is willing to have that some of y'all phonies don't want to have is that there is a huge issue of the mental projection in the black community that's matriculating down to every other community in the United States of America.  And that is the idea that we are to worship.  We are to give wings to.  We cannot say a foul word against people who live a life of extreme criminal behavior.  And then once they die, we can't say nothing about it.  They're off limits.  It is ungodly to speak of the truth because the person died at the hands of what?  A white police officer.  They don't mind you talking bad about black people no other time.  But if it's done at the hands of a white police officer, then it's an issue.  George Floyd, I don't know how many people, if he hadn't died, would be supportive of him.  George Floyd committed tons of crimes.  He's been in and out of prison.  One of the most heinous crimes that he did, which I believe that all you women, female activists out there will have a problem with, is that he pulled a gun on a pregnant woman during a home invasion.  Him and several other men rammed into a woman's house, put her at gunpoint, potentially traumatized her for the rest of her life.  And then at the time of his death, he's doing methamphetamine and fentanyl.  And some of y'all act like methamphetamine and fentanyl just sprinkles out of the air and falls into your system randomly.  No, you have to be in a certain lifestyle that gets you to a certain point where you're buying drugs from somebody in the community, probably another black man.  buying drugs for somebody in the community to the point at which you're high and operating a motor vehicle, then you use fake money to try to pay for something at the store that they call the police on you.  In order for you to be involved in all of this behavior, You are making poor decisions.  You are not a role model.  You are not a model of the everyday black man.  You are what we consider an exception.  You are a person who's on the lower end of the black spectrum.  You are scum of the earth.  If you are robbing, pillaging people and using drugs and destroying property and trying to buy stuff with fake money when everybody else here is working hard, obeying the law and doing what they're supposed to do.  But somehow, some way in our society, that person down here, who obviously he deserves justice and his family deserves justice, but that person down here is exalted in the realm higher than somebody like Ben Carson, Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, Clarence Thomas.  I could go down a list.  Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Madam C.J.  Walker.  I ain't never in my life seen somebody saying, say her name, Madam C.J.  Walker, who was the first female millionaire.  And if she was alive today, she'd be the billionaire out of any female in history, white or black.  But I don't want to say her name.  But the lowest amongst us.  All of these individuals that they are touting as say their name, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, all of these individuals, if they had not died, and 95% of them will justify uses of force, but if they had not died, they would be in prison right now.  They would be doing time for crimes that they've committed.  Eric Garner arrested 40-something times.  And some of his arrests were for resisting arrest.  Or at least a charge was for resisting arrest.  Sandra Bland assaulted a police officer and killed herself in jail.  It's all on video camera.  Nobody went in her cell.  Nobody came out of her cell.  This is not an Epstein.  She did that.  Instead of us addressing the fact that she had mental illness and us helping her with her suicidal ideations.  We want to just brush it off as a police brutality.  Tamir Rice, unfortunate situation.  The little kid twirling a gun that did not have an orange tip on it.  It was removed.  The gun looked like a real gun.  The police officer pulled up.  He walked out, pulled the gun, and they shot him one time.  No intent to kill, but subsequent to a justified use of force, that young man died.  That was tremendously unfortunate.  We can keep going down the list.  Michael Brown was a justified use of force determined by not only the federal government, but local law enforcement as well.  And anybody with a brainstem can tell that was a justified use of force by the police officer that unfortunately resulted in Michael Brown's death.  But y'all keep touting all of these individuals.  Breonna Taylor.  Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor was knee deep in a drug criminal enterprise.  If she had not been killed, which was very unfortunate, she would be in prison right now, along with her ex-boyfriend, Mr.  Glover.  Now, let's talk about Philando Castile.  Philando Castile would be in jail right now if he hadn't have been shot.  And let me tell you why.  Because in Philando Castile's vehicle, he had illegal marijuana in a jar.  Enough to send you to jail.  Now, not only did he have that, he's carrying around illegal marijuana while in possession of a firearm.  That's a felony crime.  And that's not only a felony crime, but it's a add-on to the felony crime by being in possession of a firearm.  He also was illegally in possession of a CCW.  He lied on his application and said he had not been using illegal drugs, which he had.  video and his toxicology results came back saying he was using illegal drugs, even at the time that he got the CCW.  On the CCW form, it talks about illegal drugs.  Now, you got a CCW, you can't be using illegal drugs or carrying or being in possession of illegal drugs.  So you're in violation of your CCW license.  I could go down a list.  Every single person, Laquan McDonald.  Laquan McDonald was unjustified to be shot by the police officer.  Shot him 12 times.  That police officer got charged with second degree murder, which was the appropriate charge.  Laquan McDonald was high on PCP, running around threatening people with a knife, threatening several police officers.  Y'all cannot find anybody.  Stephen Clark.  Let's go to Stephen Clark in Sacramento.  Burglarizing vehicles.  Try to force entry into somebody's house.  All of what we are talking about are felonies.  Then he jumped in the backyard, went to pull out something that looked like a gun to the police officers in pitch black darkness with grass that's about six feet tall, and they shot him and killed him.  If he had not have been killed, he would have been in prison.  I can go down the list.  All the ones that I've known, that I've seen, that I've touted are all extreme criminals who happen to get killed by police.  A small minority of them are unjustified.  The large majority of them are justified uses of force that you just will not accept.  I'm all for standing up for people and standing up for injustice.  I will protest, and I'm telling y'all as I'm standing here, I will protest police shootings that are not right.  I will protest them if justice is not served.  In George Floyd's case, they fired the officer the day the video came out and they charged him and the other officers that were related, which I think that they should not have charged the officers that were related.  They're going to have a hard time proving them in court, but Chauvin should have been charged.  They did all of that and they're still protesting.  And in our community, in the black community, and you can't say I didn't grow up in a black community.  I did.  My stepfather died from heroin overdose, big time gangbanger.  And you can't tell me I don't know what's going on.  I know a lot of people in my family who sold drugs and sold drugs to each other.  Watching them high and strung out on crack cocaine.  At my draft day event, so high on drugs, they can't even speak a full sentence.  And you telling me I don't know what's going on in the dope game?  I don't know about crackheads and I don't know about being in a black community?  Graduated from Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School, right in the middle of the hood and stop six.  All black school.  Okay, okay, now that I threw a little bit of my credentials out there, I know what I'm talking about.  And I know these things are prevalent in the black community.  ABL said in his video, y'all should go follow ABL.  ABL said in his video that when you come home from a college graduation, when you come home from getting your doctorate degree, You don't get the same celebration that when you come home for doing time in the pen.  You want to know how.  I know?  How many parties were thrown for me after I graduated college?  How many?  How many parties?  How many parties were done when I started my master's degree program?  When I graduated from the police academy?  How many parties were thrown?  How much coordination?  Now, one of my cousins who I love very dearly, he's going to get out of prison after doing 15 years.  He was sentenced to 70 years.  One of his charges was for shooting three people.  I love him to death.  I know he made a mistake, and I feel like he's a changed man.  He's sentenced to 70 years.  He'll do 15.  He will be out.  When he come home, the family, I guarantee you, will throw a celebration big as we've ever seen.  I will be there.  So you can't tell me that people don't throw a bigger celebration from when you come home from doing time in a pen than when you get an education.  No fault of their own.  It's just.  people don't think like that in the hood.  People don't think like that in large pockets of the black community.  That's something that needs to change.  That's something that needs to change.  We don't need to put a person who has tormented the black community for years on a mural.  And try to say this is an example of black men in America that if you are like him, you will be killed.  That is not true.  And I'm going to make a video about the NFL players saying the stupidest stuff that I've ever seen.  But they're in a video saying, I'm Michael Brown.  I'm Philando Castile.  I'm Breonna Taylor.  Are you really?  Are you really?  You live in a multi-million dollar house.  You're making millions of dollars.  You're making people's whole salary in one football game.  Are you really like Breonna Taylor?  Are you knee deep in the dope game?  Do you have a search warrant for your arrest at your residence?  Oh, you don't?  Well, then you're not Breonna Taylor.  Oh, were you fighting with the police officer in the middle of the street for his firearm and got shot dead?  Then you're not Michael Brown.  Are you riding around dirty smoking weed with your kid in the backseat carrying a gun with marijuana?  Then you're not Philando Castile.  I can go down the list, ladies and gentlemen, but then my video will be three or four hours.  I believe Candace Owens has been completely consistent since day one.  And if you don't like Candace Owens, then don't watch her.  Candace Owens nor I have ever said I'm the voice of the black community.  The truth is, is that people recognize real.  People can recognize facts.  So then they follow us and it makes us the spokespeople of the black community issues in the United States of America.  It ain't our doing.  The truth is the reason why people watch and listen.  Candace Owens' platform is 20 times as big as mine.  But, you know, at the end of the day, people can recognize real.  And there's a lot of up and coming black conservatives that keep it real and that people understand that they can go to for facts.  If we ever going to change anything, and I'm going to finish it on this.  If we're ever going to change anything in this country.  then we need to operate in truth, not your feelings.  Because your feelings change.  Your feelings change for people.  Your feelings change for politics.  Your feelings can change about the things you've done wrong in life and you want to correct them.  Your feelings can change.  But the truth will never change.  The truth is the truth when you were born and the truth will be the truth when the day you die.  And people need to understand that.  the only way you're going to be free is if people are telling the truth.  Now, I'm going to give this analogy and I promise I'm off because I want you to watch all my other videos.  Now, I'm going to give an analogy about deep sea or what they consider cave diving.  When you dive in a cave in water, you have a safety rope.  If you ever lose track or cut that safety rope, you have no way of finding your way back to the surface, back to freedom, back to air, to oxygen.  Eventually, you will get lost in a cave.  Your equilibrium is off.  You don't know if you're up, down, left, right.  You don't know how deep you are.  You don't know how high you are.  You will die eventually because you don't have the safety rope.  Now, in this analogy, the safety rope is the truth.  As long as you got the safety rope, as much as you get turned around and you get confused, you can always use the safety rope to pull yourself back to safety, pull yourself back to reality.  Ladies and gentlemen, never forget the safety rope.  Now, is B Tatum tripping?  Do you support Candace?  Let me know in the comment section.  Like and subscribe to the channel.
