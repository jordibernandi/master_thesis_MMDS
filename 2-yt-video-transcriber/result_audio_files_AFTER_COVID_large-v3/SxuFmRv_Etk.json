It's a continuation of my little series about Gina Maria's difficulties with fiction.  Last time was about how because Gina interprets fan wiki pages about the works of J.R.R.  Tolkien as having similarities to the story of the Garden of Eden, that means the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion are... If not exactly true, then at least difficult to accept as untrue.  This time we're changing topics completely and talking about spiders on the moon. ",

Some of it related to the channel, and a lot of it just dumb stuff.  that's in my way.  I don't know what it is with this year.  And for some reason, December's in particular are bad.  I'm recording this in December, and all this month I've been getting sidetracked.  Somehow during the Christmas season and the harshest COVID lockdown my province has seen yet, that's the busiest possible time when everything starts coming up?  I don't know what's going on, I'm just confused and hoping January comes quick.  Last December was like this too.  So look, two Decembers in a row are weird.  And that of course tells us that there's something wrong with December itself as a concept.  It's only logical.  So my vote is we cut it out of the calendar and next year just do Christmas in November.  That'll fix everything.  What were we talking about?  Um.  You don't know either, eh?

Of course, this is what today we call the Moon.  Now, as we all know, only the elves have access to the straight road that leads to the Moon.  So my belief is that NASA, which stands for the Numenorean Aeronautics and Space Administration, was founded to find a way to the moon so that the Numenoreans could gain immortality.  But having failed at that objective, they decided to just blow it up.  At least then they could stick it to those goddamn elves.  But it didn't actually work.  All they managed to do was land a bunch of people on the moon and bring them back.  They really did not plan their attack very well.  They accidentally stuck the crew capsule on the end of the rocket instead of the warhead.  It was a real big mix-up.  Someone got fired for sure.  But anyway, since the missile idea didn't work out, they decided, well, we already got this crew capsule, how about we just load that thing up with a bunch of robot spiders, and at least the elves will have to deal with that.

The one who destroyed the two trees of Valinor.  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life.  So maybe the spider in the movie is Shelob.  But in that case, how did Shelob get to the moon unless... NASA's Spider Robots.  And wait a minute, the moon!  No, the moon's not Amon!  The moon is the last flower of Telperion, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil!  The piece that Ungoliant failed to destroy the first time.  And now we've sent Robo-Shelob straight to it!  It's the destructive capacity of a missile times like a billion!  I mean, Robo-Shelob's Robo-Granddaddy already ate the whole damn tree!  One bit of fruit isn't gonna be a problem!  Dear Lord, what have we done? ",

Let's take a look at some of your other comments to learn some more facts.  I saw an interview with a man with NASA who said we couldn't go back to the moon because the technology had been DESTROYED!  Yes, there are giant spider beings.  Heard it first from one of the interviews with Captain Randy Kramer who was stationed on Mars and spilled the beans on that and more.  There are tons of disclosure movies and books, we just could not see it.  According to many whistleblowers, a portal was opened that allowed these spider beings in.  The first time they breached a portal was in Vietnam, and many of our fighting men actually saw them.  According to whistleblowers, these giant spiders ate an entire population of a million people long ago.  They've recently come through again.  That's what I have heard.  Oh, well, if that's what you heard, it must be true.  They are chimera spiders.  They live in the inner Earth with other dark entities, but the Galactic Federation, along with U.S.  military and other allies, helped remove all the lower entities from the inner Earth, as well as rescue the victims there.  The population in the inner Earth was almost same as the population on surface.  These aliens were growing a misfit army underneath us and terraforming a surface with pollution so they can come up and rule over us.  However, the Galactic Federation are working to clear the malevolent hybrid aliens and their buddies that are hiding in Switzerland and Russia in the mountains as of now.  I think you get the point.  I'm not sure that I would be taking these comments as a reliable source, let's put it that way. ",

Massive thanks to all of my supporters who keep the channel going.  And I'll see you next time.  You don't belong here. ",
