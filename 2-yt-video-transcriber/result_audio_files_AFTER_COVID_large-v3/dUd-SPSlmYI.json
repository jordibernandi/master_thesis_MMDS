Well, look, let me ask you a couple practical questions, okay?  How did you find the Pipefender Apprenticeship Program?  I was getting out.  They had transition programs for vets.  It was a new program that started in Fort Hood, Texas, and that was the trade I wanted to go into.  I was a welder.  And how do civilian employees \u2013 What don't they get about the enormous talent veterans offer?  I mean, is there a?  is there a concern that vet getting out doesn't know what he's doing or she's doing?  or is there a larger than ours?  And so he has just sort of waved the white flag on on dealing with COVID.  And he all he wants to do is just just reopen.  But the way he's reopening is causing us to shut down.  Look what's happening with schools right now.  If you have kids trying to get them back in school right now, it's pretty tough.  The you know, I seems to me that there is things can and should change because for the first time.  Unions are respected more for the first time than they have been any time in the last 50 years.  Over 65% of the American people support union movement, support union growth.  And so... ",

            "text": "All right, so there's just so much that we could just do the whole show on this.  First off, vets are enormously talented.  That part of the clip didn't get finished, and you should believe that.  And if you're a company owner out there, small business owner, large business owner, whatever, you should definitely hire them.  Just because they come from a different field doesn't mean anything.  The work ethic, the discipline, everything that comes with them is great.  So definitely go out and hire veterans.  But let's unpack this Biden thing here for a second.  First off... It's at someone's house, so you can't control the setting, although you chose it, and you can control it in that sense of what you choose and what you don't choose.  But it's at someone's house, poorly manicured lawn, and different chairs.  You're socially distanced, yet you're all wearing masks.  You're outside.  But you got to keep up that mask narrative that Biden and Cam Cam have been sharing and pushing down people.  But then the bigger thing is not the mask.  Like, look, if you want to wear a mask again, I don't care.  That's your prerogative.  You're doing it, Joe, for political reasons and grandstanding, and that's it.  But for the rest of you, for the normal people out there, do it, don't do it.  Just be respectful of others.  And if they have a different opinion than you, so be it.  Let them do their thing.  But you've got notes, Joe.  You're sitting down having a casual conversation.  It's supposed to come off as like this casual fire pit style conversation where you're just shooting the crap with people.  And you've got notes.  And not only do you have notes with like a question or two on them, which would be fine if it's going to be a long event.  Like I want to make sure that I hit these or those.  But there's lots of detail on them and he has to keep going to it.  Had to keep going through the whole time.  Let's make an awkward transition from one topic to another that don't connect at all.  Let me consult my notes.  All right, here's my question.  It just was so sloppy, and when there's so many concerns out there about the fact that he can't think for himself, he can't stay on task, he can't stay on message, and others are having to do it for him.  Having him out there in a casual setting, incapable of having a normal conversation because he's got to have a tablet of notes in front of him, doesn't help the narrative.  We're going to pick that apart.  And again, I don't wish him ill.  So what?  He can't stay on message anymore?  He's got lots of other issues.  He's a creep, yada, yada, yada.  But I don't care.  I still don't wish the man ill.  But don't keep carting him out there and expecting him to rally the troops and get people excited.  There's no boat parades for Joe Biden because of stuff like this, because of the gaffes, because of 47 years of service and nothing to show for it.  But that clip there wasn't all.  Joe gave us that on Monday or earlier this week.  He also took part in this virtual town hall meeting that was online.  You know, like we've seen all throughout COVID with the split screen.  Questions were coming in.  And sticking with the whole concept of he has to have notes.  He has to have a prompter.  He has to have some help.  to get his response out or his message out.  This was a question from someone participating in the virtual town hall and then him pausing and having what seems like a staff member.  move up the teleprompter for his response.  Rule two, we'll see what you think. ",

            "text": "What will we do?  Move it up so I can tell her what we'll do.  Like, you gotta know this stuff.  Back to the outdoor conversation with this.  If you're the candidate and you know your stance and your policies on issues, these should all be easy.  Giving a speech can be tricky, this, that, and the other, although you've got a prompter for a speech, so that's really out the door too.  But having conversations when people are asking you questions and you're just sharing what's in your heart, that's really easy if you know what's going on, if you know the issues, if you know where you stand on things.  And it's becoming more and more apparent that Joe doesn't.  It's all anti-Trump.  It's all, he did a bad job with COVID, so elect me, even though I have a track record of failure.  Never done anything, and clearly I'm not well.  I mean, that's the campaign.  But I think it's just hilarious that they keep carting him out there, and they keep calling him out.  There was also, this week too, he came out, it was a conversation from before, but the clip's being discussed this week, where he's now saying, we can't constitutionally mandate that everyone nationally wears a mask.  He's like, I'm not sure if we can actually do that.  And people were calling him on the carpet for it.  because in multiple speeches before, he said, I'm going to mandate a national mask policy.  Everyone's going to have to wear them.  We're going to get this thing right, yada, yada, yada.  And then, of course, when he's calling the car, I didn't say that.  Hold on, man.  I didn't say that.  Although there's literally clips out there of him saying, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  So he'll get away with all of this.  He'll get away with using notes.  But you know where he won't get away with it?  The debates.  Y'all, this is going to be good TV.  There's a lot of you boycotting sports.  Again, totally behind you if you do.  If you don't, that's fine too.  But your TV schedule should be a lot lighter right now because shows aren't in production as much.  People are boycotting sports.  It's just a different year.  But don't miss these debates.  Don't miss these debates.  They are going to be well worth it. ",
