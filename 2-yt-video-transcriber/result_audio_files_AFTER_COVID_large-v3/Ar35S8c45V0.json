            "text": "So I was asked today, somebody said, Dr.  Boyce, how does the entire economy fall on its ass in less than two weeks with all the supply chains around the world and everything else?  How does it die so quickly from something like a virus?  And so the best way I explained it in real simple terms is an economy runs on three major components.  There are three major pieces.  This is not the entire picture, but this is a. this is a view in a nutshell.  One, consumers have to go buy products.  You know, you go buy things at the grocery store, you buy coffee at Starbucks, you buy new couches, you buy new cars, things like that.  And then two, businesses use that revenue to hire people.  Many of the people they hire are the same people that are consuming products from other companies and their own company as well.  They also make investments.  They make capital infrastructure investments and hire more people and more contractors to get things done.  Um, well, those two components pretty much died almost overnight.  Um, if you look at this virus, one thing it did was it told, uh, consumers stay home.  Don't spend money.  Uh, you spend money online, maybe spend money on food delivery.  So a lot of the economy is transitioning, but you know, don't go to the mall.  Don't go to the movies.  Don't go to the club.  Don't go and do all these things that we're going to generate money.  Don't even go out to eat.  Right.  And then the third component to the economy, besides the consumers, And besides the producers are the banks.  The banks are the ones who loan money to consumers and producers so they can engage in each other.  So it's almost like when you think about almost like a fertility doctor, when they say, you know, I want the husband and the wife to get together and make sweet love and make a baby.  Well, the fertility doctor says, well, here's a procedure or here's some medication that will help you get the job done.  So the banks are like the financial fertility doctors that will loan money to the consumers so they can do more consuming and loan more money to the producers so they can do more producing and so they can hire more consumers.  So the economy ends up kind of running, you know, just running 100 miles an hour.  And so basically the coronavirus kind of killed all three of those things.  One, the consumers are staying home and worth spending money.  two the producers uh were when are not making investments they're not hiring anybody.  uh three if the banks are seeing that the producers and the consumers ain't getting together then they're not going to inject the financial fertility necessary for things to happen.  they're going to try.  but again think about this imagine if you're a fertility doctor and you're trying to get two people to make a baby and they won't even come in the same room because they're scared of each other.  so the common denominator a lot of times in an economic breakdown is actually fear.  uh fear and separation.  when people fear each other and they're separated from one another, then sweet love ain't gonna happen.  Reproduction is not gonna happen.  Getting together ain't gonna happen.  Creating something better ain't gonna happen.  So in fact, that's a big part of the reason why the black economy struggles because black people are scared of each other.  They're scared to do business with each other.  They're scared to have black customers.  They're scared to work together half the time.  Not everybody, but a lot of us are, right?  You know what I'm talking about.  And then two, there's separation, right?  When you're separated, you can't get together and engage in the economic fertility of the financial fertility process where you create something better, create a better world because you're making trade with each other.  So effectively, that's how an economy can die within two weeks.  And basically, that's what you have in the United States and around the world.  is a complete standstill.  And how are we going to get out of this?  I don't know.  It starts with the fertility doctors.  It starts with the banks jumping in and providing as much liquidity and financial support as necessary to get these two back together and to get them trading again, the consumers and the producers.  But again, if this virus is never gone, then people are still going to be afraid.  Nothing's going to happen.  Things aren't going to move.  So that's my breakdown in a nutshell of why the economy is falling apart.  Thank you for that question.  Lionel Poston, you put that on my Facebook page.
