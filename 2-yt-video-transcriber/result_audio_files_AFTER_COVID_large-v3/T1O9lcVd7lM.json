            "text": "This is Dabu7.  We have a very rare alert being sent out out of the Caribbean as the officials there are saying that a volcano is springing to life.  This is an alert going out in the Martinique and St.  Vincent areas, this chain of islands in the Caribbean.  They're saying a chain of islands here that has more than 100,000 people.  They are all being asked to evacuate.  So this most recent warning issued late Tuesday for this area, it's giving off strong gas emissions and they're saying that the formation of a new volcanic dome is happening.  So something's going on here, visible gas and steam rising up from these areas and the government warning people that live near here to prepare to evacuate.  They're saying that an eruption could occur with less than 24 hours notice.  Now, with today's technology and all that, you would hope that they'd have a little bit more of a heads up, but they're saying that it could pop off at any time.  The last eruption in this area was 1979.  Previous eruption before that was 1902 and it killed some 1,600 people.  So this thing could spring to life out of nowhere with an eruption that no one's seen in their lifetime coming from this region.  So just a heads up, a rare warning as this region is coming to life.  I'll break it down further on the next live stream.  Make sure to follow me on DLive, also on Parler.  I'm kicking all my videos out over here on Parler, so make sure you're following there.
