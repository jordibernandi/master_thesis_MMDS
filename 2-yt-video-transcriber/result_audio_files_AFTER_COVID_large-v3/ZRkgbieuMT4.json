This is where we actually take a claim that somebody makes because they tend to think that it's true, and then challenge them by asking questions to see how can you be so sure that it is true.  Right.  Have you ever really thought about your reasons?  Have you ever thought about the method that you're using to confirm those reasons?  So maybe you think ghosts are real.  or perhaps you think that there's a higher power, or maybe you have a really strong view on vaccines, and there's no way I'm gonna give my kids those things.  That causes autism.  The idea here is to take a claim that you make because you think that it's true, and then respectfully challenge you with questions to see how you could be so sure.  Would you like to do it? ",

You knock on wood all the time.  I did a conversation earlier today with a woman who said that if she doesn't want it to rain, she can knock on wood and then... she gets a good feeling for having done it, even though she's not entirely sure that it has anything to do with controlling the weather.  And then when we were done, I actually walked over to that tree, and I was like, I wanted to get Sunny out in the next 15 minutes, and I literally knocked on that tree over there.  I'm skeptical that that actually has anything to do with it, but if you would like, we could explore that belief.  Would you like to do that one?  I'm down.  You're down?  Okay.
