            "text": "All right, everyone, it's time to talk about Joe Biden again, because if you look at the link in the description of this video and take a look at this like 20 second clip of Joe, is this not a man who's goddamn completely fucking bananas?  Is he not completely out to lunch?  I don't know what to tell you, dude.  It's one thing to occasionally make a verbal error.  Lord knows Trump does that on a fairly regular basis too.  But this particular slew of word salad stopped making all sense within three seconds.  And he just sort of keeps going with it, which was weird.  He was trying to describe how coronavirus kills so many people and it's terrible.  And whenever Biden says look, you know that he's about to segue from logic to emotion.  If you've ever noticed that, it's one of his speaking quirks.  I think it's probably the lack of his ability to even go on script in some cases.  But he repeatedly conflates years and deaths in this little diatribe here to the point of uselessness.  Nobody can get any actual worthwhile communication out of it.  And he's done this constantly.  This is why Joe Biden by and large is a no show and sometimes people don't even pay attention to the conferences he does give.  Nobody gives a fucking shit what Joe Biden has to say, his enthusiasm is in the crapper.  Trump is spiking again right now, he's a 44.4 in the aggregate.  He's almost half a point above where I think he needs to be before the first debate and rising.  That's partially due to a goddamn Emerson poll this time showing him in the positive, 49, 47, not even Rasmussen.  I think this is the first time, in fact, that a poll other than Rasmussen has showed him in the positive range for, what, fucking three months, maybe four?  The Democrats are getting nervous.  There's a reason that all of a sudden Joe Biden came out and unequivocally condemned political violence.  Of course, without using the terms Antifa or BLM, Trump the other day, by the way, capitalizing upon this to explicitly state the truth that we all know, but nobody wants to say because they're afraid of political correctness.  BLM is a Marxist organization, and they are.  They're self-proclaimed Marxists, in fact.  I'm not talking about the slogan, we're talking about the money-making grifting group that uses ActBlue and helps bundle for the DNC.  Joe Biden, even when he's got a script, or at least notes or something like that, even then the man cannot formulate a coherent statement.  This is why I think he will get crushed in the debates.  It's one thing to have grand sweeping ideas, which by and large Biden doesn't have.  And he took some grand sweeping ideas from other people, normally the far left cringe fringe like AOC, which isn't working well either, but they're there.  You can have the grand sweeping idea.  You can have a really emotional bent.  You can tug on people's heartstrings, but if you can't get the point across, if you repeatedly stumble in your words, If you become incoherent and say things that people don't understand, like George Floyd's dad talking about Brussels sprouts, it destroys your opportunity to communicate effectively enough to make the hit land in a debate, to defend yourself against a hit.  Trump had this problem against Hillary Clinton in 2016 a bit, because actually she was clearly, at least in the strategic sense, the better debater.  But Trump won anyway, and there he certainly didn't have nearly as much of an enthusiasm gap to work with.  It was a couple points he gained in the final polls.  There's six extra points in the enthusiasm gap this year.  You've got probably the worst public speaker you could possibly put up against Trump, a dude who can't run on his record without incensing the far left and so won't.  And so all he can do is spout vague platitudes and talk about. ",
