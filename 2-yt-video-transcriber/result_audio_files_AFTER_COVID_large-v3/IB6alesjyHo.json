Authorities say flood control is now at a critical stage.  For weeks, Beijing has been reporting on virus clusters in the capital.  But are the figures trustworthy?  An expert helps shed light on the numbers.  The European Union is adopting new rules to protect its companies against subsidized foreign competitors.  The move will cut down activities of Chinese state-owned companies operating in Europe.  And China warning the U.S.  against deploying intermediate-range missiles in the Indo-Pacific region.  This after reports of U.S.  negotiations with Japan.  Welcome to China In Focus.  I'm Tiffany Meyer.  Inside one neighborhood in Beijing, a group of workers are seen sealing a building's entrance.  Medical staff wearing protective suits appear to be overseeing the job.  Video shows occasional flashes of the residents inside the building.  Beijing, China's capital city, seems to be turning into a second Wuhan.  People are locked inside their own homes.  Authorities say it's to control the pandemic.  After the workers are finished, the entrance appears to have an airtight seal.  A man inside is seen looking out from the second floor.  One netizen took to social media to comment on the containment approach, calling it stupid and unacceptable.  He questioned whether the goal was to eliminate the residents living there, and asked what would happen if an elderly person or child inside the building needed to see a doctor.  Another user asked what would happen if the building's fire alarm went off.  According to the Chinese Communist Party's official media outlet, a virus patient had recently been in the neighborhood before his diagnosis.  Confirmed cases also have been found at a nearby market only 10 minutes' walk from the neighborhood.  Ten neighborhoods in the surrounding area have also been locked down.  In recent days, only a handful of medical teams traveled to Beijing to help fight the virus.  But now 20 medical teams from 12 different provinces are headed there to help.  According to reports, over 400,000 Beijing citizens per day can now be tested, and the number is still rising.  But at the same time, not a single report from China has verified the accuracy of the testing kits.  The virus has emerged in a special hospital inside Beijing.  It's the designated hospital for the Communist Party leaders and the military, including the seven members of the party's standing Politburo committee.  That's the lawmaking panel that rules China, with leader Xi Jinping as its head.  A resident from one Beijing neighborhood, home to military staff and their families, told us that the No.  301 military hospital was hit by the virus.  One nearby neighborhood was also impacted.  He showed us an internal notice explaining that virus patients have now been discovered in many military camps due to the outbreak at the hospital.  Messages about the hospital outbreak are circulating on social media.  Speculation is rising that some Communist Party leaders may be infected.  The focus is on one of the Politburo committee's seven members who nearly disappeared from Chinese media in June.  There is no official explanation for the absence.  The official is responsible for discipline inspection for the party's anti-corruption work.  Chinese authorities have since issued a notice calling the information about virus cases in that hospital a rumor.  For weeks, China has once again been reporting virus clusters in Beijing.  But are the official figures trustworthy?  And where did the second wave come from?  We spoke with an expert for answers. ",

The entire capital city and its population of over 20 million people have been under lockdown and what's called wartime status for days now.  Roads are blocked, most flights are suspended, schools and shops are once again closed.  To shed some light on the situation, we spoke with former U.S.  Army microbiologist and former lab director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research's viral disease branch, Sean Lin.  Lin told us Beijing's strict protective measures tell a different story than the official narrative.  He says they indicate that the situation in Beijing is much worse than the around 200 patients authorities have reported. ",

            "text": "New details emerge on the meeting between U.S.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the director of China's Central Foreign Affairs Office, Yang Jiechi.  In a radio interview, Pompeo told the Liberty Times more about the closed-door meeting in Hawaii.  He said while they have different views on many issues, the talks were constructive and both sides agreed to continue communications.  During the meeting, China expressed dissatisfaction over the U.S.  decision to sell F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan.  But Pompeo pointed out the sales were consistent with those of past administrations.  He also reiterated that the U.S.  would not back out of the Indo-Pacific.  The U.S.  State Department approved the sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan last year.  The officials also talked about trade relations.  Yang said China would uphold the promises made in the phase one trade deal.  That includes buying over 36 billion dollars worth of U.S.  food and agro products by the end of 2020.  China recently stepped up its purchases of U.S.  soya beans.  Beijing is warning Washington not to deploy intermediate-range missiles in the Indo-Pacific region.  That's after reports of U.S.  negotiations with Japan.  China's defense ministry spokesperson said China opposes the move, adding that it will take measures to counter the move.  China is also urging Japan not to accept the U.S.  offer, saying Japan and other countries should say no to the U.S.  and not fall victim to what the Chinese regime calls the U.S.  geopolitical plot.  Intermediate-range missiles have a short flight duration.  That makes them hard to detect and defend against, and they're considered highly dangerous.  New York State Senator Chris Jacobs has introduced a bill to stop state employees from downloading video-sharing app TikTok on their work phones.  TikTok is owned by Chinese developer ByteDance.  The app is popular among young people and is used to create short videos.  It reportedly surpassed 2 billion downloads in April.  But the app has recently sparked privacy concerns.  That's because China's national intelligence law allows Beijing access to data collected by the company.  It also censors content that's critical of the Chinese regime.  The app has already been banned in a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of State and Homeland Security.  Senator Jacobs pointed to TikTok's history of untrustworthiness when he announced the bill.  That's including its practice of censoring in the  U.S.,  refusing to testify in congressional hearings, and the fact that several of its corporate board members are also members of the Chinese Communist Party.  The European Union is adopting new rules to protect its companies against subsidized foreign competitors.  The move will curtail the activities of Chinese state-owned companies operating in Europe.  Last week, the European Commission published a report detailing how foreign subsidies distort fair trade by taking interest-free loans, capital injections and preferential tax treatment.  That leaves companies without access to those subsidies at a major disadvantage.  In the past decade, through heavy government subsidies, China has managed to create its own national champions in key industries like steel, aluminum, solar panels, and more recently, in high technology sectors.  The new legal measures by the European Commission, which will be finalized and released next year, will block Chinese bargain buyers from acquiring distressed European companies during the pandemic.  It will also, as put by the commission's vice president, tackle unchecked foreign subsidies that distort fair competition.  Hong Kong's Legislative Council election is set to take place this September, but it's facing interference from the Chinese Communist Party.  Candidates planning to run for the election will be required to take an oath of office, which includes showing support for the controversial national security law proposed by mainland China.  Failure to comply could result in the candidate's disqualification.  The new so-called security law will effectively allow Beijing to overrule Hong Kong's legal system.  People found in violation of the law could be extradited to mainland China and tread in courts under direct Communist Party control.

            "text": "U.S.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the government sees no loopholes in a new rule to curb global chip sales to China's Huawei.  Last month, the U.S.  released a new export rule to block Huawei from getting chips made with U.S.  technology.  It allows the U.S.  to require licenses for shipments of some foreign-made chips to Huawei.  But some industry lawyers say the new rule is too complex, unclear and filled with gaps.  Some allege it leaves key transactions outside the scope of control.  In its statement to Reuters, Ross said, The Department of Commerce does not see any loopholes in this rule.  We affirm that we will implement the rule aggressively and pursue any attempt to evade its intent.  The statement comes after Reuters reported that the Commerce Department sent a letter to some chip makers to shed more light on the rule.  But industry lawyers said the letter didn't really clear things up.  The U.S.  blacklisted Huawei last year over national security concerns, alleging the Chinese regime could use Huawei equipment for espionage.  Huawei denies the allegations.  Huawei has close ties to the Chinese military.  Its founder was a department director in China's People's Liberation Army.  And all Chinese companies, including Huawei, have to hand over intelligence information to Beijing if the regime asks for it.  As a result, American companies needed to get special licenses to do business with Huawei.  The Department of Commerce last week amended the restrictions on Huawei in one regard, to allow U.S.  companies to participate in standard-setting for next-generation technologies. ",
