            "text": "We're not just any news network.  We show the crowd.  We show the energy.  We show the enthusiasm.  We interview people.  We show the smiles on everyone's faces as they fill into one of these venues to support their president, to support their values, their beliefs.  their flag, their country.  We show all of that to you.  We bring it right up to you and make it personal as if you're with us here experiencing it for yourself.  This is one of the things that we pride ourselves in doing is showing you on the ground experience of how people are seeing it and experiencing it for themselves.  just the energy is so electric and exciting.  people recognize us everywhere we go.  we have to stop and take photos.  there are thousands of people that come up to us after each event and ask us to keep fighting for them.  keep showing the truth.  they thank us.  they thank us for giving them a voice because nobody else will give them a voice.  instead they take who they really are and turn them into something that they're not.  They try to say that these are white supremacist gatherings and they're neo-Nazis.  They spin all these false narratives, but in reality, there are Filipinos, there are Thai people, there are Chinese, there are Brazilian, there are Cubans, there are Africans, there are Jamaicans, there are Americans.  There are people from all over the world, to be honest with you.  Everybody supports this president.  Everybody supports American ideals of liberty, truth, freedom.  We can't thank you enough for supporting us at Right Side Broadcasting Network.  We are almost entirely viewer-supported.  This isn't just our network, it's your network.  This is a network for the people.  This is a network that's about truth, delivering the truth, showing what's actually happening in the world from the perspective of the average person.  We don't take money from big corporations.  We don't take money from billionaires and big donors.  We are all about the people.  We're an independent media corporation.
