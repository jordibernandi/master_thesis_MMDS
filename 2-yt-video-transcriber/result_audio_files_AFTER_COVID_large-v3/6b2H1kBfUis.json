            "text": "so Blacksit family as you know we've been going around looking at different pieces of land all day and so I'm still in Jambore and I've come to show you a house that's being built here in Jambore so you can get an idea of what you can put on your land.  but also I've come to look at a donkey that I'm gonna buy.  I'm buying a donkey.  I'm buying a donkey to ask me Julia what?  Why?  Why?  Why do you want a donkey?  You can see the highway right there.  I just want to show you the highway.  So you can see how close this compound is to the highway.  The highway is right there where the cars are going straight across.  So this is a brilliant location that he's actually building his house on.  But I just want to show you.  Here's your donkey, my donkey.  So I'm buying a donkey.  Why am I buying a donkey?  Because I think... If anything happens, and they decide they wanna cut fuel, and they wanna cut, I don't know, petrol, they wanna cut energy, they wanna cut anything, guess what?  I can get from A to B without a car.  So I'm gonna get a donkey and build a cart and train it, and I'm gonna use it just for now to go to town and to go round about the place and have some fun.  So I'm going strictly off the grid, i'm getting a donkey.  so i saved the best till last.  come and have a look at the donkeys.  yeah donkey donkey he's running away from me.  he's not used to me yet very healthy looking donkey.  um They're going doing their thing because they're not used to me yet, but they will get used to me.  I'm going to go and make sure I feed them and it will be looked after on his compound.  Let's go and have a look at his unmade house as well.  So now you've seen my donkey.  Let me know what you think in the comments below about Juliet riding a car with a donkey, going off the grid with a donkey.  I'm trying a thing.  My donkey will be tough.  Well taken care of.  Very, very well taken care of.  Let's go and see the house.  I like it.  I'm going to tell Adrian.  Yeah, but you have to tell me how much I have to look after it and what I have to do and how I have to train it.  How do you train them and look after them?  So I'm gonna pass it by Adrian because I haven't quite told him yet that I'm gonna buy this donkey but I'm gonna get the donkey.  so Adrian I love you very very much.  you're the best husband in the world and I know that you're gonna let me get this donkey and my donkey cart.  so yeah i've gone back onto full leg drive four leg drive to get it all right.  come on then let's see this house.  so 33 by 50. the length of the house The land, yeah.  75 by 80.  Okay, so this land is 75 by 80, but the house itself is 33 by... By 40.  Yeah.  33 by 40.  So let's have a look.  This is a free apartment.  This one is a family.  Oh, so you've made apartments.  Separate apartments.  Wow.  So these are apartments.  Sorry.  Let me rephrase that.  I've just made a mistake.  I said it's a house.  They're not.  They're separate apartments.  So, he's making individual apartments.  So, let's go and have a look at the individual apartments.  Can you guide me through the layout, please, Paul?  So, what would this be?  There's the parlor.  So, this is the parlor, the living room? ",

            "text": "And then this is Paul's little house that he lives in while he's developing this house.  So as you can see, you can build a little small room, have an outside kitchen, go off the grid, have an outside well or a borehole and, you know, live in nature.  Go outside, get the old bucket, yeah have a shower go go right back to nature have your outside fire cook your food.  so you know you can go back to nature.  but in the meantime while he's back to nature he's building one beautiful set of apartments house and so i just want to show you that anything's possible Anything's possible here in the Gambia.  I haven't shown you the other side of the apartments because Paul's got to go somewhere.  So as you can see, each set has, was it three or four bedrooms?  I can't remember.  It has a few bedrooms.  So each side has got its own set of bedrooms.  So probably it's about six bedrooms, three bedrooms there and three bedrooms on the other side.  So that's about six bedrooms and it's all on one level.  So, wow, it's amazing.  And as you can see, there's another set on down there as well.  So there's actually another set of them.  So it must be about nine bedrooms.  then, because you've got another set of bedrooms down here.  Yeah, look, it's nine.  okay so it's like a nine bedroom house.  yeah look parlor bedroom bedroom another back door another bedroom another parlor another another bedroom another bedroom wow all with ensuite.  this house is nice very nice.  so it shows that you've got it going on and this is the little house modest little house that he lives in.  so it shows that you can even live in a little house like this.  if you just come on your own and you're single.  you can have a little kitchenette little shower room.  bam there you are and this is cheap to build.  i'm going to ask him how much it costs to build this little basic house because now there's nothing stopping you from coming home.  you can have a little basic house like this.  you can have a little basic house like this and still come.  look I'm not going inside because I don't want to breach his privacy.  And I think he's gone and left me because he's got a meeting to go to.  But what I'm showing you is that if you are low on budget, just have a basic traditional house like this.  You can do it and you can spend a little bit of money, but it means you're off the grid and you're out.  You're out of Babylon.  You're out of the Matrix.  You know, you're out of racism, out of discrimination, and you're out of their control.  So, that's it, I've said it.  I've said it, you know?  I've said it.  can do what you like this is africa.  yeah come let's support the country support the investment here support the people and support the country and support nature.  let's do this let's just do this.  you know i don't know how else to encourage you i don't know what else to say i don't know what else to do rather than showing you and showing you and showing you and showing you.  and I'm sorry if you're bored, but the reason why is because in my heart of hearts, all I want everybody to do is just to come back.  I just want you to come back.  I want you to live a peaceful and happy life.  I just want you to be free.  I want you to feel the freedom that I feel.  I might be on lockdown, but I'm not in the same lockdown as you.  I might be on quarantine, but I'm not in the same quarantine as you.  I'm not going through what you're going through.  And I don't need a shopping mall.  All I need is, you know, nature.  Because nature provides for us here.  It provides our mangoes.  It provides our guavas.  It provides our cabba.  It provides our ditta.  It provides our moringa.  It provides our... you know tambourine.  it provides our cashew apples our cashew nuts.  it provides our oranges our grapefruits.  it provides our avocados our potatoes.  it provides our rice.  it provides our for our cattle and even a donkey going back to my donkey.  so i'm going to get this donkey.  i'm going to ask adrian.  so i want you all to do me a favor.  i want you in the comments below to say adrian please let juliet have the donkey.  yeah please please let adrian adrian let juliet have the donkey.  what you say seth say it you want a donkey.  tell adrian that i must have the donkey.  yeah he wants a donkey.  Adrian's telling me that Adrian said he wants a donkey, but I don't believe him.  So, Adrian's, Seth is kidding too, so he must know something that I don't know.  So, maybe he spoke before and I didn't know.  Maybe Seth knows something that I don't know.  Seth knows something that I don't know, but I want a donkey.  Sorry, I'm so childish.  I can't help it sometimes when I get excited about things.  So little donkey is going to be mine.  I want you to give me a name for the donkey as well.  And so I'm going to negotiate on a price because he said it's about 10 Gs.  So I'm going to negotiate on a price and see, you know, Julie always wants a bargain and everything.  So I'm going to try.  So I just wanted to show you this house in Jamboree that's partly made.  Hey Anna, you all right?  And I wanted to show you his little house to show you that you can live big and live small.  If that makes sense.  Live big and live small?  Yes, you can.  Okay, so Blacksit family, I want to say one love, one peace, one Africa, one unity, one nation, one people, one destiny, one love.
