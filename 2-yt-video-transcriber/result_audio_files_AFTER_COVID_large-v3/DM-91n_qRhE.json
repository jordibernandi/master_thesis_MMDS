We've got here in the gallery the largest collection of objects and stories in a museum in the world that relate to trans lives.  It's real trans people's stories, by them, about them.  One of my favourites is the one that was actually done by Fox that says gender roles are dead and it's incredibly popular.  We are part of this movement of protest that we're still struggling for equal rights, that we still want to share our experiences and that we're brave enough to do it quite boldly and like put it on our t-shirts.  Have you ever seen anything like this in a museum before?  No, never.  And I think that's the point, isn't it?  Unless we have collections like this, then the only way people are going to find out about trans lives are through the media, right?  And we need our voices to be heard.
