Look back at what they did, what they lived through, the seeds that they planted so that you can afford to be in the circumstance that you are in today.  If you are a black American and you are breathing in the United States today, you are the luckiest, among the luckiest of black people that have ever lived anywhere on the face of the planet.  That is an incredible statement.  All of human history, the luckiest black people that have ever lived on the face of the human planet are the ones that are living and breathing in America today, okay?  If you understand that, and you should understand it by simply saying, where would you like to live in Africa?  For all of that hoopla about, they took us from Africa, find me a black American that will tell you they want to move back to Africa.  I will, listen, right now. ",

            "text": "I mean, the YouTubers, like, digesting my entire life, saying, like, she must be a plant, like, I mean, a Soros plant.  I'm like, I've never even voted.  I literally, prior to getting into things, I genuinely just was not politically inclined.  Yeah.  And I just thought I had to be a Democrat and thought I had to be a liberal.  And, you know, looking in the retrospect, I realized how foolish that is, you know, that I didn't realize that everything was really, that everything that bad happened in my life was really routed to bad policies and bad politicians.  But I wanted to first lay out just my personal story.  You know, the subtitle of the book is How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape from the Democrat Plantations.  And I do believe, I say this all the time, people get upset, that black Americans are still enslaved today, that the left just got smarter and they realized that you can't enslave people, their bodies, you can't have black Americans on the plantation anymore, but you can still have black Americans doing all the work for you and reaping no benefit.  And that is a structure that we see today between black America and the Democrat Party.  We are doing all of the work, we carry them over the finish line, and we benefit not in one single way.  And so I really kind of lay out that argument and talk about what slave life was really like, the breakdown of family, why it was necessary for families to be broken down, to trade, constantly be trading slaves from one plantation to the next.  They could have no feelings for one another.  Frederick Douglass, in his autobiography, the first couple of pages that he starts talking about his life as a slave, he talks about the fact that when his mother died, he felt nothing.  When his sisters were treated, he felt nothing.  He had no sense of kinship, no familial love for his own blood.  That was necessary to the institution of slavery.  We still have that kinship and that relationship and that community still broken down all of these years later, despite the Reconstruction era post-slavery, which we saw black American families getting back together.  We were doing something.  It's all been wiped away. ",
