            "text": "The Apocalypse of Enoch, or should I say the Ethiopic Book of Enoch.  It is the oldest of the three pseudepigrapha of Enoch, where in an introduction he starts off with a narrative describing the final judgment of all and the fate of the world.  The narrative continues with the fallen angels and their relationships with women.  How they defiled mankind followed by Enoch's intercession between the fallen and God.  Their fate with visions of Sheol, earth and heaven.  The second part is a book of parables.  The third part is on astrology.  The fourth part are dreams or visions about the future history of Israel from Adam.  And the deluge.  And the fifth.  gets into the apocalypse of weeks.  When it comes to ancient technologies and the tech we use today, it is interesting to look into where it all began.  It should give you a better understanding of the world we live in and the world we are from.  So I invite you to join me and take a closer look at the very ancient and sacred technologies and the Book of Enoch.  And they took wives unto themselves.  And everyone respectively chose one woman for himself.  And they began to go unto them.  This is actually pretty scary.  Because the women under this circumstance don't have a choice.  And these angelic beings took the most beautiful women they could find.  Keep in mind, prior to doing this, they had to make a pact or bond with each other.  because they knew what they were doing and they knew the consequences of their actions.  Think about this.  These are angels.  Where do they think God was while they were all planning this?  Understand, all this was allowed.  And they taught them magical medicine, incantations, the cutting of roots, and taught them about plants.  One of the things I want to point out is that among these angelic beings, there is a shapeshifter, Godriel.  And this may be the angel that came to earth to tempt Eve.  He may have sexually seduced her, which would give him firsthand knowledge of how to mate with women, right?  That knowledge would then be taught to other angels so that they could change form and do the same.  And this is how the knowledge of these ancient technologies begin to spread.  Because they spread that information among themselves first, then to man.  Showing their wives how to use symbols and herbs for incantations.  How to take plants and use them for medicines, potions.  Azbeel was another one giving counsel to other angels on how to be evil.  Basically luring and convincing them to hook up with women.  the women became pregnant and gave birth to great giants whose height were 300 cubits.  these giants consumed the produce of all the people until the people detested feeding them.  the giants turned against the people in order to eat them and they began to sin against birds wild beasts reptiles and fish and their flesh was devoured the one by the other and they drank blood and then the earth brought and accusation against the oppressors.  And Azazel taught the people the art of making swords and knives and shields and breastplates, and he showed to their chosen ones bracelets, decorations, shadowing of the eye with antimony, ornamentation, the beautifying of the eyelids, all kinds of precious stones and all coloring tinctures and alchemy, And there were many wicked ones, and they committed adultery and erred, and all their conduct became corrupt.  Amasraf taught incantation and the cutting of roots, and Amaros the resolving of incantations, and Barakuel astrology, and Kokarel the knowledge of the signs, and Tamel taught the seeing of the stars, and Asdarel taught the course of the moon, As well as the deception of man.  And the people cried.  And their voice reached into heaven.  Now there is of course a lot more to what is being stated here.  For example when these angels taught man metal works.  The forging of swords, knives.  We're not talking about your everyday blade.  And this is where the alchemy comes in.  How many of you know about Damascus steel?  It was a metal produced in ancient Damascus, Syria.  This type of steel usually has a distinctive flowing pattern, strong, shatterproof, and sharp.  But see, the problem is no one today has been able to duplicate the recreation of the original Damascus steel.  And the reason for this, which they won't admit, is nanotechnology.  The book of Enoch then gets into Enoch's vision or what he may have thought was a vision.  What Enoch is describing may have been a description of him being taken aboard a ship.  Listen to what he says.  And behold, I saw the clouds and they were calling me in the vision and the fogs were calling me and the course of the stars and the lightnings were rushing me and causing me to desire.  And in the vision, the winds were causing me to fly.  and rushing me high up into heaven.  And I kept coming into heaven until I approached a wall which was built of white marble and surrounded by tongues of fire.  And it began to frighten me.  And I came into the tongues of fire and drew near to a great house which was built of white marble.  And the inner walls were like mosaics of white marble.  The floor of crystal.  the ceiling like the path of the stars, and lightnings between which stood fiery cherubim and their heaven of water.  And flaming fire surrounded the wall, and its gates were burning with fire.  And I entered into the house, which was hot like fire and cold like ice, and there was nothing inside it.  So fear covered me, and trembling seized me.  And as I shook and trembled, I fell upon my face and saw a vision.  And behold, there was an opening before me, and a second house which is greater than the former, and everything was built with tongues of fire.  And in every respect it excelled the other, in glory and great honor, to the extent that it is impossible for me to recount to you concerning its glory and greatness.  As for its floor, it was a fire, and above it was lightning and the path of the stars.  And as for the ceilings, It was flaming fire.  And I observed and saw inside it a lofty throne.  Its appearance was like crystal and its wheels like the shining sun.  And I heard the voice of the cherubim and from beneath the throne were issuing streams of flaming fire.  See, the thing is, folks, confirming that this was a spacecraft would be easy.  But they took that out of the Bible.  There is, however, another section in the Book of Enoch that does tell of Enoch traveling in a flying vehicle to what are known as the Metal Mountains.  After those days, in the same place where I had seen all the secret visions, having been carried off in a wind vehicle and taken to the west, my eyes saw there the secret things of heaven and the future things.  There were there a mountain of iron, a mountain of copper, a mountain of silver, a mountain of gold, a mountain of colored metal, and a mountain of lead.  And I asked the angel who was going with me, saying, What are these things which I have seen in secret?  And he said to me, All these things which you have seen happen by the authority of his Messiah, so that he may give orders and be praised upon the earth.  Then this angel of peace answered, saying to me, Wait a little.  And all the secret things which encircle the Lord of the spirits will be revealed unto you.  As for these mountains which you have seen with your own eyes, the mountains of iron, the mountain of copper, the mountain of silver, the mountain of gold, the mountain of colored metal, the mountain of lead, all of them, in the presence of the elect one, will become like a honeycomb before fire, like water that gushes down from the top of such mountains and becomes helpless by his feet.  It shall happen in those days that no one shall be saved either by gold or silver, and no one shall be able to escape.  There shall be no iron for war, nor shall anyone wear a breastplate, neither bronze nor tin, shall be to any avail or be of any value, and there will be no need of lead whatsoever.  All these substances will be removed and destroyed from the surface of the earth When the elect one shall appear before the face of the Lord of the spirits.  Hearing the end of that seems a bit shocking.  Difficult to understand the removal of those metals.  But it does reveal how Enoch was able to travel the world.  North and south poles included.  Where he is talking about passing through portals.  Now we have a pretty good idea of what angel did what and later on in the text.  There are more details on what angel was responsible for these teachings.  The name of the first is Jaquan.  He is the one who misled all the children of the angels, brought them down upon the earth, and perverted them by the daughters of the people.  The second was named Asbiel.  He is the one who gave the children of the holy angels an evil counsel, and misled them so that they would defile their bodies by the daughters of the people.  The third was named Gadriel.  This one is he who showed the children of the people all the blows of death, who misled Eve, who showed the children of the people how to make the instruments of death such as the shield, the breastplate, and the sword for warfare, and all the other instruments of death to the children of the people.  Through their agency, death proceeds against the people who dwell upon the earth.  From that day, forevermore, The fourth name, PNME.  This one demonstrated to the children of the people the bitter and the sweet and revealed to them all the secrets of their wisdom.  Furthermore, he caused the people to penetrate the secret of writing and the use of ink and paper.  On account of this matter, there are many who have erred from eternity to eternity until this very day.  For human beings are not created for such purposes to take up their beliefs with pen and ink.  Now that is quite profound and interesting, don't you think?  Without pen and ink, there would be no records of anyone's mistakes.  There would be no Dead Sea Scrolls or the Bible or the Book of Enoch.  For indeed, human beings were not created but to be like angels, permanently to maintain pure and righteous lives.  Death which destroys everything, would have not touched them had it not been through their knowledge by which they shall perish.  Death is eating us by means of this power.  The fifth is named Kasadia.  It is he who revealed to the children of the people the various flagellations of all evil, the flagellation of the souls and the demons, the smashing of the embryo and the womb, so that it may be crashed.  The flagellation of the soul, snake bites, sun strokes.  The book of Enoch does reveal a great deal about how our technology developed right from the beginning.  But it is in other related texts that we can find more about the lightning or electric technology that was used back then.  You know, I hear people ask all the time, Why would God allow such a thing to happen in the first place?  And I think this one section in the book of Enoch explains this.  In God's own words.  But he raised me up and said to me with his voice, Enoch, do not fear.  Enoch, righteous man, scribe of righteousness, come near to me and hear my voice.  And tell the watchers of heaven on whose behalf you have been sent to intercede.  It is meant for you that you intercede on behalf of man.  And not man on your behalf.  And this is what he wants Enoch to tell the fallen.  For what reason have you abandoned the high holy and internal heaven.  And slept with women and defiled yourselves with the daughters of the people.  Taking wives acting like the children of the earth.  And be getting giant sons.  Surely you you used to be holy.  spiritual and living ones possessing eternal life.  but now you have defiled yourselves with women and with the blood of the flesh.  begotten children you have lusted with the blood of the people like them producing blood and flesh which die and perish.  on that account i have given you wives in order that seeds might be sown upon them and children born by them so that the deeds that are done upon the earth will not be withheld from you.  Indeed, you formerly were spiritual, having eternal life, and immortal in all the generations of the world.  That is why formerly I did not make wise for you, for the dwelling of the spiritual beings of heaven is heaven.  But now the giants who are born from the union of the spirits and the flesh shall be called evil spirits upon the earth.  because their dwelling shall be upon the earth and inside the earth.  Evil spirits have come out of their bodies, because from the day that they were created from the Holy Ones, they became the Watchers.  Their first origin is the spiritual foundation.  They will become evil upon the earth and shall be called evil spirits.  The dwelling of spiritual beings of heaven is heaven, but the dwelling of the spirits of the earth which are born upon the earth is in the earth.  the spirits of the giants oppress each other.  they will corrupt fall be excited and fall upon the earth and cause sorrow.  they eat no food nor become thirsty nor find obstacles and these spirits shall rise up against the children of the people and against the women because they have proceeded forth from them.  so apparently According to this, the book of Enoch, demons are actually part human.
