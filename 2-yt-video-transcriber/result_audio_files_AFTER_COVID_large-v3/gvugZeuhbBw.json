            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  Submerged prehistoric settlement in the Black Sea.  Oops, it was 1,000 years older than the experts thought.  That pushes sea level rise back, oh, 1,000 years off of this chart because we also find submerged prehistoric settlements around the same depth.  off the coast of Israel and looking through the Chalcolithic era.  this stopped me in my tracks and sent me right over to the Kailash Temple the largest megalithic single block temple carved out of this mountain in one piece.  problem is the erosion patterns on this type of stone.  put it at nine thousand years ago not thirteen hundred.  look at the fine craftsmanship on these implements here from the Chalcolithic 6,000 years ago is when they made this.  I think the timelines for our human civilization are off by thousands of years.  I'll present my findings, then I would like to know what you think after seeing all the information.  A new survey reports an overwhelming 85% of Americans believe that at least one tech company is spying on them through the apps on their smartphones.  Two-thirds of those asked claim they've seen an ad for a product they've talked about but never searched for online.  I've had the same exact experience talking about having my roof refurbished.

And now on with the video.  and we're gonna start off here the Black Sea exit point through the Bosphorus out into the Aegean and then the Mediterranean Sea an area of history and legend since time immemorial.  you know there's some lost history in this area.  so we're gonna start right over here in Bulgaria.  Now, underwater archaeologists in the 1970s had discovered this at the mouth of the Ropotamo River, and they put a date on it immediately of 5,000 years ago.  And then with today's more modern survey techniques and better side scanning sonar as well as excavation techniques, it has been redated to 1,000 years older, 6,000 years ago.  They call it the Chalcolithic, the Copper Age, But maybe we're being shown something shiny to distract us.  And also at the same time, five meters, for those of you in the  U.S.,  is 15 feet.  So 6,000 years ago, the water was at least 15 feet lower on this exact spot.  So you know they didn't have it at the zero mark when they made the city.  The water was even lower than that.  but they put that 15 feet lower rate at the very base of some of these foundations.  But another discovery was this area was entirely on land, the entire settlement, 4,000 BC.  And as more excavation continues, they're finding more wooden stilts, tile floors, advanced pottery making techniques.  And see, this is what made the dates mixed up.  is this area was so much more advanced by a thousand years in metallurgy and pottery.  So the experts thought that this site was a much newer era.  So wait, what's that say?  There were 1,000 years ahead in the technology of the day?  So looking at the Holocene, sea level rises, and we're in the Holocene right now, the warm time between full-blown ice ages.  And the dark black line starting at the 8,000 year at 15 meters, which would be about 45 feet lower than today.  And as we progress up the timeline, 8,000, 7,500.  We'll start to see.  the sea level has that gigantic increase from around 8,000 to say 7,000 years prior from 15 meters, which is about 45 feet lower than today, right up to about three, which is nine feet lower than today.  Problem is this find where they show that this was completely above water is the red circle.  It's off by a thousand years.  So the story goes that after the floods had come, and this does give a lot of credence to different flood myths and legends across the world that we know are so standard across every single civilization has a flood myth, that the survivors had reorganized right here, at least as one point that is known where the survivors had gone to.  Seafaring people still resettling right here.  And a modern map of Bulgaria will bring you to the same location.  ancient city of Nesbar.  And if you just go a little bit to the south and you'll see that giant indent into what looks like the coastline there, that's where this submerged city was.  That is 15 feet underwater and a thousand years older than previously thought.  In addition, of most interest, that next city to the north called Varna, V-A-R-N-A, that's where they found this hoard of gold treasures with crystal handles.  The archeological discovery is called the Chalcolithic Neocropolis at Varna.  And apparently it's the largest gold hoard ever found in a burial site during this era.  A lot of surprises in this little tiny area of Bulgaria for our world history timeline.  And this also proves that gold and silver hold value through antiquity, metals right in front of you.  Maybe those were small pieces for trading and not just jewelry.  Oh wait, it could be both, bullion jewelry.  Now look at the Black Sea on the map here.  Bosphorus comes right through and allows access to the Aegean or vice versa.  And from the Aegean connecting directly into the Mediterranean south of Greece.  And also another piece of history of underwater archeology, At-Lit-Yam.  This is off the coast of Israel.  And they put a date around 6,900 to 6,300 years before present.  It's off the Camel Coast.  And you'll see the island of Cyprus there in the top left for the larger map.  So you know where we are.  We're off the coast of Israel here, Camel Coast.  And there's an enormous amount of these submerged prehistoric settlements, not just one.  So to really put it in perspective here, the site that has the most excavation done on it is named At-Liyam.  And it's the fifth triangle if you start from Haifa going south.  40,000 square meters.  And for those of you in the US, one meter is three feet.  But that's only one of the sites and apparently every other site that you're seeing here is approximately from 20,000 square meters to 40,000 square meters in addition to that.  Those would have all connected in a trade route or just like we have today, roads going from one settlement to the next settlement.  And the reason there's so much focus on it, it's the first and earliest known agro-pastoral marine subsistence system.  I say that three times real fast.  What they mean is raising seaweed, fish farming, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say algae farming as well.  But where the river during certain seasons was flowing into what would have been a dry area at that time, they were capturing water and also irrigating crops.  So we're looking at 25 to 40 feet of water as well.  So up in the Black Sea, 15 feet at least under, and then we see all these submerged settlements here as well.  So we know that there was a vast coastal empire and civilization across the planet, and as the sea levels rose, they were forced out.  Now my question is, since we know sea levels were 400 feet lower, and we're only looking at settlements here that are 30, 40, 20, 15 feet lower, I want to know what the big stuff is further out 400 feet underwater.  Because they're finding wells as well, drilled.  It's pretty advanced when you're putting wells together for your society.  This is 6,000 years ago.  They were supposedly still running around with spears.  And this totally goes against the entire history timeline of how we evolved and developed.  Because here's the second circle there.  Off the timeline, at that depth, by what, 1,500 years?  and some implements found in the same area here.  And some museums around the world are showing it as the Copper Age in the Holy Land.  They even show there's technological advancement long before the pyramids were built.  But that seems extremely advanced for 6,000 years ago.  And I'll let your eyes decipher for you the workmanship level on this.  Especially the near symmetry of each of these beads.  and what are the protrusions coming off of some of these others?  and candlesticks and whatever you might think those were used for.  Some say pipes.  Could be anything but right in the middle.  Do I see a fidget spinner there?  Old school.  What about the top?  And it sure looks like a small pipe fitting or something there on the right as well.  This is supposedly all created 6,000 years ago.  And if it is, there is a serious missing chapter in our history.  Because you look at almost anything that they tell you about 6,000 years prior to today, that's not possible.  Out of place historical artifacts are in front of you right here.  And the more I looked, the more intricate they became.  These are museum pieces that again are on display, but check out the triangle down there on the bottom.  This is incredible workmanship and craftsmanship.  I encourage you to look around the world's history and see how they portray our civilization 6,000 years ago.  It's not this.  This comes in the 1600s or the 1500s, not 6,000 years ago.  And if you're using a search engine and you're doing searching for different items, putting Chalcolithic deities, Chalcolithic statues, Chalcolithic archaeological artifacts, Chalcolithic art, Chalcolithic pottery, that's what I do when I'm looking for different images just to see what the range of ideas are out there.  This stopped me in my tracks right here.  Okay, this is workmanship that could have been done 6,000 years ago.  But what is this deity that this thing is here?  And I said, where is that?  Came out of Nahal Mishmar, India.  In a cave, no less.  In this area of the Kailash Temple.  Elora Caves to be exact.  And I traveled to India a couple times, but I never went to this particular temple.  I sure wish I would have because it's the world's largest single monolithic structure.  And what does that mean to you and me?  Well, it means that this was a mountain and they carved this entire temple out as one piece.  They didn't build the temple out there in the flat plains where they could have quarried the rock and then brought it over.  Nope.  They started there and dug straight down and created that temple out of the rock itself.  We've seen this in Ethiopia as well.  But here's where the bizarre gets a little stranger.  Look at the wornness of the rock face itself, the decomposition, the erosion of such a vast structure.  And if we're down in the interior of it as well, some of these smaller buildings really show how much erosion has taken place.  Problem, as always, classical history meets reality.  The water erosion on this type of stone in India and this location puts this site being constructed around 9,000 years ago.  Some say as much as 10,000, but it fits right in with a lot of more megalithic structures being built.  And to give you a size of scale of this thing, remember it's just one solid piece carved out of the mountain, the individuals there.  There was some restoration done on this temple and you can see exactly where it is.  Right in front of the person wearing the white, that apparently what looks like an obelisk or a cousin of an obelisk, was refaced and resurfaced, comparatively to what you saw in the eroded, more top portion with the largest of the temples.  Because every time I bring up Tartaria and wireless power, I'm always hit with the same comment.  Oh, they weren't advanced enough.  They didn't have the technology enough to do something like that at that time.  Well, perhaps our timelines are way off, and they really did have that technology at that time, and it was a global civilization, and the megalithic builders have left us reminders.  Thanks for watching.  Hope you got something out of the video.  And those of you supporting me on Patreon, I left the image set for the mud flood and out of time images for the civil war with the star forts up in the drop box link.  So you can have all 49 of the images that were used in that video.  I'll be loading these here as well for you so you can get a deeper insight into our civilizations.  skewed historical timelines.  I do thank you for watching.  Hope you got something out of the video and I'll see you next time. ",
