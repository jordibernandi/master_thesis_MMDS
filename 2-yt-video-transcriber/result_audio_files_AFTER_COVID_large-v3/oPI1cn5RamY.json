            "text": "Journalism.  today, I believe just about everybody reporting the news has some kind of agenda.  Their starting off point is not ground zero.  It's from where they are on the left or the right.  And it's very confusing or very difficult for news consumers to find anything to trust.  So it's crucial that we really examine what journalism is and should be and teach people proper journalism because it's the conduit.  It's what we all need.  It's what ties us together and how we communicate and understand what's going on in our city, our town, our world.  I have, throughout much of my career on talk radio, interviewed professors, people from Hillsdale.  And I said during the interview, why don't we have more Hillsdale colleges in this country?  And I got a letter a couple of weeks later, and they said, we really agree with you, so we're going to start a scholarship in your name.  for Hillsdale College.  I just, I was beside myself.  I couldn't believe it.  The scholarship will be used for a bright, ambitious student from Michigan who is interested in journalism and radio.  The journalism program at Hillsdale College has produced great success stories.  We have former students of Hillsdale now working at the Wall Street Journal, the Detroit News, and many other publications.  The radio journalism program at Hillsdale, Radio Free Hillsdale, has won numerous awards and they've just been named the best college radio station in Michigan.  Hillsdale College has a great journalism program because the students there, like all Hillsdale students, they learn about foundational things they should know, like our Constitution.  Why do we have freedom in this country?  What's it all about?  And it gives them context to report on everything.  So you match a classical education with journalism, and you're going to produce responsible, trustworthy, knowledgeable journalists in the future.  This is a matching scholarship, and that means anybody who supports Hillsdale for the education that they provide, you can donate any amount and it will be doubled.  So you can donate $10.  and you'll make an impact, and that will be doubled.  $20, any amount, $1,000, $10,000, you name it.  Please give to the Ron Jolly Challenge at Hillsdale College before our deadline, and remember, whatever you give will be doubled. ",
