            "text": "Now you're probably thinking, how does a guy go from talking to 50 girls a weekend to have four years of celibacy?  What?  And I'll tell you why.  The reason I was doing that so obsessively was that for me, my biggest wound and fear was getting rejected by the feminine because my mother rejected me.  My mother abandoned me in the deepest possible way.  And it goes really deep because not only was it torture living with her, but then my mother committed suicide as well when I was about 18.  So yeah, that's deep, I know.  So it was a big abandonment.  I was rejected by the feminine in the most brutal way.  That's my trauma.  And it's heavy, man.  It's really heavy.  So can you imagine my fear and terror when I'm insecure and don't know who I am and don't love myself?  All this going up to a woman and being, hey, you're so you're so cute.  You know, do you want to be my girlfriend?  You want to go on a date with me?  If she said no, it would be at wound of being fucking rejected by my mom again.  That's why I was such a coward.  That's why I was such a pussy.  And I didn't get it.  I was like, I'm a nice guy.  Why don't women like me?  Why am I so needy?  Why are they all running away from me?  Because they saw that wound and they're like, oh, this poor kid.  And they're just like, no, nobody wants to fuck that.  And so I was overcoming my greatest fear, my greatest trauma.  What started happening when I started doing these approaches and getting rejected and actually forcing myself and be like, fuck it, I don't care.  And then furthermore, getting into the social freedom where I'm doing stuff on purpose, where women and men and everyone around me are judging me and looking at me weird because I'm, you know, having a conversation and fucking eating my burgers or whatever.  Well, that was actually a good... It was so empowering to overcome that fear.  because overcoming that fear of rejection in a way was overcoming my biggest obstacle.  It was overcoming my fear of my mother, being dominated by my mother, being abandoned by my mother.  When I accept it, it doesn't matter if somebody thinks I'm weird or rejects me or tells me to fuck off or whatever.  It doesn't matter that I was okay anyway.  And I started coming into my power going, you know what?  I'm okay.  Maybe I... Maybe I feel a little bit good about myself.  Maybe I'm okay with, maybe I feel better about myself being able to take that projection.  Maybe it makes me stronger.  Maybe the more people tell me to fuck off, the stronger I accept who I am and build my reality as a man who's not afraid to take chances, not afraid to live his life and do what he's here to do, including talking to beautiful women.  So this became my, almost my spiritual practice.  And, you know, my healing practice, going out there and talking to all these beautiful women.  And if it went well or not, it didn't matter.  I was doing it.  I was facing my fear.  And believe me, as a youth, I was a coward.  I was terrified.  In some ways, actually, inherently very, very brave.  But when it comes to rejection and opening my heart and talking to women, fucking terrified, man.  I was terrified.  And so it was so empowering and literally it saved my life.  Me developing social freedom, being able to express myself and my intention, regardless of the outcome.  It was addictive.  It was unbelievable.  And the sex started happening and it was really, really fun.  And I met some amazing women and I went down that rabbit hole.  And even though I was in that rabbit hole, it did become about the sex and I was fearless and I was having a great time.  It was still wounding and I still had issues.  Ultimately, it really just became about ego.  It was a lot of ego bullshit.  Oh, hey, and the ego took over.  Oh, look at this.  I'm dating three, four women that I'm sleeping with.  Wow.  For a kid who was kind of a loser and nobody wanted to play with and nobody wanted to talk to, I'm sleeping with a bunch of hot chicks.  Hey, look at that.  And you add to that the, hey, yeah, my pickup videos are blowing up on YouTube.  I got all these subscribers, people.  I got fans.  I'm making lots of money teaching pickup courses.  Hey, the ego took over like a motherfucker.  You know, I was still a good guy.  I still had good intention in my heart.  But that ego, it fucks with you.  You know, if you're a human being, we all got one.  Some level or another.  So I got sucked into that bullshit.  And I woke up out of that bullshit.  And so I just want to say to anybody who's stuck in anything, anything, whether you're out there doing what I did with the ladies or chasing that money.  Oh yeah, I'm going to make this much money.  I'm going to buy this car.  I'm going to get this house and I'll be happy.  I'm going to get this promotion.  Motherfucker, you'll never be happy getting any shit in this outside world.  Nothing will ever make you happy.  Remembering who you are and why you came to this reality and living your passion will make you happy.  Your nature is happiness, bliss, divine. ",
