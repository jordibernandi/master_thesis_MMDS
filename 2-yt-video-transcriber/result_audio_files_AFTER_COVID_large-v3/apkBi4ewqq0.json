            "text": "Hello, it's me, the Incredible Thinking Soup.  I've had many shitty jobs throughout the years, and sometimes I like to make videos about them, and this is one of those videos.  If you've been following this small series, you'll remember that I worked for a Canadian coffee chain called Tim Hortons.  I also worked at a pizza hut in a gas station.  that later was no longer a pizza hut in a gas station.  My third job was a little different.  It was far less shitty.  Not, like, not shitty, just less shitty, and that was all I needed at the time.  So much so, in fact, that I stayed there for four years.  I worked the return counter at a store called Winners, which is virtually identical to TJ Maxx in the States or Primark in the UK.  I think they're all owned by the same company.  I don't know why they change name in these different countries.  They're not exactly branding experts.  The slogan for Winners was, you should go.  Designers can't live without them, but you can get them for a lot less.  The Winners Designer Event.  You should go.  Really, really stayed up all night burning the candle at both ends on that one, huh fellas?  You know, according to market research, people spend more money if they go to the store.  We should just tell them, go to the store.  So the way this kind of shop works is that they buy surplus merchandise that other stores would have thrown away and sell it at a discount.  You'd end up being able to buy real brand name clothes at a much lower price than you'd pay at that brand name's actual store.  If you're thinking, wow, sounds like a good deal, it's worth pointing out that this shows that clothes are priced kind of arbitrarily according to the most.  these brands will expect you to pay.  Think about that for a second.  You end up paying more than the things you're buying are actually worth.  Like, you buy an American Eagle shirt, it's $80.  Would it cost you $30 at Winners?  And it costs probably, I don't know, 20 cents to make, because they built it with child labor.  That's just supply and demand, baby.  You pay a huge tax on everything that you buy, and that just goes into the pockets of some shareholder for doing literally nothing.  They could still make a profit off of selling it for less.  They just jack up the price because they know they can.  And that's just how it's always going to work.  Forever.  Shopping at Winner's is a weird experience.  It's this big open floor with tons and tons of shit, like thousands of items, as far as the eye can see, divided loosely into departments.  There's no fixed inventory, there's no catalog, you just end up with whatever you get shipped that day.  And it's always changing, so people come in literally every day to see the new stuff.  And there's always new stuff, so you never quite get a sense of what anything costs.  and you can't just scan the barcode because the barcode was designed for some other store.  the long and short of this is that you end up with merchandise being strewn about in all directions everywhere.  you can imagine.  people just grab stuff off the rack try it on and if they don't want it they just Throw it over the rack rather than walk to the changing room.  That would cost them valuable shopping minutes, where they could potentially find a huge surprise deal before anyone else.  It's hard to convey the urgency with which people shopped at this store.  It got even worse at some points, like when final clearance season came around.  Winner's merchandise would be marked down every so often, but eventually, once something had been marked down to two or three times, it'd reach its final price.  You know, so that they could clear it out.  That was final clearance.  What you might just call clearance.  Anywhere else.  Anyway, there were periods right before inventory counts where huge sections of the store reached their final price.  This was a nightmare for every employee.  Most of the merchandise, clothes, food, toys, all of it would end up on the floor, most of it would get trampled, and who knows where anything was supposed to go.  When the shop closed each night, which meant after each customer who'd entered even one minute before closing time had finished shopping, so who knows when that'd be, you'd have to put it all back before you could go home.  And who the hell knows how long that's gonna take.  Hope you didn't need a ride, because they might be waiting outside for a while.  Hope you didn't have plans.  Hope you weren't opening the store the next day, because you could randomly end up with an extra hour or so added to your shift sometimes.  But if you clock in even a minute late, You're gonna hear about it.  So my job was to work the return counter, and folks, that was an experience.  Everything at the store was so cheap that most people would just buy tons and tons of stuff, way more than they intended to keep, and just return whatever they didn't want later.  You only had a month to return it for money, but there was no limit on how long you had to return something for store credit.  You just needed the receipt and price tags, which means if someone didn't have either of those things, I wasn't supposed to return the item.  But inevitably, whoever was returning it would just complain to the manager and get what they wanted.  That's just how the job worked, essentially.  My job was to waste everybody's time by pretending to enforce the rules of the return counter until it made someone annoyed enough to complain, in which case the rules were just thrown out by the manager.  Now, I couldn't just not follow the rules, because they routinely had secret shoppers monitoring your performance, but I also didn't have the authority to change the rules if someone got upset.  That makes me the bad guy.  in every interaction, and the manager, who you'd have to call over the intercom, would come over and make you look like a complete asshole, and they'd be mad at you for it happening, because they're like, why are you pissing off this customer?  I'm doing that because it's the rule, because it's what you made me do.  I'll get in trouble if I don't.  Three things were not returnable.  clothes that had been laundered, shoes that had been worn, or underwear of any kind.  In the first two cases, it became your job to inspect each item for wear and tear.  If you accepted merchandise that was not resellable, among the thousands of returns you did that day, you would be reprimanded.  If you accepted a return for the wrong price because your manager overrode the rules and made you return something you weren't supposed to and you couldn't match it to any of the thousands of items of merchandise in the store, you'd be reprimanded.  By the way, each individual item had its own SKU, and you needed to manually enter each SKU when returning or writing off an item of merchandise.  And sometimes, someone would return something several years old, and there'd be no way to know the SKU, how much it cost, when it was bought, or how much it was supposed to cost now, or whether or not it should even be in active inventory.  And all of that was your problem.  On top of that, you were also the only dedicated cashier, meaning, among other duties, you were the only employee expected to serve customers at all times.  If the line got too long, which, according to their rules, was three people, you'd page one of the other employees to the cash registers, and boy howdy, they didn't like that.  Nobody liked that, telling people, hey, come over here and do some extra work on top of your work.  If your little rack where you put returned merchandise got too full, you'd have to call the relevant department's employee to take their items.  And they resented that too.  Why are you making me take these items?  I got shit I gotta do in my department.  Most of your job was either dealing with customers and pissing them off, or making more work for other employees, sometimes including your bosses over the intercom.  You can imagine that this became pretty alienating.  You spend all day pissing everybody off, no matter what you do.  You'd also deal with a lot of theft.  Like, a lot.  People would just yank stuff and come back the next day to return it for store credit.  Most of the people doing this seemed to have some sort of drug dependency, and if your manager saw them, they'd make a big stink and escalate the situation, putting you and everyone around you in danger.  If the managers saw somebody they suspected of shoplifting, they'd send an employee around to tail them, just to make them feel less comfortable.  Often, they'd lash out and threaten the employee tasked with this.  I remember once, a guy took out his wallet and flipped through the money inside, screaming that he had too much money to steal anything, which, like, okay, I kind of get it.  It is insulting to have someone follow you around, but on the other hand, he did then proceed to run out of the store with a bunch of merchandise, so, like, fair dues?  Now, I don't have a real big problem with shoplifting, quite frankly.  Who gives a shit?  This store would lose hundreds of pieces of merchandise just to people stomping on it.  Shoplifting was not a big deal.  I do take issue, however, with the store's management making us put our safety on the line to defend their merchandise.  Maybe it's just me, but I think my well-being is worth more than a $29.99 MSRP Calvin Klein leather belt or two.  I remember once a woman came in quite upset that her car had been broken into and all the Christmas gifts she'd bought for her kids had been stolen.  She gave us the receipt and told us to look out for the guy that did it, and that guy came in later and returned all of the gifts, and he got the money.  And that didn't feel good.  Look, man, do what you gotta do to survive, but being made an accessory to a child's Christmas presents being taken away?  That doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit, lemme tell ya.  You know what else didn't put me in the Christmas spirit?  How wild the store got during Christmas.  I remember one night, not a single pair of shoes remained intact on the shelf.  At least one out of every pair was on the floor.  Not a single pair of shoes remained.  Which meant you not only had to restock the whole thing before you could go home, but you also had to find the lost twin of each set before you could even put them away.  And the Christmas music.  Good God, the Christmas music.  From November 1st, if you were lucky, to January 5th, endless Christmas music.  If you like or encourage stores to play Christmas music, and I consider myself a compassionate person and I Try not to get angry, but rotten hell, you ghoul.  Die right now in rotten hell.  That's what you deserve?  In my opinion.  But you know what's worse than Christmas?  Boxing Day.  Americans, Boxing Day is a Canadian holiday observed on December 26th, where you're supposed to return Christmas gifts that you didn't want.  If that sounds crass and commercialist, yeah.  The amount of returns we would process on Boxing Day was staggering.  Each cash register was turned into a literal conveyor belt, and the entire staff would take shopping carts and fairy merchandise from the registers back to the relevant departments.  Since these were all gifts, ain't?  nobody had receipts or price tags, and one in ten people would chew you out for the store not printing gift receipts, even though we Definitely did, and were ordered to offer it to each and every customer for the two months leading up to Christmas.  So not only did you have to find a price match, but you also had to print and attach new price tags, which means you had to find the following information.  The item's department number out of about 50 or so, the item's SKU, the item's category number out of literally thousands all printed in a big binder, the item's original price, and the item's current price, all while you're still serving customers and sorting merchandise.  And everyone in the store is pissed off and wants to go back home to their families because it's the day after Christmas!  And handling stuff that people returned was always a crapshoot.  And I don't mean because it's a gamble.  I mean that occasionally crap shoots out at you.  Because people shit in a surprising amount of things that they then try to return to the store.  Pooping in bed sheets and then folding them back up and returning them.  Your problem now.  Or pants with skid marks.  Or underwear with skid marks.  Huh, I bet you think you caught a continuity error there.  We're not supposed to return underwear.  But the thing is, anyone who wanted to would just talk to the manager and then the manager would let them and then we had to just write it off.  So, it's just another rule that they made us enforce for no reason.  And that's on top of the normal retail poop of cleaning the bathrooms where people just leave shit on the walls and just generally around.  Also, people just shitting on the floor of the store.  Like, that's a thing that people would just do.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's just an accident.  I don't want to dwell on it.  I just think it's important that we all recognize that retail workers deal with a lot of literal shit in addition to the figurative shit that we expect them to deal with.  I worked this job for four years, and by the end of it, I was still making minimum wage.  Nobody made more than minimum wage, and if they did, it was by an insignificant 10 cent.  bullshit that didn't make a dent in your bills.  The minimum amount that if they paid me one cent less, it would be a crime.  That's the message you should take away from this.  Your bosses will take as much from you as they can, just like the arbitrary prices you pay.  You're going to be squeezed in all directions until you give them more and more and get by with less and less.  That is the inevitable trajectory of the working class under capitalism, an endless squeeze that whittles away at your quality of life and finds new ways to exploit you, to steal from you, to reward you less and less.  It finds ways to cheat you, to sell you less for more money, and then, when you have nothing left, it issues you more credit to put you in deeper and deeper debt that you have to work harder and harder to get out of.  If you work retail, you know it's impossible.  You're not paid enough to survive, let alone save for the future.  Not because the work isn't difficult.  We all know that the work is difficult.  But because the biggest assholes in the universe treat having to work a minimum wage job as the punishment that you should face for not being able to find a better one.

Hey, I'm sorry that the patron drawings are later than is even the normal amount that they're late.  I went to start drawing them and my pen is out of batteries.  So I had to order new batteries.  Normally, when that happens, I can go to the source, which is like Canadian Radio Check.  If you're not familiar, get batteries there.  Can't do that in the middle of the pandemic.  So... I had to order them online, and hopefully they come today so I can draw the thumbnail for this video.  We'll see.  Let's put a pin in that for now.  All right, have a great day, you scamps. ",
