Now, I got full-grown pastors, okay, full-grown adult men sending me text messages, sending me inbox messages, asking me when I'm going to repent and resign my church because I said Trump was going to win the election, and Trump didn't win.  Let me tell you something.  Trump won by landslide, ladies and gentlemen.  Listen, I'm almost ashamed of these pastors and preachers and prophets that say, well, I'm going to have to apologize.  No, you ain't got to apologize for nothing.  He won single-handedly, hands down, biggest historical landslide.  That's a factual deal, ladies and gentlemen.  The man won.  I ain't apologizing to nobody for what I know in my spirit to be true. ",

With everything that's gone on in the past year, and with what's happened with the Capitol, and how they're pushing that narrative, if you were from the outside looking in, it would be a pretty good argument to start confiscating guns.  They're smart enough to know that they can't fully take over this country without taking our guns.  And some people might ask, well, why the charade?  Well, I'll tell you, this entire four year charade was simply to identify all of us who they perceived as somebody who would be a dissenter.  And that paves the way to taking our guns.
