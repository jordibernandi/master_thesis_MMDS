I'm the Godless Engineer, and I critically analyze apologist claims to give you the best arguments and information so that you can stand up and use your voice.  Today, we're going to be taking a look at a cow butt video where he tries to make an argument against the fact that atheists just believe in one god less than most religious people.  Here, let's see what he's got. ",

He just found 10,000 things that didn't work in a light bulb.  Now, suppose a person were to say, tell me why those 10,000 filaments didn't work and I'll use the same reasoning to tell you why the one thing you say works won't.  I just believe in one less filament than you. ",

            "text": "That's a really stupid argument against the whole.  I believe in one God less than you.  For one thing, the I believe in one God less than you do isn't a positive argument or really an argument at all against anything other than the fact that religious people and atheists are really no different other than we just believe in one God less than you do.  Essentially, that's all that's meant to demonstrate.  It's not meant to argue against anything.  But to try to compare it to something that we can empirically show is either an answer or not.  an answer is rather ridiculous.  And I'll get more into why it is ridiculous.  But hey, if you want to see how dumb butt gets, then please stay tuned.  All right, heathens.  Well, before we get into today's video, I do want to give a really big shout out to Uhan Rodrik.  Uhan helped me out while I was sick with COVID, while we were sick with COVID.  He helped us out a lot here, both in the house and on the channel.  So I just really want to give a big shout out and say thank you so much, Uhan Rodrik, for helping us out over here.  Also, before we get into the video, whenever somebody says, oh, I just believe in one god less than you do, it's meant more of a demonstration of the differences between our worldviews as far as belief in a supernatural deity.  Both of us don't believe in all of the other definitions of gods.  We just, atheists, just so happen to go one god further, and we don't believe in your specific definition of god.  It's really the only difference.  It's not meant as a positive argument or anything like that.  It's just meant as a demonstration of how not different we actually are.  Kyle Butt in this video, though, is going to take that demonstration and try to turn it into some kind of argument.  He's going to convolute the uses of I Believe in One God Less in order to confuse the conversation.  So let's get into this Butts video. ",

            "text": "Do a quick search of YouTube for best atheistic arguments and you'll get several videos that include popular atheists saying this in a nutshell, I just believe in one less God than you do.  What do they mean by that?  Well, they rattle off a list of gods such as Zeus, Poseidon, Vishnu, Buddha, Horus, Apollo, and then they say something to the effect of, tell me why you don't believe in those gods, and I will use your very same reasons to tell you why I don't believe in your god.

            "text": "So this kind of goes a little bit further into the.  I believe in one like God less than you in an effort to try to explain why I believe in one God less than you do.  Because all of those other gods that you listed there, Zeus, Vishnu, Buddha, all them, they all have a reason.  Like everybody that believes in those gods has a reason why they believe in those gods.  But they also have the exact same reasons why they don't believe in other gods.  And you're no special case in this situation, Kyle Button.  The reasons why you don't believe in those gods are the same reasons why those people that believe in those gods don't believe in your god.  So I'm having a really tough time trying to find the difference between your god and these other gods and the reasons why you believe in your god and not these other gods.  Because it all seems like the exact same spiel every time you ask somebody with a different god.  That's the purpose in bringing up the long list of gods.  Another reason why to bring that up would be to point out how illogical it would be to think that your god is special unless you have good empirical evidence to suggest that your god is the one true god that does exist.  That is.  the big difference here, is whether or not you have empirical evidence, like rock-solid evidence, to show that that God is the real God.  And we're going to be getting into this a little bit more in his video. ",

It's a demonstration on how different our worldviews are and also a demonstration on how your belief in your God is the exact same kind of belief that other people have for these other gods.  You all have the same reasons for believing in the gods.  And none of them make sense to me.  I get that you're talking about the logical conclusion that any one specific definition of God is probably not the correct definition of God.  That's also another thing.  that's meant by listing off all the other different gods and how we just go one God further.  All these other definitions of gods have been proven not to be real.  They've been proven and shown that they do not exist.  So what makes your god special?  It would seem, coming from a more rational and logical standpoint, you would take all of those other gods as an established prior probability.  that makes your god very unlikely to be the true god.
