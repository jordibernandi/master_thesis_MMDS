            "text": "You know, Dane, that's a very interesting topic.  And I've had this discussion with other people about how witnesses are being impacted.  I think probably the biggest takeaway when I think about how Jehovah's Witnesses are being impacted by COVID, it revolves around what is the reason that they're being impacted?  Most Witnesses, all of their lives, they have been told to seek certain types of employment.  And there's nothing wrong with those types of employers because they pay your bills, they take care of your family and everything.  But for so many witnesses, they had choices, they had options.  And because they believe everything that the organization told them, They made choices to pursue certain types of careers.  And I mean, this goes back to people who are watching this video right now, to some people's grandparents who sold the farm because the end was going to come.  Whereas now this farm could now be split up into subdivisions and sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and the family would be good to go.  The list just goes on and on.  And then when you start going around the world, Daniel, Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States, and this was something that was just done a few years ago, there's an organization that's called the PEW, P-E-W.  And what they did is they did a massive poll of denominations.  And you know what they found?  Take a guess.  What they found is that Jehovah's Witnesses were at the bottom of the economic educational scale.  And of course, education many times has a direct impact many times on how someone is going to do financially.  I think back to my own kingdom hall, my own congregations I was in, and how many brothers, they had the opportunity to get certain types of jobs, but they took other jobs.  And as a result, many of those jobs have been classified, like you mentioned, as essential workers.  So the witness is having to go out into this environment that we live in now, not necessarily because they have to, but because of the type of choices that they make.  And it's really something.  when you think about it, as you move around the world, I mentioned, and you go into countries that have less economic development than the United States.  For a Jehovah's Witness living in certain countries, it can only be just devastating because that same person could have had another type of career opportunity if his religion had not convinced him that you need to do ABC instead.  And so the impact is unfortunate.  It's just unfortunate. ",

            "text": "So, JT, but what do you say to a witness who essentially is seeing this economic adversity as just being another sign or indication that they're in the right organization and religion?  They're just earning another strike.  You know, Satan is coming after them in another way.  I'm sure many witnesses feel like this is validation that they're doing the right thing. ",

            "text": "Yes, in fact, that has been the history of this organization.  Whenever there's been turmoil anywhere in the world, a good Jehovah's Witness sees it as a stamp of approval that what we're doing is right.  But it's also interesting that for others, it makes them pause and take a step back and like, you know what?  We've seen this before.  We've done this before.  When World War I hit, when World War II hit, all Jehovah's Witnesses just knew the world was coming to an end.  I remember for what many of us, we remember as well, 9-11.  I mean, Jehovah's Witnesses, they just knew, this is it.  Man, it's 20 years ago.  We just had a 20-year anniversary of recognizing those who lost their lives 20 years ago.  There were kids who are born who've now finished high school and are in college.  And so for many witnesses, when they see world events, these become, like you said, a confirmation.  But for others, they become a time where they take pause and they realize, you know what?  I should be better positioned than I am financially and so forth.  And so for those individuals, they're the ones, and we're seeing more and more of them, they're the ones who are taking that second look at what they've been told.  And they're seeing something very different, very different. ",

Die hard to those who got to leave them.  I got to leave right now.  And so you have people all in between.  And there are those in betweens who are having this conversation and they're asking themselves, why is it we have nothing saved?  because we are living paycheck to paycheck because of the choices that we made based on what our religion has taught us.  So I'm sure we would, because we started to have that conversation as well because we looked at ourselves living here in the Washington DC area, prices of homes, prices of rent is very high.  One of the things that we used to see take place right in our congregation.  We would see each year, witnesses would have to move because each year in this area, rent went up.  It just kept going up.  And after a while, so many of the friends in the local congregation, they would literally just get priced right out of the rental market.  And so, because they was waiting for the end to come.  See, the incoming was what was supposed to save all Jehovah's Witnesses from having to deal with all this stuff that they're dealing with.  Because the Watchtower said it, the organization said it, we believe it, and we made decisions and choices based on things are wrapping up real soon.  I was talking to my wife the other night.  You know, most people, if you tell them something is coming soon, most people are like, okay, I can wait, no problem, no rush.  But you can't keep telling people something's coming soon and you're moving from decades into centuries.  You just can't do that and expect people to simply not take the time to ask additional questions about why are we doing this?  We should be better positioned than we are right now. ",

            "text": "When we were Jehovah's Witnesses, we were just on this Watchtower hamster wheel.  We didn't think about our future, making investments, saving for retirement, none of that.  Because Watchtower had us in this mind frame that Armageddon was just around the corner.  We were just trying to do all we could to make it to our meetings.  Even though we didn't quit our jobs to pioneer, we were still struggling working full-time jobs because the kind of jobs that we were working, they really weren't paying us that much.  And, you know, after the situation with us leaving the organization, and I asked JT, why didn't you try to find a different job when we were at Jehovah's Witness?  And his answer was, because the job I had allowed me to get to my meetings.  I didn't have to work any overtime.  I didn't have to work weekends or do any traveling.  He felt like that was the job that was allowing him to do his watchtower stuff.  And when I think about it, timing is everything.  Because when we first moved to Alexandria, Virginia, if we would have bought a home, we would have been sitting pretty financially just from a real estate standpoint.  We would have been sitting on a lot of equity in a home.  You just allowed this religion to make you think so small to the point where you didn't make any good decisions.  We weren't thinking beyond studying for our watchtower, being able to be at the theocratic school and service meeting.  You know, we just were not thinking. ",

            "text": "You know, Daniel, I like the way you put it.  When people are having difficult times, it gives you emotional clarity.  And that's what this type of situation does.  It really makes a person have to stand up and say, what am I doing?  And so that's what happens right now for so many people in this organization.  My recommendation is very simple.  It's what it's always been.  Don't push it to the back of your mind.  This is now your opportunity to take a look, a serious look.  And this is what we're finding by means of the Internet.  You see, by people being at home, they are now tied down to basically surfing the web.  So this clarity causes people to look at things that they would not otherwise.  Let me give you the perfect example.  We just got the phone about a couple of days ago.  with a guy who's still an elder, active elder, doing everything in the congregation.  He actually ended up on our site by accident.  He said he was typing in some research for a talk he was giving.  He had just typed in Jehovah's Witness and our site popped up.  Algorithm brought it up.  And he said, I'm sitting in my private area, private room.  So he basically said he decided he was going to listen.  He said, I know I'm not supposed to be doing this, but I'm going to do it anyway.  He clicked on our site, and he listened to what we had to say.  And what we were discussing in the video, as he's put it, I knew it was true.  This guy emailed us.  We got on the phone.  We talked for over an hour.  And this is the type of guy, he is doing very well financially.  He is a regional manager for a very large organization.  So he is doing very well.  And we discussed about what's happening with the friends in the hall.  And man, I mean, he was just cavalier.  The friends are struggling.  So many of the friends are struggling because of the type of work that they do.  And as a result, the organization, as you know, is not doing a lot of donation.  We're not paying people's light bill, people's gas bill.  We're not doing that for the most part.  And that's what these friends are now left with.  And so now all they can do is wait on.  Jehovah is what they're being told they got to do now. ",
