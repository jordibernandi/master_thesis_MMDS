We're at RoadRooter.com.  What's your morning, Hornos?  Here's your sip of tea.  All right.  A lot of people ask me, okay, so the silver deliveries have been assigned.  Not fully.

            "text": "Okay.  The, well, let's, let's, let's jump over to economics.  I know that In September, I mean, everybody's starting to get excited about silver because it just started to show some life.  You had said in September that silver would be a precursor to more economic chaos, and you actually even said \u2013 when we're talking about september we're talking about last september when he gave the the private road members again a peek into at the vegas litecoin summit a peek into the future of silver.  so go check it out.  definitely it's something you want to if you're interested in silver and you're interested in cliff high.  get on that and kristoff is amazing by the way if you want to know what's going on spiritually.  And then Jenny Moonstone with the Golden Grand Canyon, she's just on fire, helping us discover what it is, why it is, and all kinds of things.  So check it out.  Then we have my predictions.  All right.  Another great post from David Morgan.  Go to the Morgan Report.  Silver could pass all-time high.  Now, David goes through a chart that was posted a while ago, and he goes through how undervalued silver is.  how massively undervalued historically silver is, only because of the manipulation.  Especially in these last few years, this is when the computer rigging happened, and it is just beyond the pale, as they say.  Silver should be trading at least over $1,000 right now.  Right now.  I think it'll blow that by one to one with the gold probably at some point.  So go check out David Morgan's.  It's called Silver Could Pass Its All-Time High.  His YouTube channel is The Morgan Report.  All right.  So here we have the Comex first day of delivery.  There's about 14,000 contracts that basically have stood for delivery.  And I think there's going to be a little more than that.  It looks like the numbers didn't quite add up on how many notifications were given versus how many contracts were taken off the open interest on Friday.  There's like 3,000 extra.  So it might be we hit over 17,000.  We could hit the all-time high.  I don't know.  It's kind of squirrely at the end of the month because the demands for silver for delivery come in not all on the same day, but basically over the first three or four days of the month.  So I'll know more Monday or Tuesday about kind of where we stand on deliveries.  But an interesting thing, if you look at this chart, and I highlighted some of the things that stood out, Let's go down the list here.  There are, you can basically stop when there's issued and stopped.  Issued means people said, hey, I want my silver physically delivered.  And stopped means this is the entity that's the short going into the month.  They were short going into the month that's going to have to pony up the silver.  Now, Macquarie has been pretty big all along, but look at the BMO Capital.  379 contracts.  Now, that might not look like a big thing, but BMO has never been on this list.  So it is basically a newcomer to the short squeeze.  Now, many of these entities closed out as many as contracts as they could take, taking huge losses, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses last week for the big banksters, just so you know, so they didn't have to deliver.  So they're getting pain on both sides.  And the losses won't be seen until they declare the third quarter earnings.  But look, at BMO, they got dinged with 379 that they kept open for some reason.  And it was 1.9 million ounces they owed.  Which is, in my estimation of where these shorts were put on, probably a loss of $10 million or so for BMO.  For a non-participant in the silver market, I guarantee you BMO is now going to \u2013 this is their house account too.  See the H over there on the left?  I'll guarantee you there's going to be a shakeup in the BMO brokerage pit.  It's probably like two guys who are in charge of gold and silver and just got way off sides and screwed up and could have lost probably, I would guess, five times what the delivery is, so maybe $50 million.  So keep an eye out for BMO Capital.  Another new one to the list is, believe it or not, Wells Fargo Security.  What the hell is Wells Fargo doing in the physical silver pit, not closing out their contracts?  It's because they had a huge loss.  It's the house account.  Again, Wells Fargo, a licensed bank.  We give these banks licenses to print money and they go gamble it on silver commodities.  My estimate is Wells Fargo, just on the delivery of 1.89 million ounces, they lost probably 10 million or 9 million, maybe 40 million overall.  What the hell are they doing?  there is my question.  Morgan Stanley.  They're pretty much in the market all the time anyway.  Then we have JP Morgan.  Notice, this is \u2013 Ted Butler is brilliant.  Ted Butler said JP Morgan will not be delivering any more physical silver into the market on their house account because they've already paid off what they need to pay off vis-a-vis the DOJ settlement.  And voila, JP Morgan did not have any house account deliveries or issues.  It was just the customer account, but it was gigantic.  It was almost half of what was in there, which is 3,811 contracts issued and stopped 3,020, 800 contracts on the plus side.  And you don't know how much of that is wash trading, meaning they're trading with themselves and delivering against their own.  There's a lot of manipulation going on.  But, I mean, the big thing that stands out is the house account didn't put out any metal at all, which Ted Butler said, yeah, they're done.  They've paid off $300 million in physical into the market, and now they are done.  So it looks like Ted was right again.  Again.  The other new one was Barclays.  Look at Barclays down there, 463.  They had to pony them up.  which is over 2 million, almost 3, is that 3 million ounces?  2.5 million?  The reality... The reality of these companies that are newly delivering physical silver into the comics because they didn't close out their position, that reality is not going to sit well with the risk management group of these companies.  So those are the ones I'd say, hey, take a look at.  The three new players to silver delivery, which means they probably closed out a lot of losses in the past year.  three or four days so watch for losses at bmo capital wells fargo securities and barclays and it could be substantial not sure and we'll see.  also i mean friday we probably have uh close to half of the delivery notifications have been have been um certified, notified.  The rest will happen Monday, Tuesday, and then they'll trickle through the month.  But there's nothing stopping someone from like Warren Buffett coming in and saying, okay, I want delivery this month.  Instant delivery by contracts and then say, I want them delivered.  So anybody short silver still is shitting themselves.  There you have it.  All right.  And then, yeah, we'll know more on Monday.  I'll go through it more Monday.  But, yeah, it's starting off great.  The bigger thing that happened was the closing out of short positions last week.  I think that's where hundreds of millions of dollars in hits happened.  Um, and now it's just the physical.  I think they'll come up with the physical.  I mean, the physical is out there, so they'll come up with it either by leasing it or buying it off someone outside of the comex market.  that, you know, JP Morgan's probably charging huge premiums for silver right now.  They know these people are screwed that are short, that don't have the metal.  So, Hey, you can go buy silver.  You might have to pay a hundred dollars an ounce for it from JP Morgan.  which means more blood in the water for these banks who shouldn't even be participating in silver, if you ask me.  Well, that's what I got for you.  Again, go to the Road to Ruta.  You can join today.  50 Theta, 50 Theta Fuel.  And they get mailed to your front door, so you don't have to be crypto savvy.
