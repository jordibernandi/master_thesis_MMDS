            "text": "Let's get it.  Greetings.  This is Professor Griff, a USCCA certified firearms instructor.  We're presently having classes and we're going to discuss stealth, safety, training, education, and legal protection.  The surge of gun sales in America are through the roof.  They said there were 6.5 million guns sold over the last few years.  Most of them are reactionary gun buyers, feeling that the government, feeling that law enforcement, feeling that those that are responsible for our safety are not taking black people's safety serious.  So the surge in gun ownership, not only as a whole, but black people have surged.  I mean, to the tune of 6.5 million gun sales over the last several years.  The educational component surrounding firearms and guns should also increase.  If that is balanced out, I think we can start educating the masses of people that are owning guns.  What percentage of that are women?  What percentage of that are black gun owners that are not educated, not trained, and not taking safety, security, storing guns, staging guns seriously?  This is what we intend to do right here on Serious Arms.  and serious defense because we have to be serious if we're gonna become serious responsible firearms owners.  We have to take the safety, the education, the training, and the legal protection serious.  We're going to do that in the classes that we're given.  So check out the information below, above, to my left and to my right, or the flyer coming on after this.  Get the information, screenshot it, get the number, call, participate.  Sign yourself up, sign your mate up, sign your children up in the classes so we can begin to talk about safety, training, education, and legal protection.  This is Professor Griff.  I'll see you guys in class. ",
