            "text": "This is a bar of chocolate.  A big, fat, juicy, tempting bar of chocolate.  This is my wife.  This is my wife eating a bar of chocolate.  This is me also eating a bar of chocolate.  But here's the game changer.  This is me.  This is my wife.  This is me and my wife eating an apple.  What me and my wife found is when we filled the house up with apples, with oranges, with pears, with pumpkin seeds, when we started to eat those things, suddenly we didn't have the same room anymore for chocolate.  And likewise, my dear precious believer, If you fill yourself up on the good things, on prayer, on fasting, on reading the Bible, on evangelism, on church fellowship, if you fill yourself up with those kind of things, suddenly you won't have the same room anymore for those sins which so easily tempt us.  Do you get the picture?  It's all about which appetite do you feed.  Listen to Ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to 24.  It says, and to put on the new man created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.  One day an elderly grandfather was teaching his grandson all about life and he looked at his grandson and he said, you know there's a fight going on inside me.  It's a fight between two wolves.  One wolf is evil, he is anger, he is sorrowful, he is lust, he's pride, he's all that is greedy, he lies, he's arrogant, he's jealous and he has a big ego.  But the other wolf is good, he is love, joy, peace, hope, humility, he's full of kindness, he's got compassion, there's truth, there's generosity and he has faith.  And then he looked at his grandson and he said, you see, the same fight which is going on within me is going on inside every single human being on this earth.  And I'll tell you something else, boy, it's going on inside you.  So the grandson, a little bit nervous, a little bit shaken, looked up at his grandfather and said, grandfather, which wolf will win?  And the grandfather smiled and said, the one that you feed, that's the wolf that will win.  So that's secret number one, feed the new man.  He longs for the Lord Jesus Christ, so give him Christ.  But at the same time, we must starve the old man because he wants nothing more than to go back and feast on sin.  Secret number two, when you fall, Get back up again.  Proverbs 24 verse 16 says this, For the righteous falls seven times and rises again.  I don't know whether you'll agree with me on this one, but I do think one of the most beautiful things that you and I can ever watch while we're on this earth is to watch a baby learn how to walk.  You know what I'm talking about.  Here's this little one and he takes a few steps or she takes a few steps and then she falls down and then she gets back up again and she takes a few more steps and then she tumbles and then she gets and it keeps going over and over and over again.  The baby might fall a thousand times, a hundred thousand times.  There might be tears, there might be pain at times, but what happens?  The baby always rises again.  He always keeps trying to walk.  And over time, with this consistency, with this patience, what happens to that little boy?  What happens to that little girl?  Well, eventually they learn how to walk.  And my dear brother, my dear sister, that is my honest prayer for you.  That one day you will come to a point where you walk and you do not fall anymore.  I don't know, perhaps we're having this conversation now because you've been living a life in defeat for years now, and it's been hard.  Don't be surprised if you stumble more often.  Don't be surprised if you fall over every time you try to walk like that newborn baby.  Don't go to self-pity.  Don't go to self-hatred.  I've done that before.  It gets you nowhere.  The most important thing you need to do is just take one step at a time.  Keep your eyes on the judge.  Keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, and he'll get you through this valley.  And there'll come a point where you live that victorious life through the power of the blood of the Lamb of God who was slain for the sins of the world.  Have you ever heard the saying before, don't try to run before you can walk?  Well, actually, that's what the Christian must do.  He must learn to run before he can walk.  Do you remember Joseph in the Bible?  He learnt how to run.  He learnt how to flee.  He was tempted persistently, day after day, by Potiphar's wife.  Come lie with me, Joseph.  Come to bed with me, Joseph.  Until there came a point where Joseph had to just get out of that city.  He had to run.  He had to flee.  He had to just get away.  In October 2014, Emma and I got married.  And for the first three years of our marriage, we had no internet in the home.  And then for the last three years, we've used Emma's mobile phone as a Wi-Fi router.  So the point's this, I can only ever access the internet when Emma is in the home with me.  Now why do I tell you that story?  I don't tell you so that you think that I'm a great guy.  I don't tell you to boast in any way.  The reason I tell you that story is so that you know that the man who is standing in front of you right now is just as weak as you are.  I've got my own struggles to face.  Number three, ask Jesus to answer the door.  A little girl was one day sat down with her Sunday school teacher.  And the Sunday school teacher asked the little girl, where does Jesus live?  And the little girl said, he lives in my heart.  So the Sunday school teacher said, and what do you do when the devil comes and knocks on the door of your heart?  And the little girl paused for a couple of moments.  And then she said this, I asked Jesus to go and answer the door.  Dear brothers, dear sisters, when the devil tries to get into your heart, we need to ask the saviour of the world to come in and answer the door for us.  Why do we need Jesus to answer the door?  Because the fact is this guys, we cannot fight the devil on our own.  He's smarter than us, he's bigger than us, he's older than us and he's been studying us for years.  The devil's a bit like the YouTube algorithm.  Have you ever signed in on YouTube and you've got all of these recommended videos?  Perhaps you're into chocolate cake, like my wife, and you see these chocolate cakes coming up on the screen and you click on it.  The YouTube knows exactly what it needs to present in front of you to get those clicks.  The same with Google Ads.  It knows exactly.  If you've been talking about lawnmowers, suddenly you're signing on Google and then lawnmower ads come up on your feed.  And the devil does the exact same thing.  He knows that if he dangles this bit of bait in front of your face, you'll click.  He knows that if he discourages you in this way and then puts this temptation in front of you, you'll fall for the sin again.  But there's one thing I'm more sure of than the sun is going to rise tomorrow.  And that's this.  The devil is terrified of this one man.  This one man, they had a battle once for 40 days and 40 nights.  The devil threw everything he could at him, but this man with an empty stomach still came out and defeated him.  Once again, the devil threw all of his powers at him.  This man was nailed to a cross and everyone looked and everyone thought it was over.  But on the third day, this man rose from the dead, conquering the grave, beating him all.  What's this man's name?  This man is called Jesus Christ.  And he's not just a man, he's God in the flesh.  And that's why you and I, whenever we're tempted by this fiend, the devil, we need to call out to this God-man, Jesus, to rescue us and to save us and to deliver us from all of our temptations.  May I just say one more thing?  I've really been quite encouraged over the last week to read in the comment box how many men, how many women are just so desperate to get sin out of their lives.  Well, if that's you, just up there is a playlist with a bunch of tips, a bunch of strategies to get free from lust, to get free from sin, to break these bonds.  Do click it now.  And if you haven't yet already, I'd love it if you'd subscribe as well and join this family. ",
