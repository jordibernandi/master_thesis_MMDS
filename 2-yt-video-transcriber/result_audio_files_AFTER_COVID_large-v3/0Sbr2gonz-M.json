            "text": "One issue environmentalists in the West are almost completely silent about is immigration.  For the most part, Green Parties in the West support and celebrate mass immigration to Western countries.  But this wasn't always the case.  Environmental groups in the 1960s and 70s often took strong stands in favour of population stabilisation.  In 1969, for example, the board of directors of the Sierra Club urged the people of the United States to abandon population growth as a pattern and goal, to commit themselves to limit the population of the United States in order to achieve a balance between population and resources, and to achieve a stable population no later than the year 1990.  In 1978, the club's board of directors urged the federal government to conduct a thorough investigation of US immigration policies and their impact on US population trends.  But in 1996, under pressure from immigration activists, the club's board adopted a position of neutrality.  Around the same time, the group Zero Population Growth dropped most of its work on US population issues and altered its stated goal from stopping to slowing world population growth.  ZPG also changed its name, one of the most vivid and well-recognized among non-profit advocacy groups, to Population Connection.  In 2013, the Sierra Club and other groups actually supported an immigration bill in the Senate that would have greatly increased annual immigration levels, describing it as an immigrant's rights bill while carefully avoiding any mention of its demographic implications.  In this video, I will mostly focus on mass immigration's impact on the United States, but keep in mind all of these arguments apply across the Western world.  Population growth in the United States is almost entirely driven by the federal government's immigration policy.  The Census Bureau predicts that the nation's population will grow from 325 million today to 403 million by 2060, and 96% of that increase of 78 million people is due to the currently starkly high level of immigration.  As outlined in the National Environment Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies are supposed to weigh the environmental impact of any new policies they introduce.  Strangely enough, federal agencies have almost completely ignored these laws when it comes to immigration.  even though immigration-driven population growth has a huge impact on the environment.  A New Yorker journalist called Osita Noanevu once mocked Americans who are concerned about immigration, given that Middle America is full of vast and mostly empty country where 40% of the land is for cows.  A common argument in favour of immigration is to point to the vast open spaces still available in Western nations, or to give examples of how everyone in the US or another country could be crammed into one state or county.  But this ignores the multitude of often unseen environmental impacts individuals have, and the clear evidence from the natural world that we are already overpopulated, on both the global and national level.  The key point about immigration to the West is captured in the fact that when immigrants come to the West, they do not maintain the traditional lifestyle of their home country.  Rather, they quickly adapt to the Western lifestyle.  As they do, they become greater consumers and polluters.  Their individual ecological footprint increases.  For example, the carbon footprint of the average immigrant in the United States is 302% higher than it would have been had he or she remained home.  As well as the obvious increase in their ecological footprint, there are a myriad of debilitating effects immigration has on the environment.  These include, number one, the loss of biodiversity and species extinction.  Overpopulation directly threatens a wide range of endangered animal species in the United States, as human consumption of resources crowds out and poisons other animals.  The Center for Biological Diversity listed the top 10 US species being driven to extinction by overpopulation.  This includes the San Joaquin kit fox, a native of California, which has lost almost all of its habitat as grasslands were converted into farms.  And the Florida panther, whose habitat has been destroyed by urban sprawl from the city centers in Florida.  Florida is also home to 95% of the US breeding population of loggerhead sea turtles, whose nesting area has been converted into recreational beaches.  Both of these species are being wiped out by urban sprawl because Florida's human population has doubled in the past 30 years, due mostly to immigration.  Over 20% of Florida's population are first-generation immigrants, Florida also has the highest net migration of any US state.  Overall, there are 1,300 endangered or threatened species in the United States today, and as a growing population demands more and more resources, from farmland to residential real estate to urban sprawl, these species will have fewer places to live.  Number two, water shortages.  As immigration continues to drive the United States population higher, the demand for water continues to rise, yet the availability continues to decline.  For example, a study out of Columbia University found that massive droughts in the southeastern United States in 2007-2008 were due to the region's exploding population.  which posed the root of the water supply problem.  Georgia's population grew from 6.5 million in 1990 to 9.5 million in 2007, and has now reached 10.5 million.  Nearly a quarter of total water use in Georgia is for public water supply, meaning a higher population puts a larger strain on water availability.  Immigration is also leading to the destruction of freshwater habitats and rivers.  According to the EPA's most recent wadeable streams assessment, which looked at the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the nation's rivers and streams, 28% of US stream miles are in good condition.  compared to the best available reference sites in their regions, 25% are in fair condition, and 42% are in poor condition.  Significantly, less densely populated parts of the country tended to have biologically healthier rivers and superior water quality.  While 45% of western rivers were found in good condition, in the more populous eastern highlands, only 18% were found to be in good condition and over half were in poor condition.  3.  Urban Sprawl.  Urban sprawl, or the expansion of cities, leads to the conversion of farmlands and grasslands into cities.  Sprawl is an environmental problem for lots of reasons, including increased energy consumption, water consumption, air pollution, and habitat loss for wildlife.  Habitat loss is by far the number one cause of species endangerment in the United States.  Between 1982 and 2001, the United States converted 34 million acres of forest, cropland and pasture to developed uses, an area the size of Illinois.  The average annual rate of land conversion increased from 1.4 million acres to 2.2 million acres over this time, and continues on an upward trend.  A paper from the Public Library of Science found that the southeastern United States will expand urbanization by 101 to 192% over the next 50 years.  The number one cause of sprawl, by far, is population growth.  New houses, new shopping centers and new roads are being built for new residents.  In recent decades, cities and states with the highest population growth rates have also shown the most sprawl.  Number four, overcrowded cities.  While the overcrowding of cities could possibly be mitigated by more immigrants moving to rural areas, the reality is that for a whole host of cultural and economic reasons, most settle in or near cities.  Indeed, according to the census, immigrants are currently driving the increased population in most American cities, and the foreign-born population is heavily concentrated in the country's 10 largest metro areas.  On top of the geographic expansion of cities, the actual number of residents in those urban areas will put growing levels of strain on public utilities such as trains.  As immigration continues to fuel population growth, more and more cities will feel the strain of overcrowding making mass transportation more arduous.  For example, In London, passengers wasted almost 400,000 hours because of delays in their journeys in 2017, caused by overcrowding.  In the same year, it was estimated that New York had 75,000 subway delays monthly.  In a 2017 article, the New York Times noted that the major cause of subway delays is a factor that basically did not exist 15 years ago, overcrowding.  But the Times ignored the elephant in the room, the immigration variable in the city's population growth.  In 2015, more legal and illegal immigrants lived in New York than in any city worldwide, 3.2 million.  Solving subway overcrowding when thousands of new immigrants arrive year after year is impossible, regardless of how much new rail is put down.  California has the highest immigrant population in the US, so it's no coincidence that it also has 8 of the 10 most polluted cities in the US.  Number 5, carbon emissions.  Immigration transfers population of people from lower polluting parts of the world to the United States and other Western countries, where CO2 emissions are far higher per person.  According to a CIS study, US immigrants produce an estimated 637 million tonnes of CO2 annually, which is 482 million tonnes more than these immigrants would have produced had they remained in their home countries.  In other words, immigrants more than triple their emissions when they moved to the United States.  Number six, energy consumption.  93% of US energy comes from a non-renewable source, and each source degrades the environment in some way.  The average immigrant more than triples his energy consumption when he arrives in the United States.  Number seven, cattle production.  While cattle production may seem benign, it's not.  Cattle emit methane, cause soil erosion, pollute streams, and require the conversion of forest into rangeland.  Immigration more than quintuples the average immigrant's effect on the production of cattle.  And this is related to number eight, fertilizer consumption.  Although fertilizer increases short-term crop yields, it also salts the earth, poisons the land and water systems.  Fertilizer use is the main contributor to nitrogen pollution.  In Europe alone, the environmental and human health costs of nitrogen pollution are estimated to be anything between 70 and 320 billion euros per year.  Nitrogen emissions such as ammonia, nitrogen oxide and nitrous. ",
