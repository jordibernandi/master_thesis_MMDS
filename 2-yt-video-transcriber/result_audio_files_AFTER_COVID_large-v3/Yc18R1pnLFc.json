            "text": "Good morning, my brothers and sisters.  So I wanted to share this word that the Lord put on my heart this morning.  Some will take it, you know, as a warning.  Some of you probably already know this, but I'm going to give you a lot of Bible verses.  What's happening in the world has been prophesied, not just by men and women of God, but also just throughout the Bible.  We see different scriptures talking about these kind of things happening and how.  It's a sign of the times, right?  And some people may feel like, well, you know, we've had riots and things before.  But please understand that with social media and, you know, people going viral and people being able to see everything all over the world.  I think I've seen a quote from Will Smith.  He said racism is just getting recorded now.  It's not.  it's not going up.  It's getting recorded.  And there's some truth to this statement because now people are.  All over the world are able to see an incident and it's going to invoke different reactions.  It's going to invoke different emotions and people are going to respond different Differently and so we need to understand that's.  one thing we're going to talk about is how a believer should respond when you feel these different things But these different feelings these different emotions when you see these different things going on in the world coronavirus riots and all of this stuff.  so God gave me some scriptures and that I'm gonna share with you guys, and I'm gonna break each one of them down, okay?  The first verse I feel led to pull up first is this, Matthew 24, all right, verse 12.  And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.  Good news.  And the gospel of the what kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations.  And then the end will come.  Now, some of you remember that I read Matthew 24 a couple of weeks ago showing that it's not the end of the world.  You know, when coronavirus is going on, some people thought, you know, oh, this is the end of the world.  But right here, there's a lot of things that have to happen.  And it says lawlessness will be increased.  Now it's to the point where they're burning down police precincts.  Okay.  We've had riots before, but they're targeting police precincts and you've got all kinds of people doing all kinds of different things and some people are going to feel it's justified.  Some people, you know, are out there.  They don't care about George Floyd's murder.  Let's be 100% honest when you're stealing shoes and When you are stealing phones and things like that, you don't care about that man's death.  You're doing it for your own selfish reasons.  And if people be honest with themselves, a lot of people, they do these things because they just like to do it.  Some people out there are having a blast.  I mean, they're having a good time.  Why?  Because in Jeremiah 17, 9, it says, the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.  who can know it.  It doesn't say some people's heart or some race of people's heart or people with certain backgrounds.  It says the heart is deceitful.  Your heart will deceive you, all right?  People thinking, oh, I'm a good person.  I'm a holy person.  I'm in good standing.  But then when you begin to seek God, and you begin to read the Bible, you find out like, oh man, I got flaws.  I got things that I need to work on.  I got things that I was not aware of.  And when I compare myself to other people, which a lot of people like to do, which is a problem in America, then you feel holier than thou.  When I look at the thug and I look at the gangbanger, I feel like I'm such a good person.  But then when I start comparing myself to the righteousness of God and what the Bible says, I find out, hey, man, I might need to humble myself because I'm not all that I thought I was.  But your heart will deceive you, okay?  So a lot of people, lawlessness is running abound, okay?  And the heart is deceitful.  People thinking, oh, I'm doing this for a good reason.  You know, this is justified and I'm right.  The Bible says, you know, I felt it with my heart.  I saw the video and I just, I felt something in my heart and this is how I felt I should respond.  Now, watch this.  I'm gonna get deep.  Now here comes a big warning.  Matthew 12, 36, watch this.  But I tell you that everyone will have to give an account on the day of judgment For every empty word they have spoken.  Some versions say for every idle word that was spoken.  So everybody just running off saying what they feel.  Now, we're going to tie it in together.  The heart is deceitful, right?  And the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart, the what?  The mouth speaks.  The Bible says that for every word that you say, you're going to have to give an account.  Okay, so watch how that all ties in together.  The heart is deceitful.  It's desperately wicked.  Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.  And then here in Matthew 12, 36, it says, but I tell you, everyone will have to give an account on the day of judgment for every empty word.  So the Bible says there's life and death in the tongue.  Be careful what you say.  You sow when you save.  When you speak. ",
