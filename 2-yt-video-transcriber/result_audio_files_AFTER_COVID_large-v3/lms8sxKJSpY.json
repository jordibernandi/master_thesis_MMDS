Yeah, I told them.  They just told me not to film.  I told them I'm not on your property, so... Do you mind if I ask what you're filming for?  Oh, I'm just doing a little news story.  I'm a journalist.  Okay, all right.  That's all.  You work for any specific company?  No, I'm just independent.  Okay.  Do you have any ID on you or anything?  Oh, no.  Okay.  What's your first and last name?  Oh, I'm not going to ID.  I'm just out here filming, dude.  I'm sorry?  I'm not going to ID.  I'm just out here filming.  Okay, well, I was... You're not in any trouble.  I know, I know.  That's why I'm not going to ID.  Because I'm not in any trouble.  You don't have to be in trouble for me to ID you, though.  Well, that's what Title 11-1902 says in Delaware.  You know, you have some kind of crime that you suspect me of, and you just said I'm not in any trouble.  So you just lost that whole.  get my ID thing.  Sorry, bud.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to do the whole... I know, I don't want to talk to you at all.  Are you detaining me here?  Technically, you're not free to go.  Okay.  So I am free.  Okay.  All right.  So, like I said, the security office told they were just concerned because you were videoing.  That's great.  That's all.  Okay.  I thought you were law enforcement, not feelings enforcement out here.  You know, their feelings don't trump what I can do.  I can't hear you.  Their feelings don't trump what I can do.  You're not feelings enforcement.  You're law enforcement.  Okay.  Law says I can video from public property.  I understand that.  I'm not disputing that.  I'm not disputing that.  Okay.  Perfect.  But I am allowed to verify who you are.  Just make sure you don't have any warrants or anything.  Okay.  that, okay?  I'm not going to do that.  If we need to escalate it, that's fine.  If you want to get a supervisor, I'll wait.  My supervisor is actually on his way.  I'll let you talk to him a little bit more.  Is there any reason why you don't want to provide any identification?  I want to be anonymous.  That's the whole point.  That's all it is.  I'm just trying to do a news story.  I'm an investigative news journalist.  If I tell everybody who I am and what I'm doing, everybody's going to know.  What's the point of coming out here?  You've got to come out to the source.  They just got approved for a COVID.  You know, vaccine.  I'm just working on a little news story about it.  I don't see why you all need to heart me for who I am and what I'm doing.  No one's hearting you.  It's part of our job.  We ID people when we get calls and complaints.  Well, I know, but I'm just engaged in free class out here.  That's all I'm doing.  So you can be as cooperative as you want, but at the end of the day, we're still allowed to ID you.  That's all.  That's fine.  Well, at this point, you said I'm detained, so I'm just never not going to speak anymore at this point.  Okay.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, man?  He just got called here from the guard check.  Yeah, that's cool.  I know I told him too.  He's hollering at me not to film.  So I said, I'm not on your property.  You know, there's nothing you can do about it.  Call the police.  They'll tell you the same thing.  So I was hoping you'd come out here and educate him and tell me to have a nice day.  But your officer here is harping me for my ID.  So I'm not real happy about it.  So I don't know what you want to do about it.  You said you're the supervisor.  Yep.  So, look, we're obviously not trying to give you a hard time about the whole situation.  Yeah, exactly.  I just want to keep doing my job out here.  I'm out here doing the job.  Well, you technically are right now.  I just need your ID.  I don't have it on me.  I'm not going to give you anything.  I'm just going to try to explain something to you.  You've given us your information.  We're not going to give it out to anybody.  This whole incident is documented.  Would you just listen to me for a second?  I don't want to listen to you.  I want to be free on my way to do what I want to do.  You can still be if you let us do our job, though.  That's all I'm doing.  You can still be if you let us do our job, though.  This is preventing you from doing what you want to do, though.  So we could be out of your hair if you gave us your ID.  I want to turn around and go back to where I was doing.  That's fair.  So do we.  I'm not stopping you guys.  I'm not detaining you. ",

So I know the code verbatim.  So are you aware of the basic things that you have to provide a police officer when they turn to you?  Well, they said when you have, you either have to think I'm committing, I'm about to commit, or I have committed a crime.  He's already told me I've done nothing wrong.  So you don't have that.  So I have no obligation to give you anything.  That's the problem here is you have no suspicion whatsoever.  of me breaking any laws.  He's already stated that on camera, so there's no need to go push any further with this.  You guys are escalating this into trying to violate my rights of my fourth amendment to get my ID and trying to tell me you have to get my ID.  You don't have to get my ID unless I'm breaking the law.  That's how it works.  So if we're going to keep doing this, that's fine.  I'm not going to ID.  So where do you want to go from here?  Well, you know, obviously we would really enjoy a consensual conversation about that, but... It's already gone too far.  We're detained at this point.  It's not consensual.

What's your badge number?  1088.  Woo!  Man, this is great stuff.  You can just stop anybody and ID anybody.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.

I'm gathering content.  I'm on public property.  I've never entered their property once.  I'm not trespassing.  I'm not loitering.  I'm breaking their laws.  Why are we still here?  You're law enforcement.  That's true.  Let's enforce the law here.  I'm just talking to you, man.  I don't want to talk anymore.  I already told you that.  I want to go back to doing my job.  You guys should be going back to yours too.  You're not doing anything.  You're harassing a law-abiding citizen right now.  I'm not breaking any laws.  We already saw this.  So you never stepped foot on their property?  Never once.  I've still been filming the whole time.  Two cameras.  Do you know why he called specifically?  He came out to me and told me I can't film.  And then he went back in there.  I guess he called somebody.  And then he came back out again and said I can't film.  I said, dude, I don't want to argue with you.  I'm not going on your property.  I haven't been on it.  I'm not on it.  This is public.  This is the police's job.  Call them because you can't enforce anything on public.  I said, if you don't like it, then call them.

That's what I'm trying to say.  So you wanted us to come out here?  Not really, but when he said that, I wanted to wait for you guys to come.  I'm not going to be around town and have you guys chasing after me.  We didn't take the phone call.  Someone at the police station took the phone call, and we just responded out here.  Well, I mean, when you get out here, you see that, hey, some guy's just taking pictures in public.  He's good to go.  He's not doing anything wrong.  He's turning around.  You don't even have to come talk.  I get it if you want to.  That's great.  I don't mind you coming and talking.  I tell you what I'm doing, but as soon as we try to escalate to... We're going to get your ID if you come to this room.  I asked for your ID.  Okay, I'm not going to.  That's fine, dude.  You told me we had the right.  That's a semantics game.  That's what you're doing.  That's fine.  We'll play it back, man.  That's fine.  Here's the deal.  Obviously.  That's not semantics.  That's what was said. ",
