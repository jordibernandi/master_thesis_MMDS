            "text": "O holy night, the stars are brightly shining.  It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.  Long lay the world, sin and error pining.  Till he appeared and our soul felt its worth.  A thrill of hope.  The weary world rejoices.  For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.  Fall.  Come hear the angel voices.  O night divine.  O night When Christ was born.  And truly he taught us to love one another.  And his law is grace and his gospel is peace.  And chains shall he break for the slave is our brother.  And in his name all oppression shall cease.  Sweet hymns of joy and grateful chorus raise me.  Let all within us praise his.  On your knees.  Come hear the angel voices.  O night divine.  O night When Christ was born.  O night divine.  O night.  O night divine. ",
