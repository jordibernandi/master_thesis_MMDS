So, but, you know, despite all this censorship, basically, from the rest of the media and Facebook and Twitter, it seems that the American people have found out about the story.  as usual censorship backfires.  And that interesting poll that you mentioned in Rasmussen yesterday shows that a majority of Americans think that Joe Biden actually knew about Hunter Biden's shady deals overseas and also may have benefited from them.  And when you look at Republicans, 83 percent of them think that.  But Democrats seem to be just in the dark or not wanting to know about it because only about 30 percent of them feel that way. ",

So Unfortunately, Joe Biden is has been shown by all this evidence and by Tony Bobulinski's very credible testimony to not have been being truthful with the American people.
