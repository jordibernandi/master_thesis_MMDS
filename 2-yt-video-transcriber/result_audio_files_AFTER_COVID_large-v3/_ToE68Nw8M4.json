She also happens to be my daughter.  Please welcome Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  I think you brought a fan club with you.  It's always so funny when I have a guest that gets 14 times the love that the host gets.  I just want to throw that out there.  But as long as you're doing that for my daughter, I'm fine with it.  I'm fine with it.  Hey, this is, and I'm saying this not just as a father, But as the reader of the book, it is a fantastic insight into what we never ever hear about President Trump and what really goes on in the White House.  So there've been so many books about President Trump and the White House, most of them written very negatively.  What's different about this story? ",

I spent three and a half years working for the president, two and a half in the White House, and nearly every single day of my 12, 14, 16 hour days, I spent most of that time at the president's side watching him talk with foreign leaders, watching him interact with his family.  I got to see him in a way that very few Americans get to see.  For two and a half years, I spoke on behalf of the president, and this is my turn to tell my side of the story and show the country who this man is behind the scenes, the generous, the kind, the compassionate person that he is, and also give people a chance to know who I am, why I wanted to work in the Trump White House, and why I loved the job that I had.

I saw somebody who empowered women, who fought for us, who stood up for us, who defended us.  When I was under constant attack from liberals, as you know, nothing was off limits, whether it was my character, how I felt about something, my weight, my appearance, my fitness as a mother, everything was on the table.  you made or whether I didn't make the pie.  Everything was on the table for liberals to attack.  But the president actually stood up for me, defended me and empowered me to do my job and trusted me to carry his message to the world, which was a pretty big responsibility. ",

I had been kicked out of a restaurant.  I'd been attacked at the White House Correspondents' Dinner as their guest sitting at the head table.  And I was not having the best couple of weeks of my life.  And we had been traveling.  Even my own husband didn't really know how to address kind of all the negativity that I was taking on.  And we were walking into a meeting with Prime Minister Abe.  And the president had every reason in the world to be focused on that meeting.  But he just sensed something.  He grabbed me and said, hold on a second.  He grabbed me.  He turned to me in the hall.  He looked me directly in the eye and he said, Sarah, the reason that they attack you is because you're good at your job.  You're smart.  You're beautiful.  Do not let them get you down.  And I was just kind of taken aback and astonished that he recognized in that moment that I needed help.  A second.  And I needed somebody to empower me.  And he did that.  And then he, in true Trump style, slapped me on the shoulder and said, now let's get back to work.  And we immediately went into this bilateral meeting and started discussing, you know, one of the most significant trade deals in his presidency.  But that was one of the things that I want people to understand about this president, that he loves the people around him.  He fights for us.  He empowers us.  And that's what he's trying to do for every American.  every single day he steps into that office. ",

I sat with him when he made phone calls to parents who had lost a soldier that had been serving overseas in Afghanistan.  I saw him become vulnerable in those moments.

And he would take these moments.  He would go into these hospital rooms and visit one-on-one with soldiers who had been injured, who had come back.  He would sit with their families and I think really just open himself up in a way that you don't get to see on the cameras.  The president has very much a tough guy persona, and I think he likes that and usually prefers that.  But these moments, you really got to just see his love of country us to live in it.

That's why they're there to cover the president.  And despite the back and forth we had, we all had a job to do.  And I think a lot of times we had a mutual respect that we had very different jobs that were important to our democracy.  And I had a very good working relationship with a number of reporters.  I'd love to name names, and I'm thinking about whether or not I want to, but I'm afraid I might ruin their careers.  If I say something good about a reporter, it may hurt both of us.  But there were, I think, a lot more good people that were trying to do a good job and trying to write good stories than there were bad.  Unfortunately, the bad ones are usually the loudest.  and get the most coverage.  And certainly I think on places like CNN and MSNBC, they give full stage to those individuals to attack the president.  And so often it's not news anymore, it's commentary.  And that line has been so blended.  And I think that is one of the most dangerous things about where we are in the news industry, in the media empire, is we've got to go back to separating news from commentary.

Because you talk about that struggle and how God used even people to pray for you.  So it's not just a book about the White House and politics, but about your own spiritual walk and how God gave you comfort.
