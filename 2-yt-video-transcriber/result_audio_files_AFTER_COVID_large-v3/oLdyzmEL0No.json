            "text": "So nowadays, pretty much all experts agree any potential major conflict with the United States would come with either Russia or China.  And so China's development and growth is seen as probably the most threatening, especially their global influence.  So how could a war with China break out?  Well, we talked to military experts, both in and out of uniform, and they came up with pretty much two scenarios.  One, a full-scale invasion or threatened invasion of Taiwan, or a misstep or overstep in the South China Sea.  Basically, Chinese ships bumping up against US ships and someone fires.  So we talked to those experts and found a little bit more about what each service would contribute to that kind of scenario.  So for the Navy, they're key to this entire fight.  Basically, it's a maritime operation through and through.  A lot of ships are coming into play.  Most of 7th Fleet, a good chunk or all of 3rd Fleet is going to back them up.  They're going to bring in ships from Hawaii, from Guam.  They're going to bring in aerial assets and, of course, anti-submarine and submarine warfare.  The seas between the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, all those areas are going to be just cluttered with ships.  And they're going to be doing a lot of firing from long ranges because China has its own defenses and its own Navy to counter ours.  The Navy has not seen a naval battle like this since World War II.  And we definitely have not faced a pure adversary with anything like the ships that China has in more than 70 or 80 years.  And of course alongside those ships and aboard those ships are the Marines.  And the Marines have a kind of a new role to play.  They've been doing a lot of land warfare with Iraq and Afghanistan.  With the Navy, they're kind of going back to their naval roots, as they like to say.  They're going to bring small teams.  They're going to do anti-ship movements and activities.  They're going to be providing short-range air defense, a lot of air attacks, and capabilities that provide little vantage points and leverage points for the Navy to gain access to sea lanes and coastal areas that normally they would be too far off to really do any good.  And so the Marine Corps is really going to play that role.  that rolled hopping island island much like they did in world war ii with the pacific campaign but with many less marines and much more high-tech equipment.  so for the air force this fight's a bomber fight.  i mean they need to bring in their space assets for guided accurate fire.  they need to bring in long-range bombers from the continental united states from from guam from other areas of the pacific.  they need to be bombing constantly and avoiding detection avoiding cyber and different types of operations and capabilities.  the chinese have to counter their influence counter their targeting which they, again, haven't faced against an insurgent, insurgency or terrorist groups like they have, say, in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They've not faced sophisticated systems like this at all.  And so it's going to be a different, more complex fight, but one that they can definitely overcome.  And the Army does have a role here.  In fact, some of it's behind the scenes.  They're going to play a lot of role in sea lift and airlift, running logistics around the entire Pacific theater.  It's kind of one of their main missions.  Key to that is actually what would happen should China go into Taiwan.  And it was not going to be necessarily pitched battles in the streets with, the Rangers and 82nd Airborne, more likely our experts are telling us that they're going to be doing civilian evacuation, much like they would do for parts of the Korean Peninsula should a war break out there.  They would have to get civilian populations out of there and allow the fighters, the bombers, the ships, the strike forces to really target what they need to target both in mainland China and on Taiwan should the Chinese get a foothold there.  But really their role is to take care of the civilian population and get logistics moving and also provide whatever fire support they can.  And of course, last but not least, the Special Operations Community.  Those forces always have a role to play.  It's just a bit different with this one, with the great power competition and larger scale conflict.  They're really going to be falling back to their main job historically, which is to support and train up and employ allied forces and guerrilla forces.  ways to kind of attack China's flanks in areas near, say, Vietnam or Thailand or parts of the Philippines, countering other fronts of the war, so to speak.  And, of course, targeting high-value targets, you know, basically nuclear sites or missile sites or cyber centers, things that they would just target precision strikes on, but they might need a you know, a group on the ground, a team bringing in target and bringing in fire.  So that more kind of traditional role, less going after snatch and grab jobs with bad guys like in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more high-tech target-based type work that they've done, you know, decades past.
