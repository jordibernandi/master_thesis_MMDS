I was just screaming.  I was... And you're going to give me... I'm second at two.  I don't care.  Step back, baby.  Hey, it's me.  They're screaming in that white car.  Somebody take over really quickly.  There's a white car in Oxnard facing rightbound, and they're still in the lane.  They almost got hit.  And I can hear somebody screaming.  That white sports car right there, I can hear people screaming from here.  I don't know.  We had domestic violence.  We had that, but I heard it.  I heard the tire screeching as well.  I just can't see if they're coming.  So they're not coming.  Denise Lynn is down there in the frame.  I don't know if you can see Denise Lynn.  Looks like the girlfriend or wife doesn't want to be on camera either, so.  Thank you.  Car just started.  I think that was just an accident.  Here she goes.  She's gone.  She's gone.  Well, top star of our cast.  Um... L.A.P.D.  is... not to... listen to.  I guarantee you that L.A.P.D.  is watching this live stream.  And they saw fit not to have any of these units.  investigate what's going on in here.  He's screaming at Denise.  Why are you recording me?  Why are you recording me?  We're fine. ",

So that's why I can't emphasize that enough.  So thanks so much.  Thanks for subscribing.  I know you already have.  Hit the like button and go.  give Denise Lynn some love.  She deserves it.  And that's it.  So thanks for watching.  Appreciate it.  Love all you guys.  Except that one guy. ",
