            "text": "The good news of Jesus Christ is at the very heart of the Bible.  It's at the very heart of everything we do on Truth For Life.  And so we're always glad when people come to us with a very simple question\u2014namely, what is this good news?  What is the gospel?  And in short order, we could say that the gospel is the announcement of what God, that is the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, have done in and through the Lord Jesus in order that we might come to know him and live with him and live for him.  You know, the old Scottish catechism asked the question, what is the chief end of man?  Or why are we even here?  And the answer that is given there is that we exist in order to glorify God and enjoy him forever.  Well, of course, that's a long way removed from where most of us are.  And many times when I'm in front of people, I can see in their eyes that they're essentially not buying what's being said.  This notion of Jesus on a cross just appears to them to be a sort of human tragedy.  They may even feel good about feeling bad.  They don't realize that in the cross what we're dealing with is God's key to a divine strategy\u2014that he sent his Son, Jesus, to become one of us.  And Jesus lived the life that we should live but can't, and then he died the death that we deserve to die, and he did it in our place.  He did it voluntarily.  And it is a wonder.  It's about love.  It's an immensity of God's love.  When John writes about it, he said, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son.  And so, when a person comes to terms with this, then it becomes immediately apparent that any notion of acceptance with God on the basis of my religious background or the good deeds that I've done or the ones that I'm planning to do\u2014a sort of gradient-on-the-curve approach of things, that a good God, if he exists, will reward nice people if they do their best.  All of that just comes crashing down before the historical reality of the death and resurrection of Jesus, because now we're left face to face with his claim to be the Savior.  You know, it was a Scotsman who came up with penicillin.  If Alexander Fleming had not come up with penicillin, probably somebody else would have come up with it.  But if Jesus Christ had not come, nobody else could come.  Jesus is the only Savior, because Jesus is the only one who is qualified to save.  And so when that begins to dawn on us and we realize that the New Testament is always calling for a decision on our part, is identifying as being alienated from God and calling for us to understand what it means to be reconciled to him\u2014and you may find yourself saying, well, I don't know how to do that\u2014 Well, I'm a simple soul, and I just try it like this.  First of all, A, that there's something to admit, and that is that I am in the wrong with God, that I have sinned against his law.  Goodness, if I had a lifetime, I could never repay these things.  So I admit that.  I believe, then, that Jesus has died in order that he might bear the punishment for my sins, that by his death and my trusting in his death, then the guilt that is a real guilt is relieved once and for all.  And by trusting in Jesus and the fact that he is a resurrected, that he is a risen Lord, then I can know his presence with me and his power in me.  And then I like to say to people, but don't rush into this.  think about it.  Consider these things.  Consider the implications.  It's a bit like getting married, you know.  You'll never be the same again.  And it's going to involve saying no to sin, obviously, saying no to my own selfish agendas, and saying no to secrecy.  It would be strange to fall in love with somebody and not want anyone to know.  And becoming a Christian is not some sort of mechanical transaction, some sort of mathematical formula.  It is the dramatic reality of realizing.  this is why I was even made.  And the God who made me has come and pursued me in Jesus and wants to woo me and win me for himself.  You say, well, fair enough, but then what?  Well, then simply throw yourself onto him.  Speak to him.  No special language necessary.  You can even pray a prayer along these lines.  Dear God, thank you for sending your Son to do for me what I could never do for myself.  I admit that I am sinful.  I believe that Jesus died in the place of the sinner.  I come with empty hands and with a needy heart, and I ask you to transform my life and make me the person you want me to be.  Now, If you are there at that point, then welcome, because in the simplicity of that transaction, the promise of the Bible is that whoever comes to me, I will never turn away.  You don't come on the basis of your background or your ability with the English language or whether the prayer was right or not, but with the awareness of the fact.  As John Newton put it, I know two things.  I'm a great sinner, and Jesus Christ is a great Savior.  Perhaps today, God will use even this in order to bring about that divine transaction in your life.  And if that is so, we'd love to hear from you.  We'd love to hear from you so that we could pray for you, so that we could also send to you literature that will be helpful to you, so that we can encourage you in relationship to what it would mean to be with others who are now like-minded in that way, so that you have a family, so that you have friends, so that you have support.  So thank you for the opportunity to say these things to you and do be in touch with us and be assured of our prayers.  Thank you. ",
