Why do you think that you're exempt?  Title 39, New Jersey.  Right, but until you guys are following the law, you're getting the hell off the road.  And you're not exempt, correct?  I'm sorry?  You're not exempt from the law, right?  Listen, I'm not going to sit here and say that I know 100% the legality and all that kind of stuff.  So where's your headlight?  That's not a headlight.  Huh?  The law says you have to have a headlight.  Where's your headlight?  What's your name?  Devin.  Devin, what's your last name?  And do you have a lawyer number or anything?  1408.  Okay.  Let's get the lieutenant out of here because you don't have a headlight on, and I think you should take that bike off the road.  I did an IA about the very same mission about a year ago, and I was told by the captain that you guys were ordering all new headlights and making sure everything was great.  That's why you have a bell, but you don't have a headlight.  It's not your fault.  Yeah, it's not your fault.  No, it's... I had this bike last week, and someone else used it, and the light was broken, and they took it off, and they didn't put it back on.  Right, so then you shouldn't be riding it.  I shouldn't be riding it, you're right.  It's not your fault.  Yeah, I don't know.  It was on there, but... They just issued him this bike without a light on it, like they can't really care about his safety out there?  Somebody can hit you.  He's riding it, and he gets hit by a fucking car because they don't see it.  Then the people of the city are going to have to pay for that.  Yeah, I mean, that's a serious issue.  Now, if you're taking this bike out, don't you check to see if everything is good?  Yeah, but obviously I didn't check the headlight because... I'm not going to bust your balls.  That was my issue.  Yeah, I'm not going to bust your balls.  Yeah.  That was my issue.  Just make sure you get out of there.  Yeah.  If you want, I'll go back to HQ right now.  I don't want to flush your balls.  We don't want you to get hurt out there, man.  They should have that protection for you.  I appreciate that.  Because he did address this last year and they said that they had them all for all the bikes.  And now they're issuing bikes for people unsafely.  I mean, there's videos out there where the guy didn't have a bell on and they arrested the guy.  Right.  That was in Seattle City.  Was it?  Oh, no, no.  Seaside Heights.  Oh, was it?  That was Seaside Heights, yeah.  Yes.  For your safety, too, make sure you have a headlight and shit on.  Yeah, don't let them put you out there without a light on.  Yeah, I don't want you to get hit.  Take it easy, bro.  You guys, get ready, but the paint sucks.  I'm a disabled vet, dude.  The paint sucks.  Thank you, guys.  See you, man.  What's your name and badge number?  That's Sergey Harris, 1376.  And your name and badge number?  I can't hear you.  He's got the same badge number?  No, he's 66.  Very important.  We just asked you to put your light on on your bike, officer, and you're continuing.  Well, I'm not riding right now.  Well, then you are.  You're on public property, so you still should have it on.  This is the... An area that you guys can actually get hit by now officer.  When you're riding your bike, are you except for title 39?  So you think you're exempt from riding a bicycle and having headlights on?  I followed an IA complaint.  I spoke to the captain.  about a year ago, and you said, I'm actually correct.  Subscribe to Jersey Watcher.  Okay.  So the captain was wrong?  We'll get you surprised when you talk to him about it.  The captain was wrong, but you're right.  That was the apartment.  No, it was the police officer at that time. ",
