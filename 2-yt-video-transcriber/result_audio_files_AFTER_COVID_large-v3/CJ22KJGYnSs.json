            "text": "Some people are more equal than others, but we're not all in this together.  Hi, I'm Brian Lilly, political columnist with the Toronto Sun.  How many times have you heard since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that we're all in this together?  It's the phrase that politicians, especially Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have used to explain why we need to just keep on trucking, why we need to put up with this new hardship or buckle down a little bit more, do what needs to be done to fight the pandemic.  And if it were true, that would be great.  But we've known from the beginning it's not exactly true.  Some people are more equal than others, and a trio of stories that I've written about lately show exactly that.  Let me start off with Cabinet Minister Patty Hajdu.  Now, it was reported back in the summer that she was taking a couple of flights back home to Thunder Bay from Ottawa on the private government jet while telling the rest of us to stay home.  She even tweeted about it on... Easter Sunday about the need to not go meet with family and friends while she was in Thunder Bay.  It turns out it wasn't just three flights, it was 11 flights.  Four of those were round-trip flights, so that accounts for eight, but there were three others going all the way through June at a time when the rest of us were being told not to travel.  Then there is the story of civil servants being told to stay home with pay and not work.  That's right.  Between February, March and April, a time when 2.7 million Canadians lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Well, 58,000 civil servants were told to stay home on paid leave.  Why?  They may not have had childcare because of COVID-19 and the schools being closed.  They may not have been able to connect to their corporate IT network.  But don't worry, you will still get your pay.  I've been told by civil servants since the story was published that I don't know the half of it, that there is much more, that some departments didn't even put their employees on this type of special 699 paid leave.  They just told them, go home.  Don't worry.  Don't work about it.  Now, I know that there were many civil servants working harder than ever from home to get programs out the door.  I don't dispute that.  But guess what?  A lot of those civil servants knew of the other ones not working and getting paid.  It didn't sit well with them.  Now we've got the numbers directly from the feds.  It's from 58,000 down to 8,400 by September.  Still too high.  In the meantime, those working from home?  They got all kinds of equipment bought for them.  I get it.  You may not have had a desk at your home to be able to work at.  You may need a chair, but a $600 ergonomic chair, a $1,300 stand sit desk, a 209 left-handed ergonomic mouse.  I can find an ergonomic left-handed mouse starting from $24.99 up to $124.99, but there's no way it needs to be $209.  There's no way that the departments needed to be spending as much as they were.  But this is the way government buys things.  They waste money.  They don't look for value for money.  They just get the money out the door as fast as possible.  Back in the middle of the pandemic, the federal government offered workers either to deliver this equipment to their homes for free or to give them a $500 credit to buy the equipment they needed.  I really hope an awful lot more took up the government's offer on the $500 credit because what I saw in the documents released to Parliament last week, that was the much cheaper option.  Bottom line, we're not all in this together.  We're not all being treated the same.  And if you're a federal government worker, you live by different rules than the rest of us who saw job losses or hours cut or pay reductions in the middle of the pandemic.  And it's about to happen all over again as the lockdowns continue rolling out across Canada.  Let us know what you think of these stories.
