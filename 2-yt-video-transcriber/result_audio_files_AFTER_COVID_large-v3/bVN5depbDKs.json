            "text": "In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.  I want to speak for a few minutes about a religious order of sisters that has worked tirelessly in our nation for about 150 years in providing an apostolate to the elderly.  especially the poor among the elderly.  We know them as the Little Sisters of the Poor.  They were founded about 180 years ago or so in France.  It all began with their founder who looked outside her window one day and saw a poor elderly woman who was blind struggling to stay warm.  And she brought this poor blind elderly woman into her home and cared for her.  And was resolved thereafter to commit the rest of her life to an apostolate of serving the elderly, especially the poor or those who had no one else to care for them.  Other women joined her in this effort and soon became recognized and established as a religious order.  And they continue that apostolate to the elderly, especially from among the poor, to the present day.  And they have a number of institutions for the elderly, nursing homes and elder care facilities across this nation.  They are sisters that you will never find out of habit.  They are sisters that you will never find at the shopping malls.  These devout sisters remain in their care facilities caring for those among whom need it the most, the sick, the suffering elderly, and those who are dying.  And you'd think our nation would be grateful for what they do.  I imagine some of you have had a direct experience of the Little Sisters of the Poor, perhaps caring for an elderly parent or grandparent or other family member.  I remember back some 35 years or so.  in my own experience of the Little Sisters of the Poor, it was at a time when an elderly priest, who actually may be known to some of you by name, was sick and dying and in their care here locally.  And three of us who were seminarians would rotate through every day to assist him with Holy Mass in his small private room in the Little Sisters of the Poor care facility.  I saw every time I went there the loving care that the sisters gave to all of the elderly entrusted to their care and specifically to this wonderful Monsignor.  By the way, this priest was blind, but he had memorized from having offered the Tridentine Mass for so many decades, a particular Tridentine Mass.  And he would do completely from memory the Tridentine Mass each day with one of us assisting him.  And in fact, in the final weeks of his life, he was so debilitated and weak that we would have to put him on oxygen for a while to get his strength up to put on his vestments and offer that Mass.  Oh, and then after Mass, about once a week, he would have us read to him his mail, which every week included a dozen or so solicitations for various charities.  and mission work.  And as poor as he was, he would always have us filling out checks to send and give to all of these charities.  What a beautiful witness of a priest.  But at any rate, I mention that because I was so touched at the time by the care that the Little Sisters give to the elderly.  But an element of our nation went to war against the Little Sisters of the Poor, bullied them, and for years, ever since the Obamacare, as it's often called, was inflicted upon this nation with its various mandates and draconian rules, an element of our federal government has been at war with the Little Sisters of the Poor, attempting to force them to provide insurance coverage for abortifacients and contraceptives.  I mean, think of the irony in this.  These religious women who take vows of chastity and see themselves as wed to Christ being forced by a bully government to provide abortifacients and contraceptives as part of medical care to any employees they may have who are not specifically religious sisters.  Three years ago, the President of our United States, President Donald Trump, came to their rescue.  And the rescue of other religious and faith-based organizations which objected to the mandate in Obamacare that an employer must provide abortifacients and contraceptives to all employees who desired it.  President Trump issued an executive order that included a moral clause that any employer who objected morally was not bound by the mandate to provide these.  He went to bat specifically, explicitly and publicly for the Little Sisters of the Poor in particular and other individuals, employers and organizations as well.  But of course we know how things go and lawsuits were filed in spite of the executive order against the Little Sisters.  In particular, the state of Pennsylvania was trying to force the Sisters to comply contrary to their conscience.  And in fact, the Sisters estimate that it would have cost them $70 million a year in fines if they did not comply.  Imagine that, the state of Pennsylvania and the elements of the federal government would rather destroy this apostolate to the elderly than simply to allow it to exist and leave it unmolested.  So the case went to the Supreme Court, and this past week the Supreme Court got it right.  They don't always get it right, but this time they did.  And they ruled that the executive order issued three years ago by President Trump was just, it was constitutional, it was legal, and it was binding.  And thank you, President Trump, for what you have done for the Little Sisters of the Poor and for so many others to be a champion on this and other matters.  And even two of the very progressive justices on the Supreme Court sided with the majority.  on this matter.  That's how strongly the Supreme Court ruled in this matter.  You would think that Catholics would be very happy about this SCOTUS decision.  And many are.  Good Catholics are.  But not all Catholics.  One in particular who is issuing public statements from his basement, quickly and publicly stated that if he is elected President of the United States, he will ensure by executive order or by whatever means that this is undermined or overthrown or bypassed or whatever strategy he might employ, he will ensure that if he is president, that the Little Sisters of the Poor, among others, will provide abortifacients and contraceptives to any employers who deserve it.  You might have heard his name.  It's Joe Biden.  And apparently he intends to seek election as the next President of the United States.  He publicly identifies himself as a Catholic, and I'll say this, I doubt he would ever come here to Mass, and certainly would probably not come to the Tridentine Mass, but were he to do so, I would refuse him Holy Communion, above all for his position in favor of abortion.  At any rate, Joe Biden, when he was vice president, was a part of the Obamacare, which first drove over the rights, the constitutional rights, and the consciences of so many individuals and organizations such as the Little Sisters of the Poor.  Drove them over with the government bus.  comply or be destroyed.  Drove him over years ago.  And now he's saying that if he's elected president, he'll back that government bus up again because the first time didn't destroy them and he'll run them over again.  Make sure they're roadkill this time.  obliterate their apostolate.  You know, quite frankly, at his age and stage in life and circumstances, he should first of all be trying to get himself right with God, and secondly, should get himself right with the little sisters of the poor who care for the elderly.  Lord knows he might need their services soon enough, although I don't think he qualifies as poor, except maybe spiritually.  At any rate, elections have consequences.  Elections have consequences, we've heard that, for good or for bad.  And he's telling us what he will do if he is elected.  If he's elected, he'll be true to his word, He'll go after the little sisters of the poor, and soon enough he'll be coming after us as well.  But you know, public statements should have consequences as well.  Public platforms and public actions should have consequences.  And so should his.  He's telling us quite explicitly, quite clearly, Resolutely, right now, if I am elected, this is what I'm going to do.  Do we want a president who goes to war against the government when it's unjust?  Or do we want a president who goes to war against little nuns, little sisters, of the poor.  Elections have consequences.  I want to conclude with a prayer that was written for the United States of America by our friend Archbishop Viggenom.  It is a prayer during a time in which a nation is preparing to cast its votes for its civic leaders for its president.  This prayer speaks directly to the situation I've just described, the oppression of the little sisters of the poor, and so much more.  We'll make this prayer available to you.  We even have some copies today in our little religious bookstore if you want to stop by afterward.  will continue to make them available throughout this season in which we prepare for an election.  We're grateful to Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 for his concern for our nation and for this beautiful prayer.  Almighty and eternal God, King of kings and Lord of lords, graciously turn your gaze to us who invoke you with confidence.  Bless us, citizens of the United States of America, Grant peace and prosperity to our nation.  Illuminate those who govern us so that they may commit themselves to the common good in respect for your holy law.  Protect those who, defending the inviolable principles of the natural law and your commandments, must face the repeated assaults of the enemy of the human race.  Keep in the hearts of your children courage for the truth love for virtue, and perseverance in the midst of trials.  Make our families grow in the example that our Lord has given us, together with His Most Holy Mother and Saint Joseph in the home of Nazareth.  Give to our fathers and mothers the gift of strength to educate wisely the children with which you have blessed them.  Give courage to those who, in spiritual combat, Fight the good fight as soldiers of Christ against the furious forces of the children of darkness.  Keep each one of us, O Lord, in your most sacred heart.  And above all, him who your providence has placed at the head of our nation.  Bless the President of the United States of America so that aware of his responsibilities and his duties, he may be a knight of justice, a defender of the oppressed, a firm bulwark against your enemies, and a proud supporter of the children of light.  Place the United States of America and the whole world under the mantle of the Queen of Victories, our unconquered leader in battle, the Immaculate Conception.  It is thanks to her, and through your mercy, that the hymn of praise rises to you, O Lord, from the children whom you have redeemed in the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Thank you. ",
