Both these channels links are in the description.  Let's get into the video.  So this is car number 72.  Well, you pulled around pretty quick.  What's up?  Nothing much.  You filming the lot?  Is there anything I can see in public?  What is that?  Any reason?  Can you step back six feet, please?  Oh, COVID?  Do you have a mask?  Yeah, I do.  Do you have one?  No, I don't need one.  It's your policy, not mine.  What's going on with you guys?  Why are you filming us?  Is there a problem with that?  No, why are you filming the lot?  Is there a problem with that?  Is that illegal?  No.  I'm sorry?  I'm sorry? ",
