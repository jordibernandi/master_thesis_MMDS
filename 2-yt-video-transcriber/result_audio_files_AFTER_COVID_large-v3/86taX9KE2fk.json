            "text": "Good evening, people.  Watch on the 65.  Lisa Boyce, I'm going to give you the gospel.  It's in 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  Christ filled his blood for our past and present and future sins.  He was buried and rose again on the third day, according to Scripture.  We're saved by grace through faith in Christ alone.  Not of ourselves, not of works, least any man should boast.  It is grace that God gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believed In him will not perish but have eternal life.  We don't come to Christ no other way but believing in what he already did for us at the cross.  We don't come to him saying, Lord, look at what I've done.  Lord, look at me.  We don't go to him like that.  We go to him believing.  He's already taken care of.  You're free in Christ.  There's freedom in the Lord.  Once you know that he's taken care of your sins... And that is grace through faith and not of yourself and not of works.  There's freedom.  You will never lose your salvation.  And God will never take it away from you.  If you believe in your heart that Christ rose again for your sins, then you're saved.  Simple as that.  I want to tell you what's happened to me.  The Holy Spirit showed me this.  The people, and I can't describe, I don't know how to describe this.  We've stepped into another realm before the rapture.  I can't describe it.  I was looking at The news articles on various avenues and I'm like something has snapped.  Not only in the political but in the spiritual realm.  I just feel in my heart of hearts that something is about to happen.  I've been saying this now for a while and I'm saying it now again.  Something, I don't know when, but something is about to happen.  That entire White House is back on Trump right now.  All of them.  Except maybe one or two.  People are resigning from his campaign left and right.  And that's... Probably the way it was.  Now, someone asked me earlier tonight, do I think that God is done with Trump?  God might not be done with Trump.  But the geopolitical is done with Trump.  This fiasco yesterday at the Capitol.  They're blaming him for it.  And... You know, I mean, there was four deaths.  But I find it very hypocritical.  They blame him for this.  But all these eight months that Black Lives Matter and Antifa was out there in the streets rioting and making people's lives a living hell and burning down people's businesses, no one said a word.  There was not one word.  He wanted to bring in the National Guard, but they told him no.  No.  But now all of a sudden, when they overcrowd the Capitol building, it's condemned.  This is what the political spectrum is starting to look like.  Especially, and I'm going to tell you something, it's not Joe Biden.  It's not Sleepy Joe that you have to worry about.  It's Marxist Kamala.  That's who's going to take over.  But nevertheless, like I said, we're going to be gone.  I do believe shortly.  Zach, my younger son, had a very interesting dream.  He just told me about this dream.  He said he dreamed, and he said it was because of all the games that he was playing with the, looking at the northern lights.  But he said he dreamed.  there was millions of northern lights in the sky.  I don't know what that means, but that's what he dreamed about.  He said there were different colors.  And I'm like, wow.  And of course, they don't want to hear what I think of it.  But, you know, I put a spiritual thing on everything.  And I do.  But folks, the time is short.  The time is at hand.  The time is at hand.  I'm going to give you this article off of End Times Headlines.  But yeah, we have definitely stepped into another realm.  on this earth before we're going to be taken out of here.  And... I'm just saying.  But this is the Palestinian Authority warns that Israel is planning, listen to this, to build a holy temple.  Mahmoud Habash, an advisor to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Habash on religious and Islamic affairs, is claiming that Israel is calling for the demolition of the Dome of the Rock Mosque that currently sits on the Temple Mount and will be replaced by a temple to be built.  Now, let me get something straight.  We don't have to be here for the temple to be built.  The rapture can take place anywhere.  And they do this later.  We don't have to be here for that.  Some people are saying, oh, but the rock, the temple has to be built before the rapture.  No, it don't.  No, it don't.  Not at all.  Nothing has to take place before the rapture.  Matter of fact, the rapture is going to happen at any time.  It says, according to a report by Israel National News, the Palestinian Authority official news agency reported that Jewish organizations that support the construction of a holy temple on the Temple Mount have asked the Israeli government to submit a proposal to the Islamic Endowments Department in Jerusalem and the Jordanian government to demolish the Dome of the Rock and to build the temple in its place.  This is huge.  Habash said in a statement that the settlers who made these calls enjoyed broad support from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Habash is warning not to ignore these calls and that they must be responded to strongly by the Arabs, Muslims, and the entire world.  Consequently, in the future, it appears that a future temple will indeed be built in Israel.  According to the book of Revelation chapter 11, John the Revelator wrote, Then I was given a reed, like a measuring rod, and the angel stood saying, Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar and those who worship there.  Believe out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two  months.\".  and I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy 1,260 days.  Clothed in sackcloth.  That's three and a half years.  Once again, we are seeing more headlines that are paving the way for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.  This is the time of the end right now.  This is it.  It's not a matter of if, but when this coming temple in Israel will be built in Jerusalem.  This is huge news.  And we are getting ready to leave.  Like I said, we don't have to be here for this to happen.  Not at all.  And it won't take long for him to build it.  I will leave this in a description box and let me just give you a glimpse of other news that's on the pike right now.  Let me just give you a glimpse of it because it's not good.  We know that the Twitter accounts on, well, Twitter account of President Trump has been locked in.  Facebook has totally blocked him out indefinitely from what I understand.  I think Twitter is going to do the same thing.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I put some stuff on my blog.  So if you go to my about page on my channel, You can click on the blog from there.  And I put a lot of articles up there right now.  It says... Let me see.  Listen to this.  Iraq court orders the arrest of Donald Trump over drone strike against Iranian general.  I'll put that in the description box too.  Um... Republicans are considering drastic measures to stop Donald Trump.  Could invoke 25th Amendment.  You know?  Sorry about that.  It is what it is.  It is what it is.  But we know now, with all this is going on, that this is the end of this nation.  I don't mean to be negative about it, but it's true.  I'm actually being positive about it because as Christians, we need to look up and rejoice because we're on our way out of here.  We don't have to be here for this.  Have faith.  We're on our way out of here.  Because everything now, like I said earlier, is welcome to the jungle.  The Antichrist spirit is already here.  All that's needed now is for him to show up and bring order out of chaos.  And that's exactly what he's going to do.  And people are going to worship him.  So, anything else comes up, I will be back with it.  But right now, I'm going to leave that Israel article in the description box, and I'm going to leave the other article.  Like I said, I got articles that I put in the blog.  So if you go to my About page on this channel, you will see the blog there.  In the meantime, have a nice evening, guys.  Thank you.  And thank you for your support.  Have a nice evening. ",
