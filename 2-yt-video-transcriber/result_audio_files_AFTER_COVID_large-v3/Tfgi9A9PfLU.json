A detective turns over a picture of a guy inside Shinola, and he's like, so that's not you?  I look.  I said, no, that's not me.  He turns another paper over.  He said, I guess that's not you either.  I picked that paper up and hold it next to my face.  And I said, this is not me.  I was like, I hope y'all don't think all black people look alike.  And then he says, the computer says it's you.  Your nose is red and your lips is red.  Say ah.  You got a tooth coming in.  Yeah, you do.  Your tooth tastes like pineapples.  At that time, no.  I didn't know that they used any type of facial recognition or anything like that until talking with the detectives who showed me that that's what they used to apprehend me, if that's the right word.  In the morning, everybody gets dressed, everybody gets ready.  Lissa leaves and takes Rosie to my mother-in-law's.  And then I dropped Juju off to school.  It's just a boring Thursday, right?  We're on the phone with Lissa around four.  So then my line clicks.  I click over.  I'm like, hello?  The guy's talking like he knows me.  He's Robert.  And I'm like, who is this?  You need to come down and turn yourself in.  Who is this?  The officer's somebody from the third precinct, and I need to turn myself in for what?  So he's like, I can't tell you that.  I'm like, then I can't come down.  Well, if you come down, it'll be much easier on you.  You don't want us to come out to your job, do you?  At this point, I think it's a prank call.  So I'm like, look, man, if you want me to come get me, I'll be at home.  Bring a warrant, and I hang up on him. ",

I taste like pineapple.  Hey, Julia.  Julia, do you know why Daddy got arrested?  Because I looked up on the computer.  Remember that when we was outside?
