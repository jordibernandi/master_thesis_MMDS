            "text": "This is Deron Chavis here at Fifth District Mini Farm.  I'm gonna show you a technique we use to mitigate weeds in the garden.  I know a lot of us grow things and one of the biggest challenges that we deal with in terms of time is picking grass and other misplaced plants from around the crops that we're trying to grow.  So what we're gonna do is show you one of the ways that we can address this.  So here we have our tools for addressing the weed pressure.  First of all, I have a can of Burnzomatic with the Burnzomatic torch on it.  And then I have a used can that I've cut open on both sides in order to make my circles really crisp.  And then I have geotextile fabric.  This probably will work with any type of weed barrier fabric that you might get at a Lowe's.  The geotextile fabric is good because it lasts long.  We don't have to buy this every season.  It lasts for a couple years.  You can roll it up at the end of the season and reuse it in other places also.  It has these really nice lines.  so that you can make sure you keep your rows straight if you're into that type of thing.  Light your torch and then you're gonna place your can where you want to have the hole at and then you're gonna just gently Place your can and flame into the inside of the can.  You don't have to stick it all the way in there, because this lack of air will cut the flame off.  And then, voila.  What you wanna do?  after you heat it, you're gonna wanna take some sort of fabric or something like that, because the can's gonna be hot, and then you're gonna move it to the next place that you wanna put it, and then repeat.  And as you can see, we just plant the transplant directly into the hole and it allows for minimal space for weeds to sprout out.  And if you have to do any weeding, you'll be doing weeding at the base of the plant, like here.  Less time in when it comes to weeding, saving you a lot of time when it comes to growing your crops or whatever it is that you're trying to plant.  In your garden.  So boom, that's that weed suppression at 5th District Mini Farm. ",
