            "text": "Twisha Christian, I want to do an update on Zion Oil and Gas.  I know a lot of people are wondering, you know, kind of what's going on.  So I have an update for that.  And I also want to talk about Kim Clement's prophecy concerning the dinar and the 20,000 Dow and also the debt.  So let's get right into it.  All right.  So Zion Oil and Gas, they've been doing pretty, pretty well considering that they don't have any revenue yet.  Coming in and it's been pretty steady.  It's been between 27 cents and 34 cents over the last month.  And so they've been pretty steady and I think they've really seen a lot of protection.  All right, so I'll just leave it at that.  I believe that they're in a way that they've been protected from their stock going down so much.  But time is close.  So, but I'm going to go ahead and go over what is actually going on and why they haven't made any announcements.  So I listened to the last two podcasts and I listened to the stockholders meeting.  And so basically what has happened?  because Israel has closed their ports and their borders, they were unable to get their crew down there and get the rig down there in time.  So they've had to wait and they don't want to send the rig over right now because then we're going to have to pay extra fees, you know, because the rig is just going to be sitting around.  They're going to have to.  there's going to be extra costs involved.  And not only that, they're the rig crew has to be in a 14 day quarantine.  So what they're trying to do is, is that when the borders do open up and the ports and everything, what they're going to do is which is coming.  that day is coming on July 1st.  Hopefully, right.  Hopefully there's no more closures or anything like that or they decided to stay closed down.  So what they're trying to do is, is that they're trying to when the crew gets out of their 14 day quarantine and the rig is arriving around the same time as they're getting out of quarantine.  So that is what is going on.  So it's there's nothing that they could have done before to get that rig down there before everything closed up.  So we just have to wait a little bit more.  There's just a little bit more time that we have to wait.  So the date that was given that everything is supposed to kind of start opening back up was July the 1st.  Now, of course, they'll have to coordinate, like I said, their crew with sending the rig over if there's no other delays coming from the government of Israel.  So with the price being where it's at right now, it's very possible that it could go down some.  It can go down a lot, which still will give you an opportunity to get in.  And it may not.  It's been pretty steady.  It's been pretty steady over the last month during all the turmoil, the stock market's going up and down.  So if there is any type of economic crash, I don't know how that's going to affect Zion oil.  I know it's going to affect a lot of American stocks, but as far as Zion oil, that just remains to be seen.  So basically that's what's going on.  We just have to wait.  I think they have until like September 8th or 16th or something like that to get their price above a dollar for a consecutive 10 days.  I believe that it could happen.  As the news, as they bring out the news as far as them shipping out the oil rig and their crew down there coming out of quarantine.  I can see some of that good news actually kind of boosting the price.  And that just remains to be seen.  Alright, so I have faith.  I believe in the company.  I believe in the company, especially in the long term.  And that's one of the things that we need to do is make sure we're learning how to trade because you will with any stock, the stock goes up and the stock goes down.  So you need to learn how to trade to buy and sell and buy at the right times.  And one of the other things I'm looking for as far as long term is that, you know, hopefully they'll start paying dividends on the stocks too as well.  Okay, now I want to get back into what Kim Clement said about the 20,000.  There was a lot of comments that were made when I discussed that.  And just to be clear on certain things, and you have to read what's above and below what Kim Clement is saying.  Just like when you read the prophecy, sometimes when it comes to prophecy, you could read the first two or three sentences, and then there's a paragraph, and it's actually switching to a whole other subject.  In this next week, this man shall begin to emerge, and in the following two weeks, which is a three-week period, he shall slowly come to the fore, for they are saying, how do we kill the giant?  How do we kill the giant of debt?  How do we kill the giant of socialism?  How do we kill the giant of human secularism?  I have placed that man among you, a humble man.  And as Samuel stood before the brothers, and they had rejected David to come because of his age, take all these little remarks I'm giving you.  They are gems.  The name and the word gold.  Remember that.  A man among them, amongst them, but is young.  And God says... These that shall reject him shall be mocked in how he takes the giant down.  Now hear me please.  The giant of debt, giants that have come, the brothers of Goliath, stand in glee watching America.  We will cripple you.  You will lose your credit.  But God said, Watch, I said twenty thousand.  Look not to Wall Street, however, observe, and they shall say, What is your plan for this giant?  And he will take a simple stone, remember the name, and he will hold it up, and they will laugh at him.  But the plan is so brilliant, says the Lord.  It can only it could have only have been given by me.  OK, so in this he's talking about, you know, the giant of debt.  Right.  It says, but God said, watch, I said twenty thousand.  Now, Kim Clement said he tied twenty thousand to the dinar.  Right.  So we're looking for a revaluation at twenty thousand.  When he says that, he says, look not to Wall Street, however, observe and they shall say, what is your plan for this giant?  And he will take a simple stone and he will hold it up and they will laugh at him.  But the plan is so brilliant.  OK, so the revaluation of the dinar is not going to wipe out the debt.  This is what he's saying.  OK, we said twenty thousand the dinar, but he says here.  look not to wall street.  however observe and they shall say what is your plan for this giant?  and he's talking about the giant of debt and these some of these other giants.  all right so we are not to look at the dinar evaluation to deal with the debt of this country and the deal with the world debt.  okay he says look not to wall street.  however observe what is your plan for the giant.  So you're not going to look at Wall Street.  You're not going to look at the Dow to wipe out this debt.  Right.  And the simple stone and all this stuff and about that, there's there's other Kim Clement prophecies that deal with this new energy source that's actually going to wipe out the debt.  Now, it's not to say that either gold or.  the dinar will wipe out some other debt but by the time we get to that point our country's 25 trillion dollars in debt the world is probably at 350 dir 250 trillion 255 trillion.  who knows where this with with the debt is right now at this moment?  but we're not looking for Wall Street to take care of the debt.  so we're not looking even though the Dow hits 20,000 the dinar revaluation.  that is not going to take out all the debt.  It's going to be a simple stone and that simple stone from what I've read from Kim Clement's prophecies.  This deals with our new energy source.  So I just wanted to.  I just wanted to clear that up because there's been a lot of comments about the 20,000 in the dinar.  And, you know, some people are saying that the dinar is going to wipe out the debt.  and it's and it's not, according to what Kim Clement has been saying.  It's going to be this new energy source and I've put that on my channel multiple times.  One of the other things I wanted to bring up about Zion Oil and just any stock trading.  And one of the things that I've learned, I just realized not that long ago, several weeks ago, that you can actually start trading on Webull at 3 a.m.  Central Standard Time.  So I did not know that.  So the whole time that I've been using Webull, I did not know that you can actually start trading that early in the morning.  Because I would notice like some of the stocks that I have that either they, you know, at the end of the day, you know, before I go to bed, I'll check, maybe check the pricing and see where I'm at.  And then when I get up before the markets open, I noticed there was a lot of changes.  It's like, well, I'm up at 7 a.m How's this changing?  So I didn't realize until I started digging and doing more research that Webull actually starts trading.  And I don't know any other apps as far as that trade that early in the morning.  But I guess it's a really big advantage for those of you who are trading penny stocks or you're just trading stocks in general to where you might actually be able to buy in a dip that early in the morning.  And then when the stock markets do go up, you know, rise as the as the regular trading hours are open.  so just so you guys know that link is down below in the description.  you can get two free stocks but you do have to deposit a hundred dollars in order to get those and then it takes a week for those stocks to process and show up on your on your overall portfolio And then you could take them, you could sell them and buy other stocks and that's what I do.  So if you guys want to get ahead of the game because when Zion Oil does start to take off, a lot of you are going to be missing opportunities to trade that early.  You guys are going to be missing opportunities to trade because the markets really do open through Webull that early in the morning.  So that link is down below in the description.  I'd like to thank you guys for your support on the Patreon.  We are moving forward on the Gregoria Legends project.  We have some animation going.  We have some professional writers going.  Everything that you guys do for the Twisted Christian channel, when you guys do sign up for the Patreon, you guys are supporting this project.  Overall, it's a biblical project.  It's a little edgy, but we're out there to promote the truth.  and put out god's word and we're doing it in a japanese animation form to reach all those who all those young people all over the world.  and this is just one of the projects.  and if you don't know these projects come mainly from genesis 6. they come from legends.  they come from other writings that are in the Bible and books that used to be in the Bible for over a thousand years.  And so we're putting together all these different stories and we have our main story that deals with Genesis 6.  So you guys go to the Grigori Patreon.  You can check it out.  I appreciate all you guys support with that.  That really helps out the project a lot.  So with that being said, stay encouraged.  Things are tough out there.  there's a lot of uncertainty out there and we have there's a lot of things that are pushing this denar revaluation.  it's gonna happen.  I still think that they're still gonna be a few other things that we still have to see before it actually happens.  I know that the president United States is doing everything he can to try to keep the markets going try to keep the market strong but at some point You will see some type of market crash.  And it's just all part of the plan to try to get him out of office.  We still have, there's been a lot of arrests, especially in that one particular industry with the trafficking.  And we're seeing some things.  We were seeing some things between the president and social media, and I've talked about a blackout, and I think that's coming.  I mean, it's just brewing.  If you guys know what's going on with Twitter and Facebook and the president of the United States, and now these advertisers are getting involved, that this blackout, when it does come, It's going to change everything because they are continually threatening, you know, banning him.  You know, they want him banned.  They don't want him speaking anymore.  So you're seeing this, these war of words going on in the media and on social media.  I'm still looking for that to happen too as well.  We don't know how that's going to affect.  There's a lot of things that can affect the stock market.  If they start doing arrests because of the whole Epstein thing and they start bringing all these people down, you already know that they're going after a prince and that's unheard of.  There's a lot of things that can happen that can contribute to And I see these things coming to a head, coming to a point.  And when all that happens, you're going to see the financial system change.  So, yes, we are close.  We're not there yet.  In my opinion, you know, that all remains to be seen.  So I thank you guys for listening.  Thank you for your support.  God bless.  Twisted Christian out. ",
