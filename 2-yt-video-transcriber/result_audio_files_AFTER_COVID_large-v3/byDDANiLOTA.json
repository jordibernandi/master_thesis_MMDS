Joining us now, very, very honored and happy to have him, is Professor Noam Chomsky.  who has been a public intellectual, linguist, activist for decades, and is author of, of course, many books, including Manufacturing Consent, co-author of that book, big influence on me and this show.  Most recently, he's author of Internationalism or Extinction, Universalizing Resistance.  Professor Chomsky, thank you so much for being here. ",

What are your thoughts as you look at these movements happening? ",

            "text": "Well, the first thing that comes to mind is the absolutely unprecedented scope, scale of participation, engagement, and public support.  And if you take a look at polls, it's astonishing.  The public support, both for Black Lives Matter and for the protest, is well beyond what it was say, for Martin Luther King at the peak of his popularity at the time of the I Have a Dream speech.  It's way beyond that.  And that's also far beyond the level of reaction to earlier events.  There were public reactions, strong ones, to many earlier police killings, but nothing like this.  Maybe the most similar was the reaction to the beating of Rodney King, beat him almost to death, after the attackers were freed in the courts without charge.  There was a week of protests, 60 people were killed, had to call in federal troops to quell the protests.  But it was in Los Angeles where it happened.  Something else where nothing like this.  No, it's everywhere.  And it's not just the police killing.  It's background issues.  So it's beginning to move into concern and inquiries and protests about the facts that lead to events like this occurring.  Shows an enormous rise in consciousness elated, but a rising consciousness, about 400 years of vicious repression, unremitting, leaving a very bitter legacy, deep issue of the whole socioeconomic and cultural order.  I actually think the recognition of that willingness to act on it is without any precedent that I know of. ",

            "text": "I think it's the result of many years of intensive activism.  We see it in many other ways.  So, for example, years ago, the New York Times ran an important series, highlighted an important series, 1619, on the history of racism in the United States, 1619, because that was the year when black slaves began coming.  Substantial numbers scattered cases before, but it was from 1619.  You couldn't have imagined that a few years ago.  And that's one of many signs of what I hope are really significant changes that seem to be in the way that you attribute to the groups like Black Lives Matter, others who have been bringing these issues to public attention, making people think about them, learning what happened, the reaction right now, say, to Trump's Tulsa appearance, bringing up the hideous record of that.  That's quite important.  When you go back to, say, Ronald Reagan, when he opened his campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, which is known for owning one thing, the murder of three civil rights workers, the message was pretty plain, but there was very little reaction.

It's very hard to get a grasp on something like this in terms of various types of reporting, misinformation, and so on.  So we need to approach it gingerly.

The autonomous zone is an interesting case of this.  Also striking to see the support.  The mayor of Seattle supports, apparently plenty of popular support, I mean, it's driving Trump and Fox News insane, but that's a positive sign.  Something important has happened.  Again, what it'll lead to, you never know.  But I think it's an important manifestation of the sense that we've got to take our lives under control, that we can't leave them in the hands of the authorities who declare themselves our masters.  We have to take charge. ",

            "text": "Success and failure are complicated things.  Any serious struggle is going to have moments of regression.  Things don't work out the way you expect.  So you pick up, you go on from there.  Anyone you can think of, civil rights, women's movement, abolition, all of them, it's a process.  So take, say, the Sanders campaign.  A lot of young people, I get letters all the time, see things posted, say, we tried, we lost, it's over, I'm getting out.  It's not what happened.  What happened was a tremendous success.  unparalleled success.  Nothing like this has happened in US political history, actually almost ever since the real populist movement, the radical farmers movement was crushed by force.  Here's the spectrum of discussion has been substantially shifted.  Things that were not on the agenda not long ago are front and center.  universal health care, coal amplified by the pandemic disaster, Green New Deal, the result of serious activism by a small group of young people who occupied congressional offices.  In the background was the Sanders success, young members of Congress who swept into power, able to support them.  Now that's on the agenda, issue after issue.  Sanders has made but I think he's correct, to join the Biden campaign and push it to the left.  His associates are working on planning commissions.  And in fact, if you look at the program that's emerged, it's farther to the left than anything since FDR offers lots of opportunities.  Now, this didn't happen by magic.  It happens kind of like the Green New Deal.  by constant pressure and activism.  That's the way the left ought to conceive of elections.  Pushing the button is not the issue.  It's the constant activism that is reshaping the array of choices, issues, and policies.  And you don't win by snapping your fingers.  Some things work, some things fail, then you pick up and you go on from there.  And I think we've seen significant changes over the years. ",
