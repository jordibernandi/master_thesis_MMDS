The woman's right to have a child outweighs him not wanting to have a child, which is an insane thing to think that our court system went through and said that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  all right everybody welcome back to the channel.  uh today i have a fun story to go over here.  um this story has been covered by multiple news outlets uh all across the country.  but i chose the daily wire article only because it was the only one that had a few extra little details in there that they decided to leave out of all the other articles.  and it just so happens that those couple little details are kind of uh negative towards the woman.  so it would just.  I found that interesting.  it does.  those two little things were left out but let's give you an idea here.  so it's ex-husband wins in court prevents wife from using frozen embryos and it starts out with.  a woman in Arizona has been barred from using frozen embryos she produced with her ex-husband to get pregnant.  Basically, the background of the story here is these two are dating.  She has cancer.  She's about to go through an aggressive form of chemotherapy.  And they recommend her to, you know, free some embryos, I guess, ahead of time.  My brother just dealt with this whenever he had cancer.  They said, do you want to, you know, store a little bit of your sperm?  And my brother was kind of reluctant against it.  And I said, bro, I was like, for the cost of what you're going to pay for, you might as well do it, right?  Um, they actually did like in, like they, they put the sperm, they took the guy's sperm and they, they, they fertilize these eggs, right?  So these are not just eggs or whatever that she's got frozen.  She actually has fertilized eggs, embryos, whatever frozen, ready to rock and roll.  She goes through and gets all her cancer treatment done.  They end up getting married.  Actually, days after they did this whole egg thing, they go and they get married.  They're married for, I don't know, three years, four years, something like that, typical.  And boom, they're getting a divorce.  So these two are now divorced.  They're done.  The woman is unable to produce eggs any longer due to her chemotherapy treatment.  So that sucks.  I'm sorry.  That definitely sucks.  But... Apparently the contract that these two signed together said if one of us does not want to use these eggs again, then none of us can.  So they have to agree together to use the eggs or else they get donated.  And basically what's going on is the woman wants to use the eggs, the guy doesn't.  Of course, right?  Okay, so it gets into a little bit here.  The couple married four days after signing the contract.  Terrell filed for divorce three years later.  Terrell is the man.  Torres still wants to be a mother, but she couldn't due to the chemotherapy.  Sucks.  She wanted to use the embryos that had been created with Terrell, but... That would have been required him to become a father against his will and make him financially responsible for a child with his ex-wife.  So in the state of Arizona, they did update these laws, I believe it was in like 2018, so that it does give the woman the right to use her embryos against the guy's will.  So basically, the courts can force you to birth the child with your DNA that you did not want against your will.  these newer cases now they can't hold you financially responsible for it.  so they can say look yes she has the right to use the eggs but you don't have to pay any money for the kid but it's still your kid which is kind of messed up like there is still a child with your DNA running through its veins running around and you're supposed to just ignore that.  so it's still a little bit of a shady deal towards men on that.  but at least they don't try to go after him financially since their contract that didn't go retroactive that law.  So with their contract, he would be financially responsible.  for payments for this child that she chooses to have with a new man.  She's getting remarried.  So he would still be, no matter what, even if she said, because she even says in here, the new husband guy will adopt a kid.  It won't even have to be your kid.  We don't even want any money from you.  We don't want it.  And the court said, like we just talked about in this video the other day about the men's rights issues in the family courts, the court said, it doesn't matter.  It does not matter if you have that child and it has his DNA in it.  He will be financially responsible for 18 years of payments to that child.  And we will take that money and we will process it and we will give it to you so that we can keep feeding our little machine here in City Hall and all these little people can keep getting money from the government for processing all these child support payments, right?  So shady, shady, shady, shady.  The crazy part about it is here is that this woman basically hoodwinked this guy into fertilizing these eggs in the first place, which is something that every other news outlet kept out.  So it says on here, The Daily Wire previously reported that a lower court in Arizona ruled that the woman's desire to become pregnant outweighed the man's desire not to become a father.  It was also reported that Terrell only agreed to donate his sperm initially because Torres said she would use an ex-boyfriend's sperm instead of his when he initially refused.  So you're... What a red flag there, Terrell.  What a red flag you should have seen popping straight up in front of you.  Like, if you don't... I'm going through these cancer treatments, and if you, my boyfriend, who I'm not even married to you yet, if you do not fertilize my eggs and I'm about to freeze, then I'm gonna go let my ex-boyfriend do it.  Like... And you still married this woman?  Like, that's an insane concept to think that she just threw right out there in front of you that if you don't impregnate my eggs, I don't give a shit.  I got somebody else who'll do it.  I got this guy who's still hanging around.  He'll gladly give me a jar of it.  A jar of the batter.  The contract signed by Terrell and Torres before the embryos were created said that both parents must provide express written consent... for the embryos to be used, Terrell had refused to provide that consent, and so the Arizona Supreme Court upheld the contract.  So basically what happened was they went to court once, The first court, the lower circuit court or whatever they call it, was in favor of Terrell.  And they said, no, listen, if this guy doesn't want to have a kid, he shouldn't have to have a kid.  Then it went to the next level of court.  The next level of court went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The woman's right to have a child outweighs him not wanting to have a child, which is an insane thing to think that our court system went through and said that.  They 100% went through the entire process and said, you know what?  We don't care about him.  He doesn't have any say in this.  Even though that child is only gonna exist because of him, she's more important and she gets to use those eggs.  I guess this is a win.  It's a win for men because he definitely got to, you know, not have to be on the hook for this child for 18 years.  It's crazy that that law is not retroactive because there has to be people that still have eggs on, you know, frozen and stuff that haven't used them yet or whatever.  I don't know what the shelf life is if there's an expiration date on the egg aisle.  But... You know, it's a sad situation that she wants to have a child now and everything and, you know, has made these, the cancer is an issue that caused her not to be able to have the children.  So that kind of sucks.  I get it.  Like, I feel a little bit of sympathy for that.  But at the same time.  Maybe it's a sign.  Maybe it's a sign.  Maybe it just wasn't supposed to be and you just weren't supposed to have children.  I don't know.  I don't know what more to tell you, but I'm glad that they didn't force this guy against his will to have a child.  because even if they said with these new laws where they say, well, you don't have to be responsible for the child.  You don't have to be around.  You don't even have to pay for the kid.  Nothing.  That's still my kid.  And if that happened, I would still have to be a part of that kid's life.  It's my DNA.  You don't think I'm going to take care of my DNA?  So I'm glad that they went the way that they went.  But that all just came down to a contract.  If it wasn't for that signed contract, if it wasn't for that one little clause in that contract, she'd probably be having that baby and it would probably be against his will.  And he'd be paying 18 years of child support for nothing.  So that's all I got for today, guys.  I'll see you next time.  Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching this video.
