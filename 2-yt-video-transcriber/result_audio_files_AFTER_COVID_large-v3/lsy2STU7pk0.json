            "text": "Okay, guys, this is The Angry Pepper.  So today's episode, we're going to talk about the bad shit that's coming.  We are watching the United States unravel at a moderate pace, I might add.  But nonetheless, it's unraveling.  And the things that are going on are insane.  It's almost like the perfect storm, right?  I mean, you have... covid that put everybody on shutdown.  build everybody's anxiety anger loneliness depression up.  then george floyd gets killed and now that pisses off america america turns into a firestorm.  right then we have a couple other debts from last year being bought up again.  people get pissed about that.  okay now people are talking about defunding the police rioting burning shit tearing confederate statues down because they don't know their history.  then you got jacob blake.  Pretty sure I missed something in between that.  Then Jacob Blake gets shot.  Then you have two hurricanes hitting Louisiana.  It's insane, the shit that's going on.  The things that are going on right now are bad.  And it's only going to get worse.  And like I said before, we have to get ready.  Oh, not to mention we have a food crisis coming.  Things are getting insanely bad and we are in a historical moment in Prepper history.  I'll say that.  In American history and world history, right?  There's a lot going on and the bad shit that is coming is going to be unprecedented.  It's just this fucking feeling I have.  And most of us have this feeling actually, right?  That's why we prepare.  That being said, how do we negotiate our way around that?  Right?  How do we negotiate our way around that?  There isn't.  The only thing we can do is prepare for it.  And preparing for it right now means continuing to get your canned goods.  How about this?  For those of you that have money, for those of you that have time, what you're gonna wanna do right now is get the fuck out of the city.  My timeline moved up a little bit, right, from a year to probably six months maybe, or six to nine months.  Not by much, but it moved up.  And we're getting the fuck out of here because this shit's going to get hot.  All cities are going to get hot.  And after the election, it's going to get incredibly bad.  What are we going to do?  We're gonna continue to prepare.  We're gonna continue to leave the city if we can.  Some of us can't leave the city.  Some of us have family members that won't leave, especially if we have a 70-year-old grandmother who's just stubborn.  You're anchored to the city.  I get that, so you keep preparing, right?  You keep canning, dehydrating, doing what you need to do to make sure you have enough food to limit your time outside.  Because come the election, shit's going to get insanely bad.  If Donald Trump wins, it's on.  The left is going to lose their mind and start punching people in the face they think are Trump supporters.  Not know, think, because the left is that stupid.  You also have, and I saw this the other day on Instagram, a bunch of Black Lives Matter.  assholes were forcing a lady who was minding her business and eating to raise her fist.  They were in her face.  I'm like, why can't shit happen like that when I'm at a restaurant?  Right?  Because that fucking kid would have caught a beating.  Because now you're trying to force people to like your cause, to raise their fist.  You know who else did that shit?  Hitler did that shit.  Stalin, these assholes, Stalin and Hitler, forced people into their thinking and their ways.  BLM is doing the same exact shit Antifa doing the same exact shit.  this is the problem.  this is why it's going to get bad.  when I saw that video of them forcing that lady to raise her fist and she didn't she was just sitting there probably amazed that she was getting yelled at for that reason.  but the fact that she didn't was good but the fact that people were forcing her to do so was bad because it's going to get worse now.  Some of you in my comment section were right, I would have shot them.  Listen, if you can avoid shooting somebody, you can go with your hands, go with your hands.  If you can't avoid shooting them, shoot them.  Protect yourself, do whatever you got to do because it's only going to get worse.  Listen guys, the bad shit's coming.  a lot of you if not all of you know that already.  i know you guys know the bad is coming.  um it has to be stated that this bad is coming.  i know you guys know this.  i know uh you guys are prepping for this but it's insane.  so i was talking to a friend on zoom and i found it interesting while i'm talking to her that For all the things we've prepared for, civil unrest, riots, pandemics, some people, zombie apocalypse, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, whatever it is, it's all happening.  Minus the earthquakes.  And I'm pretty sure it just jinxed us.  Nonetheless, we've gotten prepared for all of this over the years, and all of this shit's happening in one year.  It's just insane.  It's just one crazy year, and it's only going to get worse.  because Again, look what happened in Portland, right?  Look what happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  It's like, what happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the guys in Portland were like, well, you shot three of our boys, we're going to shoot one of yous.  And they shot them, right?  These Antifa motherfuckers.  Again, these pale skin, basement dwelling, skinny, stream bean looking marshmallows, right?  Because they're soft and white.  That kind of bullshit is annoying.  We're letting these immature fucking amateurs get their say.  And it's insane that black conservatives are getting shut down left and right.  It's amazing that white conservatives are getting shut down left and right.  Meanwhile the left can keep their bullshit up.  They can keep their GoFundMe page up for a criminal and yet Kyle Rittenhouse, his GoFundMe page is shut down and every time they throw one up they shut it down.  that's fucking insane.  i couldn't find one to put on my my link and i'm gonna continue to find one.  i mean get it guys.  he needs to support because you know what if we're gonna support fucking criminals we can support this kid who made one mistake.  he made one mistake.  jacob blake made many george floyd made many.  a lot of these people made many mistakes.  this kid made one.  so you know again The shit that's going on is just incredibly insane and it's only going to get worse.  And we have to be prepared for it and we have to be able to pivot, guys.  That's the most important thing.  We have to be able to pivot with the shit that's going on.  Because if we sit here and we succumb to it and we start thinking about suicide and I had enough and all this other bullshit, the left fucking won.  The assholes who want you to kill yourself won and we cannot have that happen.  We have to stay in this fucking fight.  Good, bad, or indifferent.  All right, guys.
