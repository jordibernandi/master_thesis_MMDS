            "text": "Okay, number one, Black Lives Matter agitators have returned to the familiar well, harassing random white people while they eat dinner.  This is one of the primary tactics now of BLM.  And because BLM are very tough and brave, they focus once again on elderly people.  Watch.  you all Oh, yeah.  So tough, really tough, intimidating to elderly people, you know, big, big, tough guys.  You're so strong and brave are these warriors for freedom.  Oh, and by the way, here's BLM same day, same city harassing and assaulting a black McDonald's manager.  There's somebody with a wheelchair, Ed, that you need to let out.  No, you need to let the person out of your wheelchair, Ed.  And when you open that door, it's going to open up for people.  I'm talking about, Ed.  The people that are out there.  The people that are out there.  The people that are out there.  Put your hands up.  Wow.  OK, well, so apparently every time I've seen, you know, someone shout at a McDonald's manager because they got a six piece nugget instead of an eight piece nugget.  That was really.  they were really advancing racial justice.  And I didn't realize that.  So when you shout at a McDonald's manager, you're advancing racial justice.  You know, we hear the word hateful tossed around quite a bit.  The left especially likes to call.  Everything hateful, really.  And most of the time, hateful really means something.  more like has opinions that differ from my own or is more passionate about this issue than I am.  That's most of the time when someone calls something hateful, that's really what they mean.  But what we see here with BLM, this is actually finally a real hateful movement, movement.  Hateful in the most literal sense.  They are filled with hate.  They have only hate to offer.  They aren't trying to achieve anything positive.  It's not like.  this is just a misguided way of achieving some positive goal.  No, there is no positive goal.  There's nothing.  Harassing and intimidating old people while they eat dinner, that's not something you do because you have a goal in mind.  It's something you do because you hate.  You hate them for their race.  You hate them for their age.  You hate them for their assumed socioeconomic status.  BLM is only hate.  It is defined by hate.  It hates white people.  It hates police.  It hates conservatives.  I mean, it hates pretty much everything and everyone that doesn't bend to its whims.  It hates black people, too.  I mean, if you noticed in that in that last video we played as a black McDonald's manager, racial minority, middle class.  You know, as far as we know, not a conservative or Trump supporter, but they hated him, too.  Why?  Well, because he didn't dance to their tune.  That's it.  You have to do exactly what BLM wants.  And if you don't, then they hate you.  And you're an enemy and you're a fascist and you're Hitler and they can do whatever they want to you.  And they're morally justified in doing so.  That's the attitude.  Thank you for tuning into The Daily Wire, one of the fastest growing conservative media outlets in the entire country.
