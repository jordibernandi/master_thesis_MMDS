            "text": "On Monday, Fox News' Tucker Carlson revealed one of his most powerful reports to date.  And I believe that he is literally putting his career on the line by telling you the truth of what the Democratic Party is now doing, he is literally risking it all.  You see, right now, 25,000, over 25,000 troops have been sent to DC.  This is a full-fledged military occupation, worse than anything we've seen in Iran and Afghanistan.  Take a look at this article on businessinsider.com.  There will be more US troops in DC for Biden's inauguration than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.  A stark reminder of the danger, they say, of homegrown extremism.  But how many troops are actually in Iran and Afghanistan?  Well, take a look at this article here on militarytimes.com.  New in 2021, US troop presence heading down to 2,500 in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In other words, there's about 2,500 in Iran and about 2,500 in Afghanistan, putting it at about 5,000 troops.  So we nearly have 5,000. times the amount of troops in D.C.  than we do in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.  This is military occupation of D.C.  Take a listen to what Tucker Carlson had to say about it. ",

Instead, unmistakably, the Democratic Party is using those troops to send the rest of us a message about power.  We're in charge now.  We run this nation from Honolulu to our colony in the Caribbean and everything in between very much including where you and your family live.  Do not question us.  Men with guns enforce our decrees.  We control the Pentagon.  And indeed, they do control the Pentagon. ",

The Democratic Party, after banning the President of the United States from multiple platforms, wants to show you, the American people, how strong and powerful they are.  But to add a little fuel to the fire, so to speak, the Democratic arm has their FBI arm now vetting the 26 some odd thousand National Guard troops at the Capitol, not to see if they're loyal to the Constitution.  but to see if they're loyal to a political party.  That has never happened in our history.  Take a listen to what Tucker Carlson has to say, and he's putting his butt on the line by saying it. ",

Every white man in America should be under suspicion, purely on the basis of being white and male, of planning a presidential assassination.  He told us the National Guard is overwhelmingly white and male.  Therefore, Congressman Cohen says, white male National Guardsmen must undergo government background checks to prove they're not planning murder.  Steve Cohen didn't couch any of that.  He just said it.  And the CNN anchor nodded as he did. ",

Over in China right now, if you're a Uyghur Muslim or a Falun Gong or a Christian just for being part of those religions, you can be round up and put into a reeducation camp.  You don't have to commit any crime.  Nope.  Just because you're of that slant of religion, you're round up.  It's collective punishment that the Democratic Party is pushing for.  And matter of fact, right now, there is leftist radicals calling and saying that President Trump is going to start an army.  A domestic terrorist army.  Take a look at this article on Newsweek.com.  Viral video warns of Donald Trump sets to take charge of army of domestic terrorists.  I mean, really?  What is this army?  Everyone who supports the president of the United States now being labeled as part of a domestic army by the president?  I mean, that's a bit overboard by this leftist radical.  But hey, Now that Joe Biden's coming into presidency, They have plans for domestic terrorists.  Take a look at a few of these articles.  Time.com.  Everyone thinks I'm a terrorist.  Capitol riot fuels calls for domestic war on terror.  Foxnews.com.  In wake of Capitol riot, feds warn that violent extremists likely pose greatest domestic terrorist threats.  Politico.com.  D.C.  Mayor Bowser says focus must shift to domestic white terrorism.  KT.com.  Biden administration expects early focus on domestic extremism threat.  Wow.  So the biggest threat are people at the Capitol, right?  That's the biggest threat.  Not the Antifa and BLM literally writing, burning down our cities and killing people in mass.  Nope.  because they're part of the agenda.  But hey, don't worry.  Just who is a domestic terrorist or enemy of the state?  Nancy Pelosi.  Let us know who that was.  Take a look at this article on foxnews.com.  Pelosi calls Trump, GOP lawmakers, domestic enemies, enemies of the state, over their mail-in voting opposition.  So GOP members and President Trump, also known as Republicans, right, Nancy?  That's what they are, are domestic enemies of the state or domestic terrorists, if you will.  That's according to Nancy Pelosi.  But it's not like we have anything to worry about.  It's not like social media is removing conservative platforms and voices and names and masks.  Oh wait, they actually are.  Insurances are denying people.  We have banks removing people for their conservative views.  We have Uber doing that.  What's next?  I guess we get to wait and find out.
