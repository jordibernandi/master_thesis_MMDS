Don't worry, I'll be fine.  I'm gonna sleep right after this.  But I did want to say a couple of things.  Obviously, this is John the Other.  Hi.  I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, and one of the major universities in the province and city that I live in is called University of British Columbia, UBC.  And this last week, the president of UBC was fired or quit under extreme pressure.  Like, you're going to quit or we're going to fire you.  And the reason he was fired, or quit, is because he liked one or more tweets on Twitter that were critical of Black Lives Matter based, I believe, on the violence and the hatred coming out of that movement.  Now, for anybody who's unclear, Black Lives Matter is an extremely racist, violent, and if you go to the website, explicitly Marxist organization, which is a murderous philosophy.  Murderous.  And a lot of the rhetoric talks about, you know, exterminating whites and so on.  You know, okay, so he criticized that.  He said, yeah, I'm not down with this shit.  No, actually, no, he didn't criticize it.  He just liked tweets that were critical of it.  And as a consequence, he's fired.  That's it.  Your career's over.  Goodbye.  Now, by contrast... university professor at Cambridge University which is I would say one of the most prestigious universities in the entire known universe and she said white lives don't matter.  you know and I would actually agree with that in terms of the political climate white lives don't matter.  you can kill white people and you're perfectly fine.  and then she went on to say It's a long tweet and I don't have it in front of me, so I'm going to put it on the screen and I'm just going to paraphrase what she says.  She's tweeted a tweet posting, calling for what I would say is ethnic cleansing of whites, extermination, mass killing.  And Cambridge University is not firing her.  They're standing behind her because freedom of expression is really important.  You know what?  I'm not going to get outraged by this.  And I recommend that you don't get outraged either.  Because getting outraged isn't going to solve anything.  It's just going to increase your blood pressure.  It's going to produce stress hormones.  And it's going to have a debilitating effect on your health. ",
