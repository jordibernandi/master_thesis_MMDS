Undeniably, it would be.  It's a remarkably severe claim.  And it's funny.  And this is one of the reasons why I was encouraging people to vote for Biden so much.  Because if it was a hairline victory, if Biden just barely won by one state, then it would be much easier for the Trumpers to engage in this coup.  They would have to come up with a smaller lie.  It'd be easier to sell people on that.  But now, because Trump has to win four more states in order for him to take the presidency, they have to back up to these insane fucking claims.

We simply wanted to see the details.  How could you not want to see them?  So we invited Sidney Powell on the show.  We would have given her the whole hour.  We would have given her the entire week, actually, and listened quietly the whole time at rapt attention.  That's a big story.  But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page.  When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her.  When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they told us Powell has never given them any evidence either, nor did she provide any today at the press conference.  Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous, and she's right.  We're with her there.  But she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another.  Not one.  So why are we telling you this?  We're telling you this because it's true.  And in the end, that's all that matters.  The truth.  It's our only hope.  It's our best defense.  And it's how we're different from them.  We care what's true.  And we know you care, too.  That's why we told you.  Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened and precisely who did it.  Maybe she will.  We are certainly hopeful that she will.  What happened with the vote counting this month and at the polling places in Detroit and the polling places in Philadelphia and so much else actually matters.  It matters no matter who you voted for.  It matters whether or not you think this election is already over.  Until we know the answers to those questions conclusively and we can agree on them, this country will not be united. ",

Listen, the Trump administration recently got in trouble because... they what was it they like?  mixed up michigan and minnesota or something like that.  what was the insane shit they just did?  the point that i'm trying to get at is that the republicans are not exactly bringing out their crack legal.  um president trump's legal team trying to prove voter fraud in michigan apparently used data taken from counties in minnesota the latest in a series of embarrassing missteps.  it's fucking clown show dude.  so i of course i you know i'm a master tweeter.  i tweeted out lawyer spongebob see because i'm making a joke about their ineptitude.  Whatever the case may be, there are a lot of Trump sycophants who will say they're withholding their evidence until the court case.  They're they're not the reason they're not giving you evidence because they don't want to play their hand.  And that's not how it works at all.  Not even slightly, as a matter of fact, if they have evidence, they should be able to provide it.  And if the evidence they have is sturdy, there shouldn't be a way for Democrats to counter it.  the process of discoverability at the beginning of court cases allows for your opposition to challenge or to bring up, you know, exculpatory or otherwise evidence that they can use to counter your claims.  So the reason they're not providing evidence is because they don't have evidence.  That's the main reason that they're doing that.  And Tucker Carlson actually sided against them, which is pretty incredible.  Now, keep in mind, by the way, the only thing Tucker Carlson has done is say that he asked for evidence and was denied evidence.  And the Trumpers are losing their goddamn mind.  They're calling... Oh, there's Nick Fuentes.  They're saying that Tucker Carlson is a part of the Deep State, which is... They actually are correct on that one.  Yes, Tucker Carlson is a wealthy heir and billionaire simp.  So, yeah, kind of.  I mean, by whatever definition of Deep State you have.  Um... There are people, I mean, I guess I don't have, like, a bunch of materials provided for you, but they are fucking losing it.  And the Tucker Carlson subreddit, like, everywhere, these people are losing their goddamn minds.  Look at this.  Tucker Carlson went after Sidney Powell tonight.  The left never does this to its own.  Yeah, dude, the left never infights.  That's so true, dude.  The left... Never in fights.  That's such an accurate understanding of the left.  That's crazy, bro.  You are nailing it right now.  That's... I never do that.  Dude, even Trump acknowledged during the Democratic primaries that there was some, you know, they were... beating up on bernie a little bit at a couple points there like yeah okay whatever victim complex andy's i know but anyway um it is really funny watching all of these uh trumpers like come to grips with the fact that murdoch i'm sorry that uh tucker carlson's a murdoch simp murdoch's the guy who owns fox.  and um there's this uh little video that i like from vox quite a bit and it's why tucker carlson pretends to hate elites.  it's great you know There are people who unironically think that Tucker Carlson, like this is the kind of shit, after watching this video and then re-watching it, seriously, it's a lot of compacted information in here.  Watch like Rising or Crystal Ball or something.  Anytime Sager talks about Tucker Carlson again in the future, oh God.  Anyway, here's a segment.  Tucker Carlson said this on a radio show.

Tucker Carlson is a horrible human being, like a despicable person who's only interested in wealth and power for himself.  And like most authoritarians, he actually has a very submissive personality.  He'll do anything that his betters tell him to do.  And his betters have told him he's not behind this coup.  And all it took for him to signal disinterest in this coup was to ask for evidence and to not get any.  Listen, if you were Sidney Powell and you were one of the keystones of ensuring the public legitimacy of this whole Trump anti-fraud court case, whatever, wouldn't you do or say anything to get on his program?  Wouldn't you do or say anything to be able to make your case for multiple nights in a row on the program of the most watched public figure on cable news?  You'd do anything.  But she didn't have anything.  so she couldn't do it.  And that's all it takes to be excommunicated from the Trump cult these days, you know?  Asking for evidence.  That's it.  Not even disagreeing or anything, because Tucker didn't disagree in there, and the Trumpers are mad anyway.  He just asked for evidence, and they get mad.  You could see back in that press conference with Rudy and the likes, you know, they got really mad when it was suggested they didn't have evidence.  And they said they just provided evidence.  Of course they didn't.  They threw around some affidavits.  Affidavits can be immiscible as evidence if they're determined to be legitimate and worthwhile and credible.  But they're not on their own evidence of wrongdoing.  They had nothing.  And they had so nothing that they got offended.  And the rest of the Trump cultists, they got offended that Tucker Carlson had the audacity to ask for evidence.  damn dude the ideological hegemony that you have to the amount of groupthink that you have to lock yourself into to be a part of the Trump cult these days is unbelievable.  These people sold themselves as the free thinkers, you know, fuck your feelings, yeah, we don't care about no SJW shit, America, yeah, fucking, we'll just say what's on our mind.  But now, none of that shit, motherfucker.  It's coup time, baby.  You need to shut the fuck up and don't ask questions.
