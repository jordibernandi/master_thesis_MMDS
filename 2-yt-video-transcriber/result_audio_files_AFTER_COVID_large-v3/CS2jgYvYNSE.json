            "text": "So, Barack Obama, failed president, okay?  Kenyon-in-chief was talking to LeBron James, who, as you know, is, I would say, definitely not as good as Michael Jordan.  But I would also say he's not as good as a group of randomly selected players.  Larry Bird, John Stockton, Chris Mullen, Kevin Love, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash.  George Mikan, remember him?  The big... The big old, you know, the black and white footage.  He did a lot of wasn't that good, but he was better than LeBron.  I can tell you that.  So I don't respect all these active athletes who are trying to bring politics and sports.  That's why I like strong athletes with great patriotism, like Curt Schilling, who does, you know, strong fraud.  Lost his money in video games, does great fraud on Build the Wall.  That's a great athlete, okay?  And a great patriot.  And guys like Aubrey Huff.  You know, I love tough guys with women's names.  Aubrey sounds kind of like a woman.  And maybe that's why he fights so hard to be so tough on Twitter.  Okay, so we love athletes that love MAGA, that rip off people and have women's names.  Not like LeBron James who, you know, wants people to live and have rights. ",
