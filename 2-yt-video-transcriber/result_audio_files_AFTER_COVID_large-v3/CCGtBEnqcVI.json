            "text": "Hi.  I'm full of shit.  Nice to meet you.  The year was 2007.  The Dixie Chicks were sweeping up Grammys, Bow Wow was still black, and renowned writer Steve Erickson had published his eighth novel to glowing reviews.  Zeroville, the novel in question, follows ex-monastery and vicar when he first arrives in Los Angeles in 1969.  After watching his very first movie, Vicker falls in love with cinema, gets a tattoo of Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift in the back of his shiny bald head, and decides to abandon all he knows in pursuit of the movies.  As the years pass, Vicker watches as Hollywood and the movie-making landscape are transformed, all the while growing from a mere film enthusiast to an artist himself.  Erickson, whose stories are frequently noted for being the kind of evocative, genre-less, and mind-bending stories that dispel the expected, wrote Zeroville with one premise in mind, a book about movies that reads like a movie.  In an interview with Bookslut, Erickson stated, With Zeroville, I decided from the outset that it should have the pop energy of a movie, linear, always in the present tense, the story told in action and dialogue and movie references, cutting from short scene to short scene.  Several people have mentioned how quickly the novel reads, and that's what I wanted, a story that moved like a movie.  With all that in mind, it seems like Zeroville would be an ideal book to adapt into a film.  It's about movies.  It was written like a movie.  It reads like a movie.  It should be fairly easy to turn it into a movie, right?  You already know where I'm going with this.  To their defense, adaptations are pretty hard to do.  Changing the medium of a story sometimes means you have to shave it down or get rid of entire subplots, all the while keeping the main themes intact enough for everything to be cohesive.  And sometimes the opposite is true.  Sometimes a story is a short one, and so you have to add to it to make it a feature film.  This can be risky, but sometimes it's done right.  Like when Akira Kurosawa based Rashomon from a collection of short stories by Urunosuke Akutagawa.  When done right, the result can be ingenious.  When done right, the result can be beautifully heartbreaking.  When done wrong, The result can be... A monster?  Where?  Although The Cat in the Hat does manage to get all the main points from the book down, it is an adaptation that needlessly devalues the original story by padding the runtime with unnecessary drywall.  that mistakes complete chaos for entertainment.  The task of adapting becomes even more complicated when the novel in question is abstract, or quite literally deemed unfilmable.  That's exactly the case for novels like Mark Elden Slusky's House of Leaves, Nicholson Baker's The Mezzanine, or The Goliath of Literary Debuts, infinite jest.  These books are hard to adapt not just because of story, but because of narrating techniques, themes, characters, and even location.  I mean, the entirety of The Mezzanine takes place in a fucking escalator.  William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is another novel considered to be unfilmable.  Faulkner's novel is a thoughtful observation of a poor Southern family following the death of its matriarch, Addie Bundren.  Mortality, grief, family, and all of its implications are covered in a personal, unconventional manner.  With 15 point of views, different language devices, and a stream of consciousness narrative, it's right for most people to suspect that making a film equivalent would be impossible.  With so many inner monologues that help to move a story along, creating a version of that for film sounds not only difficult but Kinda boring.  Like an endless sea of narration.  Whoever wound up making a film adaptation of such a staggering literary spectacle would either have to be completely out of their minds or completely in over their head.  In the end, it was a combination of the two.  You already know who James Franco is.  After starting his acting career in 1999, he eventually graduated to writing and directing and starring in his own films.  The most I can say about his first three movies, The Ape, Fool's Gold, and Good Time Max, is that they are movies.  Good for them.  After a string of short films in 2010, his directorial effort took a different turn.  Instead of crafting his own stories from scratch, he started to dabble in telling the stories of more interesting storytellers.  His first attempt was to tell the partial biopic of the Academy Award-nominated actor and bisexual icon, Sal Mineo.  best known for his role as Pluto in Rebel Without a Cause, which is perhaps the gayest movie to come out of the year 1955.  Not, however, the gayest movie to come out of the 50s overall.  That is a distinct title belonging to A Song of Love, a.k.a.  All the Dicks.  all the time.  Mineo, who is something of a teen idol in the 1950s, was tragically killed in 1976.  The event of his death plays a role in the Franco film, which focuses on the last few hours of his life.  Sal premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2011, too.  crickets.  He followed Sal up with a couple of more short films, some documentaries, including one about River Phoenix.  His next semi-big one was a sort of docu-fiction.  take on the lost 40 minutes of the 1980 movie Cruising.  For those of you that don't remember or haven't heard of Cruising, it's the movie where Al Pacino is a police detective that goes undercover in the underground S&M gay subculture of New York City to catch a serial killer.  That movie, upon initial release, was met with controversy and protest as members of the LGBTQ community expressed concern with the way their sexualities were depicted and stigmatized in the film.  Another thing that riled people up quite a bit was the film's ending, which was thought to have been a result of missing footage.  Interior.  Leather.  Bar.  Franco's attempt at recreating those lost 40 minutes that may or may not have existed in the first place.  This effort was met with less crickets and more mixed reviews.  2013.  That was the year that James' quest to adapt classic novels into films officially began.  I like to fucking read!  One critic for As I Lay Dying started their review for the film with this line.  James Franco continues his aggressive campaign to make everyone hate him.  The multiple narrations in the book are in the film showcased with split screens and voiceovers.  Apart from some good casting, the movie fails with its characters because James spends so much time trying to capture the abstract qualities of the book that he sort of just leaves the characters to hang out.  It is only when you watch the movie having already read the book that you can get something out of it, and that's mainly by way of appreciating and getting the elements you're being shown.  But if you haven't read the book, then you're just like... Okay, sir, what the fuck is this?  And therein lies one of the biggest problems.  Pin it for later.  As I Lay Dying was followed up with a movie about Charles Bukowski that no one has seen, a movie about the poet Stephen Dobbins that even less people have seen, another impossible William Faulkner novel, The Sound and the Fury, which critics responded to a lot less amicably because, well, you should have learned your lesson the first time.  All of this inevitably leads to the desecration of.  I first became aware of Zeroville in 2019, the year it was officially released to the public, an entire eight years after it was announced, five years after it was filmed in 2014, and four years after its slated release date.  So yeah, this production's seen some problems.  For a little while, and only to those who cared an ounce, this film and its delayed release became something of a lore.  It was James Franco's very own lost footage, his exceeding a 40 minute runtime.  But by the time it came out in 2019, the lore had died off and most people weren't even aware that it came out or even that it existed in the first place.  It's unclear how much the budget for the film was, but it definitely didn't cost $78,293 to make.  which is what the box office numbers were.  Months later, after the movie was released, I caught a glimpse of reviews like this one, and I just could not contain my curiosity.  I had to see it, and boy, I did not like it.  I know I call a lot of things a hot-ass mess, But honestly, I think it's the best way to describe this movie.  The first time I watched it, I was pretty confused for the first third of it.  It starts as such a jumbled mess, so much information notably absent that it feels like you've been dumped into an incomplete world.  Like the screenplay was a first draft, or barely that.  Will Ferrell give some sort of monologue about non-existent movies directed by no one and then it cuts to James Franco looking constipated?  It starts with this scene and then it goes to the beginning, to Viker arriving in Los Angeles.  At this point, we barely have a grasp on him before other characters and situations start being thrown haphazardly into the mix.  The pacing here is... Basically non-existent, scenes jump from idea to idea, from random character to random character, and nothing here is fully realized enough for the film to stand on its own.  Everything you see only begins to make sense after you've read the book.  It's the as-I-lay-dying problem coming full circle.  Personally, I've never had a problem with movie adaptations that differ from the book by omitting certain parts or certain characters because I understand that adapting, for instance, a 500-page novel only allows for so much time in a two-hour film.  There's changes you have to make.  And that's totally fine.  But the changes here do nothing to aid the film.  In fact, they hold it back by not only omitting entire scenes, but by extension, omitting any hint of a comprehensive story.  In the novel, Vicar is taken under the wing of a seasoned film editor, Dottie, whose mantra for editing is, fuck continuity.  Surmising from how much is cut out, I have to wonder if James Franco and the screenwriters, Paul Felton and Ian Olds, Wait, this shit had two screenwriters?  What the fu- Took a bit too literally.  From the get-go, it becomes immediately clear that this is less of a sincere adaptation and more of an excuse for James Franco to dick around with his friends.  Does that mean?  I don't care.  The interrogation scene solidifies this, and sure, there's plenty of comedic elements in Zeroville.  It's actually fucking hilarious.  But the humor in the book is nuanced and balanced with scenes of real emotional weight, walking the thin line between tragedy and comedy, while the humor in the film is as deep as a kiddie pool.  or a frat pack movie.  Reading Zeroville, on the other hand, is an entirely different experience.  The story is structured in a bit of a strange way for a novel.  The events that take place seem random and inconsequential, but most of those scenes come back in a way that is meaningful to the story.  Although the story can be seen as weird in this format, I never get the feeling that Erickson himself is trying to tell a weird story.  Part of what makes it work narratively is how much affection Erickson has for it.  James Franco's interpretation of the story seems to miss all the elements that made it an important read.  And kind of like the cat in the hat, he mistakes complete chaos for depth and complexity.  Even his interpretation of the main character seems kind of off.  In the book, Vicar, although easily angered, is really rather Bambi-like.  He's wide-eyed and somewhat innocent and naive about pretty much everything.  Where Erickson's Vicar is sympathetic and offenseless, Franco's Vicar is just Weird and kind of a creep.  You would think that a movie about an editor who thinks outside the box and discovers a secret film hidden in every film ever made would make some interesting and daring choices in terms of editing, no?  But nothing about this movie, not the editing, not the writing, not the acting, that's for damn sure, is interesting.  Let alone daring.  Remember that thing about unfilmable novels?  Although it's a common belief, it's not one I completely agree with.  I think it's possible to make a film out of an abstract and experimental story.  The only hindrance is when such an adaptation is approached in a standard way.  James Franco directed Zeroville, an unconventional tale, in perhaps the most conventional way he could have done it, and the result is a confusing and sincere mess.  One more perplexing thing about Zeroville, among the many, is how much James Franco's cinephilia seems to resemble Vicar's.  Let's not forget who made movies about River Phoenix and My Own Private Idaho, who made a movie reimagining the lost footage of cruising, and one about the last hours of bisexual icon Sal Mineo's life.  Franco loves the movies as much as Vicar, enough to want to make stories centered around them.  A character like that is, surely, something that Franco could bring to life and empathize with.  The problem is that Vicar's cinephile nature is the only thing James Franco could mirror, but he misunderstands it completely.  The film Zeroville starts with a nauseating montage of James Franco shaving his head, along with spliced-in images from films like A Place in the Sun, The Passion of Joan of Arc, and Easy Rider.  In the midst of all that visual chaos, there's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment where Vicar arrives at Mance Chinese Theatre, finds Elizabeth Taylor's handprints, and lies down to dry hump the pavement.  Cheers to subtlety.  I mention all this because sometimes a story becomes even more impactful when it means something to the person telling it, when they can find an aspect of it to relate to.  Martin Scorsese isn't part of the mob and never has been, but a film like, for instance, The Irishman isn't about the mob.  Not really.  It's about morals, the importance of family, and the inevitability of death.  These are all things that mean something to Scorsese personally, and the result is a fucking beautiful epic.  Perhaps The Disaster Artist works the way that it does because it's the first role James Franco directed and starred in that he could actually relate to on some level.  It was the first time he tried to tell the story not of a superior storyteller, but a storyteller like himself.  Yes, I'm saying Tommy Wiseau and James Franco are the same person.  What do we know about Tommy Wiseau?  He loves movies, went to film school, tried to become an actor, funded various short films before directing his magnum opus.  The magnum opus, which prior to its release, Wiseau had been sure was going to be a highly regarded masterpiece.  And it turned out to be this.  And what of James Franco?  He loves movies, stream of consciousness books, went to film school, became an actor, made various short films and features that were not the masterpieces he thought they'd be.  He couldn't tell the stories of William Faulkner or Sal Mineo or Vicar or Steve Erickson because James Franco lacks subtlety and nuance.  Zeroville is about many things, including the journey from enthusiast to daring auteur.  And while Franco can relate to being an enthusiast, he is not an auteur.  Not even close.  By the time The Disaster Artist came out, James Franco had directed 15 feature films that were either completely ignored or all around critically panned.  He could tell the story of The Room and Tommy Wiseau because he's something of a disaster artist himself.  Both Wiseau and Franco are cinephiles inspired by the greats in cinematic history.  They're both admirers of actors like James Dean and Liz Taylor, writers like Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, admirers of great art who both mistake imitation for virtuosity. ",
