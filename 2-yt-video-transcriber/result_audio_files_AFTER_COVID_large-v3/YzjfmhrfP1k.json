Yes, sir.  On a one-way street.  Yes, sir.  And you guys pulled in here.  Yes, sir.  Is there any particular reason for that?  We were just trying to get around the cars there.  Just trying to get away from cars?  Yeah, there was too many cars right there.  We were trying to get around.  Now, if anyone else were to do that, they would have got stopped and pulled over, right?  Well, not necessarily.  Not necessarily?  But you kind of see how that looks, right?  No, I understand what you're saying.  What's your name and badge number?  My last name is Balo.  Balo?  Badge is 2A1.  2A1?  Bennett 519.  Bennett 519?
