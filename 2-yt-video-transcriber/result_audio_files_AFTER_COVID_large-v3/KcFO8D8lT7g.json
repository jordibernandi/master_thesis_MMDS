            "text": "Hey everybody, Greg Laurie here with some thoughts on how to pray effectively.  Jesus gave us a prayer to pray and also a prayer that is a template or a model for all prayer.  It's called the Lord's Prayer.  I think most of us know it by heart.  He said, after this manner, therefore, you should pray, our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who've sinned against us.  Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil.  And he also taught us to pray, give us this day our daily bread.  So prayer should begin with adoration and worship.  But then there's a place for your needs.  Give me this day my daily bread.  Notice Jesus did not teach us to pray, give me this month my monthly bread.  If God gave you everything you needed once a month, you would probably only go to him once.  once a month, right?  So it's give us this day our daily bread.  God is our provider.  So we should go to him and say, Lord, I need your provision.  God can provide for you through many avenues, of course, through your job and other ways.  But he is ultimately the provider.  Give me this day my daily bread.  And then I love what he also says, lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.  one.  I heard the statement, I think it was Oscar Wilde who said, lead me not into temptation, I can find it myself.  That's true.  We do a pretty good job or bad job, I might say, of getting ourselves into a lot of trouble.  Basically, we're being taught to pray, Lord, don't let me be tempted above my capacity to resist.  Give me the strength to resist that temptation.  Deliver me from the evil one.  But then Jesus teaches us to pray that I should forgive others.  Forgive me my sins as I forgive those who've sinned against me.  It was C.S.  Lewis who said this paraphrase, everyone thinks that forgiveness is a lovely idea until they have someone to forgive.  Listen, God forgives us because we ask him to, because of the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins.  And if God has forgiven us, should we not forgive others?  The Bible says, forgive one another, be tenderhearted.  Do you have someone you need to forgive?  If you want to have an effective prayer life, ask God to forgive you of your sins and forgive others who have sinned against you.  As a matter of fact, if you fail to do that, it can hinder your prayer life.  Jesus said, when you go to the Father, you remember that someone has sinned against you.  You've sinned against them.  Go to that person, reconcile with them, try to make it right.  I think in this time of self-quarantine where we're kind of cooped up with each other, tempers can flare, we can get angry, we can say things we shouldn't say, we need to keep short accounts and be forgiving one another.  And then our prayers will be more effective. ",
