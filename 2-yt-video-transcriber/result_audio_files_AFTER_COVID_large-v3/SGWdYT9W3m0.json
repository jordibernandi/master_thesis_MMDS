Only, of course, if everyone dresses up as a freak and an outsider, that makes those things the new banal conformity.  But let's not worry about all that.  By 1979, the more intellectual members of the older Gen X generation could try to fool themselves into believing that they were above all of that by listening to the likes of Pink Floyd.

Now there's a grain of something truly radical to this song, the idea that state school is a form of prison, forcing kids through a syllabus of ideological left-wing indoctrination.  But unfortunately this is de-emphasized for the merely psychological.  Roger Waters settles for pathology.  He's more worried about the possible psychological harm done to children who suffer the, quote, dark sarcasm in the classroom.  In other words, he's worried about how school might affect the ego and self-confidence of individuals rather than how it might be brainwashing them.  And this incessant psychologizing is characteristic of what would become the Gen X mindset.  It is rife, for example, in the movies of Tim Burton.  In his hands, the penguin is the victim of child abandonment, while Willy Wonka owns a chocolate factory because his father was an evil dentist who wouldn't let him eat chocolate.  And lo, how all the mystery and charm is stripped out of the thing because it has been explained by this leaden logic.  All of this is embodied in an icon of the later Gen X, Daria.  Daria was very cynical and a deadpan snarker.  In fact, there were many deadpan snarkers for Gen Xers like her to look up to.  I'd say it was actively encouraged.  Bill Murray, in every film, was a deadpan snarker.  Yes, it's true. ",

Well, let me tell you, James May is supposed to be your favourite, and it doesn't make you unique or special.  Anyway, back to Daria.  As well as being a deadpan snarker, she was also, I'm afraid to say, a chronic midwit.  What do I mean by that?  Well, Daria had an explanation for everything, and that explanation was usually some form of Codd psychologizing, as I've already discussed.  Something as profound and wonderful and enduring as strong religious faith becomes, in Daria's hands, mere pathology.  There's a psychological need for religion because the human mind cannot stand the vast chaos of space and physics, or it cannot come to terms with the great unknown or something.  Daria knows better, of course.  Daria has no such psychological need.  Will you never rest? ",
