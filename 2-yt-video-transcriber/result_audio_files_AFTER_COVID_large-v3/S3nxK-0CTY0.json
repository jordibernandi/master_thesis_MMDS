            "text": "Hey, it's Aaron and today we're going to do something a little bit different.  Today we're actually going to go through a series of questions that I've been receiving on social media that broadly explain a wide variety of topics in regards to anarcho-communism.  So this series of questions is actually posed by a far-right libertarian and I'm going to do things a little bit different.  Like I said, I'm not going to be on video in this series.  I'm just going to talk about the questions and give explanations and hopefully give some visuals to go along with this.  so it kind of makes it a little bit more streamlined and easier to understand for people that are trying to find out the basics of anarcho-communism.  So this will be part of my How Anarcho-Communism Works series and without any further ado let's get right into it.  So, I'm currently a minorkist, so very far right and libertarian.  So the fact that I'm considering communism is freaking me out, honestly.  I have a good bit of questions before I can actually be on board.  And my first question is, how can you be a communist and also have individual liberty?  As in, like, the ownership of guns, freedom of speech, freedom of religion,  etc.,  etc.?  Sure.  So, I want to stress, first of all, that I'm an anarcho-communist, so all of my theory is based around that.  Essentially, you can boil communism down to the worker control and ownership of the means of production with the abolition of state, class, and money.  Obviously, that's a gross simplification, but for the sake of this argument, let's go with that.  And anarchism talks basically about questioning and abolishing all unnecessary or unjustified hierarchical structures.  Again, very simplified, but let's go with it.  So essentially, communism deals with ownership, while anarchism deals with leadership.  So, as an anarcho-communist, you would have the freedom to do anything you wanted, so long as it didn't infringe on the rights and freedoms of anyone else.  You can practice whatever religion you want, have as many guns as you like, and you're encouraged to constantly question any form of government that may arise.  Also, Karl Marx even said, under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered.  Any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.  You would play a direct part in the government through direct democracy, liquid democracy, vote weighing, and rank choice voting.  So instead of voting on politicians, you would vote directly on policies themselves.  So some people refer to this as a type of libertarian socialism.  So you're basically saying that communism isn't the equal redistribution of money?  Well, no, not necessarily.  True communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless society, so there's no money to redistribute.  But socialism, which is typically referred to as a transitionary period between capitalism and communism, does try to redistribute wealth in various different ways, depending on what country we're talking about.  So, there's a difference between socialism and communism.  Socialism is a slippery term that has many different definitions, and some people do use it interchangeably with communism, but honestly, this is all very confusing, and I don't really like to use these terms directly when I'm answering questions, because it tends to muddle a lot of these ideas.  The second you say socialism or communism, people immediately get some crazy ideas in their heads about what it actually means, and usually, they're kind of wrong.  So, you believe that stuff like Medicare for All, free college, and other stuff like that should not be provided by the government, but rather by the community?  Actually, that's a great question.  So, I personally believe in a form of government called democratic confederalism.  Essentially, small communities that work together on the ground level to make decisions for themselves on a community basis.  they would have councils of representatives who enact the policy that is voted on by the people.  Those councils would then link together in various ways to form a federation of councils.  That federation would then be able to work similar to the national government by being able to take immediate action like sending in the military to deal with a national threat or to deal with some sort of health crisis, but it is essentially organized from the ground up rather than the top down, allowing for the base community, your local neighborhood, to actually be the highest form of government.  So the community on the ground level would work to do whatever it can to provide those resources, and if it's unable to do that, then the federation of communities together would provide those services for them.  Everything would be free because, again, there is no money.  Well, by gum, everything you just said was so intelligent, I'm going to become an anarcho-communist now.  Actually, that's not what he said at all.  But that is the end of this video, and you can definitely check out the next one.  It'll be coming out, hopefully, very soon.  And that's my show.  My name is Aaron.  If you do get a chance, please check out all of the links in the description box below.  hit that little bell button because you know that they're not going to tell you when I release a new video.  And make sure you're subscribed because they're unsubscribing people every single day.  And also, before you go, I make purely anti-capitalist content, so there is no way that I am ever going to get an advertiser actually wanting to sponsor this video.  So to make sure that we keep putting out consistent anti-capitalist content, make sure that you hit the Patreon link in the description box below and probably at the very end of this video in a card.  And yeah, become a member of my Patreon because it's people like you that actually keep this show going.  So thank you very much for watching.  Have a nice day. ",
