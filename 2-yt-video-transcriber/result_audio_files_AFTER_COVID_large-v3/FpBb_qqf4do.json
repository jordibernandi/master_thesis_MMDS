            "text": "While we are on the subject of socialism for the rich, which my Republican friends have suddenly become very concerned about, let me talk about the Trump tax proposal that was pushed very hard by Senator McConnell and the Republican leadership and where I think every Republican voted for it.  You want to talk about socialism for the rich?  It is not the bill that puts $2,000 into working class hands all over this country.  That ain't socialism for the rich.  This is socialism for the rich in that bill.  Amazon.  Oh, by the way, I must say this, if I may.  We were quoting the liberal Washington Post owned by Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest guy in the world.  So here is Jeff Bezos' company, Amazon, and they received a tax rebate.  They paid nothing in 2018 in federal taxes.  That's a corrupt tax system to begin with.  But then on top of that, they received $129 million as a tax rebate.  That, Senator Thune, is what socialism for the rich?  In fact, this particular company is owned by the richest guy in the world.  You gave him a $129 million rebate. ",
