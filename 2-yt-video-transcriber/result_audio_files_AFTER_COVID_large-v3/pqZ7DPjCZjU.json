That is where the fraud took place, where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.  We need an audit of all of the computer systems that... played any role in this fraud whatsoever.  And Joe Biden had it right.  He said that he had the biggest voter fraud organization ever, and he didn't need people's votes now.  He would need people later.  They had this all planned, Maria.  They had the algorithms.  They had the paper ballots waiting to be inserted if and when needed.  And notably, President Trump's vote in the blue states went up enormously.  That's when they had to stop the vote count.  and go in and replace votes for Biden and take away Trump votes. ",
