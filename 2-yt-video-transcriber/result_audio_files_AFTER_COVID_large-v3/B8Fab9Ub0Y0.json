            "text": "What's going on?  This is my life in the shop.  I'm your host, Donald Washington.  I want to bring you guys to another dead rapper.  This young brother, 29-year-old Corey Thompson, go by the name of Triple Beans out of New Jersey.  They run up on him in broad daylight.  Bing, bing, bing, bing.  And he's rolling on the ground and they're blasting him.  He's rolling.  That's him right there.  They sat and executed this man.  Let me tell y'all something.  This social media beef, this rapping, this jealousy, this envy, Godfrey said it best.  Gangsters do not, I repeat, gangsters do not live that long.  You guys got to understand, rappers are entertainers.  You're not supposed to be really living that life.  I watched so many gangster movies.  It's fascinating to young black men.  I watched, there was a movie, and it was like a documentary, and they were saying, yo, it's just fascinating to watch Scarface.  And the lady was like, why?  She was like, just... a poor Cuban being able to have nothing and have millions of dollars being able to sell a product and become millionaires.  That's a fantasy.  It's fantasy.  I want to bring you guys this Facebook page.  This is the brother here.  This is him here.  Damn.  Triple B. So y'all understand this, man.  Hey, once y'all go, you know, YouTube, Facebook, and you publicly diss somebody, everybody in the world is watching this.  For them to sit out there and risk life in prison to kill this man, they had personal beef.  I mean for real.  They really wanted this man dead.  This is where it happened at here.  This is Avon Avenue.  This is it here.  Let me see what's going on down this block.  I'm gonna show y'all.  the news clip is, I'm not gonna show y'all.  the news clip is now.  I bring politics into this.  For all my life, I was always blue no matter who.  But the Democratic Party is starting to irritate me really bad.  Because what happens, I bring back to the home.  My father told me, he sat me down.  I don't.  N.W.A.  Scarface and all them rappers was really out gunning mofos down.  I thought they were really murdering.  I thought that was a cool thing to do.  Menace was just coming out.  Boys in the Hood was just coming out.  And all these rappers started talking about, let's murder each other.  I'm who I'm murdering.  And the street code was, if you wasn't blasting mofos, then you was a chump.  You was a sucker.  If you was treating women with respect, you was a sucker.  Literally, I actually literally thought that.  My father had to sit me down and say, no, no, no, no, no.  These rappers are just entertainers.  They're not really mo' and mo' foes out.  Chief Keef, some of them rappers that moved to the Hollywood Hills, they safe.  But some of you local rappers, this is why a lot of these local rappers are still getting murdered in the streets.  Gunned down left and right.  I brought politics in this, and why I say the Democratic Party is really starting to irritate me, because it started with them.  Let me tell y'all, something happened in the 70s.  The projects, that's not a nickname term for some type of function.  It was a project.  They said, let us take minority women, and if they have a child out of wedlock, let's reward them.  Let's see what happens.  Let's put them, thousands of them in these buildings.  And let's sit back and let's watch what happens.  I did the Chicago Way documentary.  This was in 70.  By 73, it worked so well.  They quadrupled welfare.  In 73, look it up.  They quadrupled welfare.  What does welfare have to do with this?  I know a lot of people jump on me for this.  A lot of people hate me when I talk about this.  But what welfare did was take the father out of the home.  What was the common denominator with every jail inmate?  Juvenile, high school dropout, gang member, drug dealer, drug addict.  They share one common denominator.  in that state.  90% of them grew up without a father.  How does welfare come into this?  Because welfare is what fuel that father out of the household.  Where does the Democratic Party come into this?  It's because the Democratic Party is what fuels the most welfare and pushes it and pushed it and pushed it into our households.  with now a young lady, instead of making sure you got a crib car career gonna stay forever, she can have much unprospected sex.  She won't have as many baby daddies as she won't with as many losers as she want.  They run off, she won't ever miss a meal.  reward bad behavior, you get 30,000 times more of it.  If they initiate the purge tonight, tonight you will see the murder rate go up times 1,000.  If they say, okay, tonight's the purge.  And then people the next day, oh, purges have nothing to do with the murder rate going up.  What?  Stop it.  I actually, and I know, I wouldn't be here.  I would be dead or in jail had my father not sat me down and said, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What the hell do you think you're doing?  No, you ain't, no, this ain't going.  I ain't cheering for this.  No.  You doing some stupid, no.  These rappers, I hear this music.  He hated it.  He hated rap.  Hated it.  As I'm starting to.  Um.  We all have to come together.  We tripping.  You know, we letting these young brothers think that this is the cool ish to do.  I'm watching still, and some of these rappers, man, was just blowing up.  FBG Duck was blowing.  Wando or whatever dude name was.  I don't follow these young cats, man.  But some of them was really good.  And now, over some beef, probably over what set you from, what hood you from, and you don't own a block, you don't own a piece of real estate on that block.  You don't own a piece of real estate on that block.  My man was looking around, so you know he was already beefing with somebody, he was already watching his surroundings.  But he didn't peep the car sitting right there in broad daylight.  Car looked like the windows might be tinted.  But who expects this on broad daylight?  This was caught on tape.  This was caught on tape.  So, at 29 years old, and then a lot of these young rappers are fathers, what happens then?  We do have the jail, the prison.  We got a lot of black men locked up in prison.  We got a lot of black men strung out on drugs.  It's a lose-lose situation.  You take the head of that household out, and now you got World War II on these streets.  Democratic cities, let's name them.  New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, Chicago, L.A.  What do they have in common?  The murder rate is through the roof.  Through the roof.
