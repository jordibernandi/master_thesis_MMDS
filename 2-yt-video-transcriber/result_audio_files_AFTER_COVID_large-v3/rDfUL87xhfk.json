I was going after Mr.  Salty Cracker, I believe almost a year ago.  At that time, I think he had 75,000 subscribers.  And of course, people are going to point to the fact that he's becoming way more successful as something to prove that his rhetoric is either resonating with more people, which is true, I would agree with that, but also that it's correct.  And that one's really dangerous.  476,000.  Thousand.  Subscribers.  that's that's in a year.  that's one year.  he's gained almost 400 000 subscribers.  that's more growth by the way than anyone on the left.  okay that's more growth than vosh.  that's more growth than both the fifth column those those are two of the fastest growing channels there are on the left.  that's that's way more growth than the majority report than david packman.  way more growth than kyle kolinsky way more growth than even jimmy dore.  and jimmy dore is like the alex jones of the left.  So it is dangerous how quickly this kind of messaging is not only working on people, but is just catching on like wildfire.  And that is something that you can't ignore.  That is something that no one should ignore.  And I've been learning the reasons why.  I mean, the reason a lot of this messaging points are actually appeals to people.  And if you go through this list, it's everything you'd expect, right?  Jimmy Kimmel cries during monologue.  Joy Reid racially attacks Judge Clarence Thomas.  Democrats fail to steal.  Restream.  Billions of ballots appear.  4 a.m.  for Joe Biden.  Unleash hell on the commies.  CNN mental health expert says Trump is worse.  Kamala Harris just openly admitted that she is a liar.  Fake Kamala Harris caught tricking minority voters.  Dems go for the steal.  Lady Gaga goes full cringe.  It's billions.  Yeah, billions.  Billions and billions.  And it all looks very lo-fi.  Like I said, production value is zero.  He just has to turn on the camera, speak for seven minutes, put in a couple clips.  There's no writing.  There's no research.  That's basically all you need.  But anyways, we have to be better at... At tapping into this, and I'm not saying you have to appeal to Nazis, it would be really disingenuous to say that the whole reason that this stuff is so popular is because they are all white nationalists, or because they're all just racists.  That's not true, alright?  Most of the people who this is appealing to, most of the people who are looking to follow this, the reason is, is because they tap into something that other people haven't been able to.  everyone feels like there are these huge differences between the rich and the poor that there are these elites and and you know that there are these oligarchs these these ceos these corporations who control everything who have all the power.  and under our current system yeah the more wealth you have the more power you have.  and some people are really good at tapping into that and pointing them towards globalists pointing them towards international banking cabals, pointing them towards Jewish people.  And galvanizing them and making them think, well, the reason that I can't, you know, have anything more than a stagnant wage, the reason I can't make it in everyday life is because of these globalists, because of these shadowy people who work behind the scenes.  And who do I look to on the other side?  I look towards, you know, the liberals.  They're condescending.  all right they're.  they're these uh elitist uh big city folk uh who like to talk about uh how much they care about the working class.  but at the end of the day they spend all year in these big cities and then that's all they really care about.  and then there's these people on the left and they just seem to be talking about things that i i don't understand.  they're talking about how there's multiple genders and they're talking about how there's like a patriarchy and that there's all these systems of class antagonism and stuff like that.  and and then you You know, every single one of them calls me a hick and a racist and white trash and that just makes me feel like a complete and utter shit.  So yeah, I'm gonna listen to channels like this.  I'm gonna listen to someone like Salty Cracker who makes jokes, he makes fun of them, he calls them cucks, he calls them libtards, all these different words.  that makes me laugh, makes me feel a little less shitty about my current situation.  That's how you get pulled into this.  And then before you know it, video after video after video starts to vilify certain groups.  They start to vilify the black population of the United States because it's like, well, at the end of the day, they're committing all these violent crimes, so it kind of just makes sense.  It's culture, isn't it?  Or maybe it's even, I don't know, genetics and population, as we learned from the last one.  And then you keep getting deeper down this rabbit hole.  You get more and more indoctrinated into all of this.  And... All because of the very same alienation that everyone else is feeling.  All because of the growing inequities, the poverty of the United States. ",
