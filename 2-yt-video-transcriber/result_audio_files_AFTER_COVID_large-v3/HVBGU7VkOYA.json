Do you think a spider can breathe underwater?  Well, the diving bell spider can.  True, it has no gills and other useful devices that fish have, but it does have an amazing ability.  Maybe it's even a little bit of a wizard.  Have you seen the fourth Harry Potter movie?  We need that scene in the lake.  The second trial of Triwizard Tournament and Cedric Diggory.  he used the bubble head charm to breathe underwater smart guy.  so it seems wait what's a spider have to do with all this?  oh yeah it can do the same thing and doesn't even need a magic wand.  the diving bell spider is considered the only species of spider that lives underwater almost all the time.  hunting resting mating feeding laying eggs wintering all this it can do without rising to the surface.  the only thing a spider can surface for is a supply of oxygen which sometimes has to be replenished.  Otherwise, something like that very head bubble comes in handy.  When the diving bell spider dives into the water, the abdominal hairs, covered with a special fatty substance, don't get wet.  Air is trapped between them, which allows the spider to stay underwater for a long time, using a primitive natural aqualung.  But this is not the only way to store oxygen.  The diving bell... ",

While some spiders have learned to hold their breath with their webs, others have mastered flight.  Welcome to the arachnophobe's nightmare.  Some of these creatures can actually fly.  Or rather, they sort of float in the wind.  Using a web, they can rise several kilometers into the air.  And what's more, some of them are even able to float across the ocean.  At least that's what scientists think.  Compared to the spider's web, the air is similar to a thick liquid, so the effect of gravity is easily neutralized by what can be called the stickiness of the air.  It's pretty hard to drown when you're floating jelly.  Also, only small and very light spiders can fly.  By the way, this is a completely conscious action.  Before flying, spiders test the wind by lifting their front paw.  They test it.  They prefer a breeze of about 11 kilometers an hour.  Only one question remains.  why in fact is all this happening?  well despite the fact that scientists still don't know everything about spider flight it seems that the reason is simple colonization.  the young ones go on flights to find suitable places for themselves and to give life to a new generation.  well and scare the crap out of someone.  well let's leave the horrors of flying spiders for a while and turn to the wonders of nature that don't give you premature gray hair.  imagine that you're walking through the park and suddenly you hear the sound of blasters.  Seriously, the stormtroopers are missing again.  Wait, why would there be stormtroopers near my house?  No, you're not crazy.  There's just a lyrebird lurking somewhere in the bushes.  Firebirds are amazing creatures that can imitate natural and artificial sounds with amazing accuracy.  In general, it absolutely doesn't matter for them whom or what they imitate.  Other birds?  Sure.  Koalas?  Yup.  Dingoes?  No problem.  A chainsaw giving someone a total immersion in a horror movie?  Why not?  How about a sudden car alarm next to a liar bird, making the car owner jump out into the street for a long time because of that false alarm that the liar bird made? ",

I think I finally found living confirmation of the expression, you are what you eat.  By the way, if that expression really works, then honestly, I won't even speculate on what this lizard ate, but it can walk on water.  Jesus.  very fast it looks insanely funny.  i don't know why but i can't watch.  quite my god it's lizard jesus as it runs away.  and here's another fact for you.  this lizard is called the common basilisk.  just imagine that it's not a giant snake crawling through the pipes inside hogwarts but Something's running.  And it's that.  It seems that such a choice of monster would slightly undermine Slytherin's credibility.  But back to the basilisk's unique ability.  For a long time, scientists couldn't figure out how it managed to stay on the surface since the lizard weighs so much more than all sorts of water snakes.  In the end, it turned out that the basilisk paddles with huge claws rather than actually running on the water.  By the way, it can run up to 500 meters on the water surface at a speed of 12 kilometers an hour.  On land, it moves a little slower and can easily do without oxygen for up to half an hour.  And if humans are clearly superior to basilisks in two points, we somehow don't get along with running on water.  Someone's already invented special shoes and liquid mountaineering.  But let's be honest, we're not going to get into the Slytherin beasties yet.  So you better take a look at this picture.  A bird with lots of legs.  Sometimes nature makes very strange creatures.

The rest belong to the chicks who hide under the father's wings.  Actually, even the two legs of jacanas are quite unusual.  Because of their elongated toes and claws, the bird's weight is distributed over a larger area, allowing them to walk on leaves floating in the water.  And they do it rather quickly.  As soon as a predator appears on the horizon, the caring parent hurries to the chicks to hide them under the wings.  It's believed that sometimes the chicks fall from the leaves, and then the father fishes them out, dries them, and warms them.  And if that seems like it's not a real ability to you, let me remind you.  We're talking about the animal world here.  A world where you can be eaten the minute you're born if your parents don't take care to protect you.  And who else would be so cool to save their kids?  Cuttlefish don't really care about their offspring, but they have another ability.  It's hypnosis.  Yeah, I agree.  You don't think of a perfect predator when you say cuttlefish, but they're actually really cool.  When they hunt, these creatures purposely create running stripes on their bodies with their chromatophores.  Not only do they look like disco kings, but they also hypnotize their victims.  You would think that crabs and shrimps have enough intelligence to realize that danger is approaching them.  But on the other hand, it's really, really so beautiful.
