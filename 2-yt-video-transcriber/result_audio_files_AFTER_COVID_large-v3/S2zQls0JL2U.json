So you're lucky.  you called during a pandemic because this is when it's one of the only times the government seems to be helping.  But what are they doing?  I mean, I read an article today that said that it goes, it peaks at 40 days and it dies at 70 days.  no matter what you do.  If we had no rules whatsoever and no cops, people would start seeing that they're getting contagious.  They'd go, I went to that restaurant.  They got sick.  My neighbor's sick.  I'm not going to restaurants anymore.  I believe they would self-quarantine based on their own personally calculated risk.  And I think that's what we should all do now.  I think old people, big, fat, disgusting pigs, sick people should avoid contact with other people because it's not worth the risk.  But the rest of us would like to get back to work, please.  And that's what's happening, too.  Like we had that caller earlier talk about Trump derangement syndrome.  Sorry, Trumpers going to Sparrow Hospital and blocking it.  Like Trumpers are the only ones ignoring the quarantine.  Teenagers, blacks, Hasidic Jews, they're not participating in any of this.  Like I was driving around my neighborhood the other day and I saw two young people, a boy and a girl in a convertible.  And when they got to the stoplight, I went, oh, that must be a brother and a sister, right?  They were all quarantining.  And then they kissed.  And then I go to the park with my boy.  We're riding bikes.  And I see another couple making out.  And I realize incest is rampant in my community.  There's all these brothers and sisters making out.

And I said, what a horrible thing to happen to 300,000 people.  uh, obviously kidding.  And everyone got the joke and laughed.  So that gave me the, I've kind of forgot that Americans are so intolerant and, um, what's well, the, the American left is so incapable of irony and sarcasm.  But anyway, in that piece, 10 things I hate about the Jews.  And it was originally entitled 10 things that with the goddamn motherfucking Jews.  And it was a funny piece, piece of satire about, um, Well, first of all, it started out just bitching about the general culture the way I would bitch about Scottish culture or Irish culture, about how the food is annoying and the accents and all that shit.  But then at the end, I pull it together.  I was actually quite proud of this particular piece.  And I pull it together and I say, look, we're in the same boat.  And I was talking really to Israeli liberals and saying, we have your best interests in mind, both under siege from Islam.  And Judeo-Christianity needs to become a thing.  You have to recognize that 90,000 Christians are being killed a year by radical Islam.  They're out to get you.  They're out to get me.  So you see your wall here has brought terrorism from an attack a day to zero.  So you should support Trump and support the wall.  And believe me, I met a ton of Israelis who are pro-Trump.  But I was annoyed by the Israelis who are anti-Trump because Trump has their best interests in mind.  So that article was a joke article.  That video was a funny article about how... We see Jews and Christians as adversaries, especially when it comes from the left, and they're the same thing.  I mean, to get back to what I was saying earlier about how little we disagree on, the whole Jew-Christian thing comes down to, did Jesus do miracles?  How long did he do miracles for?  Like, three days?  All right, so we disagree about three fucking days.  Can we unite, please?  That was the end of the video.  Can we unite, please?  But we're living in a crazy fucking time right now.  that is all about the Nazi thing.  And if you can discredit someone, Me Too helps.  If you can find something dirty on someone with a secretary or even an allegation, that you can do that.  But that's hard to find.  Nazi's much easier.  It's just, that guy's a Nazi.  And people go, really?  Like, Faith Goldie was at a restaurant in Toronto, and someone went... Like Invasion of the Body Snatchers?  Nazi!  And no one questioned the allegation.  This one woman went, that's a Nazi?  She's a racist?  And then the woman, who had no idea who Faith Gould was, collapsed to the floor.  I'm not lying.  You can ask Faith about this.  And started going, oh my god, there's a racist in this fucking restaurant.  Convulsing on the fucking ground.  That's where we're at.  So you can be interesting and funny with an article like Divorce Your Wife, where I said that was the title of it.  And I said, I was talking about marriage.  And I said, if you're having trouble with your marriage, divorce your wife.  Dump her.  She's done.  Now you want to find someone who gets along with your kids, who's your type, you have stuff in common with.  Oh, there's one.  Your wife.  So just recourt her and pretend it's your new girlfriend.  Because I grew up in the 80s where divorce was big.  And I would see these people.  I'd see my dad's friends leave their wives because that was a thing to do.  That was in the 80s.  And then I'd see them remarry the same fucking woman.  So in my Divorce Your Wife article, I said, yeah, get rid of the bitch.  And now court the one that's living already here.  You don't have to spend any money on the divorce.  Let's do it.  And no one gave a shit about that because we live in an anti-marriage society.  And that's not a thing.  But if I do the exact same bait and switch with 10 things I hate about the Jews, they're so excited that they might have a Nazi that they go through the fucking roof and say he literally hates Jews.  They don't do any, you know.  armchair thinking.  Ezra Levant flew him to Israel. ",
