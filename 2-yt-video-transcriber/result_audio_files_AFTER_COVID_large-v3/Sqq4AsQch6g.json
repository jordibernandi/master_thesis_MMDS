            "text": "So I just watched this video by Jeremy Corbell, and he's interviewing Chad Underwood, the man who filmed the Tic Tac UFO, supposedly.  And he has a number of interesting things, but what I want to focus on is what pertains to my video, No Sudden Moves.  which is about the FLIR video and trying to demonstrate whether the object actually moves or not.  And I show various points at which the camera loses lock.  at the same time he switches between one camera and another.  And I thought that demonstrated fairly clearly that it was in fact losing lock, but it seems like obviously people disagree with me and Chad Underwood disagrees with me.  Or does he?  I think what Jeremy actually asks him isn't actually, you know, have a look at Mick's video and see if you agree with it or not.  He doesn't even mention anything about it.  And he kind of asks kind of misleading questions, I must say.  So I'm going to just kind of go through it.  This is like the second time I've watched it.  I've just kind of queued it up at the interesting point around the no sudden moves type discussion.  And we will, I'll kind of live comment on what actually happens.  Let's see. ",

            "text": "All righty.  So Jeremy Corbell says debunkers say that it only appears to be moving because you are banking your craft.  And this is not what we say.  This is not what debunkers say.  I don't know any debunkers say.  And it's obvious he's not banking the craft because you can see the actual horizon indicator does not move.  So he is asking him completely the wrong question.  The real question you should be asking is, debunkers say the camera loses lock because you're switching between different cameras, narrow and wide, field of view cameras, or between infrared and TV cameras, different cameras, physical cameras that are actually different, different lenses or different light paths switched by mirrors.  It doesn't matter.  But they're actually switching something physically, and this causes the lock to be lost.  That's the question he should be asking.  Instead, he asks, did it lose lock because you are banking your plane?  And, of course, Mr.  Underwood replies, no, of course not. ",
