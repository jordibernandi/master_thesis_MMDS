            "text": "Hello everyone.  Today is Thursday, September 10th, 2020.  And I'm here to make the third part of the last of the videos.  It's been very difficult.  I want to try to get it, but there's so many things going on.  So I came up here to do what I got to do.  As I told you earlier, we are staying temporarily with another couple who has been very sweet to us.  And we're hoping to get where we need to be soon.  I'm hoping.  So, anyway, that's beside the point.  This is the third part.  I'm going to give it to you and I'm going to say there's some other things that I want to give you.  This third part is called, and this is the title the Lord gave me, Thus saith the Lord, repentance is not obsolete.  In other words, you cannot... Replace it, or is it an option?  Thus saith the Lord, repentance is not obsolete.  Okay, here begins the word.  Second wave, second wave.  Boom, boom.  Hell opens up its mouth to devour.  Sound, second wave, second wave.  Sound wave, sound wave.  Death.  Destruction.  Pandemic.  Master Lock.  Those are the first words I was given.  California.  California, Death Valley.  Flames of hell will come to you, and you will wish for death.  Mutant armies will come to consume you.  War is on both sides of America, on their shorts, particularly California.  The second pandemic wave will be much, much worse.  Cannot emphasize that enough.  The furnace of many, many afflictions.  There will be death on the streets.  Death in your homes.  Shootings of magnitude.  Blood will drip in this nation.  Times, times, times are in my hand, says the Lord.  Permanency.  A permanent lockdown will occur.  Within this lockdown, will families be taken out of their homes?  I believe they started it early.  Satan is on a rampage, understand that now, to move things ahead.  Military will not hesitate to break down doors, break out windows, shoot without advance notice.  And when any officer or leader talks about camps, they are speaking about FEMA camps.  That is Federal Emergency Management Agency and you will not come out.  There will also be deals that have been wagered and then broken.  Laws wrote down and used against the people.  Orders of mass destruction will be given.  That was the end of this word from the Lord.  There was no visions.  That was boom, boom, boom.  Very firm.  This is the words.  This is the words.  This is the words.  This is where we are right now.  Things are moving quickly because the enemy is moving it fast.  God brings in the times of judgment on his will and in his way.  And they will not be broken.  I am not here to give you a pity party or to give you a wonderful speech of peace, peace.  I would advise you to read Jeremy 8.  That is one of the scriptures the Lord has given me, all the chapter.  Now, quickly, quickly, I must move on, quickly.  Following this was a word from the Lord in our conversation together the same day.  America, time's up.  The downfall of America will be of its own demise.  Power of America will be taken.  The carnal church will be shattered in pieces, but those that truly know me will rise to the occasion, fearless, bold, and refreshed, knowing the cause, bringing in souls, and once more I will be their God and you will be my people.  And that is the end of that one for part three.  Now I'm going to go on.  This early morning I've been having some Dreams, some words, and some more.  I'm going to tell you right now.  California, you are in, as I said earlier, Death Valley.  You need to repent right now.  Those of you that want God to bring you out and bring you into safety or secure you where you are.  Repent.  O ye nation, repent.  For the day of the Lord is at hand.  Ohio.  I have a message for you.  The Lord says, I know what your government has done.  I know what the governors are saying.  They are lying to you.  They are bringing in false reports.  They are also moving ahead quickly to put all those and anyone that exposes them or anyone that has the symptoms of COVID in a camp.  You will not come out.  When you are put in a camp, oh Ohio, you are moving forward.  You will be chastised and you will receive the judgments, do you?  Now, with all that being said, I want to say this right now.  I've had people ask me.  I made mention of this in one of my earlier videos here.  I didn't do a whole video.  I just did a mention.  In this second wave, pandemic soon, boils are going to be a part of what?  Judgment.  It's going to be a part of judgment that God allows.  Boils, significant boils.  And this vaccine that they are talking about, I saw it down in Antarctica.  And it is now coming up into different parts.  China, the USA, California, all the states are in on it.  And your governors are going to eventually, if they haven't already, they're going to come together and they're going to sign papers against their state.  I don't want to get too harsh here, but I'm warning by the Lord Jesus Christ that this pandemic is around the corner.  God's judgments are just and they are appointed time.  I don't care what anyone else is saying.  These days or not, God's judgments are appointed, he said.  That is what he remitted to me.  And I'm going to tell you, those that need to be where they need to be had better go quickly.  We're going to have a scavenger hunt on Christians by the time we enter into 2021 as we get into it.  A scavenger hunt of dead bodies.  We're going to have... pandemic that will lock down everybody and every nation.  And if you're not prepared, if you're not out of whatever state, city, if you are being called, you better find out where you can stay and you better know that it is from the Lord and who you will be with.  You cannot just go.  God is not going to send people somewhere where they're not with others.  Never will, never will.  People that go off on their own, you are easy targets for the enemy.  You need to be praying.  I cannot stress this enough.  I'm not going to go into some of the things that I saw.  I'm just going to tell you now.  We are going to see and be here for one of the most horrific and horrendous pandemics the world has ever seen.  And they are moving it quickly forward.  Satan is moving things so fast.  But God still has his hand on the pulse of things.  I can only, only warn you, bloodshed is around the corner.  There's going to be much, much chaos around election time, and I am only told to say this.  Things are not all going to go the way.  people are saying that they are going to go, be it an election or not.  an election.  God is going to shake things up, and it's not all going to be to the good.  God is going to shake people up until they get where they need to be.  God is going to shake up households more than ever before.  God is going to send his people, his prophets, his messengers to shake up areas, to shake up, and Satan knows this. ",
