            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's the Kiwi here and I'm back with another video.  This video is for the more financially prudent followers of this channel or subscribers to this channel, but also it's for more financially prudent people, just period.  I've been wanting to do this video now for a number of years, for about two years, and The only reason I've decided to do this video is there's been a couple of historical markers that have actually started to show up and they're very, very relevant historical markers.  One of the historical markers was the US attack on an Iranian general in Iraq over Christmas time.  And the other historical marker is we're actually living through another spike in retirements.  A huge spike.  2019 and 2020 is the single largest spike in retirements in human history.  And this is a very, very important historical marker.  For a few of you that know me from following this channel, I lived in the United States for 26 years.  While I was living in the United States for that 26 year period I lived the boom bust boom bust boom bust three times and After the third time, I was pretty much done.  I honestly was just, this is just absolute buffoonery.  I need to figure out what causes this stuff.  I need to do some research, something.  I need to find out what causes these huge collapses in the economy.  2008-2010 was a huge one for me because I actually lost some friends that committed suicide because they lost everything.  They lost their jobs, their homes, their savings, their wives and then they just couldn't deal with it anymore and then they killed themselves.  So 2008-2010 for me left a huge impression on me as an individual.  So with that being said, I decided to start doing some serious research.  Around 2012 was when it really started.  And what I did was I brought books.  I brought Milton Friedman's books.  I read those books.  I listened to supposed experts on YouTube.  I read reports, research papers.  I read all sorts of stuff.  And it was absolutely incredible because what I learned from all of this stuff was absolutely fuck all.  It was just all plain gobbledygook to me.  It was just debauchery.  None of it made any sense to me in any way, shape or form.  And so I just kind of dropped it.  I just walked away from it.  After researching this stuff, I most probably... Had my nose up this stuff for most probably about three or four years.  And sincerely, I just could not put anything together.  Well, in 2018, I was listening to a YouTube channel called The Money GPS.  And that individual had a piece of information in that channel in regards to the spikes in retirements.  And I thought to myself, huh, that's a pretty interesting piece of information.  I wonder what would happen if I took that piece of information and I overlapped it with some of this debauchery that would happen on Wall Street.  And when I'm talking about debauchery, I'm talking about the savings and loan debacle, the tech bubble crash, all these ups and downs that we see in the economy.  Sure as shit, there was a correlation.  There was a massive correlation between these spikes and retirements and when there was always some sort of something happening on Wall Street.  But there was also something else that always happened.  There was always some sort of war.  So we have spikes and retirements, buffoonery on Wall Street, and wars all correlating around the same time period.  So in the late 80s, early 90s, we had the old boys that fought during the Second World War.  What did we have?  We had the savings and loan debacle where people lost billions of dollars.  All the retirees, not all of them, but a good number of retirees that fought during the Second World War lost their shorts and off to Iraq.  Yeah, off to Iraq.  The United States went.  Had to bring some freedom to Iraq.  Okay.  Then we fast forward to the late 90s.  We had the silent generation.  The silent generation was the group of people that were born before the Second World War or during the Second World War.  That's my father's age group.  Now, a lot of these individuals were exceptionally wealthy.  And the reason why they were exceptionally wealthy was a lot of them inherited their company's Businesses and corporations etc.  from their fathers that had fought during the Second World War.  Well that generation was coming on strong at a far younger age.  They were the first real generations to start retiring earlier in life.  So they started putting a heavy draw on the system in the late 90s early 2000.  We all know what happened in early 2000, don't we?  Yeah, we had 9-11 And not only did we have 9-11, we had the tech bubble crash.  And we all can remember George Bush getting up there and going, you need to get out there and spam, spam, spam, because we got to fund this war, boys and girls.  So we had that going on.  Then we had the next group of people that started to retire.  That group of people was the first wave and baby boomers.  The first wave of baby boomers started to retire around that 2008, 2010 mark, and boom, what did we have?  We had the GFC, the global financial crash, and it was all blamed on the housing market, okay?  So we had this huge market crash, but the US and its allies were already at war, correct?  Yeah.  There was one thing that people did miss, though.  Around 2010, what happened?  ISIS showed up out of the blue, didn't they?  Just out of nowhere, ISIS just popped up.  America's back to war again.  We've got to up the troops into Afghanistan.  We've got to do this.  We've got to do that.  And it was rather ironic because ISIS supposedly popped up out of nowhere after Obama removed all the troops out of Iraq and left a huge power vacuum there.  So, accident?  No, not at all.  None of this stuff is an accident.  None of it.  It's all premeditated, preplanned, prethought out.  So that brings me to this point.  And this point is... 2019, 2020, we're seeing the largest spike in retirements in human history.  There's never been a larger spike in retirements, period.  And after talking with my friend in Nevada, who is the CFO and partner of a multi-million dollar corporation, and running my hypothesis past him, he said, you're bang on.  You're right on the money.  It's the reason why we got the hell out of California.  We've sold up everything and we have locked down on the business.  And the reason they did that is because of the fact that they are my age group.  We lived through the debauchery of 2008 and my age group, as a whole are just that much more tuned in and that much more aware of what's going on around us.  It's the reason I actually got out of the United States, not just California, but got the hell out of the United States because based on the stuff that I was seeing and these historical markers that were coming down the pipeline, I was literally like, it's not going to be good here.  And so... After talking with him, running my hypothesis bio, that's why I'm doing this video.  So, 2020.  We've got the single largest spike in retirements in human history.  The money that is owed the final wave of baby boomers is trillions upon trillions upon trillions of dollars over their life expectancy.  You have state and federal pensions that are owed them that are somewhere in the vicinity of $5 trillion.  Then with their retirements, their 401ks, their investment portfolios, savings, you name it, there's another $5 trillion plus on the sidelines.  Now that's $10 trillion that was owed to them two years ago.  And that's over their projected life expectancy.  Now, the 396 people that control the financial institutions are worth somewhere in the vicinity of only $50 trillion.  So, do you really expect these financial institutions and the people that control those financial institutions, the corporations,  etc.,  to pay out $1 a fifth of their entire wealth to these retirees?  No.  It's not going to happen.  They're not going to pay you out.  They will pay you out a little bit, but then all of a sudden, there'll be some sort of false flag attack of some sort in the United States.  that will start some sort of conflict again.  That's where the historical marker of the attack on the Iranian general comes into play.  Because it was a litmus test to just see how fast Americans are willing to go to war.  And that baby boomer generation, that generation that's coming on strong right now, retiring, they were ready to go to war like that.  So it was a litmus test.  They're like, okay.  We've got these guys exactly where we need them.  Perfect.  So, I personally expect, because if you look at 2008, 2010, there was six odd trillion dollars got wiped off the freaking face of the earth.  It just vanished off into some other people's pockets.  Gone.  So, If you look at the historical markets going back, there's always been a certain percentage of the population that just lose everything.  So if you think in any way, shape, or form that these individuals that run these financial institutions and these corporations that own these financial institutions, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, if you expect there's 396 odd people to actually want to pay out their trillions of dollars in wealth, to you, you are delusional.  Straight up.  So, within the next couple of years, you can expect, without a doubt, you can expect a market crash of some sort, and you can expect some sort of false flag attack.  Because that's what's happened all the way along.  Period.  So, Like I said, within the next couple of years, my prediction is by the end of 2022, the economy is going to be in a free fall.  They will re-elect Donald Trump.  Donald Trump will be re-elected because presidents in the United States aren't elected, they're chosen.  And his job is to sell the American public, especially that dopey final wave of baby boomers who are so arrogant, so narcissistic, so hedonistic.  It's unfreaking fathomable.  His job is to sell these individuals on how great America is doing and how great the economy is doing and everything's okay and all that sort of stuff.  Boom, there'll be some sort of massive market crash.  then some sort of massive false flag attack and all that money is going to get wiped off the face of the earth and Americans are going to be so angry and so pissed off.  They'll be all back to war again.  And this next war will be a huge war and it will be in the Middle East.  It will be absolutely massive.  They're gearing up for this stuff.  So I'm just giving you this, giving you a heads up because What I did was I removed all my money, what little I had, my personal belongings, everything.  I removed them out of the United States because I just knew that something bad is going to be happening, something massively bad.  So if there is any way that you can get any of your assets, financial assets or anything like that out of the  U.S.,  I would really highly recommend doing it.  If any of you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments section below.  I hope that some of you are savvy enough to actually follow the information.  A lot of people are doing it.  A lot of people are pulling their money out of the United States.  The real smart ones are.  The real smart ones are.  Outside of that, all the best to you guys.  And I'll talk to you later.  Cheers, guys. ",
