            "text": "Well, howdy there, Internet people.  It's Beau again.  So today, we're going to talk about what the president apparently plans to do this week.  The president is currently Donald J. Trump.  It has been said, kind of indicated, that he intends on leaning into this whole little thing he has going on with the social media companies as a way of changing the story, as a way of distracting people.  from the giant mess that he created.  He intends on framing it as a First Amendment issue.  So let's just go ahead and get out in front of all of this.  What is the purpose of the Bill of Rights?  What was it designed to do?  Protect us, the people, either individually or as a collective, or the states, either individually or as a collective, from the federal government.  So if you happen to be a senator or representative or, hypothetically speaking, the chief executive of the federal government, it's going to be really hard to genuinely frame something as a First Amendment issue.  The goal of the Bill of Rights is to protect us, the people, from the government, not protect the government from the people.  None of these private entities have to platform President Trump.  None.  That's not a thing.  That's not a First Amendment issue.  I don't know that Twitter actually can violate someone's First Amendment rights on their own.  I would think they need the federal government or a state government, somebody, to step in and compel them to do it.  I don't know that it's actually possible for them to violate somebody's First Amendment rights.  As is usually the case, the president, when he is talking about the Constitution, appears to be so wrong that he has it literally backwards.  I would suggest that the president's attempt to force a private entity to carry his message is actually the First Amendment violation.  Put this into any other time period.  Take it out of today where you have social media.  This would be the equivalent of the president requiring every newspaper in the country to carry his message.  That's wild.  That sounds like something some two-bit dictator would want.  Doesn't sound like something that should happen in the United States.  It's a private entity.  It does not have to carry the president's message.  Period.  Full stop.  As chief executive, he's going to have a real hard time making this case legally.  But that doesn't mean he can't attempt to create fake outrage about it and change the story.  distract from what happened.  At the end of the day, the President of the United States allowed the Capitol to fall.  That's the story.  I would suggest that that's an important enough story that it shouldn't be replaced by the President having his feelings hurt because he can't tweet.  Those things don't seem to be on the same level.  Those things don't seem like the same level of importance.  Do not allow yourself to be distracted by this.  Don't get sucked into this.  He is very good at manipulating the media and manipulating people's emotions and changing the story.  The President of the United States allowed the Capitol to fall.  That's the story.  Anyway, It's just a thought.  Y'all have a good day. ",
