Good guys can be great men, but in the eyes of some women they will never be good enough.  until until their time has run out and they're nothing more than discarded leftover women it is only then that these not good enough good guy men become good enough.  the sad thing is many of these men think they've found love but from many of these women's points of view they've found a sucker A fool.  A man willing to take her on.  Baggage and all.  Baggage and all.  Yeah, right.  So I have a video today.  Why do we pick good guys last?  Listen to black women.  Yeah, don't listen to black women.  Don't listen to any women.  But seriously.  A video by Madame Noir.  I think I've heard of it before.  8k likes to 5.2k dislikes.  Who wants to bet most of those dislikes are from men?  Yeah, they are.  But why do women pick good guys last?  Why are good guys not good enough from the beginning?  Is it because more women have more choice and option?  But in a sense, it makes a lot of them trashy women.  No one cares.  And my last point before we begin, does the more bodies a woman acquire through her adult life, does that lower her value?  does it?  yes yes it does.  yes yeah i'm answering the question myself.  but yeah yeah tell me what you think.  but yeah yeah it does.  well i hope you're doing well.  hope your week has been good.  week's almost done month is almost done and it's been a strange month already.  but this of course is replicant fish.  welcome back.  glad you could join me again.  the epic sci-fi noir.  yeah replicant fish.  indeed let's begin.
