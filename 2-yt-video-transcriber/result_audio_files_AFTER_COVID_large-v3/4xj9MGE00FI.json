That's right, this week's episode is a collaboration with legendary prank phone caller Longmont Potient Castle.  I think most of you probably know Longmont, but if you're somehow unfamiliar, please do pause now, go over to longmontpotioncastle.com, Google him, see what the lore is all about, and then come back.  All right, now that you're back, we can get into this fantastic and very exciting episode as Longmont Potion Castle phoned Rudy Giuliani, Ed Till, Joe Messina, and Matt Connerton.  First, though... I decided it would be a good idea to provide Longmont with a contact number for Alex Jones, and it turned out that he already had a contact number for one of Alex Jones' friends, and so we tried to connect them for an exciting project.
