That Trump is worse because he's more brazen in his support for the Israeli extreme right, or that he's increased bombing overseas to record levels.  That Biden is worse because he promises to confront Assad, or push a more hawkish policy towards Russia.  Trump says he's better because he wants detente with North Korea and will end the war in Afghanistan.  Biden says he is better because he wants detente with Iran and will end the war in Yemen.  Neither give us any reason to believe them.  Biden's already proven his pro-war cred, as he not only championed the invasion of Iraq, but actually wanted to split it up into three separate countries.  And who can forget presiding over the birth of America's killer drone empire?  So-called anti-establishment Trump bragged.  he let the Pentagon take the gloves off, giving them unprecedented authority.  Trump doubled civilian casualties, increased troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, orchestrated coups in Bolivia and Venezuela, and brought us to the doorstep of world war by attacking Iran.  Taken in their totality, Trump and Biden debating foreign policy is not much different than Nazi officers debating the military strategies of Hitler.  The hard truth is that Trump and Biden are both committed to a global military empire and endless war that kills and subjugates millions of people, to using CIA plots, occupation, and brute force to impose and expand US capitalism around the world.  All independent nations are on their list for overthrow or destruction.  Trump and Biden just have different timelines, with different targets and tactics.  The debate over who is better on foreign policy becomes reduced to speculating who is more likely to start World War III, or dissecting who will provide minor improvement in this or that country, knowing there's a trade-off for more hawkish policy against others.  How can such a thing be quantified?  Which lives are worth more?  And which country should we compromise killing people in order to stop them being killed in another?  These are deeply disturbing questions.  And what's never acknowledged is that on foreign policy, Trump and Biden actually agree on far more than they disagree on. ",

Anyone who cares about ending this murderous legacy and the dark reality of the U.S.  as a global occupation force needs to understand that peace is not on the ballot.  The only path out of this is building a grassroots anti-war struggle that fights both parties, using the only language they understand, disrupting and shutting down business as usual for the war profiteers and politicians who support this imperial world order.  This entire system, from the political establishment to the Pentagon leadership, runs on the ideology of American supremacy.  The U.S.  doesn't have imperialist policies.  The U.S.  is an imperialist country.  We must build a movement that challenges this premise and comes in direct confrontation with it. ",
