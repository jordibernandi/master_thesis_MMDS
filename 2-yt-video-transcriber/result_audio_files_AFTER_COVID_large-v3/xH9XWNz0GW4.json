            "text": "Good evening, government property.  The Capitol has been stormed, the Georgia Senate runoff election results are in, and the Electoral College has certified the election.  We'll tell you what you think about all these things and more, but first, we'd like to begin by congratulating Nancy Pelosi, who earlier this week banned gendered terms like mother and father from being used in the House.  It's a progressive step to help dissolve the loving fabric of families that is so troubling.  It's also a much needed and powerful step toward censoring God, as God has used gendered terms like man and woman in the Bible.  repeatedly.  With the admirable left leadership in our country, we can look forward to the evil word of God being progressively eroded away in exchange for the all-loving, omnipresent word of the government, which seems to be more trustworthy than God.  On the note of ungodly intellectualism, on January 3rd, the 117th Congress kicked off with a Missouri representative concluding a prayer with Amen.  and a woman.  As the left insists on banning gendered words, their intellectual superiority compels them to make up new gendered words and use them.  A woman.  A word with a deep and rich meaning to balance out amen.  Amen has a meaning of truth and solidarity.  As a woman balances out that meaning, it apparently has a meaning of lies and division.  Ending a prayer with a woman is a beautiful, subversive way to spit in the face of God and truth while honoring Pelosi, lies, and division.  This just in.  Happy New Year.  It's 1984.  A woman will be in the next edition of News Speak.  In other news, the Georgia Senate runoff.  election results are in, and the left wins both Senate seats.  the left got the most votes in an election.  Surprising, right?  Both Democrats won despite the adversity they faced when Facebook shut down the fundraising pages for both Republican campaigns.  We can only imagine how much the Democratic candidates would have been distracted and probably even heartbroken when Facebook shut down their opponent's ability to campaign.  But the left persevered through the adversity for an inspiring win in another decisively democratic election.  With majority control over the House, the Senate, and the presidency, more on that in a sec, the left will now go unchecked.  From the same people who have brought you unconstitutional mandates like lockdowns and masks, while definitely not deliberately destroying small businesses, you can expect more lockdowns while having additional rights being taken away with spoon-fed reasons that are always in your best interest.  This just in!  They can't take away your freedoms if you're brave enough to disobey them.  Hey, how the hell did this get in here?  And it's written in misgendered ink!  I want you to find who did this and put them on AOC's blacklist.  They'll be the first to go into the new concentration camps.  Oh, but when you find him, tell the public and his family that he caught a virus and needs to be taken away to a FEMA camp for health treatments.  Now that the left has free reign, you can expect them to push your country to look more and more like a democracy while looking nothing like a communist takeover.  Like, not at all.  Like, definitely not that.  But like, if it was that, they'd still call it a democracy while they were doing it.  So like, it'd be cool.  Ahem.  And in other news, at the Capitol, as Congress convened to certify votes, hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters gathered so the mainstream media could call them all racists.  And indeed, our independent fact checkers has verified each one of them is a racist.  And their secondary reason for traveling to the nation's Capitol is because they're crazy enough to think something fishy was going on in this year's election.  Idiots!  These people clearly hate America and are deliberately trying to destroy democracy by ensuring elections are fair and democratic?  These protesters' concerns are baseless, they're all conspiracy theorists, and they're also other words that we use to trigger you to automatically view them in a negative light through our mind control tactics.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Joe Biden won the election hands down.  So go home, all you Trump mega maggots.  This just in, Joe Biden has won the lottery, as you can see here through our exclusive footage of his winning ticket.  Congratulations, Mr.  Biden.  But on a more somber note, unfortunately things turned ugly at the Capitol with violence.  There's absolutely nothing funny about that.  Before those unfortunate events, protesters stormed the Capitol, as you can see here, when barricades were opened for them by police.  Conspiracy theorists suggest the most unruly protesters were Antifa in disguise, just trying to wreak havoc to make Trump and all his supporters look like they're dangerous and trying to overthrow democracy.  Well, luckily, our fact checkers have debunked this claim as false, citing the latest science that shows Antifa wouldn't dress like this.  The fact checkers also denied that it's even possible.  the same alleged Antifa member was at a BLM rally in Arizona in June.  And here he is pictured at that rally, so you can be certain of what didn't happen, according to our fact checkers.  And as you can see, socialist media giant Twitter now lets you know through a manipulated media thought control warning that no Antifa activists stormed the Capitol, according to multiple fact checkers.  And the fact that Twitter does this doesn't make it any more suspicious.  The fact checkers will also let you know that this Trump supporter is definitely not Antifa.  That's why he has the communist hammer and sickle tattooed on his hand.  like most Trump supporters do.  And the most disturbing part of this story that we command you to believe is that President Trump was personally inciting these protesters to violence.  So much so that Twitter removed a video Trump posted where he said to his supporters at the Capitol, you have to go home now.  We have to have peace.  We have to have law and order.  We had the video of Trump's words destroying our narrative about him.  Oh yeah, so we're not playing the video, right?  Duh, of course not.  You ready?  That was followed by both Facebook and Twitter locking Trump out of his accounts.  Big Tech, the new government that governs our government, heroically stepped in and prevented people from hearing Trump say, you have to go home, we have to have peace.  One can only imagine the further violence and carnage that would have happened if Twitter and Facebook let people see that video.  Once again, big tech steps in and has done something for us, for our protection.  Thank God for big tech.  a woman.  Following Trump's ban on social media, the people that ran Joe Biden for president had Joe Biden inspiringly address the nation on video where Mr.  Biden was kept awake for seven and a half minutes.  For his very effective speech, Joe Biden received praise from all of the media, according to the media.  In his speech, he said, democracy is under unprecedented assault.  And indeed it is.  A democracy is where people vote their leaders into office and have faith that their vote counts in a legitimate election.  Otherwise, history always shows there will be an uprising.  And we take a break reporting to you on today's uprising to share a poll with you taken from my Instagram.  People were simply asked, do you believe the next election will be fair and just?  With over 140,000 people viewing the poll, the results are 8% said yes, 92% said no.  And there you have it.  92% of people polled agree.  Our democracy is under assault.  Moving along, late in the night, the Senate voted to reject the objection to electoral college votes from Pennsylvania.  Shocker.  And then the House voted to certify the election results.  Joe Biden is now the president-elect.  He will be your next president.  After the vote, President Trump issued a statement, not on Twitter for some reason, vowing a peaceful transition of power.  To all of us here at the media, that sounds like he's inciting violence and refusing to leave office.  This just in!  The few can only control the many if you are in a state of fear.  Bravery and saying no to surrendering your rights is what will keep you free.  What the hell is this?  We didn't discuss this at Event 201.  Come on, who the hell is doing this?  That's it for today's news.  Tune in tomorrow as we'll be reporting on the latest science.  that shows doing your own thinking causes cancer, but letting the media do your thinking for you is healthy.  No need to go back to sleep because you already are.  Sweet dreams. ",
