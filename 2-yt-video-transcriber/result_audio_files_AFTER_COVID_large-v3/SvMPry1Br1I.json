Under my favorite thing in the world, the postcard with 15 ways to stop the spread, we are changing America.  I, for one, have stopped going to gas station bathrooms, trucker rest stops, and Equinox locker rooms to help stop the spread.  But I know Mr.  President wants to speak on this personally because he was so instrumental in crafting these vital guidelines.  So, Mr.  President... ",

Thank you.  But like he said, I want to read.  I'm wearing the white hat, by the way, because we went golfing today.  It was like perfect.  There's nobody on the course.  So it was like, you know, how can I skip it?  But we're here because we care.  We're going to help the people.  Not so much about the ventilators, though, but we'll see.  But we're going to slow the spread.  That's what they call it.  They say slow the spread.  So I'm going to read this.  This thing, I know it back of my hand, but I'm going to read it anyway.  President Trump's coronavirus guidelines for America.  Postal customer.  For more information, please visit coronavirus.gov.  Okay, so we got the gov now.  We used to only have the dot com.  Remember the dot com?  But we've done some nice things.  We've gotten the gov now.  So that's pretty good, even though some of you won't give me credit.  That's pretty good.  So we got the gov.  That's good.  Cover the rules.  If you feel sick, go home.  It's called homework.  Maybe you do the homework instead.  If your children are sick, get a black or Latin to take care of them.  They're very good at it.  So maybe you want to do that.  If you're old, sorry.  If someone in your household has tested positive, They got to change that.  Well, you know, gross, but they got to change that.  We always say you test positive and then it's like that's bad.  But if you test negative, then it's good.  It's like we got to maybe change that a little bit.  No social gatherings unless, you know, 10 people or more.  That's almost double digits.  Can't do it.  None of that.  Unless it's an Epstein party.  Rest in power, Jeffrey.  Uber Eats.  Don't go to the restaurants.  Go Uber Eats.  That's where I get my McDonald's.  Don't visit nursing homes because they smell like poop.  Good hygiene.  Is that how it's... Hygiene.  Well, hygiene is very important unless it's, you know, born star at a golf club, then it's all bets off.  But we're doing a great job.  You may not report it that way, but we're doing, I think, what's really one of the great jobs.  And so I think that's it for me.  I'm going to go back.  I got a back nine to play, but no ventilators.  Sorry. ",
