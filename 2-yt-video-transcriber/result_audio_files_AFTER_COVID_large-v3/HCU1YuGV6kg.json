            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, an advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  Through my nonprofit, The Lighthouse Project, I've been doing research for a few years, and so now I'm going to start sharing the fruits of that labor with you.  Now over the last few decades, there have been many changes to the law with the goal of improving the lives of women and children.  These changes have taken place both in the Supreme Court of Canada and through Parliament.  After hearing submissions from groups such as the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund, also called LEAF, the National Association of Women and the Law, also called NOL, and feminist law professors who regularly testify as a witness in the House of Commons, in the Senate, as well as contributing briefs to the government to assist them with the crafting of new legislation.  Now, there's a book called The Most Dangerous Branch.  It was written by the late Professor Robert Ivan Martin, and he was writing in this instance, Chapter 7, about the influence of these specific groups in the lawmaking process.  He says, In 1992, amendments to the Criminal Code to change the definition of consent in sexual assault were introduced in and enacted by Parliament.  The amendments in Bill C-49 were largely the work of LEAF.  Catherine MacKinnon was a member of the LEAF committee which consulted with the then Minister of Justice about changes in the law and she authored LEAF's submission to the House of Commons committee studying the bill.  It is interesting that an American feminist legal academic who believes that the whole notion of a woman consenting to sexual relations with a man is questionable should have had an important role in amending Canada's criminal code provisions concerning sexual assault.  It is a measure of the power of LEAF that it drafted a bill which quickly and with little debate became law.  Now, given their role in crafting law, and this isn't just in Canada, and I'll get to that later, it's important that the facts presented by these groups are reflective of reality and accurately represent the legal issues which they purport to speak about to explain the seriousness of their influence.  At the moment, LEAF is collaborating with two groups called Women at the Centre and the Metropolitan Action Committee on Violence Against Women and Children, also called METRAC, on a heavily government-funded project, I've seen so far to the tune of half a million dollars, called Do Justice for All, with the goal to create a whole new type of court that will primarily adjudicate sexual assault trials.  Not only are these groups writing law in Canada, they're being put in charge of making new court systems that will come to different verdicts than the existing judiciary.  And it's unknown whether or not these new hybrid courts will respect due process rights and charter rights of the accused.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you along on my investigative journey so you can see the process and the fact checking that goes into it, assist me with my research if possible, and maybe challenge my findings if you think I got something wrong.  And for lawyers who may be watching this, I want them to be able to use my research to help restore due process in our courts and our lawmaking processes.  The best way to start looking at this situation is to look at something that's current, that's going on in the news and actually going to Supreme Court in Canada.  It will be litigated.  So it's really important that when we get to that point, that these groups are going to be forced to accurately represent the social reality of the issues that are at play here.  So there was a decision from the Ontario Court of Appeal that came out just this June in 2020.  Actually, in fact, a feminist-crafted law was tossed out as unconstitutional.  As is common with these situations, it's a big rabbit hole when you start fact-checking and investigating these groups and these individuals involved.  So the first thing is to pick a starting point.  And in this case, I'm going to look at the origins of the law.  And it was designed in response to a decision from Canada's Supreme Court.  And that case is called Daviol.  So what happened in this case, essentially, is that the Supreme Court decided it was unconstitutional to deny an accused the defense of extreme intoxication if they were in a state of automatism.  This case caused a lot of disturbance in the public.  The media were saying drunk defense now being allowed.  And so of course they rushed off to parliament and within six months, a bill was crafted, had support from all different parties in the government, and was passed into law.  The reason why I'm starting to present it to you right now is because I have come across information that the information given to Parliament when they crafted this law and information that I believe is quite common behind a lot of these changes to the rules and interpretations by the court as it turns out in this case, are based on misinformation.  So in this case, there was a claim that there, since Daviol happened, that there was in that six month timeframe, there were many cases of guys rushing to use intoxication as a defense and that a number of them were successful.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anybody actually looked at those cases that were being referenced and full citations were given.  So we can look up, although in two cases, they are unrecorded or unreported decisions.  So the information only came from the news and those ones I'm working on fact checking.  So for now, I'm going to stick with the ones that I can actually look up and then I'm going to compare them.  to what was said about these cases and whether or not the feminist groups that reference these cases could have even believed what they were saying was true.  And I don't think that's the case.  So I'm going to look first at a paper that's called The Intoxication Defense in Canada, Why Women Should Care.  So this is a report that was prepared and funded by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, but ultimately it was written by a law professor from the University of Ottawa named Elizabeth Sheehy.  And this is important because Elizabeth Sheehy cites this article, not naming herself at some instances, but actually just saying it was a report by this other group, the Status of Women.  So in this article, she says, Since the Supreme Court decision of September 30th, 1994, sending Davyult back for retrial, March 1995, There have been three, and remember that number, three successful extreme intoxication defenses, all involving assaults against women.  In the first, R versus Blair, the case report specifies neither the charge nor the nature of the accused assault upon his wife.  In acquitting the accused, the Alberta judge focused on the accused's two-day drinking binge and on the fact that the accused was an alcoholic and that there was violence in his family.  but that, quote, there was no previous evidence of any violence towards his wife.  in concluding that he, quote, must have been acting or driven by these latent drives within himself that were disconnected with his free will.  And he was not acting voluntarily.  So those quotes actually come from the verdict.  And this verdict can't be found on Canley, but I did find it on Quick Law.  And also, quote, it's important to note that there's an appeal decision in this case and in the appeal they actually overturned the verdict and sent it back to retrial upon which he ended up pleading guilty and was sentenced to.  I've seen both six months and nine months in jail.  so when she says that this was successful I suppose you know at the time she said this.  it was successful But the reason the appeal overturned it was because there was fresh evidence brought in.  It wasn't because the judge was stupid.  It's because fresh evidence was brought in by the Crown, which it didn't realize it needed at trial.  And that was primarily character evidence.  So from the verdict, the information that was available at the time, which I'm going to say was misrepresented, goes as follows, and this is written by the judge.  I am satisfied that it is more probable than not that the accused had consumed medication which would greatly aggravate the effect of that alcohol in inducing automatism.  The important factors in addition to the quantity of alcohol consumed is that the accused, although at the present time does not drink regularly, he is an experienced drinker.  He is an alcoholic.  He began consuming alcohol when he was 11 years of age.  He had a latent memory of spousal abuse, spousal abuse going both ways between his mother and his father, and his father and his mother.  And I am satisfied that it is more than probable than not, I must add this, and this is a very important factor, an extremely important factor, that his actions on this date were completely out of character.  There is no previous evidence of any violence towards his wife.  And indeed, the tests that were completed by both his wife and himself indicate that he and his wife have a good, solid marriage.  So you can see from this that there was some sort of testing involved, and it's important because the onus shifts to the accused to prove that he was in a state of automatism.  But even more bizarre, actually, was I discovered an article in the news that is really quite striking.  It's called With Friends Like Feminists, and so I need help finding this full article, but the abstract of it says, that the article informs that Kimberly Blair, that's his wife, of Leduc, Alberta, whose husband, Carl, is in jail for beating her, has told women's advocates to leave her and her husband alone.  Carl Blair's conviction in January 1996 for beating up his wife while he was drunk.  Kimberly Blair's comments that feminist support, in scare quotes, has not helped her raise her family in Carl's absence.  And it has a response from those advocates.  All right, so I'm just going to close off saying this is one case.  There's 15 cases that I looked at and all of them have the same kind of misinformation about them to varying degrees.  Some are quite amusing.  Although in the end, none of this is amusing because these misrepresentations and what I was reading from earlier, this paper that was written for Status of Women Canada, it is the source material for everything else.  And so when there's a failure to fact check and when there's an assumption that these groups would never lie to us and these groups are actually intensely involved in the crafting of laws and in the decisions of the court this needs to be exposed and it needs to be looked at.  and so what I'm doing here now given that these cases are from 1994 to 1996 you know we're talking decades that nobody's really been seriously fact checking these groups.  and so that ends and I hope that you can help me to put an end to it.  I look forward to telling you about the next case. ",
