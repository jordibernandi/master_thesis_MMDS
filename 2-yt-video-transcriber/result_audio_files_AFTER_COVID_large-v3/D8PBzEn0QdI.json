Something really isn't working even when you dress me up.  Cause to me this change is worthless, made for someone else I'm the mind, nothing else.  in dysphoric living hell Just look at this figure like it's ever gonna pass And think about my mind, is it really so mad?  Got my freak design, I'm a pair mismatched.  But if I'm not this, I can only be that Until I made the deduction, it's all a construction Seems.  I'm not the only one who came to that conclusion.  The labels that you place on me are nothing but a burden.  If you give me duality, I'll have to tear it out.  I fight against my height, could crawl inside my flesh.  My prison is so tight, are you surprised I never left?  Yeah, maybe this knife could really change my life And take away the stress, the weight all off my chest.  Now listen, I don't need your permission.  No proof of my condition No use in trying to fit in.  Now stop looking for threatened.  I wasn't out to burn you Hardly touching your buttons Still lighting up your short fuse Really?  Because of the deduction It's all a construction Seems.  I'm not the only one who came to that conclusion.  The labels that you place on me are nothing but a burden.  If you give me duality I'll have to tear it open!  Well, if what you're trying to say is you're not really one thing or the other, I'm afraid you'll never find a job, and you'll never find a partner.  I have one, you moron, and to them it doesn't matter.  Get your mind out of my groin, someone ought to tell you that.  I'm not a man or a woman, and I knew it as a teen.  You disagree?  Go ahead and tell me what those definitions even mean.  If I don't have to fit a stereotype, can do or wear whatever I like, then what is the point of those words even existing?  To inform random strangers about my genitalia?  So when you look at me, that's all you really see.  But this part of mine, I'm defined completely Given an entire bird, assigned to tell birds To identify with why it has no real word.  I think we've established gender is a concept You can get yours, so why will you not spend?  Us who don't identify with vague ideas and chalk outlines Just draw our own, or step outside Go to and fro, or as you like But don't be kept from breaking out the doors.  we chose Despite the doubt, but it's that or stand against the wall For two could not contain us all.  Thank you. ",
