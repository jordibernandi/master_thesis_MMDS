The thing about what I like about Israelite businesses is probably one of the most honest businesses that you can get into.  What I mean by honest business is because Israelites keep the law.  Our laws prevent us from defrauding one another.  So you have to sell a garment a certain way.  You have to sell clothing a certain way.  You've got to sell the ashwagandha a certain way.  I've got to sell my oils a certain way.  So if I buy something from you, I ain't got to worry about it being no bullshit.  Likewise, if you buy it from me, our laws prevent us from doing that.  And when an Israelite sells something, it's like the whole nation supports that business.  So when I started TLC, Tzariach and Lily's Creations, 90 to 90, I would say 98% of my business is from Israelites.  And I think that's a good thing.  And it shows the power of the dollar when we really deal with each other.  So now y'all can support me, I can support you, and it just helps us grow like that.  So it's like business is important.  So make sure y'all support Daniela's business, support my business, support all these brothers.  You know, I actually became, our brothers make garments, headpieces, the baddest headpieces you can find.  Make sure you support all the businesses that we have.  So I think that's very important. ",

And so as I'm down there, I think it was like a Monday or Tuesday, and this officer out of y'all is telling me this story.  He's holding a baby.  And so I'm thinking it's his.  And, you know, congratulating him.  while I asked him about it.  He said, no.  So he tells me the story.  And so the story is.  there was a sister that came into the school.  She lived a wayward type of lifestyle.  And when she came to the school, she was looking for some type of protection.  She wanted to change.  And so that's what Israelites is about, getting our brothers and sisters to change.  So we teach them how to repent.  And she was pregnant at the time.  So as she's in there pregnant at the time, she had a home, but the home was kind of unstable.  And so Officer Asharnapaj and his rib allowed her to stay with them.  Now, granted, they got 10 kids of their own.  and their family.  So as big as their family is, they still invited this sister to come in and stay with them.  And the whole school would help her, would help her with the pregnancy, if she needed food, if she needed help, you know, prepare for her because the daddy, she didn't know who the daddy was, so the daddy's not around.  Excuse me, I shouldn't say she didn't know who the daddy was, but the daddy was a pimp, I believe.  Wow.  So he's, you know, way off.  So... We're raising her and that child as a sister and soon to be son in the family.  And so she had the baby.  And when the baby came out the womb, she said, what is this?  She didn't even say like, who is this or anything like this?  She said, what is this?  And pretty much rejected that baby the time that it came out of the womb.  But Ashanah Posh and his rib is still taking care of that baby, tending to the baby.  And one day in the middle of the night, she gets up and say, I don't want this baby.  I don't want to take care of this baby.  And she was actually going to leave with the baby.  And so Ashanah Posh's rib, I don't remember her name off top.  I apologize.  But Ashanah Posh's rib said, you can go.  But you can't take the baby, which we'll keep the baby, and you go.  And she agreed to it.  And so they did it legally.  They legally owned the baby or adopted the baby.  And when I heard the story, it was amazing in a few things.  Commander Jenny Hunter has always said, don't kill your baby.  We'll adopt the baby.  And Israelites is always making that mantra that we have the answer to black problems.  And that's a black problem.  That's a straight up and down black problem.  A lot of women out here have frivolous sex.  Men do it too.  have babies and they abandon the babies, whether the father abandons or the mother aborts and stuff like that.  And you don't have to do that because now we're the proof that we'll take that child.  We'll raise that child up.  I believe his name is Samson.  We'll raise that child and bring him up the right way.  And that story is what should go across the earth.  Because we don't just talk it, we live it.  And it reminded me, which you brought to my mind, which I thought about then, of Officer Dawa Da in South Carolina, when Nature Boy was beating the hell out of that sister.  And Dawa Da went, resurrected that sister, helped that sister get the son back, get the children back.  And she's such a beautiful sister in the school. ",

            "text": "Yeah, she's still in the school.  Still married to the brother.  She'll make the best garment that you could see.  So she was able to come into that fold, marry that brother.  That brother was able to resurrect her, heal her from the torture that Nature Boy brought to her.  So when we talk this... You know, you come in here, we'll change your life.  It's not something that we're playing with.  It's something that we will literally do.  So, man, I thank them brothers, Ashanapaj, Hidrib, Dabada, what he does, and Commander Jenny Hunter and the leadership qualities from Commander Jenny Hunter, the generals and captains on down, the leadership that we put inside these other brothers and sisters to do that.  That's what... Israelites should be remembered for.  Like all they want to talk about is that you know this.  All they want to talk about us is we're screaming on them corners.  But screaming on them corners is saving black and women's lives because as we're screaming on the corners, there's brothers and sisters that hear something in that and say, I need to change.  And then they come in here and change.  Or when you're in danger, you know you can go to them Israelites and get an answer.  Even when black people want a real answer in the blackity black world, they come to Israelites to get the answer.  They don't go to no comedic cast.  They don't have no answer.  They don't go nowhere else.  They come to us to get the answer because that's the only place you can get the answer.  So that was an amazing story.  We told that story twice on the radio show.  I had told it in the beginning, and the one that I made the clip out of is the one with Commander Jenny Hanna because he brought them both to the forefront and let them, you know, get their shine and get their glory for what they did.  because, again, they got 10 kids.  You got some people that got one kid won't do it.  So two kids, when they said they had 10 kids, so now they even took on an 11th child to raise from a baby on up.  And here's the most important thing, what that child will know, because a lot of times we look at our life stories.  So like, let's say we grew up in a broken home or we might've been molested.  Well, in this case, he was abandoned.  You might feel depressed growing up like that.  But in reality, what you've got to remember is if you're here, that means God wants you here.  And God has a purpose for you here.  So now he'll be able to tell that story too.  And he come up as a priest and prophet of the most high.  Now his story will be able to resonate.  So for all the abandoned kids that feel like their life is over, now they ain't got to feel that way.  So that's an amazing story. ",
