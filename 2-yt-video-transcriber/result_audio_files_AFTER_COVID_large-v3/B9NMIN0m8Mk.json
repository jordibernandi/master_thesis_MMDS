            "text": "Today I want to discuss obstacles to your exchange.  The most important thing on the day of exchange is not just exchanging your NARS and getting the money in your bank account, but it's about taking what you've invested in and multiplying that.  Because we already know that there will be other currencies that will follow.  All the currencies on the same day?  we don't know.  But we have an idea of which select few that may go on the same day.  Then you also have to look at what will happen to the markets after the revaluation.  Are the markets going to jump up?  Are all those penny stocks and other stocks you're looking at, are they going to start to go up?  You want to be able to make your exchange and be able to do the things you need to do to multiply what you have in your investment.  So just to be aware of the things that could happen, as you can see in the environment that we currently live in, if the Dinar RV was to take place right now, some of you wouldn't be able to exchange.  Some of you wouldn't be able to go to the bank and go purchase these doms.  And some of you may not even be able to go online on the day of the RV and order dong because you don't have enough money in your account to cover it.  Or your car doesn't support purchases like that.  Or you'll be forced to use a credit card.  and if you don't have a credit card then you will not be able, you won't be able to turn around and buy the Vietnamese dong.  Because you can buy Vietnamese dong now.  That's fine.  but when we take the revaluation money.  And let's say you have 100,000 or 200,000 and let's say it's one to one, right?  You can take 10,000 of that and put it right into the Vietnamese dong and maybe put another 5,000 in the Thai baht.  So we're talking about taking your your investment and multiplying that.  And the same goes.  So will you also in all these different stocks that you're looking at?  Because, you know, the economy is going to go through a boom when the revaluation happens.  Our economy is going to get a big boom.  All these different stocks.  that have gone down during this time period, they're all gonna end up jumping back up.  So you definitely wanna be prepared to be able to multiply your earnings.  Your first obstacle, especially if it was to happen in the midst of what's going on right now, some of you won't be able to exchange at all.  You won't be able to go to the bank, your bank might be closed because of the type of situation that your state is in or that your city is in.  And your only other option is going to be to be able to purchase the Vietnamese dong.  Because some of you have held off.  Some of you do have money to where you could go ahead and make the purchase of the dong now.  But there's no point if the Iraqi dinar is the best value.  So some of you may hold off and wait.  until you see the Denar evaluation and then turn around and make your purchase online if you're able to.  because the first thing is what's happening that has happened all around the world is that there's been internet outages.  you may not be able to go online and make your purchases.  You may not be able to go online and look to see what time those banks open.  That's why you need to have that information ahead of time.  You need three banks that deal in exchange for currency and you can buy the currencies that are on your list from, you can buy most of the currencies on that list from your bank.  You need at least three.  Now the other obstacles are which does have to do with the internet.  but if specifically web sites are down that you're using to make your online purchases and to do your online searches because some of you are going to wait until the last moment to start looking for things and those web sites are going to be down.  so say for instance if I'm making my online purchase on the day the revaluation and I'm gonna purchase a 3000 Vietnamese dong on my credit card then I know that I'm gonna be able to cover it.  then I would go ahead and do that.  Now, if my website is down, I need to be able to go to other websites.  Now, of course, the banks, you know, there might be issues with the banks and you actually might be standing in line waiting to exchange your dinar and the announcement comes that the Vietnamese dong has changed in value.  some of you are gonna be in that position.  And so that's what we want to try to avoid for the people that are listening.  Because at the bank, you might, your actual, that bank on that day for whatever reason might be closed, right?  Especially now in the times that we live in with the virus, we don't know, you're not gonna really know where we're at.  So thinking ahead, that particular bank might be only doing drive-through at that time.  And it's going to range from, it's going to, the whole thing with the banks are going to range from city to city because some of you in an area that are not, that's not really affected by all what's going on all around the world.  And you might not have that many people in your, in your area that actually have dinars and have a lot of other foreign currency.  So if you're living somewhere like in New York or LA or a bigger city, you are probably going to have a lot harder time trying to do your exchange.  I can probably almost guarantee it because you live in a bigger city and you're just going to end up having more problems.  And a bank that you go to might have really long lines because I know that there's a lot of people that do hold dinars.  That doesn't mean that in your area there's a lot of people that you, some of you are going to be able to walk into a bank, sit down with somebody, make your exchange, make your purchase, and walk out and have it all done within 30 to 45 minutes.  Not everybody's going to be able to do that.  For those of you, you got to keep in mind that the markets, if you're trying to invest into the markets, the internet and those trading platforms might be down too as well.  And that's why this is the next most important thing, because if threatening platforms are going up and down, websites are going up and down.  Or on the day of, you have to decide whether or not if you're going to call into your job.  Because that's actually another obstacle.  Because you're going to call your boss and your job may be very important to you.  Regardless of the amount of money that you have in dinars, your job, maybe you don't have as many dinars and you rely on your health insurance and you don't want to call in.  And it's one thing you don't want to do is quit, especially if you have health insurance, at least not right away.  So you need to be prepared.  to call in on that day because if you're like me I'm looking at exchanging my dinar for other currencies.  I'm looking at going being able to go into my trading platforms and buy the stocks that I've been looking at for a long time and buy some of the prophetic stocks.  so for me this is this is about multiplying.  Okay, say for instance, for some of you who want to take your exchange money after you've already got your other foreign currencies, you've already ordered them, is the next step is that you're going to be wanting to get that money in your account so that you can start investing in the stock market.  Some of you might want to go out and buy 10,000 shares of BBB or 10,000 shares of Zion Oil or whatever the case during that time period.  So whatever bank card that you use for your trading platforms, you need to make sure that you have money in that particular bank account.  I don't plan on keeping the same bank account.  And I've discussed this in a series that I did about the exchange.  You'll have to go back and look at some of those videos.  But because of fraud and your information has been exposed, security breaches, and I've discussed that on this channel, different companies with different security breaches, your information is out there somewhere.  And when you do go to the bank and you do set up a whole new bank account system, right, and a new checking account and all that so you can use it to to buy additional currencies online and also to invest in the stock market.  Sometimes some trading platforms, it might take a day or two.  And you're not going to have time, so you're going to have to use that old bank account temporarily.  You're going to have to put whatever money that you want to set aside to make your purchases online on the day of the RV, the day after.  You want to make sure that you have enough in your old bank account to cover all those purchases.  So because when you get your new bank account, right, that's going to be the one that's going to be protected because it's a brand new account and nobody should have that.  So just to make sure, you want to make sure that you have three places to go online to buy currency and you also want to make sure that you have three banks that exchange and allow you to purchase foreign currency that are on your list.  You need to make sure you have those for the day of.  Some people can live pretty far from a bank that deals in foreign currency.  So that could be another obstacle For some of you, that's why you need to make sure.  you want to make sure that if you need to bank hop, that you have your banks, your bank list all ready to go on the day of the exchange.  Again, folks, this is about taking your investment, exchanging it and increasing, multiplying your investment through the purchases of whether it's the stocks and the other foreign currencies like the dong and the Thai baht.  So let's make sure that we're ready, that we're that we're prepared.  Make sure that you have all those ducks in a row.  So on the day of.  You can take your 100,000, 200,000 dinars that you extend and take part of that and multiply that into potential millions.  That's what it's about.  Some of you don't have that opportunity.  Some of you are on a very low budget but you have 500,000, you have a million dinars and you want to be able to exchange that and increase that value.  Okay, so this is all in preparation for a video that I have coming up on the day of the exchange.  Because some of you are only going to have six hours to exchange your dinar and be able to purchase the Vietnamese dong.  And that video is coming out later.  So I appreciate you guys listening.
