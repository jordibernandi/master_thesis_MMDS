But I want the men and women of this country that are in danger, the admirals and the generals that have done a job like they've never done before.  They're in war.  We're in war.  You know, I call it the invisible enemy.  That's a war.  And it's a dangerous war.  We're also at a level when you said 40,000 people.  And you're right.  Almost 40,000 people.  And and what?  Oh, more than.  OK, good.  Correct me.  Correct me.  Well, I'm really glad you corrected me.  But here's the story.  Let me just say something.  If we didn't do what we did, the 40,000 right now could be a million people, could be a million people, not 40,000.  It could be a million.  We're tracking at much less than the lowest possible estimate.  And that's a great tribute to a number of people and a number of things.  One of the things that it's a tribute to is what's taken place in this country with the American people because they've gone inside, they've done it.  They've done a job that nobody thought was possible.  And, in fact, when they did the models, as they call them, nobody thought it was possible.  They did models not based on this kind of success.  I've seen New York streets, and I see it in the morning.  I've watched all my life New York streets.  And you can't even see the pavement.  There's so many people.  And you take a look this morning.  You take a look even on Friday morning.  I looked at it.  I saw it through a camera.  There wasn't a person on Fifth Avenue.  There wasn't a person on Madison Avenue.  I've never seen anything like it because people have really listened to instructions, and they've listened to what we've had to say, and the professionals, they've listened.  And those people, people should really give them a lot of credit, including people like you, because you just don't have the sense to understand. ",

Got it.  This is CNN's Jeremy Dimon calling Trump out for making every day during these coronavirus press briefings a self-congratulatory campaign rally for the president.  Now I think it's beyond clear at this point that Trump has dropped the ball every step of the way.  But if he hadn't, and again, he has, but even if he hadn't, this is clearly not the time for throwing yourself a parade.  More than 40,000 Americans have lost their lives.  That's 40,000 families, 40,000 neighbors, 40,000 friends, and yet we rarely if ever hear a single word of condolences from Trump, whereas we are subjected to literal hours per day of listening to the president rave about himself, and then occasionally calling his friends up to rave about him too.  I mean the guy has expressed more heartache for losing campaign rallies than he has for any of the tens of thousands of dead Americans. ",

If you look at our success rate, we've had tremendous success.  We win where we have rallies, including endorsements of candidates.  Our success rate is, I think, unparalleled.  There's nothing like it.  So I certainly hope we can have rallies.  We'll find out.  I don't like the rallies where we're sitting like you're sitting.  I mean, you've got many reporters outside trying to get into this room.  And I come in, I'm looking at this room, and I see all this.  It loses a lot of flavor.  It loses, to me, a lot of flavor.  But I hope we're going to have rallies.  I think they're going to be bigger than ever.  I will say this.  The rallies that we were having until we had to stop with regard to the problem that we had here, the rallies were bigger than they were, I think even substantially bigger.  We'd go into the biggest arena and we'd turn away 20,000, 30,000 people sometimes in one case.  I think they said in New Jersey we had 175,000 people show up for an arena that holds 9,000 people.

Now Trump tries to claim that he has an obligation to praise himself, I mean the federal government as a whole, because news outlets like CNN have been excoriating them.  Now, to be clear, no reputable news outlet has, quote, excoriated any public health official or scientist or nurse or doctor.  They have, however, criticized Trump, which leads me to believe that either Trump doesn't know how to distinguish himself from other people or that he just conveniently pretends that criticism of himself belongs to everyone.  Of course, it doesn't in that it belongs only to him and for good reason.  It was his unilateral decision to downplay the virus while those very public health experts that he just lumped himself together alongside were actually trying to warn the federal government.  Trump was warned by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on January 18th.  White House aides tried to warn then Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on January 27th.  Peter Navarro tried to warn the White House in a memo on January 29th.  Azar called Trump again to warn him on January 30th.  The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency on that same day.  Senators warned the administration to take the virus more seriously and to request emergency funding on February 5th, which the administration failed to do.  Health officials, in coordination with the National Security Council, tried another memo on February 14th.  Navarro wrote yet another memo directly to Trump on February 23rd.  And the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Nancy Messonnier, publicly warned of the virus and said, quote, So when Trump claims that the media was excoriating these people, no, the media was echoing them, along with countless other doctors and public health experts and foreign countries, all of whom practically begged the Trump administration to start taking swift and serious action.  Meanwhile, all we got were comments like these.  Have you been briefed by the CDC? ",

One day, it's like a miracle.  It will disappear.  They're going to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon.

Only he doesn't have the common sense to realize that the way to have a crisis reflect well upon you is to succeed at it.  That's why the approval ratings of governors, of public health experts, of doctors are through the roof, because they are doing the work.  they are telling the truth, they are putting the time in, and they are helping save lives.
