            "text": "My video for February the 19th, 2020 is video number 3,371.  The title is Donald Trump and St.  Germain.  A Facebook friend sent me a video on Monday by Linda Good McGillis.  I had never heard of her before.  She claims to be a walk-in.  She also claims that the Donald, yes, President Trump, is also a walk-in.  She says he is really Saint Germain.  Her video was over an hour long, and I usually do not listen to videos that long anymore.  However, I did listen to the entire video, twice.  She says we are entering into an event from the 17th to the 28th of February, and the Earth is going to be split in two.  Has it already started?  Between now and July, we will see more and more separation.  Yes, somehow the inner earth and outer earth will become more separated.  Everything, she says, has three components.  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Body, Soul, and Spirit.  Inner, outer, and non-material.  Frankly, even after watching it two times, I am more confused than before.  She seemed to ramble all over the place.  Would I like it if Trump was really on a divine mission?  You bet.  Without some kind of intervention for humanity's benefit, I think we are doomed.  I'm really trying to hang on to a level of hopefulness for all of us.  It ain't easy.  I'm actually recording this video.  It's almost 10 after 8 p.m.  And I usually record my video.  as soon as the other one goes live, I record the next video.  That has been my practice for a good while now, although there are occasional exceptions, and this is one of those exceptions.  I really wanted to go back and listen twice, not making the video before I had gone through it again, because actually the blurb that I had originally written had some things that weren't correct and I had to fix them before I recorded, which of course I did.  The blurb that I read at the beginning of this video is the corrected version because I did have some things jumbled.  And it's easy to jumble things when a person talks for an hour and 15 minutes and seems to be rambling all over the place.  Now, I ramble too, but it only takes me 10 minutes to ramble, and I have made other videos that people can refer to, and perhaps Linda has as well, but I have never listened to her before.  I never heard of her before.  Was she interesting?  Yeah, some of the things that she said were definitely interesting.  One of the things that she does, and other people do too, is they make their video like a podcast where people can comment and stuff like that while they're doing the video.  I dislike that whole method of making videos.  I mean, I have made videos, of course, with other people, but not where random people can chime in and make their comments.  And she didn't read a whole lot of the comments, but she did read some, including telling one person that contacted her that she'd get back to her after she had finished the recording.  In any case, President Trump, definitely an enigma.  He has already the whole United States and many around the world divided into camps that like Trump and ones that hate him.  Does that mean he's on a divine mission?  Well, maybe all of us are on a divine mission of some sort, whether on the dark side or the light side.  And that's one of the things that she and others have said, that there is only one side.  that the separation consciousness is part of the illusion, which of course I always say is the delusion.  We are deluded into thinking everything is one when it's obvious from our human experience that things are not one.  We are divided into male and female, up and down, in and out, and many other bifurcations.  And the idea of a trinity also comes into the picture Again, the body, the soul, which is, I guess, inclusive of the mind and the spirit, which is transcendent of both the body and the soul or the mind.  Although some would say that the soul is also eternal, just like the spirit is eternal.  The only thing that's temporary is the body, but it's an illusion because everything in the physical world is an illusion.  It doesn't really exist.  It's just empty space that has deceived us.  Well, it's a very powerful deception if it has deceived us, uh, because it sure feels real.  Although I have seen videos where people can apparently walk through walls and you know, do things that don't make sense.  I have of course my magician friend and sometimes through sleight of hand he can make things, uh, appear real but it's a trick.  and of course there are other magicians that have done things that are like levitation and floating in the middle of the air with no strings attached putting a hula hoop around the body and show that there's nothing attached.  they're just levitating the individual.  lots of things raise questions and I think it's good to question things.  I don't think it's good to to take and swallow the official story of anything, whether it's politics, religion, and certainly not the economy.  The economy has been fraud for over 100 years since the Federal Reserve came into being.  But of course, it was fraud before that, too.  That was just the latest version of the fraud, which has been going on for, what, 107 years now since it was formed.  And The people that run that system are liars and from my perspective, demonic individuals.  Would I like to see them repent?  Would I like it if Donald Trump was on a divine mission to help show the separation but actually bring unity?  He has unified some segments of society.  But, of course, the more that are centered around his message and the hopefulness that he presents to people, the more people oppose the whole thing.  And I think the opposition to some of the craziness of our world leaders \u2013 in the economy and politics and even in religion, it's time that some of that came to the surface and we started accepting the fact that we've been lied to about virtually everything in every aspect of our life.  We've been lied to again and again and again, not once, but throughout our lives.  The education system is such that our kids are becoming more and more confused because the dark agenda that is known as liberalism has taken over the school system by far and large, and I don't mean just the elementary, high school, I mean the colleges and the universities and everything else have been infiltrated by those espousing an agenda of control of an elite establishment that wants to be considered as God, but it's a fallen God.  So I look at things and I scratch my head.  I mean, I wish I could figure things out.  As I've said in other videos, I used to think I was pretty smart because I had high numbers on tests and stuff like that and measured at least a low genius range.  In any case, it doesn't even matter because as some say, it's just an illusion.  But I hope, I really hope that my life and everyone who wills good for humanity and wants to see healing, I wish that we could all be fulfilled in our mission.  But it ain't easy to hang on to the hope.  It ain't easy believing positive messages when there is so much negativity all around us.  Thank you folks for listening and namaste. ",
