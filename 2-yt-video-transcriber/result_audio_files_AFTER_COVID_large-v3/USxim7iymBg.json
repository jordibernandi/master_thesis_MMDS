That's why I want to thank the sponsor of this video, Blue Blocks, my favorite evidence-based blue light blocking glasses.  It's no secret that the blue light from your indoor lighting, computer, and devices at night interferes with your ability to get a good night of sleep and therefore wake up rested and rejuvenated the next day.  So to avoid that, you can either live like a monk at night and not use your computer, devices, or phone and not have any fun at night, or you can just put on a pair of blue blocks glasses which protect you from the harmful effects of blue light.  That's what I do because I'm not a monk and I'm also allergic to not having fun.  Real quick, mom, I gotta go.  I'm doing an ad, but I'll call you right back.  No, I won't.  My routine at night is as the sun's going down, I put on a pair of blue blocks and I'm protected from blue light so I can feel and function my best and get great sleep.  I love all the models, but the Maverick and the Sleep Pluses is my all-time favorite pair of blue blocks.  No, seriously, I will call my mom back.  I promise.  But first, if you want to join me in using Blue Blocks to quickly and easily protect yourself from the harmful effects of blue light, just go to blueblocks.com slash JP.
