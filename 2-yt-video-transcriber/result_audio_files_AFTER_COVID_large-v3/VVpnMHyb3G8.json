            "text": "Three-year-old Trinity Randolph was shot and killed while sitting in a car.  She was sitting in a car with her father, and her father was also shot and killed.  They were killed during a drive-by shooting while they were at a stoplight in Louisville, Kentucky.  Now, over the last month, over 50 black kids have been killed from inner-city violence.  Over 50 black children have been killed from inner city violence.  Not one black leader has said a word about it.  Not one black activist has said a word about it.  Because they think black lives only matter if the killer is white.  If the killer is not white, they don't give a shit.  They don't give a shit about black lives unless the killer is a white person.  this is what's so hypocritical about these so-called black activists.  this is what's so hypocritical about these so-called pro-blacks.  and then you have a lot of these pro-blacks that will say you're a coon.  if you talk about black on black crime you're a sellout.  if you talk about black on black crime because they believe it doesn't exist Anytime you have a conversation with them about this topic, they will say black on black crime doesn't exist because white people kill white people.  They use the same talking points every time.  They will say black on black crime doesn't exist because white people kill white people.  That's ridiculous.  Just because a white person kills a white person doesn't excuse a black person killing a black person.  And there's a much higher percentage of crime in the black community than in other races.  To put this in perspective, there's 13%, blacks are 13% of the population.  We are 13% of the population in America.  But we make up 50% of the homicides in the country.  50% of the homicides in the country are black people killing other black people.  when we're only 13% of the population.  That's disproportionate.  No other race kills their own people more than we do.  So when I see these clownish as pro blacks saying we shouldn't talk about black on black crime because white people kill white people is complete bullshit.  And it goes to show that they don't really care about black lives.  They only care about black lives when it fits their narrative.  These phony pro-blacks are worse than white supremacists.  These phony pro-blacks like Tariq Nasheed and Omar Johnson are worse than white supremacists.  Because they're telling you, you shouldn't care about lives in your own community.  You shouldn't care about the black lives in your own black community.  You're a coon if you talk about black on black crime.  You're a sellout if you talk about black on black crime.  You're using white supremacist talking points if you talk about black on black crime.  If you don't care about black people killing other black people, then you really don't care about black lives.  Because 98% of black homicides are from inner city violence.  98% of black people who are murdered in America are murdered from inner city violence.  Less than 2% of black murders are committed by the police.  If you only care about black murders when it involves the police, but you don't care about black murders when it involves inner city violence, then you don't really care about black lives.  And it shows your hypocrisy.  It shows how much of a hypocrite you are.  Most of these so-called woke leftists and pro-blacks are doing more harm to the black community than any white supremacist is doing.  Kairi Nasheed is doing more damage to the black community than any white supremacist is doing.  Omar Johnson is doing more damage to the black community than any white supremacist is doing.  Every one of these bastards are actually anti-black.  They're not pro-black, they're anti-black.  Nothing about them is pro-black.  They will call you a coon for speaking against violence in your own community.  They will call you a coon for trying to stop violence in your own black community.  And let's talk about this term coon.  The term coon comes from slavery.  It's a white supremacist term.  But these so-called pro-blacks will use this term coon to demonize any black person that they disagree with.  When the term coon is a white supremacist term that comes from slavery.  But these hypocrites will use this term coon to demonize you because you disagree with their victim mentality.  You disagree with their bullshit.  I just think the nonsense needs to stop.  We need to start holding each other accountable in the black community.  The biggest problem I have with these phony pro blacks is they always defend black criminals.  They always defend gangbangers and criminals.  By defending these gangbangers and criminals, you're defending what's actually killing most black people.  These gangbangers are doing most of the killing in the black community.  But when you defend their behavior, when you defend their violent behavior, you're making excuses for their violent behavior.  And this is what creates so much violence in the black community.  This is why I just want to encourage black people to start thinking independently.  Start using common sense and logic.  Stop following these phony ass pro-blacks.  The rapper and producer Master P is gonna pay for the funeral of Trinity Randolph because they don't have enough funds to give this child a funeral.  Now you would think all the billions of dollars that Black Lives Matter has raised, they could cover the funeral expenses of this child.  but they don't care about black lives unless the killer is white.  Because her killers are gang bangers, they don't care.  They only care about black lives unless the killer is a white cop.  If the killer is not a white cop, they don't give a shit about black lives.  This is why Master P has to come out and pay for her funeral.  When Black Lives Matter has billions and billions of dollars and donations that they could easily cover her funeral expenses.  But they're not gonna get a dime from Black Lives Matter because they don't give a shit about black lives.  So much respect to Master P for coming out and covering the funeral expenses of this child.  God rest her soul, hopefully more black people will learn from these mistakes that we're making in our communities.  We need to come together and stop the violence in our community and stop ignoring the violence in our community. ",
