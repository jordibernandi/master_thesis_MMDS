Now I usually ignore these on the grounds that they're a bunch of borderline passive-aggressive nonsense that's laden with insinuations and that nobody's really looking for answers to anyway.  But while I don't feel any compulsion to answer the stupid things, critiquing them every once in a while can be a useful or at least fun way to blow through several misconceptions of atheism.  So today I present you not ten, not twenty, but a nice round concise thirty-six questions for atheists, read by Andy Fellows.  Before we get started, please remember to like, comment, and subscribe and all that stuff, both to me and to Andy.  I know you know how YouTube works, but I guess the little robots who listen in and decide when to recommend your videos like when you say stuff like that, so whatever.  That out of the way, here are the 36 questions for atheists.  1. ",

Demonstrating a remarkable understanding of the fact that, humans being humans, they act on their personal fear, greed, and desire for power in a way that can't be neatly ascribed to a single label they identify with.  Yet somehow, the moment we start talking about any regime that was both murderous and irreligious, you suddenly become content to blurt out that they just did it because they're atheists.
