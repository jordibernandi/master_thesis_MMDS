I just kind of stewed on this one because I had to reconcile.  I had to come to terms with the fact that I'm a bitch-ass nigga.  And I'm a simp.  And I'm a white knight.  And I'm a... What other pejoratives do we have for... For men to cuck, we have that pejorative.  What else?  No, I don't want to know if I'm a cuck.  I don't think that one really applies to what I'm going to say today.  Some other pejorative.  Oh, beta.  There it is.  How could I forget beta?  That's iconic for all the pejoratives we have for males that aren't filled with value to women.  You ever notice that, by the way, that all those pejoratives... are all about whether the male has any value to a woman.  You guys, did you guys ever pick that one up?  Because I certainly did.  Anyhow, I'm all of those things.  Because this kind of really kind of irked me a little bit for a couple of reasons.  And despite my incessant preamble, it's actually something that is kind of gender neutral and just kind of should apply to both males and females.  But this type of smarming behavior that some people have when it comes to like trying to have sex with other people, And it bothers the shit out of me.  So anyhow.  There's this live stream.  And this guy.  I think his name is Marlon.  He's on with Donovan Sharp.  And like three other people.  And he's decided to tell us a tale.  A story.  An example.  Of like.  Being ready to take an L with the female.  And like.  His example.  was kind of gross to me.  So he's going to, he's going to tell a story. ",

            "text": "With me, I had a girl that like I was dealing with and she tried to withhold sex from me.  And I was like, all right, well, you know, now I guess I'm going to kick you to the curb after, you know, everything was all good.  But it's like, you got to be able to turn on that switch immediately.  And that jerk switch and let, and like, let girls know negatively reinforced with them.  Because the thing with women is that A lot of the time, women don't deal with consequences.  They're poor actions in relation to you.  So when you come in as a man and you let her know, no, that's not going to be tolerated, it's going to shock her, but then it's going to make her respect you.  I'll give you guys an example right now, man.  As you guys know, I'm here in the game.  I had some chick come over, right?  and uh she came over and she sat next.  she sat next to me.  i made a move to take her top down a top off.  she said no i was like all right cool you sit on your side of the couch i'm gonna sit on mine.  and she was like wait and i was like yeah like i'm gonna we're not we're.  you know you say you don't want to get into that.  so well i'm gonna give you your space.  what do i do?  i pull out my phone.  let her like immediately retract attention.  so she starts to feel awkward.  you know i'm saying because she had never dealt with this before.  you know 19 year old pimbo.  you know i'm saying like they're not you.  You know what I'm saying?  So, um, so I tell her like, no, that's, that's not, you know, that's not how it goes.  And she kept saying like, well, why are you acting like this?  Whatever.  She's trying to shame me.  Right.  Cause she doesn't know what, what the, what's going on here.  So, so what happens is she's like, okay, she starts to feel weird.  So she pulls out her phone.  So I'm like, all right, cool.  to Katango.  So I get up, I start doing some work on my laptop, right?  And she really starts to feel weird.  She's like, oh my, like, she's like, can you come over here, please?  Like, what's going on?  I said, well, you know, I'm just giving you what you want.  You want the space?  You know, you don't want to do that?  Cool.  I'm going to do some work.  And she's like, no, no, no, please come.  And I'm like, all right, say please, daddy.  And she's like, please, daddy.  And then I go over to you.  And she passes the compliance test.  So I go and I sit next to her again and I try to unzip her thing again.  And she says, no.  I'm like, all right, cool.  So I get back again and I come back to the desk.  And then she starts to feel weird.  And she's like, listen, I'm just going to leave.  And I was like, all right, cool.  See you around.  And she's like, I would hug you, but you probably don't want to touch me.  I was like, no, I'm good.  And she just got up and walked out.  And here's the thing.  The point of the story is this, guys.  Not for me to brag.  It's just that simply letting her know that there's consequences to her bullshit.  You're not going to leverage sex against me, baby.  That's not how this works. ",

When I say this, I say this with all sincerity.  Hopefully you all know and understand... In your hearts and in your core... That I say this... Out of a place of... Genuine... Respect... For just people in general.  But that's fucking bullshit.  That's fucking gross.  That's so fucking gross.  And that's so fucking weak.  That's so weak.  And honestly... Really effeminate.  I am so fucking bothered... By the amount of feminine shit that leaks into dating coaches and game and the bullshit that gets sprinkled in here.  I don't have to make a whole video talking about that.  But this type of crap here, where he invites some 19-year-old bimbo, he says, over to his house.  First of all, if she's a 19-year-old bimbo, I don't know why you would risk any degree of sexual intercourse in someone of such poor character.  But that's its own thing.  That's its own subject.  Let's just talk about the fact that she got here.  And then, if I understand the story correctly, you tried to take her shirt off.  And she said no.  And then you were all like, okay, fine.  I just won't give you any of my attention.  Nigga, what?  Nigga, you tried to take her fucking shirt off.  Listen, listen.  Let me be Mr.  White Knight here.  I got my white shirt on.  Let me go get my armor out of my closet, motherfucker.  But... We do this shit now?  We just try to take people's fucking clothes off and then be upset when they don't comply?  What the fuck? ",

            "text": "Like, my wife.  My wife could, like, come out... Well, actually, no.  No.  Like, if I'm married to her... Yeah, if I'm married to her, I don't really think I would deny my wife some sweet penis.  I don't think I'd ever do that to my wife.  I think I'd pretty much be down 100%.  But some woman I just met, there's someone I barely know, if she was trying to take my shirt off, honestly, I would, I would, I would push, I would smack her hand away.  I'd be like, dude, like, don't, don't fucking, you know what I'm saying?  Like, chill out, dude.  Like, even, even if the woman came with the understanding of an engagement that you guys are going to have sex that, that, that day, you know, like, there's just got to be some healthy connection.  respect or care to a person than just trying to take their clothes off.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, first of all, this is kind of just point of fact number one.  You know, I mean, just... But more than that, that's a little irksome to me.  Maybe it should be more than irksome, but that's just kind of a detail that made me perk my ears up.  That's how he tells the story.  But what gets me the most is the fact that his response is to retract all attention from her and then try to play some mind game to convince her to have sex with him until she finally gets uncomfortable and leaves.  And the moral of the story is that women aren't going to leverage sex against him.  That's not okay.  Because he may not be entitled to sex, that does not mean that the woman is entitled to his attention.  First of all, you need to study alchemy, dude.  Because that is not matched with the law of equivalent exchange.  That's not the equivalent.  That's not an equivalent exchange right there, brother.  The woman risking having sex with you as she gets pregnant and loses nine months of her life where she has to be reliant on someone else.  And then hopefully \u2013 that's if she decides not to execute her child for the crime of being unwanted, right?  There's that.  There's a little bit more risk involved for that female to engage sexually with you.  And of course a lot of women don't think like that because admittedly they're stupid.  But like \u2013 You retracting your attention because she doesn't want to have sex with you is not a fair exchange.  Because a lot of people don't recognize it, but to have sex with someone is you're asking for a lot.  And the truth of the matter is, even for yourself as a male, you don't seem to respect yourself enough To be willing to risk any degree of long-term investment for a 19-year-old bimbo.  You don't have enough respect for your own self or you're too hedonistic to yourself to where you're not recognizing the fact that this could be some crazy broad that you're about to try to inseminate.  Maybe she lied about being a bimbo.  You don't know her.  She could be crazy.  You don't know her.  She could be acting in exactly the way you want her to act just long enough to get you invested.  You don't know her.  You don't know her.  And even if you're trying to pump and dump her, you don't know her.  You don't know what kind of infectious diseases she has.  Come on, dude.  There's so much risk involved here.  So it shows you don't even respect yourself, let alone that woman.  But... More importantly than that, I'm not going to say more importantly, I mean, that's a pretty important thing in general, that so many dudes just, like, they don't seem to respect their own sperm, you know what I'm saying?  Like, your own, like, your sperm is your own legacy, you know, and it sounds like I'm, like, over-dramatizing it a lot, but, like, that's your own genetic encoding, and with that little tiny little Viracon-looking thing, you can make another person, there's some, wait, There's some value to that.  You know what I'm saying?  It's your time.  Your time, too.  You're giving this woman some penis.  You're pleasuring this woman.  You gotta respect yourself a little bit more than that than to play some fucking smarmy mind game and to retract your attention from her to say that she can't leverage sex against you.  Which, first of all, isn't even a correct evaluation of the situation.  The woman wasn't leveraging sex.  As far as I understand it, she just didn't want to do it at that point in time.  As if I understand correctly, like she wasn't saying you have to do this or I'm not going to have sex with you, which ironically makes no sense to me because Donovan Sharp himself was on the live stream, actually leveraged sex against the woman he was with and made a whole video about it.  No, you don't believe me.  Well, here you go. ",

And really what caused this was actually this Rona bug that's going on.  She obviously Devin works in an office like a lot of people, like most women.  And so now she works from home, obviously, because she can't go into the office.  uh we've both been eating more uh than we should.  haven't really watched our eating habits?  uh and we're certainly both.  that said we're getting ready to go to bed the other night and my girlfriend takes off her clothes.  she normally sleeps naked and i'm looking at her body and i'm like hmm something's a little bit off something's just a little bit off.  so i told her to step on the scale.  butt naked ale read 133 pounds.  now my girlfriend usually her weight is usually somewhere between 120 and 125. sometimes it gets to 127 128 depending on that time of the month.  if she's dead she needs to lose that weight because this is where it starts.  so until she loses five count them five pounds she is getting no sex from me period.

            "text": "so i don't really understand why you can be a co-host with Donovan Sharp who will, who will actually leverage sex and then tell the story here with this woman who didn't leverage sex.  It just appears to me that she just wasn't really warmed up at the point in time.  Like, I don't know.  You couldn't talk to her.  Maybe not specifically about having sex, but you couldn't talk to her.  You couldn't, you couldn't have a conversation with the girl.  If you can't have a conversation, if you can't spend, if you can't do anything apart from being a woman, you probably should not be spending any time with her.  I'm just, you know, I'm just saying.  I'm just talking.  I'm just saying.  But no, no, no.  Screw that.  I'm like, why is it okay for Donovan Sharp to withhold sex from Devin?  He says her name all the time, so I'm not doxing her.  But to do that to Devin.  But like, it's not okay if that woman just doesn't feel like it at that point in time.  I don't understand that.  Maybe I'm just stupid.  Maybe I'm just a bait.  Maybe I'm just a simp.  Maybe there's something wrong with me.  I don't know.  But it seems a little bit like it's a bit of hypocrisy.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying, like, I don't, you know, maybe in private you've called Don and Sharp out on it.  Maybe you have.  And maybe it just looks like it's some old bullshit because it's on the internet.  But, like, maybe you have done that.  But tabling that discussion aside from the fact that it doesn't even seem like the woman was actually leveraging sex for you to do anything apart from, like, talk to her.  And, like, if she's giving you her time and you're giving... her your time, then that would be the law of equivalent exchange.  I mean, if you start measuring your time as more important than hers, then you kind of have to have some bit of an inflated ego.  You guys should just both have a healthy respect of each other's time and investment.  And again, if this is just some chick you're trying to bang out, I don't even understand why you even attempted this in the first place.  You could have just done any other thing in life.  That isn't trying to convince some 19 year old broad to have sex with you when you barely even know her.  Let's say you knew her pretty well.  And if you I mean, if you know her pretty well and your conclusion is still I'm just going to bang her out and not invest.  She probably really has some terrible character.  I'm just saying.  She probably really sucks as a fucking person.  If your final verdict is I'm just going to bang her out.  I'm just saying.  But I don't know.  Again, this type of thing.  And also... It's so feminine, dude.  It's so... That's what women do.  Women play mind games to convince you to comply and to act in the way that they want you to do.  Women act passive-aggressively.  We're not... ",

            "text": "And this shouldn't be, like, an example of, like, an alpha male behavior or whatever kind of bullshit you want to say.  This is smarmy.  This is smarmy.  This woman... We don't... I don't know this woman.  It's just based on the story you've told us.  This woman could have been tired.  Maybe this woman just didn't like you all that much.  Maybe this woman just wanted to feel comfortable.  Who knows?  It could have been a whole factor of things.  But for the response to be offended at the fact that the woman didn't want to have sex with you, so you pull back and you're just like, okay, I'm just going to play on my phone now.  I'm just going to... First, it's incredibly childish.  It really is.  And passive-aggressive manipulation, again, is a very effeminate trait.  It's what women do because women can't aggressively try to convince men of what they want, so they have to manipulate them and take their weaknesses and operate in that manner.  As males, we shouldn't act.  First of all, first of all, truth be told, as a feminine behavior, that should never be fucking curtailed.  That should never be accepted anyway.  But as much as it just shouldn't even be accepted anyway, we certainly shouldn't adopt it as men to start playing these games.  It's like, listen, dude, excuse me.  If someone doesn't want to have sex with you, just do fucking something else, man.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like some people are like, and he reiterated this point in a more recent podcast, too, where he's like, I'll kick a woman out if she just doesn't want to have sex.  I'll just tell her to leave.  Sure, you're well within your right and your prerogative to do so.  I mean, you're not wrong.  I just don't find it as any point of respect.  I can't respect a person who treats other individuals like fleshlights.  I just can't.  I can't respect treating other people like they're just masturbatory AIDS.  People are more than that.  And it's not just being... Here's the thing.  Male, female.  It's a male who said it, and it seems to typically be a male thing.  But I mean, male or female, I've actually... Just to show you guys how much of this gross behavior of being... This one isn't an example of being passive aggressive.  This is actually just being aggressive.  I had a friend of mine back in high school who had a girlfriend who wanted to have sex with him.  And he didn't want to have sex with her.  He really did not want to do it.  And so what she decided to do would be a great idea to start attacking him, to start beating on him, to start, like, saying, you're not a man, you suck, and just hitting him and everything.  You know, it's just gross.  It's just gross, man.  It's just gross, dude.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, for this girl to do this to my... Now, of course, he's my friend.  I care about him quite a bit.  But it's like... Even if he's not my friend, even if it's just you on the internet, if you're a dude on the internet and that happened to you, man, you can't let this chick make you feel like less of a man.  And if you're a woman, you know what I'm saying, and you had some dude tell you to get out because you don't want to bang him, you know what, dude?  You took a W, man.  That's not even an L. You took a W. You don't even want to invest in someone who's going to treat you like that.  People, there's got to be a healthy pride in yourself, even as a male.  Like, as a male, there's not enough of a healthy pride in yourself to be all like, listen, fam... I'm not giving sluts my penis.  Do you not understand?  Do you not grasp the gravity that is you as a male?  You are the key to triggering life growth.  You should have a good amount of pride.  You should respect yourself to not even attempt to be with bimbos.  I don't know.  That's how I feel.  That's how I feel.  It's not that you have to be arrogant or cocky about it, but just enough to be all like, yeah, I'm not going to invest in these one-off relationships that don't mean anything and aren't going to get me any return other than 25 minutes of pleasure.  If you want that, buy a flashlight.  Go on Amazon.  I'm sure you can find some.  On Amazon, just Google it.  You know what I'm saying?  Get some lotion, okay?  Get some lubricant, alright?  Do that.  You don't need to go find these dumbass bimbos and give them the time of day and give them your life energy and your time.  No.  Don't do that.  Don't reward them for their mere existence.  Come on.  Don't treat them like sex objects.  You don't need to treat people like that.  It's just the bottom line is you shouldn't treat people like that.  It's just enough said.  Enough said.  Mail, email.  If someone doesn't want to have sex with you, just take it, man.  Take the fucking L, dude.  Just be like, all right, fine.  Playing mind games and trying to pressure people and convince them and then trying to use this as some example.  It's like you're being an alpha male.  You have confidence.  I don't think that that's the way men should be.  I don't.  At the end of it all, call me a bitch-ass nigga as much as you want.  I don't think men should be like that.  I think men should conduct themselves with so much more integrity, so much more honor, and just so much more compassion.  And same for females, man.  Same for females, dude.  Being passive-aggressive, playing mind games.  Dude, we should treat each other much better than that.  Especially if we're getting intimate with these people.  Especially if we're gonna risk the creation of another person.  Least we kill them for the crime of not being wanted, right?  At least.  That's all I'm saying.  So yeah, with that being said, man.
