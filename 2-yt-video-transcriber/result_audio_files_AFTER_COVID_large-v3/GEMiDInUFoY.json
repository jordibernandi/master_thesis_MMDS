            "text": "What's up everyone.  Welcome back to Blue Ridge Silverhound.  I'm your host, Sean, for this video.  And today we are going to take a look at the top 10 most valuable National Park Quarters for 2010 to 2020.  That's right, for this year.  This is the final year of the National Park Quarters.  While it's not completely closed out yet, I figure it's worth a look to see some of the quarters that can actually make you a lot of money.  Alright, there's going to be a few kind of stipulations you're going to have to keep in mind as we go through this list.  But just looking at some of these coins that we've seen released from the last 10 years, I can honestly say there is quite a bit of actual opportunity within this series to really make some money.  Now, a few things to keep in mind.  We are not going to be talking about the San Francisco Business Strike coins.  Those were produced directly as a collectible item through the U.S.  Mint.  You could generally buy those in bags of 100.  Those will not be here, but they do pop up on occasion, but it's not going to be on this list.  In addition, the hottest thing going today is the West Point Circulation Rarity Quarters.  As we all know, they have a vintage limit of 2 million pieces per design for 2019.  And in 2020, it remains the same.  2 million pieces for each one of the five designs.  To kind of close it out, I will do a separate video on the top five list of most valuable 2019 West Points sometime at the end of the year after the final release.  Alright, so the thing to keep in mind... when we're looking at this list these are going to be coins that you cannot just find out in circulation and then sell.  what we call raw raw coins are ungraded uncertified.  all right the coins that you see here on this list are going to be coins that have been graded whether it's through your company a third party authenticator like pcgs or ngc.  so you're gonna have to send out those high top grade specimens to those grading companies and then you can sell them afterwards.  more details to come at the end of the video on kind of like keys to success because you're going to need to know those.  so we have a top 10 list.  but of course if you guys see my top list i also have an honorable mention on there and it's going to be this coin right here.  this is the 2012 d. Okay, as you can see, there's a Denver mint mark right here on the obverse of the coin.  The 2012 D Hawaii Volcanoes comes in at, theoretically, the 11th spot on the list.  The mintage is relatively small, and this is one of the more popular national park quarters.  It has a mintage of $78,600,000 by today's standards.  That's generally about maybe, I don't know, one-fifth, one-sixth of the mintage of a lot of the newer quarters you see today.  Now in terms of value, the highest grade assigned by PCGS for this coin is Mint State 68.  So it's going to look exactly like you see on this video, this particular coin.  It's going to be relatively immaculate.  You're going to have a sharp strike.  There's going to be a few little, you know, planchet nicks on the highest surface areas.  And that's going to be it.  You don't want to submit a coin that has more than that.  The Mid-State 68 value for this coin is $900.  With lots of room to grow, imagine finding a Mid-State 69.  And there's actually a few on this list.  So the grade does exist in other America the Beautiful National Park quarters.  Alright, so the 10th spot is going to be the 2014 Philadelphia Great Sand Dunes National Park Quarter.  Okay, it's the Colorado version that you see here.  Again, it's a Philadelphia minted coin.  You can see the P mint mark right on the obverse of this coin.  159,600,000 total pieces were produced of the Philadelphia Great Sand Dunes coin.  In terms of grade, the highest grade assigned by PCGS is Mint State 68, and it also has a guide value of $950.  A lot of these coins have low pops.  There's not a lot of them out there.  So that really truly opens the door for some opportunity if you wanted to grade some of these Philadelphia or Denver minted coins.  All right, so the next one we have here is going to be actually the newest coin on the list.  It's the 2016. ",
