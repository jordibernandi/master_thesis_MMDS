We all bleed red blood.  I'm not going anywhere.  And it's not easy.  It's hard.  It's very, very tough.  I'm not having anybody over.  You know, I have to clean everything myself.  I'm enjoying making my own food.  Your nourishment is spiritual.  The earth will provide.  Stop worrying about money and food and all these ridiculous things.  Baptize yourself.  We lost.  Throw in the towel.  Nature fought back and won.  So just chill.  Get cozy.  Have a slumber party for six months.  I don't know how to even work this.  I thought this was hand sanitizer.  It's a slumber party for the rest of your life!  We have to make changes in our lives.  I miss having a dominatrix come over here and choke me till I cum.  We're all in it together. ",
