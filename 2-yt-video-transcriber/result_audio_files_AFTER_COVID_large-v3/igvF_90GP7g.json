            "text": "In my hand is a clean, crisp, \u00a310 note.  It's worth 10 English pounds.  OK, but now watch this.  I've scrunched it up into a ball.  But what I'm about to do next will really gross you out.  Can you see what I've done?  I've made it icky, I've made it dirty, I've made it gross.  At the beginning, when it was clean and it was crisp, the value of this note was 10 pounds.  Now it's creased, now it's dirty, now it's filthy.  What is the value of this note?  it's still 10 pounds.  Dear precious believer, you might think you're creased, you might think you're dirty, you might think you're filthy, but you have still not lost your value in God's eyes.  Why?  Because you are washed in the precious blood of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ.  But I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, Joe, you don't realize how many times i've committed sexual sin.  i really have made a mess.  i've been doing this for years.  well to you my friend let me just show you something.  in the scriptures romans 8 verse 38 says this for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height, nor depth, nor any created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Did you catch that?  It said, nor any created thing.  So in other words, you and I, we've been created and we ourselves cannot separate ourselves from the love of God.  He will remain faithful when we are faithless.  He loves us deeper than we could ever imagine.  And you need to know this, believer.  This is so much deeper than you and I. This is about God and his attributes of mercy, of grace, of love.  I hope you're not misunderstanding me in any way.  We are to be ruthless with sin.  Could I ask you a personal question?  Are you a pig or are you a sheep?  Well, what do you mean by that, Joe?  Well, let me put it another way to you.  Imagine there's a big, muddy puddle in front of you.  You see, the sheep might get a bit curious, it might come towards the edge, and then accidentally it falls down into the muddy puddle.  As soon as it falls, it climbs out of the mud, it runs away, it scrambles out and gets as far away as possible from that dirty, muddy puddle.  It's a shame, it's a sheep.  But the pig, on the other hand, when the pig sees the muddy puddle, Its eyes light up.  It bee-lines and it goes straight to that mud.  It loves the mud.  It loves to wallow in the mire.  It settles itself in and in its free will it decides to stay there.  With no thought of ever getting out, it's there.  This is its home.  Its nature is to be dirty because it's a pig.  So let me ask you again.  Are you a pig or are you a sheep?  Do you feel ashamed when you fall into sin?  Do you try and get as far away from sin as possible?  When you do fall, you feel angry, you feel frustrated.  You know this is not your home.  You know this is not right.  Well, if that's you, you are a sheep and you need to keep fighting.  And I think the fact that you're watching this video today is very strong evidence that there is a battle going on, that you're not content in the mire and that you want to beat this sexual sin forever.  But I'm guessing you're watching this now because you have actually committed sin recently.  And you're thinking, what should I do now, Joe?  Well, do you remember when Jesus wanted to wash the disciples' feet?  And he came to Peter and Peter said, you're not washing my feet.  Anyone can wash my feet, but not you.  There's no way I'm letting you, O Lord, wash my feet.  What did Jesus say to him?  He said, unless I wash your feet, you can have no part with me.  So then Peter quite dramatically said, well, not just my feet, my hands and my head also.  In other words, Jesus, give me a full bath.  But Jesus turned to him and said, you don't need a bath.  You don't need fully washing because you've already been washed.  What's Jesus trying to say here?  Jesus was saying that you've already been born again.  You've already been converted.  You've already been fully washed.  When a man or woman puts their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses them.  It washes them.  It saves them from their sins.  But every now and then, probably a bit more often than every now and then.  As we walk through this world, we defile ourselves, we get stains from lies, from anger, from lust, from pride.  And we need to come to the Lord Jesus Christ and say, Lord Jesus, would you cleanse me again?  Would you make me clean again?  I know I'm already saved.  but I need to be clean again.  Do I have permission to give you just one last warning?  King David once said, restore to me the joy of my salvation.  He'd just committed adultery.  He'd just had sexual intercourse with a woman who was not his wife, Bathsheba.  You see, when we commit sin, we don't lose our salvation, but we lose the joy of our salvation.  So let that be a warning to us all.  Next time you're tempted to tap on a wrong image, next time you're tempted to go to a sexual sin, Remember this, dear friend.  God blesses obedience.  And if you're going to be disobedient, sometimes the Lord will come for you.  Sometimes the Lord will chastise you.  He'll cut you down and it will be severe.  So I plead with you, humble yourself so that the Lord God doesn't have to humble you.  Yes, he loves us.  Yes, we never lose our value.  We hide behind the riches of the Lord Jesus Christ.  But at the same time, we've got to be ruthless with sin.  We've got to be children of God that are obedient and live for our Holy Father who deserves only the best.  Three things before you go.  First thing, please do subscribe.  I'd love to see you again.  Second thing, I've got a playlist all on forgiveness and conquering sin.  I think you'll find it very helpful.  And the third thing is this.  Don't worry, no \u00a310 notes were harmed in the making of this video.  So I'll be using that \u00a310 again.  Thank you for watching. ",
