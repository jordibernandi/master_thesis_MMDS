I mean, you're looking at 3 percent of Nevadans caucusing in 2016.  This time it might be as high as 4 or 5 percent.  In New Hampshire, with a primary, it's much, much simpler.  You had 20% plus.

To me, one of the big outcomes of today is what happens to Amy Klobuchar if she finishes, let's say, fifth.  And I'm friends with all these candidates, so it's hard to talk like this.  But if you finish fifth in Nevada and you're heading to South Carolina and you're Amy Klobuchar and you're not expected to do really well in South Carolina, then it starts prompting some really, really difficult conversations.  And that's what many people have been waiting for is for the moderates in the field to start consolidating.

And number three, if you project a contested convention, are you going to finish strongly enough to hoover up delegates in the states, which often means something like a 15 percent plus threshold?  When I decided to drop, it was in part because I looked at these three variables and I said, I don't think I can get delegates moving forward.  If I thought I could get delegates, I would have.  I'd still be in the race and I would not be here having this conversation with you all.  But really, that is the question for each of the candidates.

And I can guarantee you he's going to do it on Tuesday night because Pete sees that Bernie's the front runner.  He's trying to become the alternative to Bernie.  And the best way to do that is by saying I am the alternative to Bernie.  So I think that other candidates should probably follow suit.  I think Amy, Joe, Elizabeth should be trying to contrast themselves with Bernie.  more.  I'm a huge admirer of Elizabeth's, but I referenced this a little bit earlier on.  They made a very big bet early on in terms of hiring field organizers, not just in the early states, but around the country.  And those organizers are not something that you can just adjust and recalibrate that quickly.  They're not like ad spending.  And so they have a really fixed overhead that's higher than many of the other campaigns, they get these resources in.  They've been playing it close to the bone in terms of their finances.  They took out a loan recently that I'm sure they've long since paid back.  But to Van's point, it's going to be hard to activate these resources in a way that's going to move the needle towards victory in one of the states that are upcoming. ",

So I think that his numbers in South Carolina may be closer to his polling.  Right now, it feels like the most likely scenario is a contested convention in Milwaukee because none of the candidates, including Bernie, is on track to get a majority.  And if there's one thing I've learned about Democrats is Democrats really like to follow the rule book.  And you saw it at the end of the last debate where they asked the candidates, hey, if someone comes in with a plurality, what do you do?  And every other candidate was like, follow the rule book.  Let the convention take its course, which means the superdelegates will come out.  They will come out in force, probably not for Bernie.  And then you're going to have this journalistic dream come true of a contested or a nightmare, depending upon where you sit.  But that strikes me as the most likely scenario, because I do not think other Democrats are going to fall in line just because Bernie ends up with more delegates than any other candidates.
