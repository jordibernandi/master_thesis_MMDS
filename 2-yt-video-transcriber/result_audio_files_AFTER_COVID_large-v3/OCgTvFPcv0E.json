            "text": "On Sunday, September 27th, Project Veritas posted a video in which they alleged that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar had bribed people to harvest absentee ballots.  James O'Keefe here in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of the crime.  The person you're about to meet, Liban Muhammad, aka King Liban I, boasts about the hundreds of absentee ballots in his car.  Their evidence for this bold claim was... The evidence that they provided, the way that they proved it, this claim that they were making of a crime... Well, they had a clip from Snapchat of a guy called Libman Osman, who they made sure to call Libman Muhammad to drive home his spooky Muslimness, driving around with a bunch of absentee ballots from sick and elderly people who had voted for his brother, who was running for city council in Minneapolis, which they edited together with some other videos from his Snapchat to make it look like he had paid for the votes.  Also, one of the people they featured in the video who speculates that Ilhan Omar was buying votes, a local activist by the name of Omar Jamal, allegedly offered Osman $10,000 to say he was harvesting ballots for Ilhan Omar.  Now, I'm not a journalist, and I didn't go to reporter school, but as I understand it, paying someone to say something you want them to say, and then reporting that fact without disclosing that you paid them to say it is, uh... That's fraud, right?  Like, they did a big fraud.  Allegedly.  Now, if you're familiar with Project Veritas, none of this is going to come as a shock to you.  This is the kind of thing they like to do.  They come out with some highly unlikely bombshell news story that nobody really takes seriously, because they get caught lying, like, all the friggin' time.  Nobody with half a brain could take this story seriously.  And now I pause for comedic effect.  Here's the president retweeting it.  Project Veritas are perhaps the worst right-wing media grifters in the United States, with the exception of Jacob Wohl.  That's not to say worst as in they have the worst impact, they don't, but worst as in they're extremely bad at what they do, the most inept, clumsy, block-headed attempts to create bogus narratives that always, within days, implode and expose them as the scheming frauds that they are.  And it's tempting to laugh at them, and we will be doing that, we will be laughing at them in this video, but what I find very frustrating and kind of scary about these boneheads is that they manage to get a lot of attention and coverage whenever they launch one of their zany frauds.  No matter how many times they demonstrate they can't be trusted, their press releases are dutifully reported by media companies who know their outrageous and undoubtedly false claims will generate a lot of clicks.  It's trivial to show that they're probably lying.  It's trivial to establish that they have a long history of dishonesty, often just outright paying sources to say whatever it is they want to report.  The thing that's concerning is that it doesn't seem to matter.  They get headlines, and by the time the corrections are issued, everyone's already moved on.  Now it's difficult to say that they're having big effects right now.  Most of the stories they report tend to get shrugged off and ignored because of how unreliable they are.  But what happens when one of them is believable enough to take off?  And as we'll see, they've pulled that off before.  And sure, they've used up most of their credibility since then, but people believe a lot of viral bullshit these days.  How much time have you spent lately trying to convince your older relatives that no, COVID-19 is not a Chinese bioweapon?  We are making tremendous progress with this horrible... Disease that was sent over by China.  China will pay a big price for what they did to the world and to us.  Seems like credibility as a means to dissuade people from believing nonsense stopped working a long time ago.  And that should be pretty friggin' worrying.  Case in point, Project Veritas, an activist group masquerading as a watchdog operation.  They famously set up elaborate, zany stunts to demonstrate corruption in government or to fit some sort of right-wing narrative, and then deceptively edit video footage to make patently false claims.  And this isn't me editorializing.  They've been caught doing this.  several times.  If you're familiar with them, it's likely because they're the assholes that got ACORN defunded in the US, which in the long distant days of 2009 was briefly a huge talking point of the Republican Party.  Veritas founder James O'Keefe manipulated footage to show criminal intent by ACORN workers, while also pretending he had gone into their office in a ridiculous pimp outfit for some reason?  He didn't.  He was just using editing trickery.  He was wearing a normal suit.  I don't know why you gotta pretend you wore a pimp suit there.  That seems a bit much.  Acorn is a non-profit that helps register people to vote and advocates for policies which help lower income people.  The main people that ACORN helped register to vote in the United States before O'Keefe's stunt cost them their funding were Latino and African Americans, which I'm sure is just a coincidence.  And despite the slam-dunk evidence that ACORN was allegedly helping this seeming pimp to hide money from the government, it turns out that most of the ACORN workers who did not know they were being recorded either thought he was kidding and played along , called the police after he left their offices, or outright refused to help.  Now, a few of them did actually offer information to help the woman they thought was a sex worker report her income without getting arrested.  Oh me, oh my, what a heinous crime.  Well, not a crime per se, but a breach of etiquette to be sure.  In several instances, they also clarified that they could not actually abet criminal activities, which O'Keefe edited out of the publicly released videos for some reason.  In any case, those employees were fired the minute the story broke for having the audacity to help someone they thought was a sex worker pay her taxes, those monsters.  So that made Congress cut federal funding to ACORN.  And then they were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by independent investigators.  And then they dissolved citing a lack of funding.  So that's not great.  I mean, sure, a few of the workers at ACORN acted pretty inappropriately, not illegally, mind you, but the dishonest narrative that Project Veritas established, that billions of dollars in government money would be spent to help criminals evade the law or whatever, was patently untrue.  Also, the number they gave for those government funds was just nonsense.  Just loop-de-loops and flibberty gibbets.  To quote the Washington Post, their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds.  But that's a bold exaggeration.  I would perhaps use the term... lie.  As it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.  The number assumes ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, while Acorn says it is not applying for any of the stimulus funds.  This scandal put Project Veritas on the map and while it was obviously deceptive in intent and inaccurate it's the closest they've ever gotten to actually breaking a real story which should tell you something.  It's also like the last time they managed to get anything done because after this everybody kind of realized oh hey These guys are full of shit, and if I act on their coverage, I'm gonna look like a doofus.  It is impossible to overstate how wild their lies are and how badly they manage to convey them.  They pull all sorts of wackadoo stunts, like the time James O'Keefe dressed in an Osama Bin Laden Halloween costume after Bin Laden had been dead for several years and trudged through a river at the Texas-Mexico border to make some kind of point about borders, like how they're insecure because there was no federal agents to be seen, anyone, including the late Osama bin Laden, can waltz right in.
