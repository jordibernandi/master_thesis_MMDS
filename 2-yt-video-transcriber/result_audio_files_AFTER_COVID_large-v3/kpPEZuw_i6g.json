            "text": "Good damn morning, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again.  What?  When is this shit going to stop?  When?  Because you're making it fucking awkward out here.  When is this shit going to stop?  When is the capitulation going to stop?  When are the sacrifices at the altar of wokeness going to stop?  Now you got the NFL sticking their foot up their ass again.  I think that's how the saying goes.  Now, before all the games in week one, which is scheduled for what, September 10th, All the games, all the NFL professional football games are going to start with the Black National Anthem.  Now, you're probably asking yourself the same thing I asked myself when I heard about this.  What the fuck is a Black National Anthem?  Apparently it was written in the late 1800s when there was a time and a need for a Black National Anthem.  Fast forward to now, there's no need for a black national anthem.  Like many other things, it is no longer needed.  NAACP, affirmative action, shit like that.  There was a time, there is no longer a time now.  The black national anthem.  And here's another fucked up part.  They're going to play it before the national anthem.  The only one there should be.  Are they playing any other national anthems?  Aren't there a lot of Ouskies and Kowskies in the NFL?  They playing any Polish national anthems?  They playing any Italian national anthems?  Anybody else?  A couple Africans there.  We're going to play the African national anthem?  What the fuck is this?  And here's the irony.  You're playing the black national anthem before a football game that's packed with rich black people.  The league, the company that has created more black millionaires than any other in the history of the United States.  You're going to play the black national anthem before that game on a field covered with rich black people.  So what's the point?  What's the fucking point?  You want to play a special national anthem?  Why don't you play the one that Whitney Houston sang before the Super Bowl?  Was that in 1990 in the middle of the Gulf War?  Try listening to that and not getting goosebumps all over your body.  That's the one you need to play before football games.  Not the black national anthem.  And Bidenist pervertists, I hope you don't take my black card for what I'm about to say.  I've never heard the black national anthem.  Sorry.  Never heard it.  And even if it is a thing, why are you doing it before the football game now?  You've never done this before.  But now you got everybody who's all wokety-wok-wok.  You got these stupid-ass Zoom calls with all these stupid-ass, overpaid, crying, disconnected, survivor's guilt-ridden fucking players.  I'm Trayvon Martin.  I'm Breonna Taylor.  I'm Michael Brown.  Shut the fuck up.  What you should be saying is, I'm an overpaid crybaby who's mad because of the coronavirus.  Nobody's paying attention to me anymore.  So I gotta bite and scratch at every little piece of relevancy that I can.  How are you crying about systemic racism when you are worth millions of dollars and you're black?  So how did you make it to this level even though you're black.  But there's supposed to be systems, not people, systems in place to keep you down.  So how the fuck did you crack the code?  Why are you not all writing books titled How to Make It Even Though You're Black for Dummies?  How come there's not a series of those yellow and black books?  Why have you not all written books on how to get the fuck out of the hood?  How to get rich?  Because according to you, there are systems in place to keep us down.  You've obviously figured it out.  How did you do it?  Tell the rest of us so we can get rich too.  Oh, there is no quick fix.  It's just hard work.  I know.  Yeah, you guys got talent.  But you had to work hard, didn't you?  That's how you got where you are.  Now, hopefully all you overplayed clowns won't be broke in two years because you don't know how to manage your fucking money.  Why don't you do that?  Why don't you put out some money management videos?  Why don't you put out some financial advisory Zoom calls instead of talking about how fucking downtrodden you are because of racism?  If racism's so bad, why'd you guys all leave the hood?  How come you're not there helping out everybody?  I guarantee you that, and some of these people, and I've seen their houses.  They got this show called Sneaker Shopping that I watch on YouTube sometimes.  And Patrick Mahomes was on there.  He has a room, he's sponsored by Oakley's, he has a room in his house that looks like a sunglass hut.  They got shelves.  All the glasses is backlit.  I think he has a contract with Adidas.  I mean, it looks like a shoe store and a sunglass store out of the mall in his house.  Racism.  Oppression.  If it's so bad, why didn't you guys stick around to help everybody get out just like you did?  Nope.  Because what did Craig's uncle say next Friday?  As soon as I got some money, I was gone.  And I don't blame you.  But don't sit there and tell me that because I'm black, I got a target on my back and weights on my fucking shoulders.  But somehow, your dumb jock passed through school because you were a star ass, figured it out.  So either you're smarter than me, which I doubt, either you're smarter than the average bear, which I doubt, or you're lying.  The black national, and you're going to play that shit before the national anthem?  That's the only anthem that should be played.  That's like if you watch the Olympics and some other fucking country gets the gold and you got to sit there and listen to their national anthem that you ain't never heard before and you don't know the words.  And it makes you mad a little bit to hear somebody else's national anthem.  You think there aren't going to be people like that that feel that way?  You think you're not going to make it awkward for some of the black folks there in the stands because you're playing the black national anthem?  Stop that shit.  Stop that separatist language.  There should only be one national anthem.  Was there a time for a black national anthem?  Yes.  Is there a time for it anymore?  No.  Not at a fucking NFL game.  What are you talking about?  And they don't give a shit.  It's not like they fucking care.  You mean to tell me the NFL's been around for 100 years?  Last year was the 100th season.  And in the 101st season, you go, oh, I get it.  Play the black national anthem.  Let's help black people.  You've already done that, NFL.  The NFL is more than 70% black.  All of them got money.  Are they all millionaires?  No.  But look up the league minimum in the NFL.  They'll be all right.  This is capitulation.  This is not caring.  This is not concern.  This is not genuine concern.  This is, oh, if I don't do this, I'm going to lose money.  That's what this is.  Roger Goodell don't give a fuck, and he shouldn't give a fuck.  Nobody should give a fuck until we do.  How do you expect all these other people to care about you and help you, and you don't want to help you?  That's what children do.  Because we can't hold them responsible for their actions because they're children.  They don't know any better.  That's how they're treating black folks.  I don't need your black national anthem.  I don't need you taking Aunt Jemima away from me.  I don't need you kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds.  Stand your stupid ass up.  Stop trying to wash my feet and get the fuck out of my way.  I got an American dream to get.  Hand me that knife over there so I can slice a piece of the American fucking pie.  Don't slice it for me, warm it up, put a scoop of ice cream on it, put a bib on me and sit there and feed it to me.  I don't need that shit.  Show me where it is, I'll get it myself.  Oh, stupid ass shit.  And they're only doing it for the first week.  What does that tell you?  I can't wait until this shit, until this Black Lives Matter they've written on the street, I can't wait until that fades.  And it's forgotten about.  Because this shit ain't real.  They don't fucking care.  We don't care.  That shit is so stupid.  And why do we need people to care?  I don't need to be uplifted.  Don't fucking touch me.  I don't need nothing from you.  I need equal opportunity, which this country already provides.  So fuck off.  With your little bullshit black screens.  It's stupid.  Am I the only one who is offended by this bullshit?  That's what's offensive.  Not Uncle Ben's.  Not the word master.  Your reaction to this shit is what's offensive.  You lowering the bar is offensive.  Companies, oh, we're going to donate money to black employees and pay off black employees' student loans.  We don't need that shit.  Why don't you pay off everybody's student loans?  How about that?  You want to do something nice?  Do it for everybody.  Don't turn us into fucking pariahs in our workplaces and in public.  Because you want to feel good.  Because you want your little guilt-ridden liberal hard-on to go away.  It's like those stories you hear where people take too much Viagra.  All they want to do is get this boner to go away.  They've tried everything.  They've fucked as many times as they could.  They've jerked off as many times as they could.  They just want it to go away.  So they do stupid shit like this to try to make it go away so they can feel good.  So they can lay that empty granola head of theirs down on their pillow at night and get some memes.  They don't fucking care.  Wait till after this election cycle.  See if they're talking about this.  reparations, black national anthem bullshit.  God, man.  That's what's offensive.  Not what you're telling me I should be offended by, but by what you're doing.  And by the people who are allowing this shit to be done.  What?  Man, I don't even know what to say.  Well, I do.  It ain't over.  You think this is the... The peak, this is the zenith of their stupidity and capitulation.  Nope.  I have a feeling this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Fucking stupid.  Black national anthem.  Get the fuck.  And these fucking sorry ass simps in the NFL are going to be like, yeah man, that's right, that's a good start.  A good start.  to what?  Fix the family.  That's a good start.  Fucking scumbags.  Black National Anthem.  And there's people out there thinking, this is a win.  We're winning.  This ain't a win.  What, because they're playing a song?  That's a win?  Create generational wealth.  That's a win.  Put the numbers how they were before the Civil Rights Movement.  That's a win.  The overwhelming majority of black kids came from two-parent homes.  Check this out.  You ready for this?  That used to be the norm.  You see, now we're dealing with this damn near 75% out-of-wedlock birth rate bullshit.  Back in the day, it was flipped.  80% to 85% of black kids came from two-parent homes.  That was the norm.  That's what got Marcus Sanger to go, what?  They're doing pretty good.  They're going to outdo us.  I got to come up with something.  Plan something.  I don't know.  We'll spitball it later.  Put a pin in that.  Plan something.  We got to do something about this.  You see this stupid shit?  Man, let me get out of here and hop in this damn rat race.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe.  Hit that notification bell because every time it rings, a piece of shit.  liberal cries.
