            "text": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  We come now to the end of yet another year.  Not the calendar year, we still have a handful of weeks to finish that out.  But we come to the end of the church calendar year or the liturgical year.  And it's interesting that among the multitude of things changed with the revolutionary 60s in fact it seems almost nothing was left unchanged since then.  So too we had the change of the placement of a major feast of the church coming out of the 60s.  In the Novus Ordo liturgical calendar, in the Novus Ordo masses of this Sunday, it is the Feast of Christ the King.  In the traditional calendar, that feast falls on the last Sunday of October.  Why the change?  Or what is the significance of the change?  Well, in the Novus Ordo, and as expressed in the gospel text of that mass, the focus of this feast is very eschatological.  That's a big word that scholars like to use to look intelligent.  and have authority in their field.  Eschatology.  It really means the study or concerns about last things.  The end of time.  And in the Novus Ordo, the placing of this feast at the very end of the liturgical year focuses upon the kingship of Christ in the eschaton, or at end times.  And the Gospel reading of that Mass is about the final judgment in which the King of the Universe separates out the sheep and the goats, placing the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.  And biblically speaking, the right is the good side.  And the left is often the side of evil or something less.  In fact, the Latin for left is sinistra, from which our word sinister comes.  But at any rate, the focus of that mass and of the feast in the newer rite, in Novus Ordo rite, is on Christ at the end of time.  When everyone will recognize Christ, the kingship of Christ.  The saints in heaven will recognize that kingship and they will adore, worship, and love Christ the King for eternity in the kingdom.  On the other hand, those goats, the damned from among humanity and the fallen angels, they too will recognize the kingship of Christ but they will not love Christ.  They will never be in the kingdom of Christ, and they will spend their eternity suffering and regretting the choices that they made, or choice in the case of angels.  So we can look at the end of time with regards to the kingship of Christ, but we can also look to the present and that perhaps is more helpful for us.  And in the traditional calendar, by placing this feast in close proximity to the feast of all saints, that in itself is a reminder to the faithful that those saints in heaven, known and unknown to us, but those saints in heaven are there even now because they recognized and submitted in love to Christ the King here and now, or rather in their lifetimes while on earth.  Because the reality is, it is the saints on earth who become the saints of heaven.  And in the case of imperfect saints, which is probably a majority, the imperfect saints will also become the saints of heaven once they have been purified in purgatory.  So in the traditional Mass, there's more focus on the kingship and the kingdom of Christ here and now on earth.  And my friends, with that focus in mind, all of us should be Catholic globalists.  I just used a bad word, used the G word, globalist, and I'm not going to continue to use it, but I want to make a point.  We should, that is the entire world, should recognize and submit to globalism.  Jesus Christ, the king of the universe, here and now.  Every man, woman, and boy and girl in the world.  Even now.  That's what I mean by globalism.  And there should be one world religion.  And that's called Catholicism.  Everyone should belong to the kingdom of Christ here on earth, which is the one true church.  So in that sense, I believe in true globalism.  That is, the entire world recognizes, adores, and submits in love to Jesus Christ the King.  And there is a globalism in which everyone belongs to the kingdom of Christ, which is the Catholic Church.  And there is a globalism in the sense that we have universal laws that we follow, whether divinely revealed or by the natural law.  That's what I mean by globalism.  But a better word for us is called Catholicism.  The word itself, Catholic, means universal.  It's one of the marks or pillars of the church.  So in that sense, yes, we should, will, one ruler and one kingdom worldwide.  And by the way, that does not preclude various forms of human governments.  A republic such as ours, if it were fully oriented to Christ the King in our laws and cultures and ways and practices, that's fine.  We've still submitted to Christ the King.  or some other form of democracy or a monarchy, if the people and in particular the government, the human government, its leaders, submit to Christ, it is legitimate then to have various forms of government and laws that are not incompatible with or contradictory to the laws of the kingdom of Christ.  That's Catholicism worldwide.  But what we are not in favor of and should be absolutely opposed to would be a globalism in the sense that globalists intend it.  A one world government.  A one world religion.  A one world economy.  A one world ecology.  And the reason I have been so passionate week after week from the pulpit in preaching in matters related to this election that we have taking place in our nation, and I use the present tense, taking place now because it's not over until it's over.  And it's not over.  So keep those prayers and penances going.  But my passion and that of so many others, whether it's from the pulpit or outside this church, however it's expressed, is over the fact that there is so much at stake.  More than a particular election.  More than our own nation.  The entire world is at stake in this.  Because there are very... powerful, wealthy elements rising around us, rising worldwide, who are actively, aggressively, and may successfully achieve globalism for the first time in human history.  It has never been achieved in the past, not by any empire, any Caesar, any king or queen, any pharaoh.  Never have they ruled the entire world.  But that is possible in the modern times.  And I don't want to say probable, but it will be if this election is lost and they gain power.  Their globalism is will not be of Jesus Christ, king of the universe.  Their globalism will be of the prince of darkness.  That government will be tyrannical.  That government will not only restrict as we're already feeling that weight, it will constrict us.  In many ways, and in many places, it will literally kill us.  It will have a universal law imposed upon the world.  It will have a universal religion.  Far from being Christian, it will be a religion of the Antichrist.  What was the sin of Satan's and of our parents, Adam and Eve.  It was the sin of rebellion against God.  It was the sin of seeking to make self God in place of God.  Satan and the other apostate angels declared that they will not serve God.  They will determine right from wrong.  They will determine good from evil.  And that's the very temptation put to Eve and then Adam.  Eat of this and you will become like God.  You will become gods.  You won't have to submit to God.  You can determine right from wrong.  You can determine good from evil.  That was their terrible sin that will ripple through humanity until the end of time.  Seeking to be gods.  Refusing to submit.  That is what globalists want.  We already see their handiwork and their effects worldwide and in our own nation.  We see it in the terrible sins that cry out to heaven.  The abomination of abortion.  The sexual perversions.  And so many other ways.  But imagine it on a global scale.  It will be Nothing short of pure humanism.  That will be the religion of the globalists.  Where man is at the center of everything.  Man determines right from wrong.  Man determines good from evil.  And everything is for man and humanity.  That's the sin of Satan and the apostate angels.  That's the sin of Adam and Eve.  That will be the religion of the globalists.  I and you must do everything we can, while there is still time, to oppose this and try to stop it.  But at least if we are not able to, we must recognize it.  So many do not.  In our gospel text of this Mass, which is very apocalyptic, And in the first lesson, there's this delusion that's written of in sacred scripture.  A delusion where so many people do not recognize what's happening.  They don't get it and therefore they go along with it.  I will say this and I will conclude with this.  If the globalists are successful... If the globalists are able to bring about the globalism that they desire, it will be the globalism of the Antichrist, which in every way imaginable will be opposed to Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God.  And if they are able to achieve it, it will be in large part because too much of the world failed to recognize the kingship of Christ and embrace the kingdom of God here on earth.  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. ",
