            "text": "So I found that very interesting that Israel is going into a lockdown on the Feast of Trumpets.  into um fall feasts and the fact that the peace uh the peace deal is going to be signed on tuesday september the 15th and then israel goes into a lockdown on feast of trumpets.  The Lord tells us to watch what goes on in Israel.  Israel is the time.  Israel is a time piece.  Israel.  He says to watch Israel.  So that's what we're doing.  And I just think it's crazy how everything is aligning like this.  I believe that.  people over in israel are going to be screaming for a messiah like they are looking for their messiah.  obviously they're not looking for jesus christ.  they don't.  a lot of them over there don't believe that jesus christ is the messiah.  they're looking for the false messiah.  they are actually which they don't know but they they're looking for the antichrist.  the antichrist um that the bible talks about is going to come on the scene and say, Oh, peace and safety.  And I'm, I have all the answers and all that stuff.  So I think this is just very, very interesting and I wanted to bring it to you.  Um, also, you know, with everything that's going on in the world, guys, like, um, I just saw a smoke NATO yesterday that somebody showed me.  Um, I literally have been, um, posting, um, videos from people in Oregon of just what their towns and cities look like right now.  Like in the daytime, it's just completely red.  The sky, everything's red from the fires that are happening.  And it made me think of the scripture that talks about the vapor of smoke, the fire, or the blood vapor of smoke and fire. ",

There is a bright sun above me.  made me think of that and the earthquakes in the diverse places and guys just like everything that's happening right now.  I know a lot of you guys not only me but like many of you guys can sense something in your spirit like something's off.  it's funny that Barry just did a video this morning talking about it because we're all literally feeling just off like weird like sensing something something's gonna pop off.  um i think it's really funny.  um i talked to um brother chad and kristen and uh joelle and so this is crazy.  okay and i'm not saying that like we we don't know for sure but i think that the lord is trying to warn.  Some of our brothers and sisters are just like warn people that something is coming.  I don't know if something's going to happen today.  I know today's 9-11.  I don't know if something's going to happen.  I pray that it doesn't.  I pray nothing does.  I pray nothing happens today.  But I think the Lord may be trying to show people something coming.  I don't know something.  But this is strange because I was talking to Sister Joelle.  And she texts me this past Tuesday and was like, I have been seeing 9-11 everywhere.  She's actually been seeing it for quite a while, but like recently it's been just nonstop.  She's been seeing 9-11 and you know, the Lord loves numbers.  He uses numbers to speak to people.  Now I'm not somebody who's, I'm not chasing license plates and chasing signs and you know what I'm saying?  Like I'm, just not that person to chase things but like i know for me i see 11 11 everywhere.  i cannot escape 11 11. i only thing that i know that it means is destruction and i truly have felt that the lord has been showing me that in multiple different ways for a long time.  but so he uses numbers to speak to brothers and sisters and she's like.  i've been seeing 9 11 everywhere like she can't escape it and she has just been sensing in her spirit that something is coming.  and she went to go text me that day and it was literally 9 11 and she was just completely in shock like the lord was just confirming it to her.  and so i'm like okay you know i didn't even put two and two in there two and two together that 9 11 was coming up.  um just because i sometimes i'm like so busy i don't even pay attention.  but brother chad was talking to his sister in christ the other day and she said that she just sensed that something was coming on 9.  11. whether it be spiritually whether it be physically whether it be some kind of attack i don't know.  she just sensed that something was coming on 9.  11. and so he was like oh you know okay.  and um so he went to wawa.  i don't know if you guys know what wawa is but it's just.  it's a place where you can get.  i believe it's like on or like.  next i can't remember.  i want to say it's like a place next to a gas station but they have really good sandwiches.  i might be wrong but i've heard of wawa.  anyways he went to go check out And he got his receipt and he said the total, he was like, no kidding, guys.  He was like, the total was 9-11.  Like the Lord was trying to confirm something to him.  So I just thought that was crazy.  I know that Israel just had a triple rainbow over their city.  Let me show you guys this really quick.  It was absolutely breathtaking. ",

            "text": "i know that i saw a rainbow last week.  my mom saw three rainbows i think she said in three consecutive days.  um i just it's.  it just makes me think that The Lord is speaking really loudly.  I know rainbows can probably mean a lot of different things, but when I... think of a rainbow I think of God's promises and I just think he's trying to show people that his promises are true that he really is coming.  he is who he says that he is and guys you can just like really see the Lord speaking so loudly in so many different ways and he's really just trying to show us the times that we're living in.  there have been blood moons that people have been sending me from all over.  Chrissy made a video.  there wasn't even a blood moon to be scheduled and there was one anyways that she showed you guys on video.  people have been sending me things on instagram through messenger.  um there have been signs and uh all kinds of signs that the lord said he would give up in the sky and on the earth down below.  and it's just like how much more does the lord need to give us to show us that like this is the season we are in the times and those who are watching can see that we are seriously in the season.  Like we are the fig tree generation.  And he said that generation shall not pass away until all of these things are fulfilled.  And, um, guys, we are just so close and I want you guys to stay encouraged.  And it's just like so much is happening that I can't even keep up.  I mean, it's, it's, it's exciting to say the least i don't know how much we're going to see.  i just know that the lord is speaking so loudly.  i don't know what is is coming within these next few months but keep looking up.  um the lord doesn't want you to fear.  he's in control.  just keep putting your trust and your faith in him and know that his timing is perfect and that we are in his hands.  we might see some things go down but i truly believe that as things go down we go up and i had that understanding in that dream.  the last dream that i had from the lord the biggest thing was yes i saw things going down but right after the trumpet blew and we went up.  so It was that understanding that he gave me in that dream.  I think that is what he was wanting me to see.  So we might see some things.  And it's crazy because we have been seeing things.  So why wouldn't we see more?  Do I believe that a big tsunami is gonna come on the coast and a wave is gonna swallow us all up?  Or do I believe an earthquake is going to crack all the way down?  um the united states and millions are going to die before the rapture?  no i don't believe that.  I believe those things are coming after the rapture of the church.  But do I think that we may see some things happen right before the rapture?  Absolutely.  I just don't know what it is.  So we're just trying to hang in there.  Hold on.  And we're just trusting in the Lord as things continue to get worse.  But these are all good signs for the believer.  It means that Jesus is coming.  So y'all keep looking up.  Our redemption draws nigh.  I love you all and I'll talk to you soon. ",
