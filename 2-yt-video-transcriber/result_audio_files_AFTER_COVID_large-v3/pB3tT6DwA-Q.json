You know, first I would point you to CDC guidelines.  that said based on current data, the rate of infection among younger schoolchildren and from students to teachers has been low, especially if proper precautions are followed.  There have also been few reports of Children being the primary source of COVID-19 transmission among family members.  That's where the data currently stands.  But that being said, even if there is transmission and later studies come out, let's say, we believe that students should be going back to school because the effect on a child, we know scientifically, they are not affected in the same way as an adult.  Again, I'd point you to CDC guidelines on this.  that says the best available evidence indicates if children become infected, they are far less likely to suffer severe symptoms.  Death rates among school-aged children are much lower than among adults.  and far lower than during the H1N1 pandemic, for instance, when schools remained open.  Yeah, and Dr. ",

You all here are considered essential workers, which is why you were coming into the briefing room every day during the pandemic.  Our meatpackers were meatpacking because they were essential workers.  Our doctors were out there treating because they're essential workers, and we believe our teachers are essential.  Particularly, I pour over the... the data on schools often.  And the one thing that really stuck out to me, I read through the entirety of the CDC guidelines, was that I talk about child abuse often, and one in five cases being reported in schools.  Well, the CDC guidelines went on to say there has not just been a sharp decline in reports of suspected maltreatment, but tragically, a notable increase in evidence of child abuse when children are seen for services during the pandemic.  For example, in Washington DC, Child and Family Services Agency recorded a 62% decrease in child abuse reporting calls between mid-March and April, compared to the same time period in 2019, but saw more severe presentation of child abuse cases in emergency rooms.  That's a tragedy and our schools must reopen. ",
