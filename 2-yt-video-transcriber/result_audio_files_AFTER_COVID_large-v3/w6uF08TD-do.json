            "text": "Okay, hey everybody, John here.  And today I have a warning for men.  And, you know, this is not a shock title, this is not a shock video.  I'm actually quite serious.  I have in front of me a canlee.org page, which is a summary of a court case in Ontario that was heard in the court in December of 2019.  And I'm going to call it a divorce case, although that's possibly a misuse of the word.  divorce because it was a separation of a boyfriend and girlfriend who had been together for 14 years as boyfriend-girlfriend, not as a married couple, as boyfriend-girlfriend, that when they split up, she went after him for support payments, for spousal support, and was awarded spousal support in the amount of $53,000 a month.  Guy was very rich.  Now he appealed this and this decision was modified so that instead of having to pay her $53,000 a month forever until he died, he only has to pay that for 10 years.  What a win.  What a fantastic win.  The upsetting part about this, the disturbing part about this, and it is disturbing, is that the court came to the finding that this was a marriage-style relationship.  This was a spousal relationship.  And the basis on which that decision was made was that they cohabitated.  It was a cohabitating relationship.  You would think from hearing that that they lived together, right?  That's what we generally, when we're speaking English, what the word cohabitation means.  You live in the same house or apartment or condo or whatever, domicile.  You live together.  Well, they didn't, though.  They lived in separate houses, not just separate apartments in an apartment building.  They lived in separate physical discrete spaces.  Now, obviously, being in a sexual relationship, they were each at each other's place a substantial amount of time.  That's normal.  I mean, I go to my friend's place and have dinner quite a bit.  I have people come here.  The Boyfriend, in this case, owned a vacation home.  Now, I'm going to say he owned the vacation home.  You could argue they owned the vacation home if you view them as a unit.  But remember, they were never officially married.  They didn't live together.  They didn't have kids together.  And as far as I can tell, they didn't combine their finances into one bank account.  This is a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.  He owned a vacation home that they went to on a yearly basis for a couple of weeks each year.  That is the sliver of fingernail that the court has used to decide that they cohabitated, and this was a, you're married.  You're married.  You two are married.  So therefore, now that you're breaking up, She gets to get $53,000 a year.  Sorry, I just said $53,000 a year.  That's wrong.  I made a mistake.  It's $53,000 a month.  Apparently, the first decision was for life, forever, and after the appeal, only for 10 years.  But still $53,000 a year.  $53,000 a month.  This decision, which is uncannily, is a substantial precedent.  What it means is... that a boyfriend is a career path, all right, for women.  Having a boyfriend is a financial plan.  So as much as you might think you find someone attractive and you like them, you're spiritually in line with them or you're politically, you share the same interests, you enjoy each other's company, the sex is good or the sex is satisfactory, you like to work out, whatever it is you like to do, whatever it is, the factors that make you attracted to somebody and you want to spend time with them, have them be a romantic partner.  In law, this is a career path for the woman.  You are a financial plan.  And so when you break up, we've grown apart.  or I found that she's been cheating or this is just not working out because I'm never left alone or you're never left alone because yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, or whatever the problem is, you're going to break up.  Uh, well that relationship, the responsibilities to each other inside the relationship, um, when you break up, if we're sane, we think, okay, well we each go our separate ways and we're no longer responsible for each other.  Uh, if indeed you were in the first place, I mean like you're not really responsible for the life choices of somebody just cause you're dating them.  You're not responsible to pay their rent.  You're not responsible for, uh, you know, paying for them to take night courses or whatever.  But in this case, not only do those responsibilities exist inside the relationship, because this guy was very nice and generous to his girlfriend, now that they've split, he has to still keep paying for her.  So gentlemen, especially, especially financially successful guys, beware.  I think this is a signal that you actually cannot view a romantic friendly relationship as a romantic friendly relationship.  You have to be constantly, not just when you meet somebody, you have to be evaluating that every single day.  Am I getting walked into a box canyon?  Is this an ambush?  And even if she is kind and generous and nice and has a good moral ethic, if at any time her mood changes or her personality changes, and she decides, this guy is no longer inside the boundary of who I call nice people.  I'm going to put him outside the boundary and make him an enemy.  Therefore, I can do whatever I want to him.  The legal standard after this is that you can be financially exploited.  And the court's decision here to call it corrupt to call this corrupt the court said the basis for viewing this as a as a marriage style relationship is cohabitation except that you and i normal people speaking normal english would look at that relationship.  you you do not live together you have.  you vacationed together you went to a vacation.  so if you ever went anywhere with your girlfriend and lived in the same place for a week or a weekend you booked a hotel in cancun Or you went camping in Banff and lived in the same tent.  According to the Canadian court, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, that's cohabitation.  That's good enough.  You're married.  Bang.  You're on the hook.  And if you think this isn't going to be exploited... So not only is this, by the way, a wake-up call to men, and most men aren't going to get this wake-up call.  It's going to take years for this to percolate, and it's not going to come percolating from guys like me or even Janice Fiamengo, who talked about this a week ago.  By the way, watch her excellent video.  I'll link to it in the low bar.  the awareness of this in the general public is going to percolate through water cooler talk at the office when you hear the grief of your office co-worker getting financially ruined by the family court on frivolous grounds, on corrupt basis.  So to call this corrupt diminishes the value of the word.  I mean, the word corrupt doesn't reach far enough to encompass this.  And this leads me to a question, and this question is going to upset people because I'm going to use a red-hot word that has so much emotional freight attached to it that I'm going to ask you in advance not to get all excited when I say it.  The question is, does this constitute slavery?  Does this situation, this legal apparatus that is now in place where you can have a romantic relationship affection-based relationship that is not marriage, without cohabitation, without combining bank account, without combining your finances, and without having kids, and when you part company, the court apparatus will be used to claw your wealth away from you.  You will be responsible for paying for somebody as if they are your child, an adult who you had an adult relationship with, And if you're a rich guy like this, $53,000 a month.  And if you are not as rich, it'll be based on your income.  And by the way, if you're very wealthy during a relationship and then your financial situation changes afterwards, the financial status you were at in the relationship is what your ongoing payments will be.  So let's say you're a million dollar a year guy and then the global economy changes and your work situation changes.  or you get older or you make a career path change or whatever.  You want to have a more simplified life, so you choose simplicity ahead of money, so you make less money.  Well, guess what?  You made that much money while you were together, you're going to pay that much money no matter what.  So the question is, is this slavery?  Does this satisfy the requirements for us to reasonably consider this to be slavery?  And I don't mean the old, stupid, archaic concept of wearing shackles and picking cotton.  That's 18th century slavery.  Modern slavery is modern.  It's still slavery, though.  And does this qualify?  I think the answer is yes.  Gentlemen, beware.  Beware.  If you're not MGTOW now, what's it going to take?  Anyway, thanks very much for watching.  Thanks to all the people hitting the subscribe button and the notification bell.
