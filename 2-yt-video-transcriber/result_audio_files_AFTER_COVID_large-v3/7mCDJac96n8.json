And get ready for supernatural miracles that take place in your home and your life.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  It's causing those powers to be destroyed.  And Thelma.  Oh, my God.  Shout out to the Lord.  Hallelujah.  Thank you.  God is healing you.  Oh, that's it right there.  Oh, my God.  Tell me how you feel now.  I feel good.  I feel the spirit of God.  I feel him all over your tooth, Emma.  God is touching you in such a powerful way right now.  Thank you, Jesus.  Lift those hands before God and tell God thank you.  And the snakes, I command you to loose your hold off of family's life now.  Jesus.  Girl, that's it right there.  A miracle worker in God.  And God, I command those walls to come down.  And I receive new words of his mind.  Oh, that's it right there, Alvin.  Take a deep breath.  God!  And receive you the peace.  Oh, Kobai.  Of Almighty God.  Take another deep breath, Alvin.  God!  And receive you the peace.  Did you feel that, Alvin?  Yes.  Together than they've ever been before.  In Jesus' name.  And God is going to cause the middle country town, but God has empowered us.  You know, I read it, but God to work the miracles.  And once I receive it back and I begin to pray for you, It's going to get me greater.  Satan, I bind your powers over Elaine's life, over her family, over her finances, and I command it to be destroyed.  No!  Oh, that's it right there, Elaine. ",
