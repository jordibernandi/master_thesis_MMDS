            "text": "Absolutely gaping possibility of actual war between the United States and China.  You think I'm being fanciful?  The United States, having earlier withdrawn from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the INF Treaty, has now withdrawn from the Open Skies Treaty.  had already withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, has effectively scrapped phase two of its trade deal with China, has introduced into its Senate a resolution to delist Chinese companies from the New York Stock Exchange, individual United States administrations in the states, have begun legal proceedings to confiscate hundreds of billions of dollars of China's assets.  The United States has gone on to the offensive in Hong Kong, joined by Fat Pang, the fat plutocrat former governor of Hong Kong, from London, thousands of miles away, in the papers today, warning China most severely about what it must do in China.  Fat Pan, the days when Britain could cut the heads off Chinese people are gone forever.  Fat Donald Trump, the days when China can be ordered what to do by you are long gone.  That's why when Donald Trump sends his heavy strategic bombing fleet, not making this up, into the South China Sea to join the warships, so plentiful they're bumping into each other in the South China Sea.
