Hello, Bezal T3.  It's very common for churches to have a fall kickoff Sunday where the congregation is clued into the plans for the church body after the summer break.  Perhaps a new Sunday morning education class is being offered, or a new preaching series, perhaps a different mission emphasis, or some other bit of info that needs to be announced.  In smaller churches, this is usually done during a time of fellowship, maybe with a time of enjoying a breakfast or brunch before the worship service.  But in many megachurches, this occurs during the worship service, such as the case at Eagle Brook.  But here, the emphasis is not on announcing new classes or a new youth program, but rather, wait for it, entertainment. ",

Now on the one hand, it's really quite impressive that Eagle Brook has the talent and resources to produce something like that.  I mean, that wasn't cobbled together in a day.  But it does raise an important question.  What is the motivation of the leadership of Eagle Brook to invest in and present what can only be called entertainment during the worship service?  If it's to attract new attenders by blowing them away with a really exciting worship experience, then I fear that they have not considered the unintended consequences.  Those being, whatever you use to get people in the door, you're going to have to keep giving it to them to get them coming back.  If I might quote from the words of the rock band Nirvana and their song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, here we are now, entertain us.  You know, there's a strong parallel to John chapter 6 and what's going on here.  In John 6 we have Jesus feeding the five thousand with five loaves of bread and a few fish.  The people respond to this miracle by saying, this is indeed the prophet who has come into the world.  Then Jesus, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.  The next day the crowd followed after Jesus and finds him.  Jesus says to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.  In other words, Jesus says to them, I did not come among you to be a heavenly fast food drive-thru.  Then Jesus says, Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.  For on him God the Father has set his seal.  The people then say to him, What must we do to be doing the works of God?  Listen to this.  Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.  Now that's a gift of faith, by the way.  It's not a work that we do.  So they said, well, what miracle will you do for us?  that we will see it and believe in you?  What work will you perform?  You see, yesterday's miracle was just like yesterday's newspaper.  It's tired and forlorn.  They want a new miracle.  It is here that Jesus begins some of the hardest sayings that he has ever said to the people.  He tells them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.  For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.  Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.  When many of his disciples heard it, they said, Well, this is a hard saying, and who can listen to it?  No more miracle, just hard teaching.  And what was the result?  Well, we're told in verse 66 of chapter 6, After this, many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.  It's the same story with bigger and more exciting worship experiences.  You have to keep upping the amperage to keep them coming back. ",
