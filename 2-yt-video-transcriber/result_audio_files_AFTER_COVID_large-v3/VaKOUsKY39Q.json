No, it's an investigative detention.  That's all this is.  Detained for what, though?  For what crime?  It's not a crime.  You're not detained for a crime.  So if I'm not being detained, am I free to go?  You're being detained right now for an investigative purpose.  For what crime?  Just making sure everybody's okay to keep on driving.
