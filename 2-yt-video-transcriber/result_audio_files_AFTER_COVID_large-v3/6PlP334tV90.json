Also, I think currently still available on YouTube and different channels.  On Friday, she was summarily arrested without any much explanation.  She put out a short video while she was being arrested.  The officers did not have an arrest warrant to give her, which is weird.  And they said that she was under sealed grand jury indictment.  They said something about burglary.  What has come out since then, though I cannot confirm any of this, nor do I have direct access to the information, and I may down the road represent Millie Weaver.  This case goes in certain directions, but do not currently. ",

To his credit, Ezra Levant, the guy you know up in Canada, the rebel, created a GoFundMe for her.  He started out at 20,000.  And I was going to tell Ezra, the lawyers you hire for 20,000 are not going to handle political cases.  That's your plea.  Give people just a two second upshot on how criminal defense works.  Any lawyer who charges you a low amount of money is expecting you to plead guilty and not expecting to have to work the file.  uh if they're expecting to work the file because it's often hard to withdraw from a criminal case they usually require a big flat fee up front because they often cannot get out of a criminal case if you quit paying.  if they do any other structure.  so typically uh.  and goes to the argument you're making about fees in the keemstar case the uh.  to give people an idea for attorneys fees in big urban areas high profile political cases.  Average hourly rate is, well, on Wall Street, it's $1,500 an hour now.  High profile criminal case, $1,000 an hour.  If you're at a mid-tier city, decent city, but a million plus, but mid-tier, $750 an hour.  Smaller city, $500 an hour.  The lowest rate you get is, so top 1% of lawyers are $1,000 an hour plus.  Top 10% are $750 plus.  Median is $500 an hour.  Bottom 25 is $300.  Bottom bottom 10 percent is 250.  And imagine in a case like Millie Weaver, if you work at just 80 hours, just of attorney time, that's 20 grand.  So that's where it's hard to work a file correctly for a low fee unless you plan on pleading the case.  So you'll get a lot of like.  you call up and say you got a DUI misdemeanor.  Lawyer might say five grand, 10 grand, 20 grand.  That's because he just anticipates doing one day at work no more.  Um, and his, his whole economic model goes out the door if he has to work the case.  So, uh, the, uh, but so Millie Weaver suddenly gets arrested.  They allege burglary.  What has come out since then, but it hasn't been publicly confirmed either by Millie Weaver or the courts is apparently, uh, A parent was at her house some months ago because of the pandemic related issues, was at the house, saw a bunch of documents that she was looking at for her Shadowgate documentary, may have concluded that they took photos apparently of the documents.  The phone was taken from her because they were trying to protect the documents, gave her a new phone.  And purportedly, that's what may be because she doesn't even know.  I mean, she hasn't disclosed anything contrary yet.  That may be the basis of the allegation of burglary, obstruction of justice, burglarizing records, obstructing of justice, something else with evidence and domestic violence.  Now, apparently her mother has said something on Facebook.  I don't I can't confirm that it is her mother.  Her mother said that while she originally went to authorities, she had told them not to go forward at all.  I find it extraordinarily suspicious.  that this case justified an arrest. ",

That's every reporter in the history of disclosing whistleblower records.  I've never known a reporter to say, no, no, no, whatever you do, don't get me those records.  That isn't what they say.  So the criminal law has always said, For First Amendment purposes, you cannot put somebody in prison for disclosing records, regardless of whether those records were originally stolen, unless you personally stole those records.  And so that's deeply problematic.  if they're trying to use the theory against Assange, where they're saying, if you encouraged it, now it's suddenly life in prison.  Are they doing the same thing to Millie Weaver right on the eve of her releasing her documentary?  that's all about this kind of illicit activities? ",

Coincidentally, her mother came to stay with her during the pandemic, witnessed child abuse between the parents, videotaped it, recorded it, whatever.  Millie and her husband tried to, you know, steal the phone from her mother, which hence the domestic violence charges, hence the tampering with evidence that they tried to delete the video from the phone, hence the robbery.  I think it's been changed to robbery from burglary, or at least that's what's been clarified.  So that may be the entire story.  And then just jumping to the conclusion that it relates to the documentary or the release of the documentary or any of the documents obtained in that context is a leap, an unsubstantiated leap that represents bias or predetermined direction we want to go in.

So it's the woke nonsense.  The only thing Sweden's done right is how they responded to the pandemic.  Because their public health officials are so irascibly independent.  It's the last good Swedes left in Sweden.  But either way, it breaks down.  Julian Assange's accusation at the time was that this was entirely being politically manipulated to get control over him for U.S.  prosecutorial purposes.  Ultimately, all of the rape charges were dismissed.  by the Swedish authorities.  There was reason to believe that it was a setup in multiple ways.  And he's now jailed, waiting extradition, which would not have been possible, but for those rape charges originally being brought.  So my view is always when I tell people, maybe it's a coincidence that they're bringing these charges right on the eve of a documentary coming out that implicates deep state actors and various nefarious activities with two different whistleblowers.  But in my personal professional experience, it is generally ill-advised to presume that coincidence is a coincidence.  It's still proven otherwise. ",

I've never heard of them coming back.  They usually bring it right away if they believe the case.  Why multiple month delay?  And so the other aspect of this is the hold, which you've noted being held without bail pending a judicial hearing on Monday.  that may violate the excessive bail clause, depending on how they're doing it.  They used to do it all the time.  They pick up people late on a Friday to stick them in jail because they say, oh, the judge not available till Monday.  So that's deliberate.  That's prosecutorial manipulation of the arrest timing for the purposes of creating the worst possible course of conditions of being locked in jail and over the weekend is the worst.  They bring in all the worst people over the weekend to be stuck in with to not get bail.  I've almost never heard of this.  And this is a summons case.  You say, hey, you got to show up on court next week.  So there's many highly irregular activities that are going on in that county.  And for me, when you combine the irregularities with the timing of her move, with the arrest and the timing of her releasing this film, I'm going to be skeptical that politics was not the motivation until proven otherwise.

Flight risk is not exactly the biggest risk for someone of Millie from what I understand of her now.  So it's like, it's one of two things, neither of which are gonna, neither of which make much sense.  It's either directly related and, you know, it's related to theft of documents that made it into the documentary because there are some issues and questions as to the individual who provided those documents, or it's totally unrelated, in which case it really reeks of more of this selective prosecution against an overtly conservative individual with ties to the notorious Infowars and Taking the full force of the police agency to arrest her on a first-time domestic violence charge.  How both parents get arrested if it's not against the kids.  Either way, it doesn't make much sense.  And we'll find out more.  And with any luck, the indictment would have to be unsealed.

A bunch of people end up getting arrested.  A bunch of other people end up getting released that were guilty of attempted pedophilia.  That once you get close to people in power, suddenly there's a criminal justice investigation into you for something.  So if you're on the wrong side of that political power equation, there's a long history of it in the United States.  It's gotten really bad over the past during the people opposed to Trump.
