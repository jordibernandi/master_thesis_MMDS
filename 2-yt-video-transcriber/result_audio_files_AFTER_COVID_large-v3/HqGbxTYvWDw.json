            "text": "So, as often happens with, it seems, feminists and women, they want something, they demand something, and when they get something, they don't want it anymore because they didn't look at the possible consequences of whatever they wanted.  Sexual revolution.  Really good.  Women get out there.  They can have all the dick they want.  And then when they can't find a man in their 30s, well, it's their fault.  You should accept me for, it was my past.  I was sowing my wild oats.  No, see, men have a choice in life.  We don't have to accept that.  Well, yes, you do, because you're a misogynist.  I mean, by now you know how the game is played, right?  No matter what choices she makes in life, no matter what she does with her life, you're expected to accept it as a man.  And if you don't, you're evil.  The concept... that these women and feminists, that men wouldn't change to adapt and overcome whatever new bullshit is put in the way of men is ridiculous.  We're supposed to stay the same.  Societal expectations on women in the 60s removed so they can do anything they want, but men were supposed to remain the same.  chivalrous, want to get married, and so on.  But only when she's ready.  And men are saying, eh, nah.  I mean, I've talked about it before.  One of the main attractions of marriage back in the day was pootie.  was not that available, right?  Sure, you could find it.  There was probably 10% or whatever of women that would give it up.  But there wasn't a lot.  It wasn't widespread.  Now, put some hookup app on your phone.  You know, 10 minutes later, you're banging some chick.  Well, I mean, not me, but if you're good looking enough, you could get poontang.  It's everywhere.  So what the sexual revolution did, and it's an obvious open secret, is it devalued the poon.  They never want to tell you that, do they?  They don't say, no, no, no, it's not that.  It's man or evil.  You know how it is.  Come on.  So here's a dating expert in DailyMail.co.uk.  How Me Too has ruined dating.  Do you think?  She's an expert in air quotes.  She runs a 4,500-pound boot camp for men.  She's claiming men have become dull and boring because they don't take the bull by the horns.  Hmm.  No one saw this coming, right?  No one saw a backlash to Me Too down the road, did they?  No, well, not women.  Well, some women did.  Some of the more reasonable ones said, hey, wait a minute, you know, if you accuse everybody of all this stuff, nobody's going to want to talk to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Men adapt and overcome to whatever rules are put in place.  But of course, that's a problem, isn't it?  So the dating expert Kezia Noble, 38 years old from Chelsea, southwest London, is an author and some celebrity, whatever, said many blokes have adopted dull, nice guy filters that actually repel women rather than attract them.  The divorced mother of one, whose YouTube videos have 75 million views, guys.  The thirst is real, people.  She said while the empowering movement, Me Too, that is, has served a very good purpose, debatable, she is concerned about its trickle effect, which has made men feel that they can't talk to or interact with women in real life.  No, we don't feel that.  We know that there are actual serious consequences if we try to hit on the wrong woman, especially at work.  And if guys, if you're still hitting on chicks at work, you know, dude, you just pulled the pin on your own grenade.  You just don't know when it's going to go off, guys.  Don't do it.  Kezia added that most women she speaks to say they are fed up with, quote, woke men being too nice and bumbling, and they want a guy to take the bull by the horns and ask them out.  Well, Kezia, you told men we need to get woke about how women are so oppressed and all sexual harassed and raped and all the other.  Okay, we're paying attention now.  We're getting woke.  You told us what we need to do.  Now we're doing it.  Now it's a big problem.  Do you see how that works?  She told female the Me Too movement served a good purpose.  And she brings up Harvey Weinstein, who just has been convicted of a couple of sexual crimes, right?  Do you see any difference, Kezia, between Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted in a court of law by a jury of his peers on two counts of sexual misconduct?  And Joe the janitor, who looked at a woman wrong one day, she was creeped out, went to HR, now Joe doesn't have a job.  You see any difference between those two stories?  And keep in mind, Kezia, there has been exactly one man convicted or even charged with criminal activity in the entire Me Too movement.  Actually, two.  Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein.  The rest of them was hearsay.  Her word only.  Oh, he did something to me in the elevator.  Ten minutes later, you're in HR, your shit's boxed up, and you're gone.  Just like that.  On her word alone.  And we don't even have to get into the Title IX college thing.  That's even worse.  She continues, You don't want normal, average guys approaching you.  What you want is the top shelf guys approaching you.  Now, all of this stuff is scaring away Mr.  Average hamsters in the world.  We don't want anything to do with it.  Okay.  They don't care.  That's not what they're talking about.  What they're talking about is the top shelf guys are saying, no, no, no.  I got a lot to lose here.  I've got a business.  You know, I've got a reputation.  I've got cash.  I'm not going to do that because why?  What's the point?  Desirable men are pursued by women, not the other way around, you see.  And being a dating expert, Kezia, you ought to know that.  She continues, it's being perpetuated.  like you've got to be super, super respectful to women.  You can't invade their space.  You can't talk to her.  You can't approach her.  What have men been told to do?  Be respectful.  Don't invade her space.  Don't talk to her unless you can read her mind and she wants you to talk to her.  And don't approach her, because that's street harassment, isn't it?  In a little town in your beautiful country of England, Nottinghamshire, it is illegal.  For men to come up and talk to women, it can be considered a hate crime.  But it all depends on her.  See, subjective laws.  No.  So why take a chance?  You never know what kind of mood she's in or if she's attracted to you.  You can't read minds.  And that's what women are expecting us to do.  Read their mind.  You should be able to tell if she wants you to come up and approach her.  Bullshit.  No.  Thank you.  Kezia went on to say that it's caused men to water down... their masculine traits, and take on a nice guy persona.  Well, isn't masculinity all toxic, Kezia?  That's what the feminism tells us.  Men are all toxic, evil, Nazis, white supremacists, and nasty rapists, right?  We've been told that for years.  Decades in some cases.  Because number one, we're not that.  Number two, if a woman says we are, then even if nothing happened.  It's a bit dull.  It's watering the guy's traits down.  His character, his boldness.  To make him this nice, inoffensive, bland, forgettable, nice guy.  You need to take this up with your local feminist organization.  Because that's exactly what they've been telling men to be.  She argued that men can be alpha males without being a B-word to women.  Treat them mean to keep them keen doesn't mean be abusive.  It just means don't be so readily available.  Show that you have other options.  Things like that.  It's just game strategy which women play on men and men play on women.  I just feel like that's getting a bit lost.  Well, of course, show the woman you have other options.  Because if you do, you're a desirable dude, right?  Average guys need not apply.  You're all creepy rapists, so stay away.  But not Brad Pitt or Chris Pratt or whoever the hot guy is these days, right?  So Kezi is basically, she's a female pickup artist and check this out.  She runs weekend workshops costing 487 pounds and seven day mastery programs for 4,500 pounds, as well as offering online training programs and eBooks to help men meet.  Well, I thought this PUA stuff kind of went away.  Not entirely, apparently, because now we have a female trying to grab some cash from telling men how to date women.  As Better Bachelor Joker said, you don't ask a fish how to catch fish.  You ask a fisherman how to catch fish.  I'll put that link below in the link to the article so you can look it up.
