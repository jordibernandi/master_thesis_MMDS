            "text": "hey what's up everybody?  this is Dante Fortson here with episode number 12 of ask an Israelite do all black Hebrew Israelites believe in the 12 tribes chart?  I'm gonna get into that.  that's controversial because a lot of people think that all people who identify as Israelites which is what we call ourselves we don't call ourselves black Hebrew Israelites.  they think that all of us agree with and accept that 12 tribes chart.  so for those that don't know ask an Israelite is your opportunity to connect with the Israelite community and ask questions and get answers directly from one of us.  so if you want to do that leave comments in the comment section or you can also go to BHIT yeah BHITBforums.com and leave a question in the forum and you can also interact with other Israelites on the forum.  that's BHITBforums.com forums with an S. so the disclaimer before i get started.  i do not speak for all israelites.  the views and opinions expressed in this video are my own.  i am not associated with any bhi camp or denomination.  if you have questions about specific camp doctrine you should contact that camp so they can answer for themselves.  i don't answer questions about specific camp doctrines.  identify as an Israelite by birth.  that's important not religion.  it's not a religion.  it's an ethnicity it's a race it's a heritage it's by birth.  that's how I identify.  so do all black Hebrew Israelites believe in the twelve tribes chart?  all right.  so for those who are not familiar with the twelve tribes chart there is a chart that outlines the twelve tribes and who some Israelites believe are the people of those tribes.  however not all of us believe in this chart and there are several reasons why many of us don't believe in this chart.  the number one reason that well my number one reason I'm not gonna say for all Israelites.  my number one reason is that the chart names individual people and entire countries.  that's it's very non-specific.  so for example Argentina Chile Colombia and Uruguay are countries that consist of lots of people of lots of different ethnicities from lots of different backgrounds.  those are not individual people in the country.  they are naming the entire country.  so it's indistinguishable on how you determine who or you can't determine who's an Israelite.  so if anybody from Argentina or Chile or Colombia or Uruguay um just shows up they are automatically assumed to be israelite no matter where they originated from and that's that's an inconsistency.  two of the tribes are redundant.  uh the tribe of gad and the tribe of ruben north american indians.  that covers all of north america.  and then you have the seminal indians who were in florida and florida is part of north america.  so becomes confusing.  how do they designate that?  the Seminole Indians specifically were different from all other North American Indians.  and then you have the Cherokee Indians who did have a belief system similar to Judaism.  I use that word loosely.  I don't really like to use it to describe the belief system but we'll say Judaism.  how do you determine that?  they are all gad but the Seminole is Ruben?  so there's a lot of problems here and so these are just two of the reasons that some of us do not accept this chart to be legitimate.  you want to support asking Israelite.  go to patreon.com.  forward slash Dante Fortson.  it's only one dollar to become a patron.  if you want to support via cash app you can do that with cash tag BH ITB.  you can do it via PayPal the link is in the description and if you catch the live premieres you can always support via super chat and a share and a prayer are always appreciated.  so if you like this go ahead and click the thumbs up button.  make sure you click the subscribe button and most importantly make sure you click the notification bell so you get notified anytime new videos are posted.  so with that said until next time I'm out.
