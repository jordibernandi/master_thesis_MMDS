            "text": "So Kathleen Kennedy is front and center once again talking about taking a sledgehammer to Star Wars.  Why is she doing that?  Well, because she's rewarded for doing so.  As you can see here, with her winning a BAFTA or a British Academy Film and Television Award.  Isn't that lovely?  What she's talking about in this is giving someone a Star Wars movie simply because of their gender.  Why would she do that?  Well, because she's a role model, she claims.  Because she's inspiring people.  Because the future is, I forget, what's that word again?  Oh, yeah, right.  I mean, seriously, imagine framing this another way, saying, hey, we need more male directors out there.  You know, because of role models, everyone looks up to men.  You know what they would call that afterwards?  They would call that canceled.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  So hey there, so today I want to return to that wonderful world of trash fires to talk about my favorite trash fire out there.  That's right, you guessed it, Disney's Star Wars and Kathleen Kennedy at the helm.  Now all of this revolves around the BAFTAs and to truly understand that ego and the pomp that you see in these comments, you have to look at how the BAFTA builds people up.  I mean, here is an excerpt from this.  And I mean, look at this description for it.  We start out with a quote saying, I like being a role model.  It's exciting to me that young women are inspired by what I've done.  About me, I like what I am here.  You look up to me.  And then look at this.  Kathleen Kennedy might be Hollywood's most powerful woman, but she's still a little unused to the spotlight.  For years, she served comfortably as a puppeteer, an invisible hand pulling at the strings.  Now it's Kennedy's moment to step out of the shadows.  As president of Lucasfilm, she's the person behind a new generation of Star Wars films, television shows, books, and games.  I am much more comfortable behind the camera, she jokes, but I like being a role model.  It's exciting to me that young women are inspired by what I've done. ",
