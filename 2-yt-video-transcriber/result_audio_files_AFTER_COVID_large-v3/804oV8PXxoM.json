The Democrats had been trying to do this with the so-called Equality Act, but it had not gotten through Congress.  So Justice Gorsuch and a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court decided, hey, why not do it ourselves?  And we'll just rewrite the Civil Rights Act of 1964. to pretend that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 included sexual orientation and transgenderism, concepts in the case of sexual orientation that clearly were not included, or in the case of gender identity that nobody had ever heard of because it's crazy.

Whoever first came up with the idea of those triangles probably had no idea that the square of the hypotenuse was equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, but that doesn't change the fact that it is inherent to the concept.  The reason why discriminating based on orientation is the same as discriminating based on sex is because if you allow employees of one sex to date men, but you don't allow employees of another sex to date men, then you are treating the sexes differently.  With respect to transphobic discrimination, if you allow some employees to use a set of pronouns, but not others, and you base that distinction on what you regard to be their sex, then you are discriminating on the basis of what you regard to be their sex.

The point is not to protect anyone with any particular biology.  The point is to take biology out of the equation.

            "text": "I guess the reasoning here is that if you have two double standards, one invidious to men and a different one invidious to women, the two cancel each other out.  This is absurd.  As the court wrote, if an employer fires a man for not acting masculine enough, but also fires a woman for not being feminine enough, in both cases the employer fires an individual in part because of sex.  Instead of avoiding Title VII exposure, this employer doubles it.  Banning men from wearing dresses is not made less bigoted by banning women from wearing ties.  If you do that, all you're doing is being bigoted twice.  To everyone who helps me out on Patreon, you're a big help.  Thanks so much. ",
