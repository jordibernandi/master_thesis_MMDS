            "text": "You guys, our ex-faves are washed up, and the future of YouTube is parasocialism.  This is, of course, according to me, an internet loudmouth nobody, and also pretty sure parasocialism is not a word.  All right, you guys, parasocialism.  In case it's not obvious, I'm conflating parasocial the adjective used to describe relationships that are one-sided, wherein one person is invested emotionally in another person, even though the latter person isn't necessarily aware that the former exists.  Basically, my relationship with Beyonce.  With socialism.  Quick recap of socialism.  Socialism is when a society has collective ownership over enterprise.  So, the people as a whole own the means of production and participate in its management.  Para... Now I'll concede right here and now that this isn't a perfect portmanteau to describe where I believe YouTube is headed with perfect accuracy, but it sounded kind of catchy so I ran with it.  Okay, so let's start with the rise of the micro-influencer.  I have never been on Facebook or Twitter for that matter, and in really several, quite a lot of ways, hate the way that social networks and social media have changed our relationships.  You know, the whole thing about how the more connected we are, the less connected we are, man.  Listen, it's trite, but it's true.  Still, I've always thought of YouTube as a social network, and based on how much I use it, it's an easy argument to make that it's my favorite social network.  Frankly, I originally only joined IG because I didn't want to have to buy my name off of some con artist in the unlikely event that this channel ever became successful.  Still waiting on that, by the way.  YouTube is constantly evolving.  First, due to us changing YouTube through our changes in behaviors as users.  Two, through YouTube changing the platform and doing product updates so that it reflects what they want it to be.  Often, perhaps always, these two pursuits are at odds.  Often, our behavioral changes as users are a reflection of us responding to product updates and changes that we don't like.  And third, we've evolved to a point where there's not so much of a separation between those of us who watch a lot of YouTube, who are the YouTube fans, and those of us who are also steadily creating the content on YouTube.  That line is more blurred than ever since so many of us do both.  Throughout the evolution of this platform, I've stuck around.  I always say I'm a YouTube fan first, and I also happen to make videos.  I don't watch any less YouTube than I did a few years ago, and in fact, I might watch more, but I'm also way more active with creating content than I was a few years ago, despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my issues with this platform, which makes me an example of someone who has a direct relationship between how much YouTube I watch and how much YouTube I make.  Both graphs trend upward over the past several years.  Interestingly enough, as a YouTube fan, the parasocial relationships that I've had on here have more than once turned into real ones.  Dr.  Michelle, AKA Ghana Goddess, is legitimately one of my close real life friends now.  There is Alicia, AKA Kinky Sweat, Mel Thompson, Justin aka king of reads.  I could go on but these are all people who I consider to be friends of mine and we all met Through YouTube and I'm so happy when my YouTube friends and this includes the parasocial ones the people who don't know I even exist I'm thrilled when they reach a new milestone or get some other kind of recognition.  frankly I'm just happy whenever they upload a new video because it means I get to spend some time with them that day and It's not sad.  So all of these parasocial relationships that we have, particularly with micro influencers, we feel invested in the success of these smaller creators whom we support because in so many ways, it feels like we too are succeeding by proxy.  I, and I know a lot of you guys, applaud our micro-faves when they score a sponsor for a video.  Let's keep it a buck, if a company is reaching out to me for a video, then they must really stand behind their product.  Most brands out here are staying the hell away from content creators who are, uh, honest.  Telling the truth, being honest, being trustworthy, these are qualities that can often doom the micro-influencer to remain a micro.  influencer.  Content creators who can't be controlled are seen as a liability by quite a lot of brands, but that's the same quality that endears them to their fans, bars, which is what brings us to why so many smaller channels remain small.  And it feeds the growing sentiment that you can't trust anyone with over a million subscribers.  I've seen this express in the comments and I've chatted with some of you guys about it.  Ironically, due to the fervent enthusiasm that more and more and more of us have for these smaller channels due to our sense of personal ownership and investment in them, they're surging in numbers to the point that many of them can't even be considered micro any longer.  But I think they're still emblematic of what more and more of us are rewarding as viewers.  Don't be startled by the change in lighting.  The sun is setting on me, so I had to re-zoze a couple camera settings.  Anyway, we're in a time where one can routinely see channels that get more views per video than they have subscribers.  Or channels that regularly get a rather massive subscriber-to-view conversion rate in the range of 30-50% on a regular degular video.  In the old days of YouTube, a 10% conversion rate was the metric of a solid, reliable subscriber base.  Granted, nowadays, in nearly all cases, many views are from drive-bys, people who watch the videos but are not subscribed to the channel in question, but we don't need to get into all of that on today.  Meanwhile, I'm noticing that the old guard of YouTube, you know, these channels that have been around and many of which now have subscribers in the millions, can't even hit that 10% conversion rate.  I see it with the booty gurus, natural hair channels, and even the bundle queens, you know, the wig and weave focus channels.  In short, the measures of YouTube success are changing and drastically.  We can no longer look at a person's subscriber count, see millions, and assume that person's killing the game because a lot of the big channels ain't.  Even in makeup land, the smaller channels who typically don't get a lot of exposure and don't get a lot of PR, more and more people are flocking to these channels for information, reviews, what have you, rather than the old school booty gurus.  For a lot of us, it's no longer interesting to see what so and so with two, three, four, five million subscribers has to say about the newest mascara.  More value is being placed on people we actually relate to and who typically have to buy the makeup with their own money.  Big YouTubers are by no means dead, nor do I think that they're going away.  But it ain't what it used to be for a lot of them, and I don't think it ever will be again.  I think the influencer bubble is bursting if she ain't already busted.  Viewers are savvy and far more judicious, and I think they're taking a lot more ownership and the channels that they choose to support.  In some fairly profound ways, it's a part of how we shape our identities.  What you like is what you are like.  Who you like is who you are.  I'm not saying this is true across the board.  I'm just saying that these thought processes influence our behaviors frequently.  60% of the time, it works every time.  Big YouTubers with millions of followers frequently can't even hit 2,000 views in the first hour of their upload.  I keep seeing it and it's shocking.  Channels like, as told by Kenya, D'Angelo Wallace, Smokey Glow, to me, These are the faces of the micro-influencer renaissance, if you will.  This is the dawn of the age of parasocialism on YouTube.  And I think a lot of their success has to do with the fact that it's human nature to want to feel like you're part of a rebellion, that you're part of a movement.  to want to feel that we have a stake, some sense of collective ownership in our respective subreddits of YouTube.  Rather than having only those who have become YouTube rich and then those who haven't even qualified for monetization yet, we have this middle or working class of YouTube emerging where people, a lot of people, are doing well enough with 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 subscribers.  Because let's be clear, though those do sound like big numbers, and I would be grateful, to hit any of them, from a metric standpoint, they're middling.  And there even seem to be suites or clusters of these micro influencers where there's a ton of cross-pollination with their supporters.  If you're parasocial friends with this one creator, then the odds are high that you also parasocially love these other three creators.  And you can even run into some of the same people over and over again in the comments section under the videos on the various channels and kind of bond in your investment in this group of people.  Now, the algorithms see to this by suggesting certain channels and certain content to us.  They're even pretty transparent about it.  My recommendations say things like, Whitney Hedrick viewers also watch so-and-so.  Based on the truly blood-curdling amount of personal data that Google and YouTube have on us, it is not mere happenstance that they're so able to accurately create these channel bundles, and it's also why this cross-pollination of audiences is becoming more and more pervasive.  With that, I am going to stop there, and I've decided on the fly that I'm going to make this Tea Talk a two-parter.  I just have way too much more to get to, and I don't want this video to be an hour long, so let's call it for today, and we will pick things up with my remaining thoughts in a part two.  I'm parched, the sun is setting, all signs are pointing to, let's wrap this up.  That is going to do it for this part of this tea talk.  I will do my best to get part two shot, edited, and uploaded for you guys as soon as I can.  But until then, I will leave you with one bit of advice, and that is to never trust anyone with a Morphe code.  Bye-bye.  That's a nappy-headed hose there.  I'm going to take that down. ",
