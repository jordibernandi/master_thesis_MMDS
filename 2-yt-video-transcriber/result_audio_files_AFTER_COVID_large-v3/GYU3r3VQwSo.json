            "text": "It's.  Hello there, I'm Lloyd Evans and you're watching the John Cedars channel from the bunker and I'm in the middle of recording my rebuttals to the 2020 Always Rejoice Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.  If you've watched any of my rebuttals you will know there is an awful lot of material to cover but in the Saturday afternoon of this year's convention something came up.  It's a prime example of the blatant bigotry and homophobia that exists within the leadership of the Jehovah's Witness religion.  So what I'm about to show you is a clip from the Saturday afternoon of the convention together with the comments that I recorded for my rebuttal.  In other words, if you watch my rebuttal as well, you're going to see a repeat of the same material.  I just think it's important that this gets its own standalone video because not everyone has time to trawl through a rebuttal that's very likely to be many hours long.  And this is footage of Stephen Lett speaking in the final talk of the Saturday afternoon of the convention that I believe as many people as possible need to see.  So without further ado, here is the clip of Stephen Lett speaking and what will follow will be comments from my forthcoming rebuttal. ",

            "text": "There'll be many others who will come back who will have to abandon their former way of life.  I was thinking as an example, a homosexual.  Now this former homosexual comes back in the resurrection and he really thought And he was taught and he came to believe that God accepted him with that lifestyle.  But now he's going to learn about Jehovah's moral standards.  He's going to learn that Jehovah will not lower his standard to accommodate us.  We have to come up to Jehovah's standard.  Will he change?  Will he adjust?  It'll be up to him.  But you brothers and sisters will help such ones to enjoy life eternal.  All must learn to walk in Jehovah's righteous ways and willingly choose to do so.  But now, what if someone refuses to make the necessary changes?  Well, the Watchtower commented on that.  It said, after being given ample time, maybe even a hundred years, to seek God, some will show that they refuse to practice righteousness.  Justly, they will lose life in the new world, as we can see from Isaiah 65 verse 12, which says, And the sinner will be cursed, even though he is a hundred years of age.  But we expect this will be the minority, that the majority will be delighted to make the adjustments so they can live in that wonderful new world. ",

            "text": "He really had to go there, didn't he?  It's not enough for him to indulge his narcissistic fantasy of ruling over a post-apocalyptic paradise earth.  He's got to go for gay people.  As though it wasn't already a cringe-worthy display of how ridiculous the Jehovah's Witness vision of the future is, he has to make gay and lesbian people miserable.  This is the level of delusion we're dealing with, viewers, and it's why I struggle, I struggle to say that these men fully know what they're doing and are approaching this from a purely cynical perspective.  If he knew what was good for him, if it was all part of some big plan to just get people's money or get people's allegiance, he wouldn't have gone down this road.  Because he knows how this is going to play out, or at least he should know.  He should know that there are going to be many people in the audience, mainly young people, who on a daily basis at school rub shoulders with gay and lesbian classmates who are perfectly normal, not just young people, older witnesses who work alongside gay and lesbian people in the workplace, and can see for themselves as clear as day that it's not a lifestyle choice, it's how they were born, it's how they were made.  Despite it being terrible PR, Despite it turning people away, despite it almost inevitably causing some in this convention to finally realise that it's not worth following this fool, he still can't help himself.  He just has to show everyone what a monstrous bigot he is.  On the one hand, I watch this, viewers, and I think, well, at least he's putting his cards on the table.  At least he's showing people that he's entirely unworthy of their respect.  He's entirely unworthy of any kind of authority role.  Maybe it's a good thing that he included this bigotry because it's bound to help people wake up.  It sure as hell makes my job easier, let's face it, when it comes to showing people how toxic, how backward, how intolerant this leadership is.  But then I think, you know what, Lloyd?  You didn't grow up gay in this religion.  You had the easy road because you happened to be born straight.  So you never were subjected to this sort of vile hatred while sitting in the audience at a convention.  Imagine you're a young Jehovah's Witness watching this convention in your home with your parents at your side.  Maybe you've got... Mum on that side, your dad on that side, maybe your younger brother or sister on the sofa with you or sat on the carpet.  And in your own home, in your sanctuary, in the place that you flee to in hopes that you will be surrounded by love and acceptance.  you have this grotesque spectacle of a tiny, bigoted, backwards mind spewing hatred that invalidates your very being, that says, you know what?  You shouldn't really exist.  When people like you are resurrected onto Paradise Earth in the future, they will be given the ultimatum, convert or die.  And if they don't change who they are, if they don't force themselves to love differently than the only way they know how to love, we will slaughter them.  We will rid the earth.  of people like you.  Imagine you're watching that.  That's how it's going to be for probably thousands of LGBTQ children who are watching this convention, again, probably with their parents right next to them.  This sort of stuff, quite frankly, is a disgrace.  And like many things that have come out of this idiot's mouth, makes me ashamed to have ever been involved with this religion.  Anyway, I hope you found my reaction to this grotesque material helpful in some way.  Don't forget to subscribe to the John Cedars channel for more such material, and as always, thank you for watching. ",
