The one thing that you have in common with your two predecessors, both Attorney General Sessions and Attorney General Whitaker, is that when you all came here and brought your top staff, you brought no black people.  That, sir, is systematic racism.  That is exactly what John Lewis spent his life fighting.  And so I would just suggest that actions speak louder than words, and you really should keep the name of the Honorable John Lewis out of the Department of Justice's mouth.  Let me also say, you mentioned bogus Russiagate.  In your opinion, as the Attorney General of the United States of America, did Russia interfere or attempt to interfere in the 2016 election? ",
