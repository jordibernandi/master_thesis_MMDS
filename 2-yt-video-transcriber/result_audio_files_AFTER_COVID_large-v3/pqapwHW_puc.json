            "text": "Boris Johnson takes away powers from Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP are to launch a new second referendum campaign, and Rishi Sunak refuses to pay any more money to the Scottish Government.  Hello everyone and welcome to the second video of the day.  This is going to be quite interesting because Boris Johnson's government are finally standing up to Nicola Sturgeon's SNP government and their random weird demands to beg for more money and not really use their devolution powers properly and ruining people's lives in Scotland.  We're going to talk about how Boris Johnson is changing policy when it comes to devolution in this video.  But first let's talk about the priorities for Nicola Sturgeon because she really cares about Scotland and people in Scotland.  So we have the latest numbers when it comes to the jabs that people are receiving.  England, this is obviously now completely changed because we are receiving A lot of the three figures per minute.  So 279,000 jobs in England and only 16,000 in Scotland.  Now you might think of smaller population, but that's not really the case when it comes to the rate.  It's only because Nicola Sturgeon is currently too busy to focus on this.  She's busy because she's launching a new independence task force.  It's only been a few years since the last referendum, but Queen Nicola is not giving up.  She's still very much focused on this.  The problem that Nicola Sturton is facing, that's not a good photo by the way, is that the Scottish government are so concerned about the fact that we have left the European Union, the customs union and single market, and they want to have freedom of movement.  They really believe in open borders.  unless it's with England and, well, the rest of the United Kingdom.  Because in this video that I'm going to show you, you know, they actually admitted that, yes, we are going to have a border, a hard border, between Scotland and England. ",

            "text": "Scotland should be a member of the European Union.  If it is, your opponents say that that would mean there would be a serious and significant border between Scotland and England.  Well, my argument is there would be.  I mean, you've got to be honest about these matters, because if Scotland was in a customs union, i.e.  the EU and the rest of the UK was out of the customs union, by definition, there are going to be customs barriers at the border between Scotland and the rest of the UK.

            "text": "Well, this was always clear.  And again, this is just showing the double standards when it comes to the way they're treating the EU 27 countries and their so-called European family and their biggest market and the biggest partners, which is the rest of the UK.  So Scotland are willing, well, not Scotland, the SNP are willing to lose access to the biggest market and biggest partner, the UK, and to join the European Union.  That's already seen a decline.  I don't understand this.  If they are so pro-open borders, why are they going with a policy that will impose hard borders between the two sides?  Second issue is that they are sending MPs and ministers and all the weird politicos on TV, on the mainstream media, to talk about the jabs and new cases.  They're so proud to say that we have fewer cases than the UK.  I wonder why.  Maybe because you're not testing as many people as the rest of the UK are doing.  But of the four nations, our numbers, our case rate numbers, are the lowest.  In actual fact, if you look at the data in Scotland, you will see our rate is the lowest of the four nations.  Yeah, hi.  Sorry, I just wanted to say, is it not the case, though, that Scotland are testing fewer than half of patients per 100,000 in England?  So it's not really true to say that we're having better case rates of COVID than England because we're simply not testing as much people.  Yeah, well, that's the truth.  Firstly, that video was done, well, it was recorded by a Core Twitter account.  So if you're not following Core on Twitter, make sure to do it because they're very good at giving the latest updates on the SMP as well.  Why are they lying?  Why are they spinning?  You know it's going to come out.  You know it's going to be exposed.  These are simple things that you shouldn't really do and they just actually don't care.  Now, the SNP are losing some of their powers that were given to them by devolution, and so the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund is now to bypass the Scottish Government.  So, until now, the European Union Fund, this kind of structured funding sort of situation was going directly towards, given by, obviously, Westminster to the Scottish Government, and the European Union were taking all the credit.  And then after that, the Scottish government are taking credit.  Now the UK government are going to go directly funding it, and they're going to actually label with Union flags saying that this is coming from Westminster.  Obviously, the people in Scotland will benefit.  Scottish government will not, because Whitehall is now to bypass these devolved administrations and replace the European Structural Fund with a centrally controlled fund.  Now, in Scotland, that means that more than \u00a3100 million is set to be spent by the UK government on projects normally devolved to the Scottish Parliament.  The reason for this is because we have seen recently how incompetent the Scottish administration is when it comes to spending or not spending the money that they should be actually spreading around.  Because, you know, until now, the Scottish government was just setting out their own plans for replacing the EU fund.  But Stephen Barclay, who's now part of the UK Treasury, as the Secretary has removed some of the uncertainty about the way the Shared Prosperity Fund will operate.  Now, in the past seven years, \u00a3780 million has come through the Scottish Government by that route.  So this is going to completely change the way things have been working.  And the European Union, who have always been, some of them, including the Spanish government and Spanish politicians, have been against Scotland joining, are kicking off.  And, you know, Scotland, just like Scottish government, are losing powers left, right and centre.  They've lost that, you know, ability to actually waste money.  They're now losing the opportunity to rejoin the European Union because one of the Spanish MEPs, Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, has come out to say that, well, the way the Scottish finances are actually working, They're not even close to meeting the EU requirements in terms of rejoining Brussels and their clique of protectionist club.  So he's not really happy, and he's not the only one.  A number of people have come out to say this, but it's because according to actual official government figures in Scotland, the Scottish deficit is currently \u00a312.6 billion.  That's 7% of the GDP.  And so obviously this guy has come out to say it's obvious that the Scottish figures are not those that the European Union expects from countries that want to be members.  The figures are far from the European figures.  Very, very far.  It would be a problem.  How bad do you have to be economically that the European countries are rejecting you?  That's really embarrassing.  It's because they've been ruining Scotland with their finances and they don't even understand how they should be running their own affairs, let alone their own actual party.  They're all having issues with their own party, let alone Scottish people.  So the latest that we have from Sturgeon when it comes to the funding is that she has sent her ministers to beg Rishi Sunak and government to get even more money.  so extra 1.7 billion pounds more in funding.  and Rishi Sunak has you know shut down the demand because why?  you know we've been giving a lot of money already.  there is already a plan and Stephen Barclay has already outlined the plan to give you know it's going to come in the next year or so.  But they want extra, and they haven't even spent all the money that... I don't know where the money is going, because they haven't spent all the money that they've received already.  And everyone's really concerned now in Scotland, because we don't know where they're keeping the money.  What's the point of this funding and this begging?  So the SNP Shadow Chancellor at Westminster, Alison Twillis, and Scottish Finance Secretary, Kate Forbes, have now been shot down by Stephen Barclay.  after the pair wrote to Rishi Sunak to urge him to release more funding to Scotland.  So this letter begged Sunak to release \u00a321.3 billion of reserves to help tackle the impacts of the current situation.  Are you joking?  With everything that Westminster have been doing, and I'm not even a big defender of the Westminster clique, but when it comes to the financial support that they've been giving to the Scottish government, just like how they've been supporting the NHS, You can't really complain anymore, can you?  And Stephen Barclay has come out to actually say that we are providing support already including the furlough scheme in addition to the \u00a38.6 billion that's been guaranteed as a fund.  Together these schemes have supported more than 930,000 jobs in Scotland and will continue to support Scottish jobs throughout the winter.  The support is there.  You're just wasting the money.  I don't know what's going on with the Scottish government.  Because Stephen Barclay himself has now come out to say that you are actually ignoring the support, the financial support that the UK Treasury are giving.  They've been exposed.  Even the Scottish press are now coming out.  Even some of them who've been sympathetic towards the SNP agenda are coming out to say, this is slightly too far.  We don't know.  Well, we had no idea how incompetent the SNP government could have been.  This is according to the actual Scottish press.  I mean, the National has come out to criticise Nicola Sturgeon quite massively as well.  they need to actually be exposed even more because a lot of people across the uk don't really care much about what's happening in scotland which is a shame because we have to care about scotland wales and northern ireland.  it's not just about england.  everything's already centralized.  stop it let's care about others as well.  and and you know scotland you know the scottish nationalist party are so focused on rejoining the eu which is a difficult task as we said.  why are they so focused and This is the same European Union who are having massive clashes now with the EU member states of 27 countries.  They're all kicking off because the jabs are not being delivered properly.  They don't even know how to deliver a simple operation.  It's not simple, but it's simple enough in terms of if you had one country, to actually do it like the UK, like Israel, like many other countries, but they've centralised the whole project and it's all failing.  And as I said, we've had at least a third of the EU member states who have now lashed out against the European Union.  So this is the same EU that Nicola Sturgeon is so desperate to rejoin.  This is the same European Union who has ministers like this guy, the German foreign minister, who's come out to indicate that we should have privileges.  for people who have taken the jab.  You know what this means?  Because in this article, it actually says that people who have received the jab, they should get some privileges like going to restaurants, cinemas, theatres, museums, workout, exercise.  That's a different version of saying that those who haven't taken it yet aren't allowed to.  Even if the majority, because the biggest plans that governments have is they're not going to give the jab to every single person.  As long as the majority have received it, and especially the vulnerable and the elderly, everybody else should be free to live their lives.  But a German minister... Doesn't say that.  So if Scotland and, you know, Nicola Sturgeon really want to join, rejoin this authoritarian continent, feel free.  But it's not really good for the rest of the Scottish voters who don't really want to do that.  Not everyone in Scotland is pro-independence.  Don't forget, the SNP is not Scotland.
