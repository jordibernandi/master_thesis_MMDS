            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Thanks for joining me.  A quick video today because it's actually fixing to be Rosh Hashanah and the New Year's about to come in for the Hebrew folks and so I've got my kugel staring at me over there and it's like, please get me ready, please take me, please take me to be eaten by lots of other people and then I have the stuffed peppers over there.  Eventually, I'll show it to you guys.  What I wanted to talk about with you guys today is what I'm doing to get my game together before the election.  And something that you can be doing.  And it costs nothing, basically.  Cardio.  Cardio.  Oh, people don't want to hear that.  What, Patriot Nurse?  You mean I can't just sit on the couch and binge watch Netflix and be better prepared that way?  You mean video games don't cover it?  Nope.  Sorry.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  Y'all, if you are cleared with your doctor to do it, you need to be getting into good cardio shape.  Especially if you're in urban areas that are prone to rioting.  Because the last thing that I want, but what I'm realistically preparing for, is rioting in urban and even suburban areas.  And if that be the case, we need to be able to run the Mogadishu Mile.  What's she talking about, the Mogadishu Mile?  Watch the movie Black Hawk Down, or read the book.  Cardio is important because if you get into a situation where you're having to defend yourself, your family, your neighborhood, a la Kenosha, Cardio is king because you can bet that the creatures that are out at 0200, 0300, they're hopped up on a whole bunch of substances that make them not feel pain and make that heart rate go really, really fast.  And it can be pretty difficult to outrun somebody who's hopped up on a whole bunch of substances that make them semi-superhuman.  Even if their brain is the size of a pea, their body is going and going without fatigue.  And so considering the potential for breakdown in rule of law and really living a martial lifestyle, embracing the totality of the responsibilities of being an armed citizen in the republic in which we live, Got to have some cardio.  Got to have some cardio.  Strength training, of course, is a good move.  Eating well is a good move.  But if you've got to throw on plates and run with your rifle with three mags, you're going to be winded if you're not in good shape.  So consider that.  Consider that.  Another thing to consider is getting your medical game together because we're fixing to go into flu season.  And I released the four-hour online class at thepatriotnurseacademy.com, thepatriotnurseacademy.com.  So that way you guys can get your mind right and get in that problem-solving framework because it's not enough just to have medical kit, guys.  It's not.  I'd be lying to you to tell you that it is.  And I'm not going to lie to people.  I'm not going to be inauthentic.  No way.  You got to have your mind right and you got to have problem solving and a framework for addressing things in front of you.  It used to be that we taught people these basic skills, you know, the doctor mom.  And now it's everybody's so terrified of their own shadow that they call, you know, the doctor or they run to the ER for the least little thing.  Granted, there are certainly times to call doctors and go to ERs.  But my goal in... the class and making that class available for people was to get you guys trained up so that way you can increase your self-sufficiency and hopefully save you some money some time energy and effort not spending money wasted going and sitting in er's for hours upon end.  you know if it's something that you could have taken care of at home so definitely check that out.  if you haven't get yourself medically squared away guys got to get your mind right like The mind, the body, being disciplined about these things, that's part of being a well-rounded human being.  But we have a responsibility as free citizens here in the republic that is the United States, the constitutional republic.  And we need to be able... to take care of our neighborhoods at a moment's notice.  It's kind of what the Minutemen were, really.  Wars are not won by fat men.  Oh, everybody just got really offended.  It's true.  It's true.  Wars are not won by fat men.  And I'm not the one who said that.  I can't remember who said that.  But you might as well Google it.  Somebody Google it and put in the comments section where that came from.  But I mean, like if you're at an overwatch position and you're not moving, okay.  But typically you gotta be able to move.  And if you've got, I'm just saying this in love guys, not to be a jerk, okay.  I'm saying this because I'm hoping that eventually someone somewhere will watch this video and think, you know what?  I need to drop a few pounds.  I need to stop eating bad food.  I need to be more mobile and more physically active.  I need to go for a walk.  I need to go for a run.  I need to do something.  I need to PT.  I need to do something so that way I'm ready.  Guys, I would not be doing y'all a favor if I just sat here and blew smoke at you and said, oh, how awesome.  Let me stroke your ego.  Oh, here's some more ego.  Want some more ego?  There's plenty of channels that do that.  That ain't me.  I don't want to be a jerk, but at the same time, I wouldn't be doing you a favor if I said, hey, it's cool that you're 40 pounds overweight.  You're going to be fine.  You may, but guess who's going to win?  at 0300 with a whole bunch of people hopped up on crazy stuff in a crowd that suddenly decides they want to converge on your neighborhood.  Just saying.  Y'all, the cardio thing is important.  Medical stuff is important.  Dry practice is important.  You got five minutes in a week.  And just put it in YouTube.  Like the entire world is at your fingertips.  All you have to do is go dry practice.  Show me how to dry practice.  And you can see, like people will show you how to do it.  My personal dry practice routine consists of varying things, but especially coming from the holster, first round on target, one hand, meaning right hand only, left hand only, both hands, right hand only.  repeat, repeat, repeat, prep that trigger, and then you can just do trigger work.  Gotta be able to take care of yourself, guys.  And Americans want to buy proficiency, and that's absolute folly.  It is.  It is.  I'm not gonna, like, there are some people, again, I underscore this, I'm not gonna blow smoke at you, and I'm not gonna tell you things that are just gonna make you feel good, and like, oh, okay, and then you know, with the moment of truth comes, you're going to sit there and be like, gee, Patriot nurse said it was going to be okay.  But no, that's not what I'm saying.  You got to get your cardio together.  You got to get your medical game together and you need to do dry practice.  Dry practice is free.  As long as you've got a pistol or firearm that you're used to dealing with, like you can do dry practice for free.  It doesn't cost anything.  It's a good idea to go to the range, obviously, you know, once a month, something like that for some live fire, but you got five minutes a week.  You can do got to get yourself squared away.  Should you need it?  God forbid.  But should you need to defend yourself, what would you give in that moment to have five reps before you left the house?  I know, heavy stuff.  But yeah, Rosh Hashanah is coming.  I got to get going here.  My kugel is saying, cover me up and take me.  Just like that too.  If you could hear it, like you put like a little stethoscope up to the kugel and say, take me up, take me up, go, go.  Hope that was helpful for you guys.  Just a quick video today.  If you did enjoy the video, I hope you'll subscribe to me here on YouTube.  You can also support me on Patreon, Subscribestar, Cryptocurrency, and PayPal.  I got links down there in the description box below.  So just a quick bit on Rosh Hashanah, guys.  So we got the new year coming around.  What is it?  5781 coming up in the Hebrew calendar.  A new year full of possibilities and also an opportunity for us to shed light Toxicity from the last year to shed the negative things from last year.  even in trials even in things that are bitter We learn still.  so the duty that we have to ourselves to live an authentic life is to look back at this past year and Where we've come from the hardships that we've endured and the lessons that we've learned and in those lessons We take the honey out of it.  That's why, see, we eat honey and apples on Rosh Hashanah.  And I had a dear friend who sent me a little, a meme, and it was to the effect on honey.  Why do we eat honey?  Honey itself comes from the bee.  And the bee has a stinger.  And getting stung by bees hurts.  It does not feel good.  But the same thing that stings can also create something so sweet.  And so for us, looking forward to this year and taking stock of the past, we can look at the things that have inflicted pain.  We can look at the things that have hurt us.  And rather than reside in the negativity, we can utilize that to become something sweet in our lives, a lessons learned, so that that way our future is a brighter one.  I hope it was helpful for y'all.  Shana Tova, y'all.  Shana Tova.  And have a wonderful new year.  Have a wonderful weekend.  For now, it's Patriot Nurse signing off.  I'll see y'all later.  Bye. ",
