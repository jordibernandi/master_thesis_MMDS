            "text": "Hi, I'm Ophelia Jacobson with Campus Reform.  We've seen so many talks about race and racism in recent weeks, and we're here today at the University of Florida to talk with students about one example they may not know about, Planned Parenthood.  How will students react when they find out about Planned Parenthood's racist founder?  Let's find out.  So over the last few weeks in this country, we've seen a movement to remove racist historical figures, institutions, and statues.  Do you agree with this movement?  Should we be doing that?  Yeah, I completely agree with removing Confederate statues and any racist landmarks if they have a negative history.  America has like a really toxic past and we shouldn't be like memorializing that.  I think it's good.  I think as country we need to progress past like idolizing racist figures.  okay so i want to give you a quote that was said by the founder of a really prominent institution in this country.  i'm going to read you a quote and get your reaction.  okay we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population.  this individual also once spoke at a kkk meeting.  how do you feel about this quote?  um i think there's no question how i should feel about the quote.  I think that's bad.  That's just so obviously wrong.  I think that he shouldn't be a founder of any institution.  I can't believe someone said that.  He should be held accountable or she should be held accountable for what they said.  Stop being racist.  To exterminate any human being is not okay.  He should probably be exposed for that.  It's racist.  The worst part is there's several people who are currently in power that I can guess made that quote.  Who do you think made that quote?  Of course, my first thought goes to Trump.  Why do you think Trump is racist?  If literally anyone looks up anything about Trump and thinks that he said, I think it's a safe conclusion to draw.  Do you have any direct quotes about that?  Like any direct quotes that he said?  I don't know any quotes off the top of my head, honestly.  So what about the organization?  What should be done with the organization?  Um, I think there should be like maybe an investigation.  I don't think that the entire organization, everyone associated with it can be in a sense canceled, but I definitely think that there should be actions taken to mitigate the way that their founder has acted.  Should we even be funding this organization if that's what the founder said?  And they should definitely look into what the organization is promoting and whatnot.  Them excusing something like that would be racist.  People as individuals need to really decide for themselves if they want to support it or not.  But I know I definitely wouldn't if the f***ing leader said that.  So what if I were to tell you that this quote was actually said by Margaret Sanger, who is the founder of Planned Parenthood?  Dang.  All right.  Did you know about that?  No, I did not.  But yeah, they should do something about that.  It makes me feel nauseous.  I'm actually surprised.  Well, I mean, Planned Parenthood is usually a very liberal and inclusive organization.  I kind of actually knew that Planned Parenthood was founded in a selective breeding kind of thing.  There's definitely problems within that, because I know black babies are aborted at a way higher rate than white babies.  If I were a supporter or not a supporter, what she said wouldn't really change it.  I'm sure that there's many people under that founder that care about black lives.  I agree with what Planned Parenthood is doing, but I definitely don't think someone like that should be a leader.  Well, I actually do stand with Planned Parenthood.  The abortion rate for Black women is five times higher than white women.  Can an organization that says they support Black Lives Matter really say that if, you know, their founder, she said that their goal is to exterminate the Negro population?  I'm actually going to cut you off right now.  I want this interview done.  It shouldn't really matter, like, who has abortions more.  I think abortions should be available to everyone.  Someone else should step up to the plate.  who's more accepting and who resembles what Planned Parenthood says they stand for, which is lives.  When you say that Planned Parenthood stands for lives, what do you mean by that?  Like, they help women make their own decisions.  I've had a good experience with them, and they like to help others.  As long as the organization itself isn't being racist, then we can't really go after the organization itself for it.  I still definitely support Planned Parenthood.  I do think Planned Parenthood is important and needs to continue on.  Hey there, my name is Hannah Catherine Smith and I'm with Campus Reform.
