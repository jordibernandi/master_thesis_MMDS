So I just think advertisers would have a hard time putting their ads on a show, which is basically about destroying people's lives.  How much money are you willing to play to wreck your family, to wreck your marriage, to wreck your friendships?  You know, and I just think like this overvaluing of money in our society, willing to sell anything or our loved ones or our kids for cash.  It just it's not a good thing to just put out there.  But at the same time, it also reflects what people are willing to do for cash.  And it's always sad, bro.  I would never be caught dead doing any real talk, especially not for money. ",

What did you think about the video that you just saw?  Would you go on the show?  What did you think about everything you saw?  Did she really love him?  What was she there for?  Was it disrespect?  Or was it too much?  I don't know.  That was really intense though. ",
