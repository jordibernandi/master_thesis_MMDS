But we find that this sin that really became the foundation of Lucifer's downfall is exactly the same technique he used with Adam and Eve.  In chapter 3, he says to Eve, in the day you eat of this forbidden fruit, your eyes will be opened and what?  You will be like God.  Now, as crazy as that is, Adam and Eve, who walk with the voice of God in the garden of the cool of the day, understood, must have understood, that God was so much more than they were, and yet there's this pervert desire within us to want to ",

His most powerful weapon is the thoughts, the ideas he puts into your brain.  I think that it was probably expressed best by A.W.  Tozer many years when he wrote in one of his books, he says, people think of the world not as a battleground, but as a playground.  He says, we are not here to fight, we're here to frolic.  The worship growing out of such a view itself has become a sort of sanctified nightclub without champagne.  You can see how dated it is because a lot of churches now actually include the champagne.  So it's not such a crazy thing, but it realizes that people see their life primarily through the lens of the moment they're in without any greater long-term view, especially eternal view. ",

I thought, Lord, why did you send me to this horrible place?  He said, because many people do not believe hell exists.  He said, even some of my own people do not believe hell is real.  Now, that statement surprised me because I thought all Christians believe in hell.  But I found out since many Christians don't believe in hell.  They say, Bill, God's a loving God.  There's nobody in hell suffering.  They believe in annihilationism, which I explained to you, or universalism, which is a false teaching that's going around saying that everybody gets saved.  Or soul sleep, that you just fall asleep.  That's not true.  Hell is real.  It's permanent.  It's eternal.  And God doesn't want one person to go there.  That's why he died on the cross was to keep us out.  I thought, Lord, why did those demons hate me so much?  He said, because you're made in my image and they hate me.  See, John 15, 18, Jesus said they hated me before they hated you.  That's why Jesus said in John 10, 10, the thief comes to kill, steal, and destroy.  But he said, I have come that you might have life and have it more abundantly.  You see, so the evil we see in life, the destruction comes from the demonic realm.  Not from God.  We serve a good and a loving God.  He came to give us life.  So when you see sickness and disease and poverty and all that, that all comes from the demonic realm.  That's not from God.  People falsely accuse God, blame Him for all kinds of things.  They get angry with God when they see someone get sick and die.  They think it's God's fault.  No, that was the devil's fault.  He's the one that caused the sickness, not God.  But you still might not be convinced.  You might be like a radio talk show host that I was on with across America.  A lot of people are still not convinced with the good.  They still have trouble with thinking, man, I'm a good person.  How can God let me suffer in hell or let someone that is a good person takes care of their family?  Well, let me explain something.  Besides you not being good enough, none of us are, this analogy might help you.  I was on this radio show and he says, don't you quote me one Bible verse over my airwaves, Christian.  You got that?  No Bible verses.  I said, okay, no problem.  He said, I submit to you that your God is unreasonable because he doesn't consider my viewpoint.  I'm a good person.  And my viewpoint is just as valid as yours.  And if your God doesn't let me into heaven, he's actually guilty of a hate crime.  And your God should be arrested and thrown in jail.  That's what I think of your God.  So what do you got to say for yourself, Christian?  What do you say?  You're alive.  And God gave me an analogy.  Thank God.  I said, okay, you think you need to be a good person.  Let me explain.  I said, say you went and found the most expensive home in the country and you knocked on their door.  And you said, excuse me, I'm moving in with you because I'm a good person.  What do you think the people would say?  No, right?  They don't know you.  You have no relationship with them.  Well, the same way, I said, you go through your whole life.  You have nothing to do with God.  You deny Jesus is the son of God, which he said is the only way to his house.  Then at the end of your life, you come and knock on his door, demand to live there because you're a good person.  What does good have to do with it?  You don't know him.  You have no relationship with him.  You might say, Bill, come on, I'm a good person.  I'm not going to go to this horrible place.  How can a loving God let a good person go to hell?  But let me explain something.  You might be pretty good compared to people.  But if you're going to go by that standard, you want God to judge you whether you were good enough, then he'll go by that standard.  But see, his standard is different than yours and mine.  His standard is perfect.  See, James 2.10 says, if we offend his law in one point, we're guilty of all.  If we lie once, Revelation 21.8 says that all liars shall have their part in the lake of fire.  If we steal one thing, 1 Corinthians 6.9 says, no thief will inherit heaven.  If we have one lustful thought, Jesus said in Matthew 5, that's the same as committing adultery.  No adulterer will inherit heaven.  One lustful thought, just one.  And Proverbs 24.9 says, even the thought of foolishness is a sin.  If we have one foolish thought our whole life, that would exclude us from heaven.  That's a pretty high standard, isn't it?  So none of us can stand before a holy God and say, hey, I'm pretty good, let me in.  He's gonna say, no, not.  according to my standard, you're not good.  Matter of fact, Job 15, 16 says, man is so filthy, he drinks iniquity like water.  So in God's sight, we are filthy rags.  Thank God.  it's not based on being good.  Because not one of us would be there.  It's based on a relationship with Jesus Christ.  But see, our sin is punishable by death, right?  We sin.  We all sin in life.  That deserves punishment.  And the Bible says it's deserving of death.  But Jesus paid that price for us on the cross.  He died in our place.  So we wouldn't have to take the punishment.  He would save them weeping.  But because He loves man, He gives us that free will to choose.  He doesn't force you into anything.  Do you believe his word or don't you?  It's up to you.  So my question for you is, do you know if your name is written in his book?  You have to be certain of this one, people.  Please don't make a mistake with this.  Because your soul is eternal, whether you believe it or not, you will spend your eternity in one place or the other.  And you're going to hear next week about heaven.  You'd much rather spend it there than hell. ",
