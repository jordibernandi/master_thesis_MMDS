            "text": "So I think it goes without saying that I'm not an epidemiologist and I don't play one on YouTube.  I'm still trying to figure out what the appropriate response to COVID-19 is outside the obvious measures such as social distancing and washing your hands.  I say obvious, but clearly that isn't obvious to some.  Yes, let's hoard toilet paper by climbing over and fighting with other people while doing it.  That makes total sense.  Over the last three to four weeks, I've had an almost out-of-body experience.  A friend of mine and I have been tracking this virus and have been stunned at the complacency of average Australians.  Three weeks ago, I sounded like an alarmist.  A week ago, perhaps overly concerned.  And now as the situation sinks in for the vast majority of the population, I'm starting to look like a bit of an optimist.  This was Bondi Beach on Friday, March 20th.  This was Bondi Beach on Saturday afternoon, just two days later.  People were still being told to get off the beach on Sunday morning.  I feel very uncomfortable with the government shutting down public places, but when preventative measures like social distancing are being ignored by large swaths of the population, I'm not surprised that the government stepped in.  I took this footage on Sunday, March 22nd in Koolangatta, just after midday.  Remember, this is not peak season.  It's not school holidays yet and too early for Easter holiday makers.  No signs of social distancing at this cafe.  And now we've all seen the scenes from Monday, March 23rd, with people lining up outside Centrelink to apply for government handouts because they lost their jobs.  i drove past a line like this in palm beach on monday and had to do a double take.  there were scenes like this all across australia.  outside centrelink offices in supermarkets they've lined the floors telling you where to stand.  plexiglass has been installed in some woolworth store.  checkouts between the cashier and customer expect to see more of that now.  of course people are pointing fingers at the government for not acting fast enough or for not doing enough sending mixed signals and some of that criticism is no doubt warranted.  contrast the almost blase concern of the prime minister a couple of weeks ago to the way he's speaking today.  all that said i'm not that critical of the government either state or federal because i don't expect much from them to begin with.  why should this be any different?  And there's no playbook here, although there probably should have been.  Contrary to what you've heard, this is not a black swan event.  A global pandemic is one of the most predictable events possible.  Sure, we don't know when or where they'll pop up, but we knew for a certainty it would happen, and we're learning that governments around the world are woefully unprepared.  Governments at all levels have and will continue to make mistakes.  Here in Australia, states have now closed their borders to non-essential travel for the first time since World War I. This is the part I'm still trying to work out for myself.  To what extent should we close down the economy to deal with the virus?  Because skyrocketing unemployment has its own consequences, as Joe Hildebrand pointed out in an article last Sunday.  Shutting down economies also has fatal consequences because poverty, joblessness and homelessness can also be extremely deadly.  A study published by the International Journal of Epidemiology found there was a major spike in suicides among people left jobless during the GFC of 2007-2009.  People in crisis don't need a virus to kill them.  They will do the job themselves.  I don't have an answer to what extent we should be shutting down.  My first impulse is to invoke the precautionary principle, endure some short-term pain to minimize long-term damage.  But as we are shutting down non-essential services and unemployment skyrockets, we should be thinking about how we exit, how we identify people who've had the virus, been through it, and rid of any sign of the antibody so they can, if practical, get back to work.  But first, let's examine what you can do as an individual without government mandate.  If you're still waking from your coma of ignorance and wondering what all this social distancing stuff is all about, it's fairly simple, really.  It's not designed to completely stop the virus, but to slow it down so that the health care system can cope.  In fact, it's a quasi herd immunity strategy.  You accept that infections will continue to grow.  and that there will be many deaths until the epidemic has run its course but limit the impact on the health care system.  this chart from johns hopkins illustrates the idea of flattening the curb nicely without protective measures.  huge numbers of people swarming hospitals at the same time can overwhelm the system.  here is an animated illustration of what social distancing can achieve.  on the left each person has frequent direct contact with others.  within a very short time everyone is infected and hospitals are quickly overburdened.  the black line in the graph represents hospital capacity.  On the right, only 25 out of 200 people move freely.  All others self-isolate at home.  It takes much longer for everyone to get infected.  Hospitals can treat all patients because they don't arrive all at once.  Here's an example about what can happen if you don't practice social distancing.  24 people contracted the coronavirus from a 50th birthday party held at Noosa restaurant on March 14th.  It's believed they contracted it from one person who had just recently returned home from overseas.  The party had about 90 guests, so about one in four picked it up, including four of the restaurant staff.  Look, we've been building a society designed around the idea that you don't have to leave your couch for anything.  You're not being asked to charge the beaches at Normandy here.  Stay home if you feel sick, isolate, limit your interactions with others, work from home if you can.  I know it's not that easy for everyone.  I run a small business that services other small businesses, most of them related to the tourism industry, which is basically shut down.  So I'm feeling the effect.  However, if getting this under control means sacrificing my business for a few months, then so be it.  I will survive.  We aren't China.  We're not going to weld people into their apartments.  And we don't have the same level of social cohesion that they do in, say, South Korea.  but we can get this under control and flatten the curve if everyone commits to taking the necessary precautions if we do it in a half-arsed fashion it will prolong the downturn and compound those consequences of prolonged unemployment and loss of income outlined in hildebrand's article.  Now, as I said before, I'm starting to look like an optimist.  I should clarify that by saying I'm cautiously optimistic that we will avoid worst case scenarios and may even exceed some of the best case scenarios.  I'm not optimistic that some people won't continue to carry on like pork chops, but the more I look at the data, I think we can start to walk back some of the most dire predictions.  But I admit the data is mixed and in a lot of countries, trends just aren't clear because we don't have enough data yet and not enough tests have been done.  but let's start with looking at global trends.  this at first blush looks alarming.  the fatality rate continues to go up currently sitting at 4.6 percent.  that is 4.6 percent of confirmed cases have resulted in death.  italy and spain combined account for more than half of all fatalities currently 52% as of March 27th.  If you eliminate Italy, the fatality rate falls from 4.6% to 3.1%.  If you take out Italy and Spain, the fatality rate falls to 2.2%.  So a few outliers can skew the global picture.  I suspect the actual fatality rate when we look back many months from now will be much lower than 4.6% and probably less than the much-touted 2% figure.  Why?  Because the number of confirmed cases is lagging actual cases.  To be confirmed, you have to be tested, and not everyone that has it has been tested.  And some, especially the young, can have COVID-19 and show no symptoms at all.  According to the data from South Korea, currently one of our best sources of data, 99% of active cases in the general population are mild and do not require specific medical treatment.  The United States has now surpassed every other country and being the country with the most confirmed cases with more than 100,000 as of March 27th.  And the death rate in the United States is 1.6%.  And we should note that more than half of all cases in the U.S.  are in the New York metro area and over 60% of new cases are originating in that area.  Now here's a little math for you.  The daily growth rate of confirmed cases for March 27th was 21%.  If the U.S.  were to cut that to just 10% a day from here on out, you will have a million confirmed cases in the U.S.  by April 21st.  And at a fatality rate of 1.6%, that's roughly 16,000 dead.  Please note, that's not a forecast.  That's just how it works out.  How many Americans will get infected and what will be the overall fatality rate?  I have no idea.  Sam Harris interviewed Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.  He thinks the fatality rate will be closer to 0.6%.  So if, say, 100 million Americans are infected, that would mean 600,000 will die.  The flu season of 2017-18, the worst in recent years in the US, saw 61,000 deaths.  Now, be wary of forecasts.  The problem here is that we don't have much data.  For most countries, less than two months' worth and confirmed case rates and fatality rates will not move in a linear fashion.  You can't just extrapolate current trends into the future.  It doesn't take account of the ramp up in testing constraints on health systems and it will not catch a second wave of outbreaks if restrictions on movement are lifted early.  as a side note president trump's hoping for a restart immediately after easter is liable to kick off such a second wave even if the curve has flattened by then.  but if you're looking to trump for guidance given how slow he was to recognize the threat to begin with then you need to broaden your information sources.  Unfortunately, you can't trust much of the media either.  This is an article from 2009 regarding swine flu in the UK.  At that time, the worst case scenario was 65,000 deaths and a minimum of 3,100.  What was the actual end result?  392 deaths, 87% less than the minimum estimate.  Again, don't miss the point here.  I'm not saying swine flu is the same as COVID-19 or that the forecast will turn out to be the same.  It's that you should largely ignore forecasts.  The Imperial College of London came out with a paper modelling predictions of the potential number of infections and deaths in the UK as a result of COVID-19.  the worst case scenario was more than half a million would die.  that was assuming nothing was done and brits went about their normal lives.  of course that was never going to happen so i'm not suggesting that that was their base case prediction but here is a direct quote from the paper.  Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over.  In the most effective mitigation strategy examined, which leads to a single relatively short epidemic, The surge limits for both general ward and ICU beds would be exceeded by at least eightfold under the more optimistic scenario for critical care requirements that we examine.  In addition, if all patients were able to be treated, we predict there would still be in the order of 250,000 deaths in Great Britain and 1.1 to 1.2 million in the  U.S.,  Now in Table 4 in the paper they laid out their worst case to best case scenarios.  The best case, which included measures such as case isolation, home quarantine, university closures and social distancing, the number of deaths would be 48,000 in the UK.  Now, on Wednesday, March 24th, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College and one of the authors of the paper gave evidence to Parliament in which he said that the coronavirus death toll is unlikely to exceed 20,000 and could be much lower if lockdown measures continue.  He added that he is reasonably confident that Britain's health system can handle the burden of treating coronavirus patients.  There will be some areas that are extremely stressed, but we are reasonably confident, which is all we can be at the current time, that at the national level, we will be within capacity.  So how do you get that kind of a turnaround in the space of a week?  Well, because the initial model didn't take into account the lockdown continuing in the UK.  So again, beware of models and beware of forecasts.  And if you want to read more about the folly of models and forecasts, I urge you to read some.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as he said in a tweet about Ferguson's model.  lesson from a long experience with model blow-ups if you need a model with thousands of lines this is not a model usable for real-world risks and decisions rather something with the fragility of a house built with matches to impress some tenure committee.  our fat tales paper should limit these models for entertainment only.  Now, I said before that given Trump's lethargic response to COVID-19, you should broaden your information sources.  But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater because the Trump administration is putting forth some impressive people to give briefings.  Here is Dr.  Birx dispelling some more hysteria whipped up by the media. ",

            "text": "right now.  And that goes doubly for economic forecasts.  I've seen estimates of unemployment in Australia rising to anywhere from 7% to 20%.  I saw a 30% number for the US.  I've seen estimates that house prices could fall 10% to 50% in Australia.  Here's a chart of Thursday's initial unemployment claims in the context of the previous 50 years of data.  Initial claims during the peak of the GFC topped out at just under a million.  Thursday's number was 3.3 million, making the GFC look like a blip on the radar.  Tell me how you model that.  I can guarantee you not one economist anywhere on the face of the earth had previously modelled it, nor do they know how to fit this in their forecasts going forward.  Now, I've barely scratched the surface here.  There are so many aspects to this pandemic that could be videos in their own right.  Should we close schools?  Most of the evidence I've seen suggests it's a good idea.  The Australian Prime Minister says the advice he's received is that it isn't necessary.  In New South Wales, parents were given a choice and about 90% have withdrawn their kids from school.  Are masks of any use?  The short answer is absolutely yes.  It would be good if we could foster a culture of normalcy around mask wearing, as they have in many Asian countries.  To what extent should we bail out business?  Who should get handouts?  Should airlines that spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks get one?  All good questions.  Unfortunately, a lot of mistakes will be made and money wasted in the heat of the moment.  But for now, my advice for what it's worth, not very much I expect, is invoke the precautionary principle.  Stay home, wash your hands, distance yourself, and try not to consume too much doom and gloom porn.  Be skeptical of forecasts, both optimistic and pessimistic.  The sun will come up tomorrow, and the vast majority of us will be around to enjoy it.  As usual, let me know your thoughts in the comments below.  I'll see you next time. ",
