It looks like it's dark energy, but within 15 seconds, they disconnected me.  So I went on my Facebook and I did a live video on there.  So that's what you're getting ready to see right now.  I don't know what's up with that.  I guess they don't want it seen, but we're going to make sure it gets seen again. ",

            "text": "I was trying to do another live video for YouTube and within the first time this thing fall down, they disconnected me within 15 seconds and then they took my audio away.  I could not even do one.  I just wanted to get this on here again really close up.  I have a yellow filter on my iPhone and I've slowed this down to where all we can see is this repeatedly falling from there.  You can see the probes that are in there.  See them?  I want you to save this video if you can.  Yeah, this has got two probes in the sun.  This is the same video that I shared from last night.  that has around 46,000 views already.  But I wanted to see if I could get it even more close up.  They call it a sun serpent.  They said these have been around for a long time.  And that they're on the ancient pyramids.  That's what someone on the YouTube said, sun serpents.  But I can't get this on my YouTube.  They won't let me do another live without disconnecting me.  And I don't even know if my live stream ended.  They won't let me in my live stream.  And the people on the YouTube are wondering, what are they not wanting us to see?  That's what they're saying.  What are they not wanting us to see?  But you can see, this does feel to me, I'm going to tell you right now, I've told you, if ever I feel something within my spirit, I will tell you, this feels to me like it's dark energy.  That's what it feels like to me.  And I just wanted to give you all a better view.  I can't do the OBS on my laptop, but I can put a filter on to show you all.  It's somewhat better.  You can see it.  I want to see if you can see the movement in its belly.  It's a forked dark energy.  So it is, if you haven't seen the video below, it was a longer video that I first did last night, but they won't let me put a live video like this on the YouTube.  I've tried so many times and they just won't let me do it.  Yeah, so I'm going to end this video, but I just wanted to get this one part right here for better detail.  you all.  We need as much information as possible because it really does look like dark energy and I don't think it's just plain old plasma.  I really don't.  Yeah.  It's the way that it's got its feelers into the sun.  And the way it goes down, it goes down with a thump.  You see it.  So yeah, this is just a shorter version.  And I'm going to, YouTube is, yeah, they blocking my videos.  That's okay.  It's all right. ",
