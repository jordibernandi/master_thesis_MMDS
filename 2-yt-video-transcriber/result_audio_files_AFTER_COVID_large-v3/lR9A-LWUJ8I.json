Get John Haynes, Dark Succubus in paperback or pre-order on Kindle Unlimited today.  Because it is scarcity.  If you grow up as a white girl and you get attention from black guys, in my experience and all the other white girls that I know, we don't think that getting attention from black guys gives you a status of some sort.  If you get attention from the white guys, you do have the status more than if you get attention from black guys.  As a man, I'm going to have to respectfully disagree.  Well, as a woman who gets attention and who grew up in a white culture more than a black culture, I'm going to tell you that getting attention from black guys is not a badge of honor if you're white.  Okay.  And I'm white.  You are white.  Yes.  I had been sent a link to a video of a black man who was sitting in a car talking to a white woman, and the white woman then told this black man that white women just aren't interested in black men.  And this black male got very upset and wanted to disagree with the white woman, the truths regarding interracial relationships.  Now, when I took that critical examination of that video, it showed me how deeply in denial some of these what they call bed-buck black males are regarding interracial relationships.  Now, these guys believe that white women are really interested in them, but what they don't understand is that many white women out here, they are only curious about black men and they want to find out as related to the fetishes that were presented about black men from Jim Crow and the antebellum South to find out if they are true one and two.  they also want to get involved with black men to be able to get their card to say that they are not racist.  So in their youthful years, before they get serious with a white man, they may play with a black man here or there, but you'll have the black male who will sit there and think that this woman is actually investing emotions in him and is serious about committing to a relationship with him.  However, this woman is not really interested in any sort of serious relationship.  Oftentimes, this is just a fling for her, and once the fling is over, then she just goes on to move to another area and then get involved with the white men in those areas.  now these black males think that again that they have something to offer the white woman.  but the white woman in her eyes as she was talking about in the video was talking about social status and social status is very important for the hypergamous white female because social status is something that allows her to be elevated to a higher position in society and your black man is at the bottom of the social world no matter how much money he has.  in her eyes he is at the bottom of the world socially and that's why she has no real interest in your black man.  so your white woman.  in many cases she wants to be elevated to that high position in society so she wants relationships with white men and she wants relationships with the most popular and socially acceptable white men so she can be elevated by being involved with that white man.  Unfortunately, this went over the head of that black male who showed how spellbound he was by the idea of white women and was so caught up in his feelings about white women that he could not deal with the facts that this white female was presenting directly to him.  Now, this white female was not being a racist.  when she presented those facts to him.  she was merely presenting the truths regarding female nature and she was presenting the truths regarding hypergamy and this guy he was so caught up in his delusions regarding white women and the status of white women in He started to deny the truth, not understanding that the white woman was being very honest with him, being frank with him, and he could not accept that truth because he wanted to buy into the delusion that he had, and he wanted to go out here and try to elevate himself.  by getting involved with the white woman.  because some of these black males they believe that by getting involved with the white female they can elevate their social status and they believe that if they have Becky on their arm it will give them a higher social marketplace value.  Unfortunately that's not how it works in a gynocentric society.  In a gynocentric society usually it's the male who elevates the female.  if a male is looking for elevation from a female it usually makes him appear to be weak and it makes him appear to be a joke.  so this guy didn't understand.  he was actually making himself look weak by disagreeing with this white woman who was again presenting him with the truth as related to relationships.  most white women want relationships with white men and they want those relationships with high status white men so that they can be at the top of the social pecking order.  and this was again something that flew over the head of this black man because he wanted to get white sexual access and he thought that white sexual access would be available for him.  But that's only if these white women want to go out here and participate in that sexual fetish.  that allows them to see if these myths perpetrated ever since the days of Jim Crow and the antebellum South are actually true regarding black men and sexual prowess and to possibly get the I'm not racist card by having that fling with the black man.  So they're not really... interested in a serious committed relationship with a black man.  and this upset this black man to hear.  but this was the truth and this truth was something meant to help the black man.  unfortunately he was in such denial about interracial relationships that he could not see those truths regarding interracial relationships.  so when I look at this situation it again shows me how deep in denial some of these black males are as related to interracial relationships.  they still believe in a rainbow but they're white females that they want to chase are not buying into the rainbow.  they are buying into the concept of wanting to pursue men of their own race and the white females who they chase after in many cases.  Many of these white females that they can go out here and get, it doesn't matter how attractive they are, usually they are either, one, interested in the fetish and finding out things about the fetish related to black men, or two, they are at the bottom of the social pecking order and they are now looking for a black man be able to take care of them.  now that they have exhausted all of their options because usually it is after Brad Jose Hassan and lin wu have had their way with the white woman then she comes to the black man.  so the black man in his mind he's thinking that either he's a secret choice or a first choice for your white woman but in many cases he's the last choice.  and this is the thing that burnt that dude up as related to video he was in and it was the thing he disagreed with and he could disagree with it all he wants.  but this is the fact about interracial relationships.  this is the fact about interracial dating.  white women are want to be elevated to that high position in white supremacist America that they enjoy and they don't see themselves being elevated by being with the man who has been placed at the bottom of the world and they're not interested in being elevated by that man they see at the bottom of the world.  so they see the black man as the last choice.  they never see him as the first choice.  And that's a hard pill for some of these black males out here to swallow, especially these bed buck black males who are caught up in their sexual prowess and the size of their penis.  These guys think that this is the norm.  this is not the norm as related to relationships.  again your white woman.  she was open frank and candid and presented the truth because she wanted a white man and she wanted a relationship with a white man because that's going to be more socially acceptable to her and that's gonna be something that allows her to climb the social ladder in white society and that's gonna allow her to further be elevated by other people in society.  so she lives by a soul set of social standards and while some would say oh these may possibly be racist but this is just her personal preference because again white women are about their social status they are about social currency and that's what gives them the ideas as related to who they value as relation for a relationship partner for a mate or a husband and that's what they're looking for overall.  but the black man again is some cases is in denial.  he is bought into many of these false myths regarding black white women and he thinks that she's forbidden fruit but she's not forbidden fruit.  she's not interested in him like that.  she is interested in finding a partner with high economic resources and she's interested in finding a man with high social status in a white society.  that's what she's primarily looking for.  and the woman in the video was merely presenting truths regarding white women and this is something again.  Some black men have a hard time swallowing, but you have to take that truth, you have to take it no matter how painful it is, and you have to accept it for what it is.  White women are not into black men like that.  and white women are interested in things that only white men can give white women in many cases like their social status and possibly a family that allows them to continue promoting their ideas and their culture to the next generation and these are things that black men cannot offer a white woman and again black men in many cases who are thinking about chasing white women.  these are guys who really need to understand the truth about interracial dating and they need to understand that interracial dating means something different for a white woman than it does for a black man.
