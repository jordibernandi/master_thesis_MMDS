            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  In this video, I will be talking about the life of Hugh Geffner and some of the most sick things that he's done and got away with.  Why?  Now you all know I like to give a brief intro before I go in deep, but I will not be doing that for this video.  It will be very brief.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is Truth Show and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  I mean, this is Truth Show.  Oh, yes.  Hugh Marston Hefner was born on April 9th, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois to Glenn Lucius Hefner, who was an accountant.  and to Grace Caroline, who worked as a teacher.  He had one other sibling, a younger brother.  He's mixed with Swedish, German, not surprised, and English.  He grew up conservative, Midwestern, Methodist, women along here.  He started off as a copywriter in 1952.  Upon being hired, he later asked for a $5 raise and got denied.  Now here's how tricky and privileged he was, if you know what I mean.  He managed to take out a loan for $600 and then managed to raise $8,000 from investors, of course, one of them being his mother.  Now, initially, the whole house, I mean the Playboy house, I mean magazine, was going to be called Stag Party.  By 1953, he managed to feature nude Marilyn Monroe on the cover.  But get this, Horny Shady Hef published Monroe pictures without her consent, and she was never compensated.  Well, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and get this, the pictures, she never personally posed for pictures for Hefner.  Oh, and another thing, he never even freaking met Marilyn Monroe.  But the sick, obsessed, horny man must have been so in love with her, he actually bought a crypt next to hers at Westwood Village Memorial Cemetery for $75,000.  Oh, yes.  Hence his playboy buddy mates, who they all look like.  Yes.  I mean, this horny-ass man decided to broaden his horny horizons.  He decided to host TV show that he called Playboy Penthouse, and another one was called Playboy After Dark, whereas he was also the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, of Playboy Enterprises, the publishing group, which operates the magazine, you see.  Then later in 1963, Hefner was arrested for promoting obscene literature after he published an issue of Playboy featuring new shots of Jane Mansfield in bed with the man, and oh yes, of course, he got off.  In the 1960s, Hefner created racially diverse private key clubs during the Civil Rights Movement.  Then Shady Hef, in 1966, sent Alex Haley to interview George Lincoln Rockwell, whom didn't tell Rockwell that Haley was black, but thinking that Rockwell wasn't Jewish, and so on.  You see, Rockwell founded the American Nazi Party.  Oh yes, he was once described as American Hitler.  Meanwhile, throughout the interview, Rockwell kept a handgun on the table.  This interview was recreating the roots, the next generation.  in 1979, with James Earl Jones as Haley and Marlon Brando as Rockwell.  They were even nominated for an Emmy.  And of course, Brando was the one who won the Emmy Award.  Now keep in mind, Haley also interviewed Malcolm X in 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr.  in 1966.  The newly established 1962 Playboy interview.  all three were assassinated by 1968 and all allegedly set up by Hefner.  You make the point.  Some of you may have heard and some of you should ask your grandparents about all of the suicides that happened with workers and Playboy mates from Hugh Hefner's party.  For example, on January 19, 1975, Bobbi Arnstein, and this is a female, Hugh Hefner's executive secretary was found dead in a hotel room.  She had committed suicide by overdosing on pills, leaving behind a succinct, meaning briefly written and clearly expressed, Anyway, it was a suicide note and of course an angry and distraught Hefner, but mainly angry because he lost his assistant.  You see, Einstein struggled with suicidal tendencies, but Hefner believed these were exaggerated by the FBI, which he called a witch hunt against the Playboy empire.  that resulted in Arnstein's arrest for cocaine possession.  On again, Arnstein was not the first Playboy employee to die, and not the first to commit suicide.  But her story is tragic, not only for the fact that she protected her employer with her dying breath, why I have no idea, Meaning he knew what she was doing all along.  You see, the FBI had been after Hugh Hefner for denigrating American culture for quite some time, especially after he befriended Bill Cosby.  You see, Hugh Hefner and the Playboy empire weren't exactly popular with the federal government.  For four years in the 1970s, the feds attacked Hefner and his empire from all sides.  only stopping after Hefner's assistant Bobby Ornstein committed suicide after being convicted on a cocaine possession drug charge.  The feds tried desperately to pin some drug charges on Hefner in order to take down his business, which they believed Hefner was using to traffic drugs.  However, after Ornstein's death, Hefner accused the government, preferably naming U.S.  Attorney James Thompson, of unjustly chasing him down.  Of course, Thompson denied these claims.  saying that the prosecutors did not conduct head-hunting missions.  Like, he would agree or reveal that he's doing this.  I mean, who does that?  You see, after the feds couldn't get anything specifically on Heffner, they decided to get to him through his assistant, Bobby Arnstein.  The FBI and DEA turned their focus to Arnstein and a man she was involved with called Ron Scharf.  They knew Scharf was involved with illicit drug deals and they tapped his phone in the hopes that he would lead them to Arnstein, who would hopefully bring down Hefner.  However, the alleged plan backfired when Arnstein's loyalty until the end to her boss refused to testify against Hefner.  Confessions said he threatened her with all kinds of stuff, which probably led to her long prison sentence for carrying a half pound of cocaine.  Yeah, she was framed.  Which was more jail time than the men who actually masterminded the operation.  Her loyalty carried on into her last breath.  that was written within that suicide note.  Meanwhile, let's talk about the confessions from ex-ploy boy mates.  You guys may want to brace yourselves.  You see, outside looking in, the Playboy Mansion seemed glamorous and fun for a horny man.  I mean, it's filled with big-breasted blonde women and so on.  But what was it like actually living there?  It seems several former Playboy mates have came with their stories.  Of course, you can read some of these confessions in their books of what it was really like living in a Playboy Mansion.  These playmates lived in a Playboy mansion and shared tales of carpet encrusted with dog excrement, unhygienic-sounding group pleasure sessions, and shady methods of payment.  If you're wondering what living in a Playboy mansion was like, it was less parties in the grotto and more trying to figure out how to get through the damn gate to escape.  Apparently, some of the carpets were covered in dog poop.  Ex-playmate Isabella St.  James detailed the disgusting living conditions and dog pooped covered carpets in her book called Bunny Tales Behind Closed Doors at the Playboy Mansion.  Here's what she said.  Hef did not care about our carpets.  The one in his bedroom had not been changed for years.  It was literally the color of diarrhea.  It became significantly worse when Holly moved in with her first dog and then got another.  The dogs were not housebroken and relieved themselves from the carpet.  Maybe a late night or early morning we stepped in her dog's pee or worse poop.  Some of the bunnies self-medicated to get through the damn day.  Ex-playmate Holly Madison entered the national spotlight thanks to the E!  reality show, The Girls Next Door.  She was known as Hef's main girl, but that position caused her stress and despair.  She turned to illicit substances and alcohol to cope with the challenges she encountered living in the Playboy mansion.  Madison candidly discussed her dark days in her book called Down the Rabbit Hole, Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny.  Here's what she said.  The depths of my own depression had led me down this very dark path, and there was no gleaming light.  However, distant at the end of this tunnel, Maybe it was the pot and the alcohol, but drowning myself seemed a logical way to escape the ridiculous life I was leading.  That's what she said.  Bunnies had to adhere to a strict code of conduct.  According to Carla Howe, one of the Playboy's Howe twins, she and her fellow bunnies are made to adhere to stringent house rules of her time in the mansion.  She said, when you're here, you have to be in by 9 p.m.  curfew.  You're not allowed to invite any friends up to see you.  Oh yes, and there's more.  Hugh Hefner reportedly used the bunny's allowance to control them.  Ex-hef girlfriend Isabella St.  James divulged how much money the women in the Playboy Mansion received in her book called Bunny Tales Behind Closed Doors at the Playboy Mansion.  Apparently, bunnies were given an allowance of $1,000 a week.  Though the system was anything but organized, they had to go to Hugh Hefner's bedroom once per week.  and asked for the cash.  this is what Isabella said.  life was so unstable at the mansion that we always felt that we had to get the allowance right then because we did not know if we would be there tomorrow have also apparently used the allowance as a means of exerting control.  this is what was also said.  Hef used the occasion as an excuse to bring up whatever he wasn't happy with in the relationship.  He put us on the spot, making us feel uncomfortable.  He would tell us what needed to be changed and speak to the other girls about it, although he always told us that we were his family and he gave it to us out of love.  We often felt like the allowance was not given out of concern and generosity.  He used it as a tool to make sure we would never leave.  Well, I'm not done yet.  Bunnies were required to engage in polymarous encounters with Hugh Hefner.  Former playmate Jill N. Spalding shared the graphic details of what exactly went down during the mansion's oft-discussed polymarous sessions.  Here's what she said.  Each girl gets on top of Hefner Hill for two minutes while the girls in the background try to keep him excited.  They'll yell things like, do her daddy.  There's a lot of cheerleader going on.  Bunny slept on stained mattresses.  According to, again, former Bunny Isabella St.  James, Hugh Hefner's girlfriends are not kept in glamorous surroundings.  Here's what she said.  Although we all did our best to decorate our rooms and make them homey, The mattresses on our beds were disgusting.  Old, worn, and stained.  The sheets were past their best.  Oh, I'm still not done yet.  No protection was used during group sessions, and that includes sometimes with guests.  Ew.  Former playmate Jill N. Spalding revealed yet again that protection was never used during the group sessions.  When asked if Hugh Hefner ever used protection on himself, this was her reply.  No, no protection and no testing.  He doesn't care.  His main girlfriend is the first to sleep with him because that's the safest for her.  Bunnies have been offered pills and were given to some of the clients to give to their Playboy mate.  One time bunny Holly Madison wrote about Hugh Hefner offering her quadaloops during a night out in her memoir.  Here is what she wrote.  Would you like a quadaloop?  Hef asked, leaning toward me with a bunch of large horse pills in his hands held together by crumpled tissue.  No, Hef did not miss a beat.  Okay, that's good, he said, nonchalantly.  Usually I don't approve of substances, but you know, in the 70s, they used to call these pills thigh openers.  Mm-hmm, oh yes.  Now, oh, and there's more.  Bunnies had a curfew and guests were limited.  Playmate Carla Howe, again, Compare life in the mansion of being similar to a prison.  She describes some of the strict guidelines bunnies are required to follow.  Were and here's what she said.  You definitely not allowed male visitors.  If you break the rules, you get banned.  And once you're out, you're out.  You can't come back.  Oh yes, and bunnies weren't allowed to get jobs.  If life in the Playboy Mansion was bad, why would women put up with it, right?  Well, Hugh Hefner did offer free room and board in addition to a weekly salary.  And once they were there, the bunnies weren't allowed to find jobs.  As ex-girlfriend Kendra Wilkinson explained, you remember her?  Here's what she said.  I hate putting my hand out.  but we couldn't have jobs other than getting appearance fees.  Oh, and those gates I mentioned were meant to not only to keep out the nosy and the paps out, But the gates were meant to keep the girls in.  Here's what ex-mate Bunny Holly Madison said yet again.  Describe how she felt in prison during the tenure at the Playboy Mansion in her book.  Here's what she said.  Everyone thinks that the infamous metal gate was meant to keep people out.  But I grew to feel it was meant to keep me locked in.  I told all of you this because he did this without the level of scrutiny and embarrassment and not to mention prison time like anyone of color would have gotten.  He got away with prostituting, raping, drugging and embezzlement and not to mention he did deal drugs in there.  You know, he was the one providing the quarter loops and all kinds of drugs.  And in some cases, murder of some of these young ladies.  And nothing happened.  It is not a coincidence that he died so quickly during the prosecution of Bill Cosby.  Why?  Because I believe that he thought he was the next.  And considering Cosby and he went way back.  And if anyone could bring him down, it would have been Cosby.  The dominoes were definitely falling.  But that's one theory.  The other theory was he was behind in putting the nail on the coffin for the setup of Cosby.  They were like, and this was leaked, it's either you and this orgy fest empire, or you help us finally take Cosby down.  An old friend who was revealed by several playmates that all he did when he came around, like many other celebs, was sleep without being linked to the media or hounded by paps.  He got a good meal, played some lawn games, and that was it.  There was never any orgies or anything of the kind, but they knew Hef and he went way back.  So did he and Kobe, who did participate in orgies and drugging women.  So he helped frame Cosby and even helped deliver the names of people that were associated with Cosby, well, mainly him.  that will lie it was told.  during that trial assigned for other conditions i'm sure half went into deep depression he wanted out.  karma is a. i mean have has a history of framing black leaders of sexual allegations.  like i said it's always deeper than the media.  tell you.  well that's it.  let me know your thoughts below on that note.  don't forget to subscribe share and like and hit the bell so you get notifications when i do post more videos.  see y'all later.  love you all bye Thank you.
