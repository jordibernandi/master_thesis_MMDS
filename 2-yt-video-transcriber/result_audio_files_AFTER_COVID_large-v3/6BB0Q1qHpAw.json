            "text": "In any political struggle, there are those with institutional power and those without.  Political violence always occurs between or among these two groups.  Now there are many kinds of power imbalances along lines of gender, race, capital, but today we're going to look at that between citizens and the state.  We can map political violence on a two-by-two grid, with the people enacting violence on one axis and the people receiving it on the other.  We're not going to dwell on times when the state commits violence against itself, since, unless there are a lot of police chiefs or senators subscribed that I don't know about, this is not violence that contains us, and therefore we don't have much influence over it.  But Hitler's Night of the Long Knives would be an example.  Next, we have the state against the citizens, like when the police murder an unarmed man in broad daylight in front of an audience simply because they can.  And the citizens against the state, like the people burning down a police station in protest.  These two often happen in tandem, for instance, when a cop fires a tear gas canister at a crowd and a protester grabs it and throws it right back.  Finally, there's citizens against themselves.  We could talk about infighting among protest movements or even just normal everyday crime, but I'm more interested in self-inflicted violence that is itself protest, like the Indian hunger strikes or the self-immolations that began the Arab Spring.  These work to expose the cruelty of the state because it's violence that could be prevented by acceding to demands, which the state has chosen not to do.  A thing about political violence is it makes the general public afraid that law and order will collapse, that the violence could happen to them, and when people are afraid, they reflexively turn to the authorities to keep them safe.  It is demonstrated that average authoritarian sentiment increases when there is violence in the streets, even when the authorities are among the perpetrators.  This is how people end up signing their rights away during a crisis.  The exception is in the case when the authorities are seen to commit violence against explicitly peaceful citizens, what researcher Bob Altemeier calls the Gandhi Trap.  It exists within these two squares.  When the authorities beat people who refuse to fight back, or allow them to burn and starve themselves, people lose faith in authority.  When they think of violence that could be committed against them, they stop thinking of protesters and start thinking of cops.  Beyond a certain point, nonviolent protest almost always includes one or both of these two.  It is vanishingly rare for injustice to be corrected by simply appealing to the moral sense of those in power.  Once the state has shown it will commit violence against its own citizens to protect or simply to demonstrate its own authority, the people have only the choice to give up, or proceed with violence in play.  They cannot, by themselves, turn a physical struggle back into a purely moral one.  They can only decide where the violence takes place.  Change happens when people are willing to bleed for it.  Pacifism is a powerful strategy, but it is, no mistake, the willingness to personally take a bat to the head.  We can talk about whether it's more effective for your long-term goals to let a cop smack you down on camera than it is to wreck their car, but people tend to skip over what is really being asked of protesters.  Critics who demand peaceful demonstrations are saying, whether they admit it or not, that the correct way to protest is to let a heavily militarized police force that has already demonstrated its willing to murder people in full view of the public beat them shitless.  They are not wishing for nonviolence.  They are stating a preference for whom the violence should happen to.  An issue we're facing today in our modern era of filter bubbles and hyper-partisan news networks is the efficacy of the Gandhi Trap is deeply in question.  The Gandhi Trap requires peaceful protesters to suffer in public in order for it to work.  And the authorities currently have an unprecedented ability to deny that peaceful protest is taking place, or to spin it as a riot.  Just in my own life, I have seen a peaceful anti-war protest of a quarter million get reported as one of 30,000.  And I've seen a reactionary conservative rally of 87,000 get reported as a quarter million.  During Occupy, I watched footage of cops attacking protesters for saying things they didn't like, and watched conservative friends from high school argue it had been edited to make the cops look bad.  It was cell phone video.  There were no edits.  The most iconic photo of the Ferguson protests is widely interpreted as a man throwing a tear gas canister at the cops, when he was in fact throwing it at nobody and away from children.  And we have seen counter-protesters beaten with hammers, spun as the ones who brought the hammers.  We are at this very moment seeing days-long peaceful marches get little coverage, while the media focuses on isolated acts of vandalism.  In the 1960s, white supremacy lost the battle over the Civil Rights Bill, in partial thanks to nonviolent demonstrations.  So they updated their tactics.  Today an entire media empire exists, in part, to undermine the effectiveness of the Gandhi Trap.  Because pacifism does not work when the public doesn't see it.  If your empathy depends on nonviolence, they will tell you George Floyd had a criminal record, and Mike Brown was no angel, and Trayvon Martin had been suspended.  Yes, they were unarmed when they died, and the crimes they were suspected of weren't violent, but they had been maybe at some point in the past violent.  And they won't mention Breonna Taylor and Sandra Bland at all.  These are people who will tell you milkshakes are cement.  And they don't need every newscaster to run with the lie.  They just report it was a riot and know that corporate media, in a desperate attempt to appear unbiased, will debate, was it a riot?  And no one of comparable size will report that it obviously was not.  Turns out the protesters may have been peaceful, doesn't align people against the cops as effectively.  And this is the part of the video where I'm supposed to advocate for something.  but I don't know what.  Like any moral person, I want change to happen peacefully through boycotts, sit-ins, and general strikes, but I know enough history to know it's never that simple.  People have this idea that pacifism works in a phase-one-be-nonviolent-phase-three-progress kind of way, but pacifism is a strategy.  It is almost always part of a larger ecosystem of protest that includes the unpeaceful, and its strongest advocates tend to insist.  the enemy is not rioters, but injustice.  People today demand nonviolence because they're more comfortable with it, not because it works.  I don't know how to make it work, and neither do they.  I'm working on it.  But if they're not offering real solutions, and they're not taking the blows from a truncheon themselves, then they aren't after justice.  They're after a performance.  And I don't think that qualifies them to speak on the subject.  Why don't you arrest us?  Why don't you get out in front of the camera and go on?  This is not a matter of being in front of the camera.  It's a matter of facing your sheriff and facing your judge.  We're willing to be beaten for democracy, and you misuse democracy in the street.  You beat people bloody in order that they will not have the privilege to vote. ",
