Then we see pictures of Royal Air Force spotter planes in the channel, military drones, a former Royal Marine has been appointed.  And all this does... is just to illustrate our own impotence.  This is about political will.  Now, you said that later on in the show, you're going to be talking about Tony Abbott, all right?  Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister, he's in London this week.  He faced exactly the same crisis as the Australian prime minister, all right?  Boats coming, illegal migrants coming from Indonesia.  Bigger boats, bigger journeys, more people, but the principle, exactly the same.  And Abbott had the courage to stop those boats, turn them around, tow them back to Indonesia, and to send out a message which said, anybody that comes illegally to Australia via this means will not be allowed to stay full stop.

Unless Boris has a change of heart, not only will this crisis continue, not only will the numbers continue to rise, not only will hotels all over the country be filled up, But what will also happen is trust in this conservative government will start to evaporate.  They promised the British people and it was part of the Brexit promise, wasn't it?  That overall numbers coming into Britain would decline.  And we're now seeing legal and illegal immigration running at all time highs.  And this and they may not care about it in Westminster.  They may not think this is a really big issue.

But Coventry City Council actually rejected these boat people who were on these coaches and said, no, we don't accept them.  And they were sent on their way.  Now, I don't know where they went.

They're still here in this country.  The number that you quoted earlier is 48,000 people.  I would guess that's probably now an underestimate.  We're also talking, by the way, about a bill for all of this that is now in excess of one billion sterling every single month.

They passed without much fanfare.  715,000 new people settled in the United Kingdom in the year to March.  This is now back running at record levels.

Look, I want us to have... as good relations in this country between all communities that we can possibly have.  But that is only going to work if people come to the country the right way, legally, through the system.  And I can assure you of one thing, and perhaps the Guardian don't understand this, It isn't just white indigenous people that are angry with what's going on in Dover.  Many of those who come into Britain from other countries around the world legally done the right thing, been registered, been, you know, in many cases become, you know, naturalized Britons.  They're even angrier because they had to do this the legal way.  They had to do this the hard way.  So I think there's a remarkable sort of 75 percent of the country are concerned or very concerned about what's going on in the English Channel and its knock-on repercussions.

That's not going to happen.  And so they weren't able to give these people work, which was another reason that they stopped coming as well.  But what do you think is the political will that's lacking here, Nigel?  You know, there seems to me there are three kind of prongs to this.  There's the human traffickers themselves who should be locked up and should be rounded up and should be found.  There's the lawyers who continue to fight for these people who come here.

At many levels, the government's being tested on its competence.  On the immigration story, it's beginning to be tested on issues of trust.  If they drop the ball on Brexit and cave in to Barnier's demands, there will be a Labour government led by Keir Starmer at the next election.
