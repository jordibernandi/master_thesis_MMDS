Last month, we looked at 1967's documentary The Queen, which captured a slice of New York drag culture right before Stonewall changed everything.  Now we're going to jump ahead 20 years to.  Paris is Burning, the groundbreaking documentary that captured another small hidden slice of New York drag culture right before everything changed again.  And thanks to everyone who makes Culture Cruise possible with a pledge of support on Patreon.  Folks like Garth Jensen, Gareth Marshall, and Fredo Alvarez.  You can head over to patreon.com slash matt baume to help keep these videos coming, and check out some backer rewards.  Before we talk about Paris' burning and voguing and the mummy in Dorian Corey's closet, which I promise we will get to, we'll need a quick refresher on New York's drag and ballroom scene.  I went into a lot more detail on that history in last month's video about the Queen, but for now what you need to know is New York's drag balls have their origin in annual galas that started in the latter half of the 1800s.  Those balls grew, like balls do, into a golden age in the 1920s, a period known as the Pansy Craze.  But although they allowed people of all races to compete, the balls weren't exactly welcoming to people of color.  Black drag performers almost never won first place in the contests, and they were expected to lighten their skin to compete.  Drag balls then faded from public view in the 1930s, thanks to a moral panic that forced queer culture underground.  Thirty years passed.  And then, with the sexual revolution in the 1960s, drag balls gradually came back out into the open.  leading up to the pageant captured in the documentary The Queen.  They didn't know it then, but when they shot The Queen, drag was about to change forever.  At the very end of the pageant, we see a confrontation involving the reigning Miss Manhattan, Crystal LaBeija.  Crystal, where are you going?  This is not the time to show temperament. ",

            "text": "Crystal unexpectedly walks off stage when it's announced that the judges placed her third.  Not only was she passed over for the crown, but as Miss Manhattan, she'd had to deal with systemic racism that had been a part of the ballroom scene for a century.  And on that night in 1967, her frustration erupted.  I have a right to show my color, darling!  I am beautiful, and I know I'm beautiful!  So whatever happened to Krystal?  Well, now we're ready to talk about what happened after the queen.  Krystal and her friend Lottie started organizing their own drag pageants, and their own drag house, the House of LaBeija.  Where the pageant system had titles like Emperor and Empress, drag houses were structured more like families, support networks for queer people who might otherwise have been all alone.  Each house had a mother, and Crystal is recognized as the first mother of the House of LaBeija.  Drag houses kept growing and were a big part of queer life in New York by the 1980s, particularly in communities of color.  But most of America had no idea they existed until the documentary Paris is Burning came out in 1990.  The film was shot over a period of several years, and it doesn't tell a linear story so much as present a series of vignettes of Harlem's drag balls in the mid-to-late 80s.  We're introduced to a handful of figures who'd come to reign over the scene, like Pepper LaBeija, who became the housemother after Crystal.  Crystal was the founder. ",

            "text": "Right after that interview was shot, but before the documentary was released, voguing would become a huge international phenomenon.  But it didn't come to mainstream audiences through the balls, at least not directly.  Madonna discovered voguing through one of her dancers, Jose Extravaganza, a member of the House of Extravaganza.  As the story goes, Madonna's hairdresser told her about the balls, and Madonna just showed up at a club one night and asked Jose to dance.  She said, I heard you do this Vogue thing, and I want to see.  She must have liked what she saw, because she began working with Jose and Luis Extravaganza to create the moves for the Vogue music video, as well as its various incarnations on tour and at the MTV Music Awards, which includes an early televised thwarp.  Fun fact here, ballroom isn't the only queer culture that Madonna's lifting in this video.  The cinematography is a pretty direct homage to the work of a gay fashion photographer who worked for Vogue magazine in the 1940s.  He went by the name Horst P. Horst.  He was still alive when this video came out, and he was apparently pretty annoyed that Madonna never asked his permission.  And that brings us to a topic that has to be addressed when talking about Paris is burning, and that's cultural tourism and appropriation.  So Paris is Burning brought a big spotlight onto a culture that was previously invisible to the mainstream.  But the person behind that spotlight, Jenny Livingston, wasn't fully a part of that culture herself.  So although the director Jenny Livingston is queer and was friends with people in the ballroom scene and had been attending balls for years, she wasn't a performer or a member of a house.  And in the year since Paris is Burning came out, it's drawn criticism for the fact that it was made by someone who wasn't an active participant in Ballroom, but was instead an outsider looking in.  In particular, the writer Bell Hooks points out that Livingston's film creates what Hooks calls an imperial gaze, where the subjects are defined by the observer rather than by themselves.  And that definitely does happen in the film at some points.  For example, when voguing is defined by a completely clueless white newscaster.  But to be fair, the primary definition does come from people of color, who are actual dancers. ",

Whenever you're learning about or discussing marginalized cultures, I think it's important to listen primarily to the people in those cultures.  So by no means should I be your primary source on Ballroom.  I'm glad that you're watching now, but by all means, don't stop here.  There are some amazing other videos that you should check out, made by black people in the Ballroom scene.  Start with BET's series Queer as Fuck, which released a documentary last year called Ballroom a Safe Space, featuring interviews with members of the House of LaBeija.  You should also watch the TEDx talk by Ronald Murray, where he breaks down the language of voguing.  And check out Ballroom Throwbacks for hours and hours and hours of conversations with people of color in the ballroom community.  And of course, read that Bell Hooks essay, Is Paris Burning?  I have links to all those in the description for this video.  And many of the subjects of the film were unhappy with it as well.  Here's Octavia St.  Laurent talking about it several years later.  So how do you feel about Paris is Burning?  It's a terrible movie. ",

Willie passed away in 2006, but to this day his house has members all over the world, just like he dreamed.  And his children are icons in the scene.  But the future wasn't so bright for other people in the documentary.  In a 1993 follow-up, the New York Times tracked down some of the subjects and found that many had passed away.  Dorian Corey left a particularly strange mystery behind.  After she passed, her friends went through her belongings and found a mummified human body in her closet.  A note attached to it said that it was someone who tried to break into the apartment and that Dorian shot him.  Fingerprints suggested that the remains were a man who had disappeared 25 years earlier.  But to this day, nobody's exactly sure how he came into Dorian's life, or how Dorian managed to mummify him.  Other documentary subjects saw their health decline over the following years, in part due to a lack of effective treatment for HIV.  And Venus Extravaganza, who dreamed of a better life, was found murdered.  Her killer was never caught.  Violent crime, drug use, and HIV was devastating the community.  There was one study that showed that 62% of participants in House and Ballroom were HIV-positive.  By 1993, reporters who covered the Ballroom scene were starting to use the past tense to describe it.  And for a time, it looked like there was a possibility that Ballroom could literally die out.  So why didn't it?  Well, in part, because in the 90s the houses recognized what was happening, and they banded together to create a unified front to fight AIDS with a new collaborative house, the House of Latex, which threw the annual Latex Ball.  That was a giant annual party to raise money and awareness, to provide education and distribute safe sex materials, and it continues to this day.  And there was another initiative, called Project Vogue, that matched HIV educators to house mothers and fathers, teaching them safe sex practices that then they could pass along to their children.  Those projects were watched very closely by HIV educators in the 90s and into the 2000s, and those researchers found that the family structure that the houses provided, in the form of emotional support and a sense of pride and mentorship, all correlated with better sexual health.  In other words, the family structure created by Crystal decades earlier turned out to provide more than just escape and support.  Crystal and the houses literally saved people's lives.  Today, we're living in an incredible time for Ballroom.  We have shows like Posed, with a production team that includes queer and trans people of color, and Legendary, which highlights the amazing work of real-life houses.  And crucially, we have real-life role models who are black and queer and a real part of the community.  Back in the 1980s, Dorian Corey said that she used to dream of being a star.  But as she got older, she found herself hoping for something else.  Something that I think she ultimately achieved. ",
