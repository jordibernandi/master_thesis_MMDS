            "text": "Um... now that video that you guys just saw was pretty shockingly like how brazen with how racist it was.  um they really outdid themselves when they came to that department.  but i think the moral of this story to understand is that racism is not dead.  the united states is not all of a sudden not racist anymore.  this is a high school in georgia.  by the way same time we're talking about those southern states.  um it's pretty.  you know there's going to be a lot of situations like this.  racism is a very real thing.  there's no way.  there's not the case.  it's just simply not the case that racism is just dead in the united states.  okay that's just not the case.  i hate to break it to you and this is just one example.  but the thing is they actually were up front about it and like not just up front about it.  they were like incredibly brazen and just abrasive with how racist they were.  It's kind of insane, honestly, just how abrasive about it they were.  But a lot of people hold it in and don't say it.  But these people were just, you know, they were just so upfront about it that they told you.  I mean, holy crap, that was racist.  Now, the high school, they say that they will not be graduates.  It says two Carleton High School seniors were expelled Friday and won't be allowed to graduate after a racist video they posted online went viral.  The racist behavior observed in the video easily violates the standard.  They are no longer students at Carleton High School.  They were both seniors at Carleton High School, which is in Georgia.  This is a video that was posted on TikTok, a very racist video.  And honestly, I'm wondering where the racism came from, you know, because no one's born racist.  Everyone's sort of a product of their environment or how and so I guess I don't know if it's their parents probably taught them.  Maybe they observed it from their peers in their upbringing.  Maybe I'm not really sure but you know, they're definitely pretty hurt by this.  they're expelled as of right now and also Apparently the girl had got it into a college but they say that she didn't get admitted or something like that and So, as of right now, they're expelled from their high school.  Not exactly sure what's going on with the girl who was basically accepted into a college.  But, moral of the story, racism is alive and well in the United States, guys.  Seriously, don't pretend it's not. ",
