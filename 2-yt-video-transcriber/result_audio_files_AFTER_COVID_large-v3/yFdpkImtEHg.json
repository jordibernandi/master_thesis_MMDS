            "text": "I'm not a big fan of that word historical.  So what I look at, remember everything.  we work in cold cases, we're working, any crime.  you work, you're working in an event in the past.  We don't get to watch crimes in live time.  We're not like scientists who work in a laboratory environment with crime.  We are always examining events.  I guess you could call them historical events, even if it's only 30 years ago or it's only 30 minutes ago.  So what we're looking at is, do we have any good evidence?  So, for example, the first thing I wanted to know when I was looking at the New Testament is, could I reasonably consider the Gospels to be a reliable eyewitness record?  That's up for debate, and people will debate that for ages, okay?  And I've written a ton about this in my books and on the website.  And what I try to argue is that I think we've got good reason to at least suggest that the authors of this account wanted it to be considered an eyewitness account.  We have statements like John at the end of his account where he says, hey, you know, I'm writing about all that Jesus did.  I can write a lot more.  I can fill books with all this stuff.  Okay.  Then the question is, well, is it a reliable account?  Is it an account, an eyewitness account, and then is it a reliable account?  And if it's a reliable account, this is how, by the way, I look at, I get supplemental reports from 30 years ago in which a witness has been interviewed by a detective in 1972.  Now that witness has been dead for 10 years.  So I have no way to go re-interview that person.  And the detective has been dead for five.  So now I have no way to go interview the writer of the report.  But I've got this report I have to assess, even though I have no access to the first eyewitness or the person who wrote about the eyewitness.  That's much like the Gospels.  Well, I know how to assess those reports.  There's four factors.  I talk about them in cold case.  Four factors we use to assess eyewitness reliability of any document, of any eyewitness.  So those four areas are the four areas that I pressed into service as I examined the Gospels.  So for me, remember, when someone asks you, what is the one reason why you believe this to be true, I'm always a little bit hesitant because I never have one reason.  I call this death by a thousand paper cuts.  that's what it is.  is this cumulative case of of hundreds of little things that i think point to?  the most reasonable inference in any one of those things is a paper cut.  i could offer it to you and i think you could be very reasonably sale at.  doesn't seem like enough.  it's not enough.  it's the fact it's cumulative.  it wouldn't be enough in a jury trial either.  when i get a hundred of these things juries convict because it's not.  there's no other reasonable alternative.  and that's what i try to do with cold case christianity.  that book is really about looking at the historical evidence for the reliability of the New Testament.  I know that's not going to give you much.  Give me a chance to recite 48,000 words, and I can give it to you right now. ",
