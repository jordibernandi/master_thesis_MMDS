Man, I'm going to have a heart attack if I don't quit watching all this stuff, but I won't.  Anyway, this video is from Keller, Texas, and the filthy cop, Shimanek.  Even with this video in evidence, this pig is still on the streets.  Even with his past record, which is not good, he is still on the streets.  Let's get on with the video and I will finish up afterwards.  And be warned, I might even interrupt in the middle of it, even though it's a short video. ",

He saw that the guy was just standing there.  He didn't see any evidence of the guy blocking the road.  So why did he just automatically assume it was okay to go arrest him?  But let's focus on the piece of trash, Blake.  It is all about the camera because he's been in trouble before.  He's been in trouble for entering a home without a warrant and no permission.  He's been in trouble for making some kind of comment about, uh, woman not having a gun.  And now with this, and there was probably other ones that we don't know about.  And now with this, and he's still a cop.  Now, he did get demoted, but that's not good enough.  You do not have cops like this on the streets that can't handle their ego and can't handle their temper.  And this was a rough arrest.  The Blake here, I'm saying Blake because I'll just screw up his last name.  Blake here even tries to choke hold, which didn't work because this guy's too strong for him.  And they pepper sprayed him.  Couldn't really tell if they beat him.  The video really didn't show that much.  Showed part of it.  Now, the good news is they did demote this piece of trash down to just the regular officer.  The man got a Apology for the whole thing from the police chief, the police department.  A personal apology.  And I bet these two have to worry about him from now on.  He will find something to get them for, even if this is one of his buddies on the police department, which let's hope doesn't happen.  Hopefully he's the only one that is this rogue.  But anyway, I'm going to leave a, The information, the contact information in the description.  Oh, by the way, this happened back in August, I think.  And the video just been released recently, it looks like.  They sure like the whole bag.  Anyway, I will leave the contact info for the PD in the description and the Facebook.  And y'all can handle it however y'all see fit.  This is PNP News.  I am out of here. ",
