I mean, they have a role, but the answer is spiritual because the problem is spiritual.  And the only way America can be saved is through revival. ",

We're going to get to the hope.  that God has given us.  But before there can be hope, we've got to see the condition that we're in.  When we're looking at the pandemic that's sweeping through the nation right now, is there any significance to the arrival of that pandemic here in the United States? ",

            "text": "If you look at the original book, and the third part of the new book is called The Coming, what is now and what is yet to come, and what do we need to know.  But in the original book, The Harbinger, there's a chapter called Things to Come.  And if you look at that book, it talks about what's going to come.  And it says that the pattern is there will be great shakings that will come.  First of all, the nation is given, the pattern is the nation is given a window of time to come back to God.  And it's a window of grace.  Well, years, it's years with ancient Israel.  But then there's going to come an ending of that with the closing of that window.  And there's going to come shaking.  And I said, how will the shaking come?  Well, the shaking will take the form of various things.  It takes the form of economic disintegration.  It takes the form of the breakdown of infrastructure.  It takes the form of the dividing of the nation.  Economic, I mean, all sorts of things, which many of them are happening this year.  And natural disasters as well.  But the thing, actually, it says, it talks about the removing of the nation's crown.  And the word crown comes from the word corona, which is literally what we're dealing with.  But there's a thing called the 19-year mystery.  And that is that the question, and it comes back, it starts with the Harbinger, the original book, and it's revealed in the Harbinger, too.  And in the original book, it says how long between the first shaking, that attack on the enemy, that initial shaking, and the coming of the greater shakings on the land.  And the answer is that in, I mean, there's actually, there's two cases.  We have one, well, that's recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures.  One is the southern kingdom, and the other is the northern kingdom.  Well, the southern kingdom, that's Jerusalem.  It's given very clearly.  It says the enemy came, Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylon invaded, struck the nation in the year 605 B.C.  And then when did the greater shakings come?  It came in the year 586 BC.  So between those two years, it's 19 years.  19-year mystery.  19 is a year, a time of judgment, a period of judgment where the nation was given grace, but then comes greater shakings.  19-year mystery.  Well, when did America, when did it happen for America?  America, the first shaking, the strike came, of course, on 9-11.  The year was 2001.  If you add... 19 years.  what year does it come out to as the year of shaking?  the year 2020?  so that's one of the reasons i mean.  i mean there was more but the first reason why i was always looking at 2020 for years saying lord if it follows this template this year is going to be a year of great shakings.  And so it was, so it has been.  I mean, so it has been.  We've never had a year of this shake for the nation in our history, in our lifetime, I mean, since the Civil War.  I mean, and that was another thing.  So we are here now in this mystery.  Now, what about how it happened?  Well, the prophet Jeremiah speaks, prophesies of what is gonna come on the nation in that 19th year.  And one of the things he said was gonna come is one of the forms of judgment is a plague will come on the land.  A pestilence, a plague will come in the 19th year.  That's when it came, on ancient Israel, on ancient Judah.  And so the plague has come upon America now.  This is going to get very deep, but I know you are not someone who cares about political correctness.  So that's going to end.  And also, this is so important that we know, but the longest chapter and the biggest chapter in the Harbinger 2 is called The Plague.  And that is what's happening now.  And the thing is that, can there be reasons behind it?  And I'm not saying there's only one reason for something.  There's many reasons.  But can there be a biblical something that precipitates something?  Well, one of the actions that invokes the judgment of God in the Bible tremendously is the sinning against children, the killing of children.  Israel offered up its children as sacrifices.  And the prophet Jeremiah says, because you did that, one of the things that's going to happen is a plague is going to come on the land.  But he says, judgment's going to come because of what you did.  Well, you know, Israel lifted up thousands of children.  We have lifted up millions.  We have killed millions of unborn children.  Well, first of all, America has killed 60 million children over that.  And there's blood on our hands.  And this generation of the world has killed more children than any other generation in the history of mankind.  And that has happened.  And so interesting.  So here you've got, and one of the judgments is plague.  So you've got a plague.  We've killed over a billion and a half children.  You have a plague coming on the nations.  But America had a special place in this.  America helped pioneer this to much of the world.  America was at the forefront of abortion.  America led other nations into abortion.  America has killed children at a later stage than most of the rest of the world, has killed more children than most other nations.  There's only a few that compare.  Basically, one is China, which is where the plague began.  And America has been given more, much is expected, more is required.  So here's the thing.  So one of the principles of judgment, and with Jeremiah, when he says that, he says judgment is going to come because of what you did to the children.  And it's going to return to the place where you did it.  Well, where is the center of abortion in America?  Where have more children been killed in America than any other place?  New York.  New York is the capital.  And New York City is the capital.  More bloodshed has come there than any other place in America for children.  When the plague came to America... What place did it strike more than any other place?  In fact, even when you add up every other place to this day, it's still at the top.  It was New York and New York City.  More people were struck by this plague in New York City than any other place.  I mean, combined.  I mean, at the beginning and even to this day.  And so it became the capital of the plague in the world.  And Jeremiah says there'll be so many people.  Well, let me go here further.  The other thing about it, so it returns to the place, but not only that, It also, it's interesting because it's a plague that particularly strikes the older rather than the younger.  I mean, you know, anybody can happen, but that die from it are the older.  Well, it's interesting because abortion is the sin of the older against the younger.  And the other thing about it is that the day that it was announced that the plague had come to America, or when it made headlines in newspapers across the land, it was identified on a particular day, and then the next day it went throughout the land on the newspapers.  And there was a date next to that headline.  And the date was January 22nd.  January 22nd was the day that America legalized abortion, the killing of unborn.  And on that same day, the news came.  And not only that.  One year before that date, it was January 22nd to 2020 is when the headlines made America about the play came.  But you go back one year and you go back to New York City, New York.  In New York, they legalized the killing of children up to the point of birth.  And remember that gruesome law.  They did it on January 22nd, the anniversary of abortion.  And one year later to the day, The news came across America that the plague had come to America and was coming to New York City.  And by the way, when they announced that gruesome law, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, celebrated by lighting up the Harbinger, one of the Harbingers, the World Trade Center, in pink to celebrate it.  And then, and remember what we saw, that image of death in New York City?  You know, that image of, well, now death came to New York City.  And not only that, not only that, But Jeremiah says that there'll be so many people dying, they won't be able to have enough room to bury them.  Well, that happened to New York.  There were so many people dying in New York City, they didn't have enough room.  And in Jeremiah, he gave that prophecy when he was standing at the potter's gate, that's over the potter's field.  And all those prophecies are linked to the potter.  Well, what they did in New York, they couldn't bury everyone, so they shipped them to an island, to the unclaimed people.  They shipped them to an island, and they buried them in a place that New York City calls the Potter's Field, the very place where Jeremiah's prophecy said this would happen.  And not only that, but, you know, I've spoken, for those of you who know the book, the other book I did, the last book before this called The Oracle, right?  It speaks about the Jubilee and mystery and a Jubilee is a good thing, you know, because it's about restoration, but there's a sign of, there's a part of judgment to it.  If you took something that didn't belong to you on the time of Jubilee, the year of Jubilee, it's taken away from you.  Well, America took life.  And now it's being taken away.  Well, when did abortion begin in America?  It was legalized across the country in 1973, but that's not when it began.  Abortion on demand began in 1970.  And particularly it was New York that led the way and opened the way for the nation.  Well, add 50 years, when is the jubilee of abortion?  The year 2020, when it gets taken back.  And New York.  But actually, there were two days that New York voted to legalize abortion in 1970.  They were April 9th and April 10th.  They did a study to find out when the plague was greatest on New York City or New York.  And they came up with two dates, April 9th and April 10th, 50 years to the exact date.  And so here we are, you know, and so and this is and this is not all.  But this is this is this.  I mean, this is just mind boggling.  But we have to know the signs of the times. ",

Now, Brother Kahn, I know we only have a few more minutes with you.  I know we're pressed for time, but I want to make sure we dive into what's coming next.  But those of you watching online, listen, if you haven't liked this video, if you haven't shared it already, what are you waiting for?  Get on it.  Get this message out.  Everyone needs to hear it.  And in a moment, I'm going to ask Brother Khan to pray for us and to pray for you.  If you're far from God, if you feel like your fire is burning low, I want to ask him to pray for us to have a revival of sorts in our own personal lives so that we can see a revival in this nation.  But Brother Jonathan, where is this headed now as we enter into 2021?  What's next on God's prophetic calendar? ",

            "text": "Yeah, well, let me let me say this.  And I know because I know you.  Well, two things.  One is if America does not turn back from the pattern and the template is if it doesn't turn back, that the shakings continue.  The shakings continue until that nation's either going to come back to God or is going to head to total judgment.  So we are like on the precipice.  You know, and where we are right now, we got to praise them for it.  There are many things happening right now.  It's a crucial time.  That's why we have the return in Washington.  And but that's we are still.  it's at a crucial moment.  There are things that hang in the balance right now.  So this is a critical moment.  There's much to be said about it that I from the book that I can't get into because of time.  But I want to say this, too.  There's also hope.  The book, Harbinger 2, ends up with hope, as you know.  And what do we need to do as believers, regardless of what happens, what do you need to know?  What do you need to do to stand in the days ahead and to even prevail in the days ahead?  And what is the hope?  And there are mysteries in there, as you know, concerning revival.  Listen, I'll tell you, I'll say this.  The only hope America has is revival.  Yeah.  the answer is you as you as you alluded to earlier so eloquently.  it is not.  the answer is not anything else.  it's not economics it's not political it's not.  i mean they have a role but that's the answer is spiritual because the problem is spiritual and the only answer the only way america can be saved is is through revival to repent and you can't have revival without repentance.  so one of the things though at the end of the harvard show it talks about the coming.  it talks about literally the times that America's history was changed by this mystery of repentance and revival.  And it's interesting because that scripture, if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face, you know, we know that.  We know that scripture, but we don't look at the verse before it gives you the time.  It says, if I send a plague on the land, then if my people.  So God is saying, now is the time for revival.  If we don't see it now, if we don't see it, there's no hope for America.  But revival begins with each of us.  We have to be praying for revival as never before.  Every one of us.  I'm charging you, pray as never before for revival.  Not only that, but don't just pray for revival, but start living revival.  If you start... In revival, the revival starts now.  And God is going to bless your life.  You're going to be in revival.  And when you're in revival, no matter what's happening around you, you're going to be a light.  If the dark gets darker, it's time for the lights of God to get brighter.  And so these could be, listen, guys, these could be the most exciting days.  On the other hand, and that is that these are the days when we see a culture.  turning away from God.  Well, these are the days of Jeremiah.  These are the days of Elijah.  These are the days of the apostles like Paul.  And so, you know, this could be the greatest time for those who will shine.  Now, if you compromise, there's no shining.  But if you stand, like since the eyes of the Lord are searching the earth to look for the one whose heart is his, completely his, he's going to show himself mightily for that one.  You be that one.  You be that one, and God will use you mightily, and this will be your greatest hour.  But it starts with repentance.  Whatever's in your life that shouldn't be, get it out.  Whatever is not in your life that God's calling, get it in.  Start today.  Start now, and God will lift you up. ",
