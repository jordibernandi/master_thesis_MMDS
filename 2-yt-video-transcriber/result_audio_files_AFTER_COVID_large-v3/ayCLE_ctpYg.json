I never thought I'd say that, but we had too many MAGA flags on the boat and the wind picked up, the current shifted.  I couldn't tell it was port and what was starboard.  Bunch of other nautical terms happened.  One thing led to another and I was in the water and I turned around and she was gone.  The SS Magaritaville is gone and I love that boat.  She was my personality, and them flags would be lowered to half-mast tonight if they hadn't been lowered to the bottom of the lake earlier today.  They had to fight to get me out, because if I'm not going to wear a mask, I'm damn sure not going to wear that life jacket they kept throwing at me.  I just kept saying, leave me, leave me.  I want to go down with her.  Obviously, I'm here.  I'm safe.  I'm on dry land, and I'm I'm still going down with the ship.  So I just want to thank everybody for reaching out. ",
