            "text": "Hello, everyone.  Happy Wednesday.  I love you.  And I am sending you an even bigger hug today, wherever you are on the earth plane.  Wednesday, the day after the election, and what a freaking election this has turned out to be.  So many people are watching this, not only in the United States, but all over the world.  And what we are watching is systems that have been in place for a very long time being dismantled.  So I don't know about you, but I woke up this morning really frazzled, anxious, nervous, uncomfortable, right?  Waking up to the day after the election and not knowing who won is not normal, but none of this is normal.  None of what we are experiencing in 2020 is normal.  It's not designed to be.  It's designed to take us out of what we have been programmed to believe is normal.  The political system is breaking down.  It's designed to break down.  Because as we evolve into higher states of consciousness as a human collective, the systems that have been in place for a very long time that do not work, they have to be dismantled.  The dark has to be seen within these systems.  And unfortunately, we have to go through it and it doesn't feel good.  So when I sat down with my guides this morning to sort of settle in and say, what the freak is going on?  Here's what they said.  One, and I encourage you if this resonates with you to just allow these messages to be for you as well.  One, they said settle in.  Settle into your body.  Remember I said November is going to be very rocky like an earthquake and our bodies are going to be shaking a lot.  When we shake, when there's a lot going on externally, we move out of our bodies.  We feel like we don't have control.  We get anxious, scared, nervous.  So we want to settle back into our bodies where we're safe, where we're powerful, where we're sovereign.  We're empowered.  So settle in.  Number two, breathe, they said.  Just breathe for a moment, Lori.  And so I breathed.  And then they said, this is all good.  For the evolution of humanity.  We are ascending.  We cannot be pulled back into lower states of consciousness.  We cannot be pulled back into the old ways of how we have done things.  It's impossible.  And it may feel like a fight.  It may feel like a battle or a war.  But we can't go back, they said.  And so when you are evolving into higher states of consciousness, a human collective, you are going from a lower frequency to a higher frequency.  Our bodies are going from lower frequencies to higher frequencies.  The entire human collective is experiencing their reality moving from a lower frequency to a higher frequency, which means any paradigms and programs and systems that have been in place in these lower frequencies that we have been in for a very long time are going to be dismantled.  They're going to be shown to us.  The light is going to shine on them and we're going to say, holy cow, this is what's been going on for so long.  Oh my God.  Kind of like what we've been watching and we've been seeing unraveling, right?  And being torn apart and peeled away.  It has to happen so that we can say to ourselves, oh my God, this is part of a third dimensional matrix and a really low consciousness that I am now choosing to step out of so that I can evolve into higher states of consciousness and I can assist the human collective in evolving.  And it's not easy necessarily, right?  It doesn't always feel good, but it's exciting.  It's very, very exciting, but it can feel very shaky, right?  So we have to remember the bigger picture of what is going on.  This is all for the evolution of humanity and we cannot descend back into lower states of consciousness.  So anything that is going to unravel for us is always moving us into higher states of consciousness.  It's always the light that is pulling us.  It's the light that is winning over and over and over again.  This is what they said.  The light wins, Lori, and the dark will be seen.  The light wins, Lori, and the dark will be seen.  And we are seeing the dark in the United States political system.  We're seeing it.  The other thing they said is stay in integrity, stay in love, stay in trust and stay in knowingness.  It is our job.  It is our role to remember where we are going, to remember to feel into what feels like the highest good, what feels like light and what feels like dark.  And if you find yourself being pulled into storylines and narratives that are constricted, that are tight, that are fear-based, pay attention to how that feels in your body and refocus and realign to the higher timeline, which is that we shift into higher states of consciousness, which is that we are more light and more love and more compassion and more empathy.  That the old system, we do not move back to the old systems.  We are crumbling the old systems.  The old systems don't work any longer.  And anyone that comes into power in the United States.  that is part of the old system would only bring us back into an old system that we're dismantling.  It's how ascension works.  It's how the evolution of consciousness works.  And unfortunately, because we are in a third dimensional reality, in a third dimensional field, and it's physical in nature, It looks like what we're going through right now, an election where we are now standing here saying, who's our president?  I don't know.  Looks like there's a lot of corruption.  Looks like it might go to the Supreme Court.  Holy cow.  Right.  And we have massive divide.  Right.  Go watch the video yesterday that I did about divide and how this has been an opportunity for us to practice unity.  We are all evolving into higher states of consciousness.  It's just that many humans are dragging their feet because they are comfortable with the old ways.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Many of us are like, let's get going.  These new systems, these new ways are going to create more freedom and expansion and love.  Many people are still being manipulated by the media, right?  Many people are out of that system.  So we have to hold, if you can, and if it resonates with you, hold this bigger perspective, you guys.  The light wins and the dark will be seen and we got to go through it.  And the last thing they said is, where is your energy being pulled?  Where is your energy being pulled?  So I woke up this morning, checked my phone and it was like telling me all these different things and I freaked out.  My energy got pulled into those storylines and narratives.  And my guide said, do you want to be pulled there?  And I said, no, I don't want to be pulled there.  Okay.  Where do you want to be pulled?  Where do you want to put your attention?  Where do you want to put your focus?  Where do you want to put your energy and put it there?  So I encourage you today.  And the next couple of days, for however long this is going to last, where is your energy being pulled?  Do you want it to be pulled there?  Meaning where is your attention going?  And if you don't want your attention going there, focus on where you want your attention to go.  Focus on the highest timeline.  Trust you guys that the light wins, no matter what this looks like out there.  When I sat with my guides, all was chill.  All was good.  We've come too far in our evolution.  We've come too far in our frequency to allow anything to pull us back.  And yet we have to go through this and we have to feel it and we have to watch it.  So as you navigate your next nows, don't blame anyone else.  Don't yell at other people.  Don't belittle name call.  Let's try to refocus and look at this as a big human collective shift, not a Biden-Trump shift, right?  But a massive, huge human collective shift.  And the light within that shift is what pulls us.  And the dark within that shift is what gets dismantled, is what gets shown into the light and what gets alchemized.  And wherever humans stand in this massive large shift is where they stand right now.  But we're all doing this together and we get through it.  We get through this crazy election.  We get through it.  And we will not find ourselves in a system that we've been in for the last two, three, four, five hundred years and more.  We are breaking out of these.  And it's going to be a fight.  Right?  And it may be a battle.  But we're breaking out of the matrix.  That's why we're here.  And we have love, compassion, and empathy as we do it.  Love, compassion, and empathy for every human that's navigating this as we do this.  I love you.  Thank you for being here with me.  I don't know what's going to come, but I know the light wins and the dark will be seen.  Be gentle with yourself. ",
