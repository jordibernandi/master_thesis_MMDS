He's the Speaker of the Texas House.  When I went to vote at the Lake Jackson Civic Center, Bonnen accosted me and threatened me.  After voting, I went immediately to the police department to make a report.  Lake Jackson police investigated me like a suspect, asked invasive questions like whether I had a gun, and ultimately nothing was done.  It all finally caught up to Bonnen.  He's ending his legislative career after a massive scandal involving allegations of bribery.  City Manager Bill Yenny eventually told me that the police department would take John's complaint.  I have once again talked with the assistant chief.  My understanding is that Mr.  Gray will be coming in and making his statement, and a case will then be forwarded to the DA's office.  I interpreted this as the Lake Jackson Police Department getting his wife to file charges on John.  Yes, that's right, the city manager's wife is a district attorney.  By the way, Jerry Yenny refused to recuse herself during the Dennis Bonin scandal, and she refused to file criminal charges against him.  Lake Jackson police later took John's report of the alleged criminal offense.  They also provided a copy of Sergeant Necestra's body camera for $28.  The full body camera is available on the Extra Good Citizen channel, I put a link to it in the video description. ",
