I've been talking about Kat Kerr a lot lately.  She is a nutbag.  I don't know how else to put it.  She's a nutbag.  A nutbag extraordinaire, if you will.  So let's give this article a read, it's by Beth Stoneburner, and see what it has to say.  That is, when she's not explaining football in heaven.  Yeah, she's complete nutcase.  What's her excuse for being so wrong about a surefire landslide victory for Trump?  Turns out we all just misrepresented the meaning of landslide.  She put out a video about it, so I figured we'd pull it up and give it a watch. ",

In his mind, in their human mind, they already put together what they think that means.  Right.  Many times, as we know in the word or even just from experience ourselves, Especially as a prophet, that doesn't ever mean what man thinks it means.  And if you will go and check out and see how a landslide starts, it starts with a few stones.  Usually the smaller ones start first.  and then that causes the land to move beneath the rest of them, and then eventually nothing can stop that landslide from taking place.  That is actually what's going to happen. ",

I thought as a Christian prophetess, it was her job to take what God says and put it in words that we can understand and interpret clearly.  I guess her job is to just take the words that God says, whether they're going to be misunderstood or not, and throw them at us.  This chick is completely outrageous, not just for this.

Just like the landslide thing where we thought you meant it'll blow it out of the water, but you actually meant barely win?  He didn't even barely win.  He didn't win at all.  Is this one of those things?  He's going to fully expose.  Does fully expose mean not expose in any way, shape or form?

I know actually what that does mean, that those who have been perpetrating the lie, they've been paid to commit lies or stealing or cheating will begin to get very nervous.  They're actually already nervous.  And let me tell you, conviction is going to come upon some of them. ",

            "text": "Okay.  So when she says landslide, I guess what she's saying is it's going to look like a small victory at first, and then it's going to turn into a big victory.  That's my interpretation of it, right?  Well, first of all, he didn't win at all.  It was a landslide in Joe Biden's favor.  And let me justify that.  I know that it looked really, really close on election night.  That was the result of something called the Red Mirage.  That was predicted and expected.  Bernie Sanders described the Red Mirage in great detail before the election happened, and then it played out exactly as he predicted.  Mail-in votes in many states, excluding Arizona, interestingly enough, were counted last.  And Trump spent the entire lead up to the election demonizing mail-in voting.  So all of his supporters were going to be voting in person, basically.  Like, almost all of them, right?  Well, it turns out about 30% of the mail-in votes went to Trump and 70% to Biden.  And it was roughly, give or take, reversed for in-person voting.  Trump took about 70% of in-person.  Biden took about 30%.  And that means since in-person votes are counted first, It looked like Donald Trump was winning, even though he wasn't.  Biden didn't flip any states.  He didn't flip Michigan.  He didn't flip Georgia or Pennsylvania.  He had a lead to begin with.  It just wasn't reflected in the data because of how we counted the votes.  He never flipped any states.  He always had those states.  The point is... If you believe that Trump won against Hillary in an electoral landslide, then you also necessarily believe that Biden won against Trump in an electoral landslide, because they had almost, so far, the exact same electoral victory.  Trump's victory against Hillary was around 300 to 306, I think.  That's what it looks like Biden's electoral victory is going to be at the end of this too.  300 to 306, somewhere in there.  Aside from that fact, Biden won the popular vote by 4 million votes, give or take.  That sounds like a Biden landslide.  There is no way to reverse this for Trump, as far as I can tell.  Let me tell you Trump's strategy in life.  Somebody tells him no.  And then he throws himself on the floor and screams and knocks over every shelf until they either begrudgingly say fine or refuse to deal with him ever again for the rest of their lives.  That's his negotiation strategy.  Scream and knock things over and cry and throw a tantrum until you get what you want.  I don't think that that's going to work in this case, but it is risky.  He might be able to flip one single state by doing that.  He might be able to flip Pennsylvania.  That's a possibility.  If he throws himself on the ground and screams enough... maybe.  But he wouldn't just have to take Pennsylvania to win this.  It was an electoral landslide for Biden.  He would have to take Pennsylvania and at least one or two other states.  It looks like Georgia is entering recount territory, but Biden most likely won there too.  Trump would have to flip Pennsylvania and Georgia and Nevada or Arizona.  Trump has a very slim chance of being able to take things over.  We'll see what happens as time goes on, but this is an uphill battle for Trump.  None of his claims have any level of validity anyways.  I have investigated the popular fraud claims going around right now. ",
