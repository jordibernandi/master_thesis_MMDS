How about a 500 foot wooden boat built by eight unskilled people of course.  14,000 individual animals, so one of each sex, one boy, one girl from 7,000 different kinds of animal, and a 4,000 mile bridge that somehow nobody can find any evidence of.  Let's talk about Noah's Ark.  Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Playing a Blinder with me, the Creaky Blinder.  Now today's video I came across purely by accident.  It's on the Answers in Genesis channel on YouTube and this particular video, for some strange reason, has the comments turned off.  I can't possibly imagine why.  But anyway, let's get straight into the video and we'll talk about it.  Tidy! ",

And before we go any further into the video, if you are religious, this isn't me having a pop at you personally.  This is for entertainment.  Do not take it personally.  This is my opinion and I happen to think that the whole concept of a 500 foot wooden boat saving all of humanity is completely ridiculous.  So if we look at this from the perspective of a religious person, which I am not, but that's what we're going to do.  What do they do when the observations they make in what they consider to be God's world contradict what they've read in the Bible?  Well, Christians have basically got three options.  One, they're going to completely abandon their faith in the Bible 100% in order to be able to accept the scientific evidence presented to them.  Option two, they can completely deny the scientific evidence because it goes so badly against what the Bible is telling them.  Or number three, they can reconsider their own interpretation of what they've read in the Bible. ",

Because seriously, he could have went somewhere else where the flood was not going to happen.  That seems like a lot of energy, a lot of time and effort wasted when he could have just went to wherever the flood was not going to occur.  Why did God send animals and birds to the ark?  Because again, he could have just sent them somewhere else.  I mean, a year-long survival cruise was probably very stressful to the animals and hard.  And it wasn't necessary if it was a local flood.  They could have just went elsewhere and been okay.  But my third reason for having a really hard time with a local flood and not believing a local flood is remember, after the flood, God sent a rainbow, right?  He put a rainbow in the sky and said, this is my promise.  I will never do this again. ",

But it's making me have a lot of peculiar thoughts.  Forget about the flood just for a second.  Go back a little bit further.  Adam and Eve.  Some say they were brother and sister.  Some say no.  God just created one man.  One woman.  And they played hide the hot dog.  And they had children.  So.  What.  so can you see what i'm going with this?  so that would mean that the entirety of mankind came from incest or something worse.  because if the let's assume that adam and eve had one son and one daughter did they you know bump uglies or did adam?  it doesn't even bear thinking about.  But anyway, let's get back to the flood.  But let's examine this.  Forget everything you think you know about the Bible.  Forget everything you think you know.  If I was sitting here now and telling you that eight people, Noah and the rest of his family, built a 500 foot long wooden ship and took two of every animal in existence aboard and set sail out onto the sea.  Would you believe me?  No, you probably wouldn't.  Because if you break it down to a simplest terms, let's say for argument's sake, the first thing that came into my head, how did he feed all these animals for 371 days?  How did he prevent the tigers or other predatory animals from eating their prey?  Like, for example, if he had two tigers on board, I'd like to assume that he had two gazelle.  Do tigers eat gazelle?  something smaller than a tiger aboard as well.  How did Noah and the seven other members of his family stop the animals from eating each other?  What did they drink? ",

So that one family were responsible for restarting mankind as we know it.  So the sons and their wives made babies.
