            "text": "Hello and welcome back to redirecting.  Well, our son Aliyah just shared some terribly bad news with us.  It's really interesting because we were just talking about this fella.  literally last week and when we were talking about him Malaya was like well I'm glad he's looking better these days because some time ago I would say a few months ago we saw some images circulating of Chadwick Boseman and he looked very very ill in the picture.  nothing was said about him being sick at that time and I hadn't been hearing any news buzzing about him being sick either but he was looking very very thin now.  as you all know he was one of the stars of the film the Black Panthers.  okay But anyway, my son just shared the news with us that he just passed away at age 43.  And apparently he had cancer.  He had colon cancer.  He's a young man.  He's only 43.  Only 43.  And so this is very sad news to share with you all this day.  My son, he said, it almost feels like a family member died.  He was such a good dude.  Those are the words of Aliyah.  Now, some people deal with death differently.  Some people don't care because they didn't know the person.  But it's okay to have a heart towards someone that you don't know.  feel some kind of way about their death.  that is okay.  you have have those who are just so stone-cold.  they feel absolutely nothing you see.  and so I just wanted to talk about this because it was very very sad news to receive very sad news indeed.  he's only 43 years old.  he was a young man.  this helps you to have an appreciation for life or it should.  It should help you to see that in this day and age we should be very appreciative of every day that we get because tomorrow is not promised.  Tomorrow is not promised.  And those of you who think it is or believe that tomorrow is just a guarantee for you, think again.  There is no guarantees.  You see, we should be grateful every day that we are allowed to wake up.  Some people just can't even wrap their minds around the fact that their life is not their own.  The breath that you breathe is not your own.  This is why you can be cut off.  This is why your breath can be cut off and your life can end, you see.  So I'm grateful.  I don't know what anyone else feels or how anyone else thinks, but I am grateful that the Most High gives me the opportunity to wake up another day.  I start my day off by telling him thank you and saying that this is the day that the Most High has made, that Yah has made.  I will rejoice.  And be glad in this day because this is a day that is made.  I'm so happy and thankful to the Most High for another day.  But again, this is just a reminder, even though it's bad news that we are sharing, this is a reminder that tomorrow is not promised and that you should live each day as though it were your last, even if you don't have an illness like Chadwick had, okay?  He was sick with colon cancer, in which I didn't know that.  Some of you may have already known that.  But even if you're not sick, And death doesn't just show up because you have an illness.  I've heard stories of people just dropping dead who appear to be perfectly healthy, you see.  So keep that in mind.  Be grateful.  Be thankful.  And I would say some of you are not going to agree with this either, but serve the most high with gladness.  This is what we should all be doing.  He is our creator.  Whether we like it or not, he is our creator.  Okay, family, sorry to share this very sad news, but with that, I am out. ",
