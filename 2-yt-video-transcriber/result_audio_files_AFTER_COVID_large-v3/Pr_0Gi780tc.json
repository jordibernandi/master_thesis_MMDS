Why is it that we can get mad about swimsuit contests and child beauty pageants?  But the second we say, hey, maybe we shouldn't have things like drag queens read to five-year-olds, the radical left calls us all transphobic and says we are oppressing an underprivileged class.  Perfect defense, by the way.  Now it's a social taboo to criticize that behavior.  Just one question, though.  What's the problem with waiting to discuss these things until middle school or preferably high school?  Why do kids need to know about this stuff at five years old or younger?  Why is pointing that out so offensive?  For those of you who don't know, this is Jubilee, a left-leaning YouTube channel that often focuses on open conversations with disagreeing parties.  Under normal circumstances, that's a good thing, but this video was done in poor taste.  The premise of the video is that they have one person argue in favor of polyamory, and one person argue in favor of monogamy.  At the end, the kids pick which one they like better.  Our polyamorous contender is Michelle, and our monogamous contender is Evan.  They talk to three kids, Xiaowan who is 5, Nya who is 10, and Tai who is 12.  Tai kinda steals the show here and makes the video watchable, but essentially, polyamory is such a bad idea for a healthy relationship that this chick Michelle gets roasted by little kids on her ideas.

Doing an activity that could possibly create a child is not the same thing as inviting a friend to the swing set, unless that trip to the swing set involves the possibility of an 18-year commitment.  Nuance is important.  But more importantly, Michelle literally just described the breakdown of a relationship.  This is the problem with hedonism that the devout followers, like Michelle, don't understand.  The purpose of relationships, the purpose of friendships, and the purpose of a community is to get stuff done.  You cannot get stuff done with people who behave irresponsibly.  If you are in a community, you want to do things like make sure everyone's fed, make sure everyone has shelter, and make sure everyone has purpose.  With your friends, you want to have people you can test ideas with.  You want to have people who will pull you away from making stupid decisions.  You want to have people who can support you when bad things happen.  And as for marriages and sexual relationships, they are about kids.  You are either in the process of making or taking care of kids, or you are practicing communication skills.  so when you get to that point, your relationship doesn't break down.  There is always a job to do.  Sure, you can have fun with these people and you can enjoy the time you spend with them, but basing your close relationships purely on enjoyment is a bad idea.  Picking close friends based only on leisure activities that you do with them instead of picking friends who can uphold responsibilities is like getting married to someone purely because you like having sex with them.  In that case, don't be surprised if those people falter the minute responsibility is put onto them.  especially if you're going around doing things that you admit piss them off.  Michelle admitted that polyamory causes jealousy, which is destructive to a relationship.  Now imagine a kid is involved.  Michelle, a 10-year-old girl, understands this better than you do.  Okay, so let's move on to Ty.  Ty is 12 years old, and he is pretty much the star of the show.  Let's watch him poke holes in Michelle's argument. ",

If I had a kid, I would make sure it was only with one partner.  Congratulations, you are monogamous, except successful relationships are difficult and you can't just magically decide that you are going to have a good relationship.  You have none of the skills that make a good monogamous relationship possible because you have zero practice at monogamy.  Michelle mentions that a healthy alternative response to disinterest in a partner is to follow your heart and find a new partner who you are more interested in.  How do you think that's going to go when a newborn child starts putting stress on the relationship?  Sure, you may be able to control your desires, but what if he decides to follow his bliss and move on to another partner?  Congratulations, you're a single mother now.

Feminism destroyed traditional gender roles by convincing women that gender roles were sexist and oppressive.  Gender roles previously divided up labor in a way that allowed both husband and wife to specialize in their role, which made them far more efficient at their jobs.  This allowed the husband spare time to advance in his career so that he could eventually generate more income than two working parents together because his skill was more valuable.  It also allowed the wife to stay home, raise the kids, and get all the stressful house labor done so that by the end of the day, everyone has time to relax.  This is a much more successful model than the two working parents model.  And it doesn't matter which parent fills what role as long as one stays home and one goes to work.  But now, because both parents work, housework doesn't get done because it's seen as trivial or sexist and the kids are raised by strangers.  This causes both parents to fight over nonsense like who is supposed to do the dishes and it causes the kids to act out more because they have to go to a crappy daycare while their parents are working instead of being at home.  All of this causes lots of fighting and lots of misery which causes the relationship to break down.  then feminists gave women all kinds of incentives to break off their relationships with their husbands.  you get child support you get alimony and you are automatically assumed by the courts to be the better parent so you get more time with the children by default.  Last, feminists promoted free love, sexual promiscuity, and, dare I say, polyamorous open relationships that destroy your ability to pair bond with a single partner.  So, that's why divorce is so high.  Evan, as someone who is trying to have a successful monogamous relationship, you should maybe know why so many of them are failing. ",

            "text": "Now for this last part, I thought I might point something out, because a lot of people ask me to make more videos on how to read people.  A problem with that, though, is when I go over reading techniques, a lot of them are subtle, so people don't catch them, then I get a bunch of nasty comments saying, you can't possibly know that just from someone's voice, you don't know them!  Maybe some of that's my fault, though, because I don't go slow enough or show enough examples so that everyone can learn for themselves.  So before I talk about this, everyone understand that people follow extremely predictable patterns.  That being said, all I've been doing for about the past 10 years is listening to crazy people and then listening to their healthy counterparts.  The way people present themselves, the way people use their voices, and the words people use all matter, and those things tell you what pattern that person is following.  When I see someone like Michelle, I don't need to do research on her to figure out that her life is messed up.  I mean, I did do research on her for the sake of the video and found out that she's an artist with no social media following or any signs of wealth, which means she's broke.  So I did that for the sake of the video, but I didn't have to do that to figure out what pattern she's following.  Nor did I have to listen to her terrible arguments about her toxic relationship strategy to guess with a ton of certainty that her life isn't going well.  I can tell you her life isn't going well just by the way she presents herself.  She has a nose ring and a lot of tattoos that are visible on her right arm.  People who have untreated childhood trauma or had bad childhoods wear certain uniforms.  Kind of like how you can almost be certain a woman is a feminist if she's dyed her hair purple or red.  People who are victims of childhood trauma often get lots of tattoos.  They'll often pierce their nose, they'll pierce their tongues, they'll pierce their nipples, they'll pierce other places.  Lots of tattoos and piercings are a sign of being an untreated victim of bad parenting.  Now listen carefully.  I am not saying that everyone who has ever gotten a tattoo was abused as a kid.  I am also not saying that a person who got a tattoo in the past, treated their childhood trauma but kept the tattoo, is still mentally unhealthy.  I am not saying either of those things.  I am speaking in general terms, and generally it is the case that people who get lots of tattoos and get lots of piercings aren't mentally healthy.  I have seen it over and over and over again, and just to drive this point home, I have two videos coming out soon with women who are wearing the exact same uniform as Michelle, and their lives are a mess.  It is very important that you are able to notice these kinds of things because if you engage in relationships with people who are mentally unhealthy or you take advice from those people, your life will be a mess just like theirs.  I assure you that if you don't get good at identifying these people, they will ruin years of your life.  Not only that, but engaging and supporting unhealthy people keeps them from wanting to get treatment.  The faster you shut them out of your life, the more rejection they get, the faster they get better.  It's a win-win situation for both of you.
