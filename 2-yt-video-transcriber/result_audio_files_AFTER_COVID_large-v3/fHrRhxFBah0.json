            "text": "My turn, Yu-Gi-Boy.  I knew you would, Yu-Gi-Boy.  Yu-Gi-Boy.  Yu-Gi-Boy.  Whatever you say, Yu-Gi-Boy.  Yu-Gi-Boy.  Yu-Gi-Boy.  Yu-Gi-Boy.  So welcome back to another video delving into another fascist sub community.  These aren't the only videos I make on this channel, but you guys currently seem to like these ones.  So I'm going to keep making them just for this week, maybe into next week as well.  And before we get any further, a lot of the times people just see the thumbnail and see the title and they click the video and they're like, We aren't all like that.  You know, not all bronies are this way.  Not all furries are this way.  Not all pagans are fascists.  Yes, I know that.  I always say that in my video.  Please watch just a bit.  And what I'm trying to do more is show both sides.  But just like with those videos, of course, I am not saying all people who watch anime... are some sort of Nazis or fascists or they're on the alt-right, because that is simply not true.  And we're going to talk about demographics and all that stuff later on in the video.  But yes, as someone who watched anime growing up as a child, watching anime does not make you a bad person.  Watching anime does not even define your personality.  But for the purpose of this video, we are going to look at the links between anime subculture and the alt-right.  Now, as usual, before I get into the meat of this video, every type of video like this I make is demonetized.  I'm trying to go full time with this YouTube thing while I've got the time to make these videos.  So if you feel generous and want to financially contribute to my work, please check out my Patreon.

And if you want to follow me on social media at TheCabernacle on all social medias.  So like I said there, I watched anime as a child, mainly Beyblade, Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon, obviously the English dubs that were on during the time.  You know, Pokemon I remember watching as a very young kid, about maybe five or six years old, whereas Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade, maybe a bit older, you know, seven to ten, always liked them, always extremely over the top.  As an adult, I don't like anime.  I don't watch anime.  I don't actually watch much TV or films because I'm really, really picky.  So I'm not going to waste my time on like a thousand episode anime like One Piece.  I also don't often find the stories that intriguing anyway.  But I do appreciate them for the aesthetic value.  Blade Runner did a really cool anime before Blade Runner 2049 came out.  Apparently there's an anime series that might be in development as well.  So I would check something like that out.  But yes... Watched anime, don't watch anime, and I don't judge people who watch anime.  So now let's get into what I want to talk about.  You sometimes write your opinion on Twitter and then get a response from a profile with an anime profile picture.  But then it turns out they're spouting off some of the most toxic stuff online.  A lot of times these profile pictures are like the anime girls and there is actually a sort of name for this.  in that the girls are called Moes in anime.  So a Moe is an archetype as well as a genre unto itself.  Broadly defined, Moe means young girls doing cute stuff, attending school, crashing on boys, pouting and being clumsy.  If there's a single word you could use to describe most Moe archetypes other than cute, it's passive.  So yeah, you got these cute anime profile pictures.  So the article from The Ringer goes on to say, Moe trolls themselves are hardly passive.  They brand themselves with character art from World War II themed anime series such as Girls Under Panzer or Barbarossa or adored more run-of-the-mill moe imagery with swastikas or Make America Great Again caps.  So it is a bit of a shock often to see these profiles with some of the most like innocent looking anime girls or sometimes sexualized anime girls who then start talking about, you know, white replacement and white genocide and all this stuff.  I actually got exposed to this years and years ago in like 2015 when I used to write for my university's politics paper.  But where does this weird phenomenon come from?  Of course, like most things like this, 4chan is the answer.  But interestingly enough, it actually has links to the origins of 4chan, not just some weird crossover event like the brony stuff.  So Ryan Rodrick at BuzzFeed did a good article about four years ago saying, here's why there's an anime fan art of President Trump all over your Facebook.  But it goes in to talk about the origins of this cultural stuff.  So I'm going to read some of that for you now.  So the Netu Yuyoku, which is like the Japanese alt-right movement, started on a website called Ni-chanuru, 2-channel or 2-chan, which was a popular message board that was launched in 1999 by Hiroyuki Nishimura while he was studying at the University of Central Arkansas.  It wasn't a typical message board.  It was anonymous so people could say anything they wanted.  and threads would disappear after a short period of time, forcing people to comment as quickly as possible.  Two channels started off as a place to talk about anime and video games, but it quickly grew into an early incubator for what would become a full-blown internet subculture.  Around 2003, Japan started importing a lot of South Korean TV dramas and pop groups, and it was called the Korean Wave, and the Japanese media jumped on the trend.  and this disillusioned Japanese nationalists who went to 2channel to vent their anger.  So with the intrusion in their view of Korean media of course things like anime become something to be more proud of because it's Japanese and Japanese nationalists love stuff that I guess brings more fame and success to Japan.  But now here the links are already starting to show with contemporary alt-right stuff in the West.  So this wasn't destined to remain a solely Japanese phenomenon.  2chan and the Neto Yoku's influence outside the country started to fairly innocuously in 2003.  Then Christopher Paul, then a 15 year old high school student in New York, created his own version of 2chan.  He set up an anonymous message board for people to talk about Japanese anime and comic books and called it 4chan.  Nishimura lost control of 2chan in 2014 and Paul ran 4chan until 2015 and Nishiruma actually bought 2chan.  4chan off pool which means the two biggest hives of a non-online nationalism in japan the west were owned by the same guy.  so if you want a more deep dive into why the western alt-right love japan i've actually made a video on that.  i've also made a video about western weebs as well and how they sanitize japan's far-right nationalism.  but go check those out if you want that sort of stuff.  In those sort of videos, I talk about the Western admiration for Japan, but Richard Spencer, the probably most famous alt-right Nazi in the West, especially in America, actually thinks anime can be useful, and he says, I've always admired Japan and found it a fascinating place, but aesthetics of the alt-right, I would say, could involve anime.  And he has previously seen it as a recruitment tool, and he says, you want to, like, reach people whose minds haven't ossified yet, And I think that Alt-Right is doing that in a crazy way through meme culture.  In a sense, like a kid who's 22 and just graduated from college and is working at Starbucks.  And he's kind of alienated and he doesn't quite know why.  You can reach him through a meme, whereas you're not going to reach him through a book about traditionalism.  So that is a pretty interesting link that a massive backlash to Korean culture coming into Japan by these nationalists really, really drove this culture on 2chan, which was originally established to talk about anime, as was 4chan.  But like the article says, and as we know, both have become hotbeds of nationalism.  So with that in mind, it's not surprising that a lot of anime fans that you meet online, toxic anime fans, do have alt-right slash nationalist leanings.  But let's get into, I guess, the demographics and what sort of people join the alt-right who are from anime subcultures or just what kind of people watch anime which make the community like furries and bronies.  more susceptible than others to alt-right recruitment.  So in the same article, Lauren Orsini talked about the type of people who watch anime, and she said, there's a massive overlap between anime fans and the kind of people who never leave their computers, and there's almost a big overlap between anime fans and the people who spend a lot of time online.  Lauren wrote her own article responding to just this select use of a quote from her going more into the demographics, which I think is really, really interesting.  And I wouldn't really take that as an insult anyway.  You know, in the internet age, I'm thinking about myself as well.  Spend most of our times on our computers, on digital devices, and even someone like me who doesn't consider myself, you know, a massive internet nerd or anything.  I do spend quite a lot of time on social media and things like Reddit as well.  So for otakujournalist.com she wrote, So there's already a stereotype that most anime fans are men.  And there's a quote that I've never met a female anime fan in real life.  But... Lauren says here, for me this is a surprising statement since my anime fan history is overwhelmingly female.  The anime club at her university was majority women.  But she said it's difficult to find anime fandom demographics so she had to conduct her own study in 2015.  She requested demographic data from North America's 10 largest conventions, anime conventions.  And six responded, and at all of them, women made up about 50% of attendance.  And that's not really surprising, but this is an interesting caveat.  On the other hand, here's a survey of Reddit's r slash anime community conducted in 2014.  Only 7% of anime fans in that forum are female.  In other words, what the data I collected really tells us is that when it comes to in-person anime gatherings, women are better represented.  She also goes on to make an interesting point that you have to be fairly tech savvy to watch anime, especially back in the day where English dubs weren't always available or you just could not access the Japanese material as much.  But I don't find it hard to believe that in general anime has a fan base that might have a 50-50 split or might just lean slightly more male but the more fanatical fans who gather online are majority male and that's just not surprising about the internet in general.  and then you think about things like 2chan and 4chan and how nationalism does appeal mainly to men.  then it isn't surprising that you get these Moe-type people on Twitter swarming your mentions and swarming any political take with their far-right nationalism.  And just as I'm trying to give both sides a bit more, Lauren goes on to say, I don't think the idea of anime fans as majority alt-right radicals is an accurate one.  Neither do I, if it needs to be said any further.  But my community doesn't make up the majority either, not even close.  There are around 20 million anime fans in America alone.  And it's impossible to discuss such a massive number as one with common views and beliefs other than, of course, liking anime.  So in general, I feel like the hardcore subculture online is the one that has the problem with, you know, the alt-right and everything.  But something we haven't spoken about yet is the actual anime itself.  So anime is obviously primarily made in Japan by Japanese creators and by Japanese writers.  Now, of course, I've made videos about why the alt-right love Japan and I've discussed Japanese politics a lot.  Japanese politics is pretty diverse in some ways but it's slant of nationalism and far-right nationalism at the moment is pretty dominant.  The same nationalist party in power for most of the post-war years and something that has become pretty common in the last 30 years in Japan is the far right dominating most things, for example, like education.  They're super touchy on things like the rape of Nanjing, and they, of course, deny it a lot of times.  They don't get taught about it in history in Japan because of them rewriting the history books.  And as I've discussed multiple times, Japan, unlike Germany, did not undergo a program where children and just general people were forced to reconcile with the war.  Luckily for them, that Chiang Kai-shek's China was an ally of America.  So the hostility after the war really had to end because they are both American friends.  But then the Communist Party, when they took power, revived all this real hostility against Japan and talked about all these war crimes.  the Japanese did in China and this started with Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s because before Mao didn't want to talk about this stuff because he thought it was embarrassing to China.  and then of course you have all the stuff with Korea and you know the Korean comfort woman and all the stuff the Japanese did there.  but what happened?  a lot of the time?  the Japanese war criminals who oversaw this stuff were let off the hook by the americans and a lot of them entered politics with numerous war criminals becoming prime ministers.  so at large it's a country that hasn't really reconciled with its treatment of its asian neighbors and hasn't really reconciled with just how awful they acted during the second world war and the second sino-japanese war.  so weirdly there are numerous animes that actually ate You know, Nazi Germany's aesthetic.  You have that Panzer one I was talking about.  But then a lot of animes have them all dressed up in very Nazi looking uniforms.  But the one I want to talk about in this video is Attack on Titan.  I haven't watched Attack on Titan.  So I'm going to read this out and talk about what this Polygon writer is saying.  But what I decided is I'm not going to read out their analysis of the show.  I'm going to read out the analysis of of the creator who made the show and his politics.  So the author and creator of Attack on Titan is Hajime Isayama.  So what he said about the manga and the show is problematic.  So in a 2010 blog post, Isayama, who has always maintained the series was inspired by an incident where he was accosted by a large drunk foreign man at a cafe.  admitted that a supporting character, Wily General Pixis, was based on the real-life Japanese general, Akayama Yushifuru, who served in the Japanese Imperial Army from 1916 to 1923.  He's considered a hero in Japan, with Isayama admitting he found the general an admirable figure for his actions in the first Sino-Japanese war.  But this general was also responsible for countless atrocities against Korea and China during the war.  So with the stuff I've been talking about and the revisionist Japanese history, we tend to talk about the Second Sino-Japanese War which merged into World War II, but this general is responsible for these things during the First Sino-Japanese War, so just some context that sort of stuff.  So the anti-Korean atrocities included in this war, the murder of then Empress Myung Se-yong, rioting and the massacring of thousands of Koreans living in Kanto after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, and the notorious Comfort Woman, A euphemism for the hundreds of thousands of Korean women and girls who were kidnapped and used as sex slaves by the Japanese army.  So maybe that could be a one-off.  And maybe you could say this guy's maybe been brainwashed by the country he lives in.  Look at all the generals and presidents.  The Americans idealized who were awful people.  But with all this stuff in mind, so after he revealed this genre as an inspiration, he got into a Twitter flame war where he appeared to deny the notorious Nanjing Massacre, which got him a lot of death threats from Koreans.  And then China have also banned Attack on Titan outright.  So what I'm not trying to say with bringing up this stuff about Attack on Titan... is that all creators of anime must somehow have far-right leanings because they're from Japan.  Some of my favourite creators are from Japan.  Hideo Kojima is one of my favourite video game directors.  Clearly not a far-right nationalist.  In fact, he's the complete opposite.  And I'm sure anime has lots of people just like Kojima.  That's just someone I have a good reference point and Kojima is of course a big anime fan himself.  but what I'm trying to say with this is that when you have certain animes like Attack on Titan include people like this general and the creator says it's based on him and then goes on to maybe deny you know, one of the worst atrocities the Japanese committed in the second Sino-Japanese War.  That is maybe when you can start to become a bit more suspicious of the source material and of the anime.  The article is actually good in that it goes on to talk about the actual show and why it's problematic with its depictions of nationalism and fascism and how it really apes a lot of far-right talking points.  But I decided I'm not going to talk about that because I haven't watched the show and that wouldn't be my own words it would be someone else's.  but if you guys want to enlighten me on if attack on titan is problematic as a whole for this sort of stuff please let me know in the comments.  so in conclusion i guess the short answer of why you get so many anime fans being neo-nazis and part of the alt-right is because the cesspools 2chan and 4chan were founded to discuss anime and only grew into sites of just mainly and most infamously talking about nationalist politics.  But I think the interesting caveat is that 4chan originated in japan and it originated after this massive backlash on 2chan against korean media which was fueled by nationalists no doubt obviously talking about how their culture was better how their cartoons were better how their anime is better than Korean anime.  So in theory it becomes a point of pride for Japanese nationalists about how, you know, well respected this anime is.  But on the flip side of that, some of them may be attracted to the source material because of the outright fascist depictions in them.  It's also problematic.  such a well-known and famous piece of media like Attack on Titan Does have this problematic creator and of course like many other sub communities Whether that is the bronies furries or other people like that most anime fans online are men and it's safe to say hardcore anime fans are browsing.  4chan might be a prime target for the alt-right and like Richard Spencer says the aesthetics the memes are very appealing to a target demographic for him.  so he feels it's positive to use.  and in this video I've tried to stay away from the other points I made in my other two videos.  but if you feel like I haven't elaborated enough on some of this stuff please please go check out my videos.  why the alt-right love Japan and I think the other one is called how weebs sanitized Japan's far-right nationalism or something like that.  But anyway, let me know what you guys think in the comments.  I would like some feedback on this, specifically on the animes like that Panzer one or Attack on Titan.
