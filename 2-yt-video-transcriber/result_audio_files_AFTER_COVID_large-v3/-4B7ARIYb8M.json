In his drive to stick it to critics and the media, he tweeted a video montage, including our own Rachel Maddow, predicting a weak jobs report.  NEARLY 5 MILLION AMERICANS GETTING BACK TO WORK IS MOST DEFINITELY GOOD NEWS.  BUT AS THE LINCOLN PROJECT REMINDED THE PRESIDENT ON TWITTER, THAT'S LIKE DROPPING $20 ON THE FLOOR AND THEN PICKING IT UP AGAIN.  THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOB DURING THE PANDEMIC.  THIS IS THE WORST SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.  Nearly 50 million of them were fortunate enough to file for unemployment benefits, although the extra $600 some of them have been receiving every week will end at the end of this month.  Senate Democrats are now fighting to get an extension for the enhanced unemployment benefits, but Mitch McConnell and team have already declared that idea dead on arrival.  Do you know who's not worried about paying their rent or making ends meet with no job or having to shut down a small business for good?  Wall Street.  U.S.  Fox just posted their best quarter in more than 20 years.  Let's talk about that and more.  Joining me now, Jelani Cobb, MSNBC political analyst and staff writer for The New Yorker and my friend.  Anand Jahardis, visiting scholar at NYU and author of an amazing book, Winner Take All, The Elite Charade of the Changing World.  I love your book.  Bishop William Barber, my longtime friend, co-chairman of the Poor People's Campaign and author of We Are Called to Be a Movement, another very timely book.  Thank you, guests, for being here.  And Jelani, I'm going to go straight to you.  One thing I find interesting about the labor stats that get reported, until recently they mostly reflected white America.  Again, just now they've started reflecting the ethnic breakdown of some of these numbers.  So if you could talk us through what the job reports really means and what does the economic outlook look like for the black and brown communities across this country? ",

And the conversation that you heard then, the case that was being made from the Trump campaign, the Trump administration, was that this was the lowest unemployment that African-Americans had seen in decades.  And it went on and went on and went on about that.  But just like everything else with the pandemic, where the pandemic exacerbated fault lines that were already there, if you cared to pay enough attention to actually see them, what they didn't say in that was that black unemployment could have a historic low and still be about 33 percent higher than white unemployment.  And so what you've seen is simply that disparity be magnified.  So now we're talking about unemployment that is about 50 percent higher.  And so in the best of times, that gap shrinks down to about a third higher.  We often see black unemployment as much as double what white unemployment is, particularly in particular categories.  And so that's not.  shocking.  That's not news to anyone who's actually been paying attention to this, but it is kind of pointing to something that's much more difficult to hide now. ",

I found an interesting tweet that you sent this week where you essentially said the people who led us into this mess will not lead us out of it.

And I don't think anybody except oligarchs can afford to go back to where America was before, because America wasn't working for most people before the pandemic either.  You know, on this July 4th and all July 4th, if you want to understand what's happening in the economy, look at what's happening on race.  Right.  So Mount Rushmore yesterday, the president is engaging in this age old game, which is selling white people money.  the hooch of supremacy in the hope of getting them drunk so they don't notice that he is stealing their stuff and the stuff of black people and the stuff of all people except oligarchs who are doing the stealing.  And what we've seen is a rhetoric of recovery, of paycheck protection, of this and that, masking the reality that in this crisis, as often happens in crisis, the powerful have rushed in to commandeer the benefits of crisis.  We saw it when Ruth's Chris, as you reported, got the paycheck protection money.  We see it now with Black Lives Matter and a bunch of companies in America putting on, frankly, corporate blackface while refusing to pay black people more, hire more black people, actually change any of the tax avoidance they do.  that hurts marginalized people disproportionately.  And we see it in the return to these economic reinvention committees.  of Eric Schmidt, Bill Gates, billionaires being brought in to reinvent the plutocratic America that has left us so vulnerable as a host to this virus.

It's not a matter of Democrats or Republicans.  All of us have to do that.  If you listen to our political debates, you don't hear the word poverty.  I wish even as we were talking about In the midst of what must be done on July 4th is race and poverty.  It's not is it race or poverty, it's race and poverty.  We must talk about reconstruction.  When Trump gives this lie, it's the very reason 168 clergy are saying that like Frederick Douglass did 168 years ago, we must expose the hypocrisy.  that we have.  40% of people who make over $40,000 and under will lose their jobs in the midst of this pandemic.  Millions more will become poor on top of the already 140 million poor.  We have still not provided essential workers the essentials that they need living wages sick leave decent unemployment rent protection ensuring that their utilities can't be cut off.  these are the realities so you can talk about as you said you know a few jobs he's claiming that have been recovered but the economy is far from recovered and there were people in in in trouble before the pandemic.  700 people were dying a day before the pandemic.  And what Trump has done and his allies, McConnell, has engaged in an unholy rebellion, revisionist history against God and ordained\u2014God-ordained justice, and has fundamentally undermined voter protection, policies to lift up the poor.  He undermines health care.  He undermines immigrant justice.  And we must transform from that.  And I agree with my friend.  It's not about going back to normal.  Normal was already a struggle.  we must go to reconstruction, a third reconstruction in this nation. ",

I'm going to go back to you, Jelani, because as Bishop Barber just highlighted, this pandemic really just punctuated the inequality that a lot of community of color have known for a long time.  So to his point, I mean, he's really talking about it's not just race, but it is race and the economics of it.  So there are a lot of disenfranchised white people in this country as well.  However, I think when you look at the political landscape, some people in that community tend to be MAGA voters.

And yet here I am making another futile attempt to say something insightful after he has pretty much wrapped up the whole thing.  But I will say this.  I think that there's a real need to look at the populism of what Donald Trump said he would do in 2016 and where we are in 2020.  And some of this is explicitly racial.  And Reverend Barber is right.  Some of this is about class exploitation.  and people becoming cognizant.  And so, especially the best person to talk to about this is actually Reverend Barber and what they've been doing with the Poor People's Movement and how people have been organizing across the country to create a kind of counter-populism.  We've seen this in American history.  It's not simply George Wallace as the legacy of populism, but Henry Wallace, who was the progressive populist who brought in people of color, who wanted to fight against racism, who saw the... the mutual concerns between poor black people and poor white people, poor people of color and different backgrounds.  And so I think that that is a legacy and tradition that we fall back upon in this time. ",

You have Republicans who just clearly don't want to do that, want to help their friends.  But do you really have in Joe Biden, in Chuck Schumer in the Senate, in Nancy Pelosi in the House, do you have a bold, dramatic, inspiring, goosebumps-giving vision?  I'm not saying you're going to be able to pass it in the Senate, but do you have it?  Do you have this being declared?  Do you have people committing to big ideas that maybe they weren't for earlier in their career?  Maybe they were, as Biden was, for employer-based health care, crazy idea given pandemic?  And do you have them reversing themselves?  You know, this America is hungry for relief, as the Reverend was saying, but it's also hungry for fundamental change right now.

The Democratic Party is still dominated by its moderate wing.  And progressives are going to need the seniority and the connections to actually maneuver to make things happen.  One of the things I think is the best example of this, connecting it to the Fourth of July, is the Freedom of Information Act, which is a very important piece of legislation that requires the government to tell you what you're doing.  Journalists use it.  It's the most fundamental tool that journalists use when we're trying to get documents.  And that document was signed into law on the 4th of July by Lyndon B. Johnson.  But the legislator who was Pete Moss\u2014excuse me, John Moss, who was behind it, It took him a decade in Congress.  He ran for Congress because he thought there needed to be a Freedom of Information Act.  And it took him 10 years to get the political clout to be able to navigate that through Congress and get that to Lyndon B. Johnson's desk.

Frederick Douglass, years ago, in the middle of all the problems with slavery, said every attempt to blot out.  our progress must only embolden our agitation.  It is in time for an emboldened agitation.  We can have an economy that pays people a living wage.  We can have health care for the underinsured.
