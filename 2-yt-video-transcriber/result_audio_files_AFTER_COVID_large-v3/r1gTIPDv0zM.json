            "text": "It's an unfortunate reality of the past decade or so that the sentiment conveyed in these two quotes has largely been ignored.  Instead, our popular media and activist class have elevated the offended whine into an act of bravery.  When taken to its extreme, it means validating the feelings of the most easily offended.  whether that offense is genuinely taken or actively manufactured.  I don't deny that someone may feel genuinely offended by something that I personally find innocuous, but I refuse to accept that I need to indulge your subjective feelings.  Now I'm willing to bet that Stephen Fry would not characterize offense taken at genuinely racist remarks as a whine, but I'm also willing to bet that he wouldn't find a product named after an inventor to be offensive just because that name also can be used as a racist slur.  You see, I believe in this admittedly now outdated notion of context.  So the now-defunct Coon Cheese brand is the Australian trademark of a cheddar cheese produced by the Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Company.  Warrnambool, for non-Australians, is a town in Victoria about 250 kilometres west of Melbourne.  It was first launched in 1935 by Fred Walker.  Coon Cheese is named after its American creator, Edward William Coon of Philadelphia, who in 1926 patented a method subsequently known as the cooning process for fast maturation of cheese via high-temperature cheese.  and humidity.  LD&D Foods, who also held a stake in the company, were the previous operator of the brand until May 2015 when it was sold back to WCB, which is majority owned by Canadian dairy company Saputo Inc.  The product name, which it shares with a racial slur, was defended by previous manufacturers Kraft and Dairy Farmers despite decades-long campaigns to change it.  including through challenges to the australian human rights commission in 1999 and advertising standards bureau in 2001 by activist stephen hagan.  amid australian involvement in 2020 black lives matter protests.  on 24 july saputo inc announced the name would be changed.  Now, the catalyst for Saputo's decision to change the name appears to be an email written by the aforementioned Dr.  Stephen Hagen from The Australian.  Dr.  Hagen has lobbied for more than 20 years for a change to the Coon Cheese brand, which its Australian manufacturers have long argued was named after American Edward William Coon, who in 1926 patented the ripening process for the original product.  Last month, Dr.  Hagen wrote directly to Mr.  Saputo, the grandson of company founder Giuseppe, saying Coon Cheese... should be consigned to the past of outdated racist brands.  So it took 20 years, but Hagen finally prevailed.  But is it a racist brand, or is it simply the surname of someone that invented a process for faster cheese maturation?  Well, according to an article written by Hagen in 2014 titled The Downside of My Love Affair with the Alluring Section 18C, Hagen disputes the official version of the story.  He writes, In September 2008, I came under heavy racist attacks from sections of the public when I filed under Section 18C for dairy farmers to remove the brand of cheese called Coon sold through food outlets.  I argued that Coon was the name given to the cheese by Kraft in America 10 years before the official patent was provided by Edward Coon in 1926.  I told dairy farmers I would drop my case if they could prove the veracity of the brand's origin, i.e.  show me the academic transcripts of Dr.  Edward Kuhn qualification and his history of cheese making publications.  Kraft alleged Edward Kuhn was credited with the patent for introducing humidity into the cooking chamber to speed up the ripening process for the cheese.  Through my research, I discovered Edward Kuhn was not a cheesemaker, but an uneducated, recently arrived Russian immigrant who was a factory hand who swept the floors and did odd jobs around the factory.  I received numerous letters from old cheesemakers in Australia on reading this controversy who claimed they stenciled ape heads on Kuhn cheese over half a century ago, thus proving to me at least the original racist intent.  of the name.  So there are a couple of arguments made by Hagen here that I find somewhat confusing.  For example, why would Edward Kuhn necessarily have academic transcripts of his qualifications in cheesemaking?  Were such qualifications necessary to carry on the business of cheesemaking in the early 20th century?  As I'll show in a minute, cheesemaking appears to have been a family business for at least 30 years before Edward Kuhn's 1926 patent.  The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Hagen in 2008 as follows.  Initially, dairy farmers said it was named after Edward Kuhn, who revolutionised the speeding process of making cheese.  But I've questioned the authenticity of that story.  Formerly manufactured by Kraft, Mr Hagen claims the cheese used to have a black wraparound and was named Kuhn as a joke.  I want dairy farmers to show me the evidence of Edward Kuhn being honored an honorary doctorate and what year he received that honorary doctorate, he said.  If they can prove to me that Edward Kuhn was a famous cheesemaker, I will drop my campaign.  So did dairy farmers claim that Edward Kuhn received an honorary doctorate?  And if so, from which institution?  Because if that institution still exists, it shouldn't be too difficult to track down.  Also, if Kuhn were a cheesemaker, why would he necessarily have a publication history?  Plenty of people that work in industry don't publish.  Did dairy farmers also claim he had a publication history?  Now, whilst it's hard to find any history on Edward Kuhn, I did find this entry on Nacademia.com.  E.W.  Kuhn was the grandson of Amherst Kuhn, a farmer born in Russia, New York, who married Sally Betsy Treat in 1822.  His sons, Madison and Ephraim, were described in 1893 as having been in the butter and cheese business together at 29 South Water Street, Philadelphia, for more than 30 years.  Ephraim's son, Edward Willie Coon, was born on July 30, 1871 and had taken out at least one cheese patent by 1912.  The first of those footnotes is a reference to the official United States Patent Office Volume 181 published in 1912.  And as you can see on page 535, a patent was filed in April 1911 by Edward W. Coon of Philadelphia for cheese and subsequently published in June 1912.  The second footnote links to a genealogy of the Treat, Trott and Tratt families for 15 generations and 450 years in England and America.  In it, it contains the family history of Edward Coon.  His grandmother's maiden name, as I just mentioned, was Treat, and she married Edward Coon's grandfather, Amherst Coon, in 1822.  Amherst Coon, we are told, was a farmer.  One of his sons was named Ephraim, born in 1832, married in 1865, and we're told, quote, has been for over 30 years engaged in the butter and cheese business.  Remember, Hagen claims in his 2014 article that Edward Kuhn was a recently arrived Russian immigrant, whereas the only reference to Russia in the treat genealogy is that Edward Kuhn's grandfather was born in Russia, New York State.  Now, we saw earlier the entry in the official US Patent Office volume filed by Kuhn in 1911, and here is the actual copy of the 1926 patent for the process for ripening cheese, as mentioned in the historical account of the origin of Kuhn cheese.  So is this a case of mistaken identity?  Is Hagen talking about a different Edward Kuhn?  Hagen states in his 2014 article that his 2008 18C case was summarily dismissed by, as he claims, public servants who did very little research on the case and chose to believe a large corporation's integrity over a so-called radical black stirring up trouble.  I haven't forgotten this case and will take it up as part of my postdoctoral work as soon as I submit my PhD on another subject this year.  Now, I couldn't find anything Hagen has written on this issue subsequent to his 2014 article, but I'd be happy to read anything that would substantiate Hagen's historical account of Edward Kuhn.  But in the absence of such evidence, if we accept that Coon Cheese is named after the inventor of a cheese maturation process, then I think we can reject Hagen's characterization of Coon Cheese as a racist brand.  Remember, the first challenge to change the brand name was brought to the Human Rights Commission in 1999 and then to the Advertising Standards Board in 2001.  So let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit some of the ads from this alleged racist brand.  I got a huge case of lovin' Coon Just the right bite to have And I like it on top.  Nothin' else can do it.  Great taste of Coon, it never dies.  So that ad was from 1996 and clearly shows racist white people enjoying cheese.  And is that a woman of colour I see?  It's hard to tell, but if it is, then obviously she has some kind of internalised white supremacy.  Now, growing up in the 1980s, there was a show on ABC called Come and Get It, hosted by Peter Russell Clarke.  Essentially, he was Australia's first celebrity chef before celebrity chefs were a thing.  He was also a promoter of Australian cheese.  Now, got any more cheese?  Australian cheese, of course, because I reckon it's even better than the imported stuff.  It's true, our cheese flavour, texture and food value turns any barbie into a beauty.  And here he is promoting coon cheese specifically.  G'day.  Come and I'll show you some of my favourite spots around Australia.  Kunanbul, Kunalpin, Kunua Bridge.  Stop the fridge!  Kunawara, Kunjumaran, Kunavarabran.  Love that coon taste.  Now let's talk to some real cheese experts.  You mean coon cheese experts, Peter.  See what I mean?  Been eating coon cheese for 60 years or more.  Me too.  60 years?  Come on.  All around Australia, people love that great coon taste.  Say cheese.  Cheese.  Now, should we rename all those towns and places?  Peter Russell Clark is now 84 years old and thinks that the decision to ditch the name is ridiculous.  Are we going to change the name of the raccoon, do you think?  Russell Clark said coons owners should be more concerned about maintaining the quality of their cheese than ditching an 85-year-old name to suit the whim of the time.  And at the end of the day, what does it actually achieve?  Does it get one more Indigenous kid into a classroom?  Does it stop one more domestic violence incident in an Indigenous community?  But Scott, it's not an either or.  We can walk and chew gum at the same time.  Well, to respond to that, I'm going to recruit the ever-wise words of Anthony Dillon.  As he writes in The Spectator Australia, That's the dairy I'll dealt with.  Now can we stop this patronising pettiness and tackle true Indigenous disadvantage?  Here's a quick question for those who follow Aboriginal affairs.  What has received more attention in the past month?  The story of the five-year-old Aboriginal boy allegedly raped in North Queensland or changing the name of Coon Cheese because it is supposedly racist?  Great question.  He goes on, when I express my frustration at cancel culture, snowflakes on the left often reply with, what difference does it make?  Some might even think it actually helps Aboriginal people as the offending name, cartoon or date is apparently offensive and oppressive.  In answer to what difference does it make, I have two responses.  The first is that these campaigns are a major distraction to the more important problems facing Aboriginal people.  I don't need to spend too much time talking about this one as it's straightforward.  When I point this out, the enthusiastic protesters who need a cause and a distraction respond with, well, people can walk and chew gum at the same time, meaning that they can partake in cancel culture activities as well as give attention to the more important issues affecting Aboriginal people like poverty, violence, child abuse and poorer health status.  The problem is, however, while I see huge numbers attend Black Lives Matter protests, another activity that is a distraction from the real issues, I don't see the same social justice warriors anywhere near as vocal about the real issues confronting Aboriginal people.  Did I miss the protests for the five-year-old?  Exactly.  And you know why?  Because it's easy to hold a sign and abuse the police rather than engaging in the hard work of improving the social and economic lives of Indigenous Australians.  My second response to what difference does it make is that it is disempowering to Aboriginal people.  Let me explain.  The subtle message to Aboriginal people from these stupid campaigns is, a brand name has more power over your emotions than you have over them yourself.  Whether it be smarter white milk, coon cheese, or whatever is the next product that will be declared offensive.  Aboriginal people are being basically told that their happiness is out of their hands and under the control of some cheese or milk.  They're being told they are victims and that their wellbeing is dependent on an allegedly racist product being renamed.  If it is changed, they are fine.  But if it is not changed, they are victims.  This is the exact thing I've been saying for years on a range of issues.  This kind of victimhood mentality removes individual agency.  We are encouraging fragility rather than resilience, that you should expect to go through life without being offended or hear an opinion you don't like.  And if you do, well, you can call on an authority figure to intervene or incite a mob to get an opinion shut down or expunge a controversial historical figure from the history pages or get a product name erased.  And it would probably help if corporations would show some more backbone, as Trader Joe's recently did in the United States.  Basically, an online petition called on them to remove racist branding and packaging from its stores.  Trader Joe's response?  We want to be clear.  We disagree that any of these labels are racist.  We do not make decisions based on petitions.  You see, it's not so hard, is it?  The Babylon Bee satirized this nonsense perfectly.  Trader Joe's makes baffling business decision to ignore angry people on the internet who don't even shop there.  So how many people that are offended by coon cheese actually buy it?  And perhaps more importantly, how many buyers of coon cheese will now not buy whatever the new brand name will be?  As usual, let me know your thoughts in the comments below.  I'll see you next time.
