We figured we were long overdue and I wanted to try my fairly new DSLR and new microphone setup.  So one of the locations that we went to was the FedEx over at the Burbank Airport and for those of you familiar with my channel remember what happened the first time that I showed up there about two years ago.  So back in September of 2017 when I first started my channel I had my first of many encounters at Burbank Airport.  It was a complete PR nightmare for the airport police.  I was simply taking stock footage of airplanes taking off Nothing more.  And as we know, since 9-11, everybody's been deputized.  Here's a guy, an employee from FedEx, who's pointing me out and calling airport police on me.  And here is the encounter that unfolded. ",
