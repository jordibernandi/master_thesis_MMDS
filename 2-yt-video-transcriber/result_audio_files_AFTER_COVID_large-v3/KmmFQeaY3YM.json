            "text": "This election, your choice couldn't be more important.  Our candidate is in flattering lighting in full bright color.  Their candidate is in grainy high contrast black and white.  Spotted through a telephoto lens from behind a bush.  Coming back from God only knows where.  Our guy points at the horizon and holds a baby.  Their guy doesn't have a baby.  Their guy has a golf club.  The voiceover for our guy is calm, measured, bright.  Their guy gets the lower register.  And sometimes we slow down.  Our guy has clean headlines and the beautiful lens flare America needs.  Here's a scary graph over a photo of their guy awkwardly laughing.  Snap zoom.  Do you want to snap zoom like that in office?  Here's a photo of our guy saluting military veterans.  Jump cuts.  Flashes.  Static.  Aggressive colors.  You can't trust a guy with graphics like this.  Our guy gets stock footage of sunrises and an American flag.  Their guy's flag is upside down and on fire.  Intercut with overdue bills.  War and a crying baby.  Our guy gets doctors and astronauts and stimulus checks.  Flatline.  An eagle.  Hurricane.  The Statue of Liberty.  Crime scene tape.  Ronald Reagan.  Ronald.  A girl running in a wheat field to escape a dangerous sexual predator.  Welding.  Atomic bomb.  This election, the choice is yours.  Their guy or our guy.  Inspiring slogan. ",
