            "text": "Hi, my name is Aaron.  This is my show Re-Education, and you'll probably notice that I'm not on my grandmother's couch anymore.  Alas, she was not long for this world.  The couch, that is, not my grandmother.  She's doing just fine.  But today we're going to talk a little bit about some drama that I have to start with basically... everybody in BreadTube.  because honestly, I'm done.  I've had enough.  I'm sick and tired of all of this bullshit and it's time for me to spill the tea, ladies.  It's time for me to actually get in there, get dirty, and really talk some shit about some serious people because I have nothing better to do right now.  I have been way too nice and junk for way too long.  And BreadTube has it coming.  I mean, it's time that we burn down this tube of bread.  It's time for us to kill our heroes.  Today is the day that we kill those heroes.  Today is the day that we destroy our idols.  Figuratively... And fuck it, who knows, literally two.  We're going to burn this bread.  I'm going to start fire everywhere in this bitch right here.  First, I'm going to talk about the serfs.  I'm going to talk about Peter Coffin.  I'm going to talk about Vosh, Jack Saint, and especially that asshole Vadim.  I got dirt on Merrick, Bo, and probably the worst of them all, Chud Logic.  Oh, chud.  Chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud.  Chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud, chud.  I'm gonna set fire to this entire bitch.  All you're gonna be able to smell all across BreadTube will be burnt toast.  But today, ladies and gentlemen, today is the day that we burn BreadTube to the ground.  All you're gonna be able to smell across the entirety of YouTube will be burnt toast.  Hey.  Oh, I'm sorry, what?  Did you forget?  it's your birthday?  I got you a present.  Well, thank you.  That's pretty cool.  I almost completely forgot.  Let's take a look at what's inside.  All right, so pop this little box top off.  And oh, hey, right away we got some pretty cool stuff.  We got some Star Trek themed cookies.  That's pretty cool.  Okay, right on.  Long live and prosper.  For those of you who don't know, I'm a big Star Trek fan.  Really like that Star Trek.  So yeah, and then we got the little red shirt here.  He's expendable.  Very nice.  Cool, cool.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So looks like we also got a bag of oregano.  I like to bake pizzas.  I'll be putting that to really good use.  Right on.  And, oh, perfect.  Hey, we got this little red book here of socialist theory.  I'll be putting that to good use as well.  And it sounds like there's still one more thing left in this box.  So might as well just reach on in here and find out what it is.  Here.  Oh.  Oh, hey, right on.  Cool.  Yeah, right on.  A boomer FUD gun.  A Mosin Nagant.  A Mosin Nagant.  It's clearly an SKS.  What do you know?  An SKS.  That's pretty cool.  Boomer FUD guns.  No, but it does look like there's actually one more thing left in here.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, let's take a look.  Huh, looks like a tiny little USB.  I mean, let's take a look at it, see what's inside.  Now, while that's booting up, let's talk about these bread tube motherfuckers.  You ever wonder why Chud Logic never shows his face?  Stay tuned to the end and you'll find out why.  But first, let's start with Merrick.  You know, one time, she posed in the same room with a duck mask.  Is she trying to fuck that mask?  And what about the serfs?  Apparently there are two people running that channel, but you never quite see those two in the same place at the same time.  Are they the same person?  I want answers.  I want to know.  And everybody needs to know about Jack Saint and that scumbag Vadim.  Oh, I guess my file's done.  Let's take a look at that.  Thank you.

Hey Aaron, I may or may not pass out in the next few minutes, but happy birthday.  Best of luck with your YouTube channel.  Have a good one.  Lego videos about creationists.

            "text": "Oh my God.  This almost reminds me of the way BreadTube was so long ago when it first started, like a year and a half ago when everybody kind of liked each other and would work together and would be on each other's videos and stuff.  Wow.  I mean, we've come a long way since then.  We pretty much fucking hate each other all now.  Oh my god.  All of these leftists who usually disagree with each other and, in some cases, outright hate one another, all came together on this one video to wish me a happy birthday.  I mean, I still have all of these super hot takes to drop about these people, and a lot of them are really important, but maybe I could solve this a different way.  Maybe I could have, I don't know, a rational, good-faith discussion with people about it, or maybe talk to the people that I have a problem with directly in the DMs, and maybe just leave the public call-outs for things that are really important instead of airing all of our dirty laundry all of the time for... really no reason.  Or realize that Twitter and social media profits off drama because it's uncontroversial to their advertisers but gets a ton of click-throughs and engagement, therefore making a ton of money for multinational tech companies who are essentially profiting off of our own destruction.  Or maybe if people are nice to you, you're just less likely to criticize them.  And if that's the case, then it's time to actually spill some tea.  You would not believe the kind of dirt that I have on Beau.  Anyway, that's the way I look at it.  If you do get a chance, please check out all the links in the description box below.  Hit the little bell button because you know that they are not going to tell you when I release a new video.  And make sure you're subscribed because they're unsubscribing people every single day.  And make sure you're also subscribed to all of the very nice people who participated in this video.  For a little bit of backstory, this was actually a really nice present that was given to me by my partner.  They seem that... You know, COVID has been a little bit stressful, so they wanted to give me something that made me cheer up and feel a lot better.  And getting all of these people together to actually make the video was an amazing feat.  My partner is in no way known in any circles at all on social media or anywhere ever at all.  I'm just kidding.  So trying to get a hold of all of these different semi famous bread tubers or whatever was, you know, kind of an amazing feat.  So, yes, they were able to do that and they were able to get a hold of everybody.  And Chud Logic actually was able to really help out with this whole thing.  uh without uh their work and without their help this this wouldn't have happened.  um and i didn't even know any of this was happening.  this was all a big surprise to me so i thought that i'd share it with you guys because you know it was kind of fun and uh it was really sweet.  so thank you everybody that was involved.  i really do appreciate it.  and uh i might might be posting on my patreon.  um My actual reaction to the video when I first got it, the whole thing isn't there because I asked about halfway through to stop recording my reaction because I got a little bit emotional because I wasn't expecting it.  But yeah, go check out my Patreon.  You'll be able to watch the full link to it there.  So thank you very much for watching.  Have a nice day. ",
