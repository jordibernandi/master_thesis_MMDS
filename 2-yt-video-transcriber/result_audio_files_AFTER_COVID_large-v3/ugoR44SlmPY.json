In other words, the debt has been paid.  you're in court and someone pays you fine.  the judge can let you go even though you're guilty.  you can say hey you guys there's a stack of speeding fines here.  this is deadly serious but someone's paid him.  you're free to go and you can do that which is legal and right.  and just you walk free because somebody paid your fine.  it you can do that which is right.  god can legally take the death sentence off you and let you live forever because jesus paid the fine and full.  That's why he said, it is finished just before he died.  And then he rose from the dead and defeated death.  And if you guys simply repent of your sins and trust in Jesus, you have God's promise, he'll grant you everlasting life as a free gift.  So both of you are like a man who's going to jump out of a plane 10,000 feet.  He's not going to parachute on, but this is his attitude.  This is his plan.  He's going to try and save himself by flapping his arms.  Not say that person.  Don't do that.  It's not going to work.  You can't save yourself.  Trust the parachute.  So guys, don't trust your goodness to save you on judgment day.  It's not going to work because you're not good.  You're like the rest of us.  You have a multitude of sins.  Simply transfer your trust from yourself to the Savior.  Is this making sense? ",
