Something they accused you of being misogynistic.  And then was the book dropped?  I mean, this is sort of an early version of Cancel Call. ",

And throughout 1990, the book kind of moved through the usual rungs of the ladder that it does through a publishing house.  Getting copyedited, we figure out a cover.  Your editor does some basic editing on it.  But there were people in the publishing house who were very offended by American Psycho.  Usually assistants, young people working in the publishing house.  And leaks started happening.  Leaks of some of the most violent passages were being sent to the press and certain members of the press.  And so suddenly it became a story.  And the book hadn't been published yet, but it became a story.  And it became more and more controversial, the more and more that these notorious scenes were leaked and of course out of context.  they're horrible.  and so anyway the controversy got louder and louder and louder and yes kind of like today.  in a way Simon & Schuster collapsed and said we are not going to publish this book because of the outcry in the media.  now This is another thing that happened then is that it was actually the corporation that owned Simon & Schuster that demanded the cancellation.  It was Gulf & Western who owned Simon & Schuster and the head of Gulf & Western did not like the controversy, did not like the fact that his corporation was being blemished by this book who ordered the cancellation.  I knew the head of that company of Simon & Schuster quite well and I knew that he wasn't the one who canceled it, but he was the fall guy.  He had to take it.  So anyway, that is what happened.  It's a happy ending because a better publisher picked up American Psycho and they published it a few months later.  And, you know, the rest is whatever it is. ",

Who then became a conservative.  And at his conference, he did a thing on sort of the new generation of former lefties that have sort of woken up.  And it was me, Tammy Bruce, Candace Owens, and a couple other people.  So that's the only time I met her.  And it's funny, she was opposed to you back then, and here you are.  That's actually a great segue for a little political stuff.  Where are you politically?  I mean, I have a sense of kind of where you're at and everything these days feels sort of amorphous, but. ",

I was a privileged white kid and moving from high school into college during the Reagan 80s, everything seemed whatever.  I mean, I guess I complained about Reagan mindlessly like all of my other kids in my class, and a lot of people took American Psycho to be a book that was critical of the values of the Reagan 80s.  And it was critical of some of the cultural values, certainly about greed and about yuppiedom, but I didn't have no beef with Ronald Reagan.  I mean, that wasn't part of what that book was about.  Some of his iconography is used in the book, But he was just the president during the time that that book took place.  And then I was living with someone for a long time who was very invested in politics, actually ran a couple of gubernatorial campaigns in the 90s, and I got a close-up look to that and I just hated it.  I just hated the whole notion of how it was all played out.  None of it interested me.  And during the Obama era, everything's fine.  I mean, I wasn't really paying attention.  Something happened with Trump.  Something happened with Trump that I think has happened to all of us to one degree or another.  Something was announced.  And I, again, another presidential election cycle is coming up.  And I'm kind of following it.  But suddenly I'm following it because it's very interesting to me how the media is treating the Donald Trump narrative.  Now, I'm talking about a media that I had been following closely for 30 years and trusted somewhat.  The New York Times, CNN.  New York Times and CNN.  All of my life.  I read them and I trusted them and I believed in them and it was all they were, you know.  And I began to think that they were missing the story.  That they were going off a different path.  that really wasn't the reality.  That wasn't the reality.  That there was a new narrative that they were forming.  And this began to bother me.  And I don't know why. ",

And I realized that I'm not, and I don't want to be on this side of the theater if it is this hysterical, this crazed, and also I really hated the creation of narratives that were obviously not true that were being used to undermine a legally elected president, whether I liked him or didn't like him.

And yet, because it's Trump, and this is the problem with Trump, and I talk about this again in the book, it is about, I really believe it's about an aesthetic.  It's about this guy and what he looks like, and I always have said that if Trump was in the package of a Mitt Romney, it might be more palatable for a lot of people, and we certainly would not have this kind of, like, what is truly, I believe, Trump derangement syndrome.
