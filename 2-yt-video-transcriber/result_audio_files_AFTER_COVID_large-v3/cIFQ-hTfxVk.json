            "text": "Are you planning a terrorist attack or anything, are you?  Oh, I don't answer questions like that.  Okay.  Are you planning to get hurt in your car without a seatbelt on?  No, I'm fine.  You're fine?  Yeah, I may have to get out.  Oh, okay.  Alright, if you want to get out, you can, I guess, but... I just found it a little suspicious.  you were riding around the parking lot videotaping.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure you're not... You know, with all This day and age, right?  You're going to say this day and age?  Okay.  What other buzzwords do you have for this day and age?  With this current climate?  I mean, with everything, with Iran and stuff like that.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Don't forget that seatbelt, was it?  316-614.  All right.  Got it.  I just don't answer any other questions, if you don't mind.  Do you have any crime I'm suspected of?  Because I need to get going.  I'm a little bit late.  Trying to verify that flight plan.  Trying to verify the flight plan.  Yep.  Is that before you fly?  So is that, that's what I'm asking you.  If you're suspecting me of a crime still... Are you still suspecting me of a crime?  I got to get going.  So you have state statutes or city ordinances against flying a drone?  I'm just asking you a question.  But are you a federal officer?  You can enforce federal law?  Tell me what federal law you enforce.  That's a state law.  That's why you can do.  it is because it's a state law.  You said Jack Wagon?  Yeah.  Sarge, you got your body cam on?  You got your body cam on, Sarge?  Do you have your body cam on?  Okay, I don't know if you have to have one.  You cannot videotape me.  Okay.  You cannot take my video.  If you do, it's a felony.  I will arrest you.  It is a felony?  Absolutely.  You cannot take my video.  Is that a statute?  What are you doing on the property?  We weren't on the property.  Why are you filming and taking videos?  I'm going to grab a complaint form inside.  That's fine.  Thank you.  You're basing that under the wiretapping statute?  Is that what you're saying?  The felony?  In case of.  Yeah, yeah, I was out there along with county deputies, a bunch of people.  So, Lieutenant, I was just a little concerned about the unlawful detainment of about 200-plus people.  Okay.  I know there was a shooting.  I get it.  But at the same time, some people by your department were actually required to give ID and to give phone numbers and check their tags before they could even leave.  Okay.  And that's kind of a scary thing to happen with the department.  I know that probably the county took over that call.  Right, it was in the county's jurisdiction.  They requested to try to identify as many people as they could prior to leaving.  Yeah, and some of the officers there were forcing ID and saying, you've got to give me your name, give me your tag number.  I hope you respect the Constitution.  Oh, more than you know.  Yeah.  More than you know.  Usually when people say more than they know, it's the opposite of that.  You respect it for yourself and your team, but... Deputy over there.  And they call.  No, sir.  I'm going to stay right here.  Come over here.  So they had a captain and a deputy.  I'm waiting for a complaint form.  Am I being detained?  That's fine.  Come over here and talk to me for a minute.  Am I being detained?  I'm trying to figure out what's going on.  Okay.  Is there a criminal defense that you suspect me of?  Listen to me.  This lady over here just told you your job.  I'm trying to talk to you.  Okay.  Come outside and talk to me.  No, sir.  I'm waiting for a complaint form and that's it.  You can get a complaint form.  Ma'am, if you could just calm this guy down.  Thank you.  Just wait for her.  That's what I would do, deputy.  Wait for her.  She has more sense.  Okay?  Listen, ma'am.  Stop.  I'm stopping.  I'm trying to talk to you.  Okay.  You are being confronted.  No.  Let's go outside so I can talk to you.  The first thing, 901-151.  Stop.  901-151 statute.  Stop.  Read it, sir.  Stop.  Pay attention.  Just a supervisor.  That's all I need, deputy.  And that's fine.  We're going to get one, but first you're going to come out here so we can talk.  Deputy Schmidt, I just need a supervisor.  Ma'am.  Supervisor's on the way up.  I'm not playing this game, ma'am.  Let's go outside.  Hold on just a minute.  Because what they're doing, I'm the records director.  I haven't met you yet.  But what they're doing is perfectly legal.  I understand that.  Come on over here.  Sir, I feel like I want to stay here.  If I go any further, that 901151 that calls this a detention, am I being detained?  I just have to ask that question, Deputy Smith.  Am I being detained?  You're about to.  Okay, have a good day, sir.  They do have a PED there, which is really good.  That's nice.  in case you need to have anything that goes on.  Let's go.  Do you need anything?  Are you good?  Do you need anything?  No, I was just walking by.  Do you have any weapons on you or anything like that?  Excuse me?  Do you have any weapons on you or anything like that?  Well, the police don't care.  By far, I don't.  Do you mind if I pat you down?  here which is really good in case there's some type of incident they need it.  so he's had to do just trying to figure that you got detained for no state law violation.  sounds like copy that but have a great day guys.  thanks a lot.  you gotta have reasonable submission of a crime.  it's what that's.  that's why i went back to the car.  i checked it out.  i didn't have anything else.  okay I don't know if you heard when I said this guy knocked this fence down.  I don't know if that was disorderly conduct.  Sir, our conversation is over.  All right, good.  You're dismissed.  What's that?  You are dismissed then.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to narrate a video here.  You can't take a picture of the car.  You can't take a picture of the car?  No.  Why?  We have no idea what you might want to do with it.  I don't have any idea what you're doing, sir.  So it's illegal to take a picture of this car?  Did you know that Department of Homeland Security actually issued a memo?  that said the filming of the buildings is okay and the police cars?  I mean, it's in public.  We're in public on a sidewalk.  no do you have any questions?  uh yeah is he arrested for a driver's license or something?  so you asked me if i have a question and then you can't answer anything.  oh okay yeah i got you too.  get back in the car and do your work.  hey how's it going?  are you stopping me?  yeah oh what for well you're filming us and you're driving on their property.  no i just i was in the cul-de-sac.  i didn't go anywhere in their property.  okay what's going on?  bud?  um filming is illegal.  Well, if you're filming our back parking lot.  That's illegal?  And following our dispatchers around, yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm from Florida.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wherever.  Florida.  Are we going to have the sovereign citizen talk?  No, don't go there.  That's stupid to go there.  You guys are the only ones.  No, you guys are the only ones that are sovereign citizens.  You have sovereign immunity throughout Florida.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to have you interrupt me there.  Come walking out of my facility.  Your facility?  You own this facility?  Okay, so... Can I finish my stuff here?  So EOC is a really good place because what it does is allow you to have... Rude of you to interrupt, Captain.  Yeah, it is.  It sure is.  It sure is.  So what they do, they have a really good program here, but Captain... What is it again?  Slabos?  Not so good.  Thank you.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I didn't know if you heard.  I didn't know if I can have you turn those off when I walk out or not.  Hey, I'm just curious.  What's in Victoria's Secret?  Is that like a warrant book?  Are you Victoria?  No, I'm not.  Can I help you?  Is that like the warrant book?  No.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  It was funny.  It says Victoria's Secret.  But yeah, can we turn those off before I walk out?  so my face isn't on it?  No.  Oh, so I'll leave mine on too.  Okay.  Now you know how it feels.  Thank you very much for your time.  Appreciate the complaint form.  Hey, what was your name?  ID 27.  ID 27?  Yep.  All right, I'd like to make a public records request while I'm here for the police department.  All righty, regarding?  I want to get the personnel record for ID 27.  It's the way it works.  Wow.  I know.  We'll see if that's on there.  It's on there.  Everybody's a law-abiding citizen out there.  I think these guys are just out here just to keep the peace.  But when you see them up on the roof up there like that, you know, it makes a little bit different of a situation.  But these guys are pretty much ready to go here if something's going wrong.  But everybody out there is really law-abiding, really good, awesome citizens.  Hey, Pete, take a picture.  Let me get it.  There you go, 2029, taking off a little bit.  I was going to ask you a quick question.  Do you mind?  Just quick question.  No?  I was just going to ask a quick question.  You guys got a guy with a sniper rifle up on the roof?  I'm sorry, Peter.  Yeah, I just saw it.  I just saw it up there.  Okay.  There you go, tough guy.  Tough guys, plural.  So was it a yes or no?  Was it a yes or no?  I'm just trying to find out if it was a yes or no.  Yes or no?  They ready to kill law-abiding citizens, that's it.  Sir, can you not report people's names?  Okay.  What's your name?  Rossi?  My name's Officer Rossi.  All right, Officer Rossi.  These are other people that have been in the building.  Oh, wow.  That aren't actually employees here.  So I'd like to make a public records request with you then.  With me?  I want a copy of that log right there.  You'd have to make a public record request with our records department.  Actually, Florida Statute 119 says that whoever receives it can forward it on, Officer Rossi.  Okay.  I will get ahold of my supervisor for you.  You sure will.  That complaint form's for you now.  I'll do that.  I mean, if they're there, you can inspect them.  It's readily available.  It's not hard to do, so.  That's it.  See how easy that was?  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Can you say something?  I'm sorry.  Do you have any weapons on you or anything like that?  What are you guys doing?  You don't mind.  Show me your hands.  That just makes me nervous like that.  So what are you doing?  Who are you?  Are you a police officer here?  Why are you guys walking around our parking lot?  Hang on.  How long do you plan on holding people there past where the deputies are down there, like holding these people?  What?  I said how long do you plan on holding people that are past where the deputies are down there?  Until we're done with our investigation.  Do you have any further questions?  Yeah, do you know what 901-151 Florida statutes are?  Would you like me to detain you until we're done with our investigation?  What crime do you suspect me of?  You want a lawsuit?  You're interrupting an investigation.  I'm asking you how long you're going to hold people.  It's related.  You're going to continue to interrupt an investigation.  You're directing traffic.  Okay.  What was your name then?  There, that's a smart girl.  Thank you.  You're very welcome, sir.  Do you have ID on you?  No, I don't have any ID.  I just had... I don't have any ID.  Are you involved in this situation?  I'm standing here on a public right-of-way.  Just do your job.  Do your job.  Oh, don't you worry, sweetie.  I will.  No, don't call me sweetie.  Have some respect.  Oh, I have lots of respect.  Trash.  That's what that is. ",
