            "text": "Very well.  Now, Thomas Hobbes was a 17th century philosopher who contributed greatly to the subject of political philosophy.  During the later years of his life, he lived through the English Civil War.  Living amongst such brutality, watching the changing of the country, parliamentarians fighting royalists and the ensuing chaos that would follow, it really made Hobbes question the nature of the state.  What is government and how did it come to be?  Right.  In his book Leviathan, Hobbes looks at the earliest years of human development, before society, before civilization and of course before government.  Hobbes refers to this as the state of nature.  Hobbes was very critical and pessimistic about the state of nature.  This state was a time with no laws and no rulers.  In a way, complete freedom for every human.  However, living in such a state, Hobbes argued, was complete chaos and something we would definitely want to avoid as it would offer no long-term benefits for humankind.  Without rulers and laws, humans were free to be as savage and as brutal as possible.  It would be a life of brute violence.  There would be no safety, no security or trust, and as such, partnerships, growth and civilizations would not develop.  There would be no industry, no commerce, no culture, no arts, no knowledge and no sociable or civilized life.  Each day would just be a battle to survive.  And as Hobbes claims, continual fear and danger of violent death and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. ",

Hobbes believed humans were self-interested, so they would want what was best for themselves.  And also, humans were rational beings, so they would strive to create an environment that took them out of this state of nature.  This is where rulers and governments would need to be created.  Hobbes did not believe in the divine right of kings, whereby God has created certain men to rule.  In fact, Hobbes believed that it was the human beings as a collective who decides the rulers.  This collective is the social contract.  Humans get together with a mutual interest to create a better life than the state of nature.  i see first people will give up their complete freedom.  they will give up their complete freedom in order to live together in peace and stability.  they will create rules and common laws that all must follow.  secondly they will hand over complete power to a person or a group of people to enforce these laws.  this is the sovereign the authority that makes sure the social contract is followed.  The role of the sovereign is to ensure there is peace and stability in the society and they have unlimited power to make sure this remains.  The rulers then can do whatever they want, whatever they need to do in order to maintain the peace and safety for the population.  This is the social contract.  We collectively agree to follow laws and rules and we give unlimited power to the sovereign to make sure we all follow them.  we can never limit the power of the sovereign and we can never try to fight against them so long as they are fulfilling their part of the social contract and maintaining a safe environment free from chaos and from the state of nature.  remember all that stands between humans and that chaotic brutal life is the sovereign and so they must always remain all powerful all the time.

Locke agreed that the state of nature was complete freedom for human beings, this liberty to act and live how one pleases.  However, this did not mean we could do anything we wanted and every act was permissible.  We must remember, although there was no rulers, this did not mean there was no morality.  Locke believed humans were still bound by natural law, and using our rational faculties, we can see that we have natural rights.  Locke described these natural rights as life, liberty and property.  So basically, we cannot kill or harm each other, we cannot enslave or force each other to act, and we cannot steal from each other.  These were the three natural rights all humans had.  We were all born and created equally with these three rights. ",

            "text": "Of course, in the state of nature there is no authority to protect these natural rights or to judge if any of the rights are being violated.  And so here is where the population makes a social contract.  We grant limited powers to a government to make sure that these three natural rights are being preserved.  The role of the government is to judge whether any of these rights have been violated for an individual and to punish anyone who violates another's natural rights.  Now, we may give up some freedoms in order to preserve our natural rights, we do give power to a government in order to help protect our natural rights and act as an impartial judge, equal and fair to everyone.  This would all be in the pursuit of liberty and justice for all.  this is done only with the consent of the people.  we make this contract with the government.  we the people give the consent for them to have the power to punish us providing our natural rights are being safeguarded.  yes i understand so we can see.  the main difference between Locke and Hobbes is that Locke did not advocate for unlimited power of the sovereign.  Locke did not believe the government should have absolute control and rule over the people.  The government was only there to protect our natural rights and nothing more.  Should the people ever feel like the government is not fulfilling their part of the contract, Locke believed it should be permissible and in fact necessary that the people overthrow the government and expel the existing rulers.  should the leaders become inept or thoughtless in their laws the people must repel the authority.  this was after all a contract an agreement that both entities needed to make good upon.  if the current rulers could not fulfill their promise the people should be able to get them out of office and bring in new rulers.  interesting This is where liberalism as a political philosophy started to develop.  The idea that human beings should be free to live however they like, providing they do not violate anyone's natural rights.  Human beings should be free to live how they want, love who they want, worship what they want, without any interference from the government.  We see Locke's theory prominent in liberal democracies too, where the people can contribute and give their consent to a ruling party and president and we all have the power to expel these rulers if we believe they are not doing a good job.
