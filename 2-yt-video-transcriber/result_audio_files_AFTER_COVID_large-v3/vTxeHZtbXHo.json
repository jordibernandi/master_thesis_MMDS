            "text": "Hello, everybody.  So my name is Billy Prampab from Paterson, New Jersey.  I've lived in Paterson for over 30 years of my life.  I'm a United States Air Force veteran, first generation American.  Parents, they migrated to this country from Ghana, West Africa.  And, you know, they came here to give me a better life, give me a better standard of living.  They didn't really have much of a positive life back home in Ghana.  And You know, when I came to this country or when I was when I was raised in this country, when my parents came here, they they wanted to do something different.  There weren't a lot of opportunities growing up.  My mother and her relatives, they lost everything that they had shortly after her father passed away.  And they were all living in a kitchen, probably twice the size of this little area here.  Right.  Wow.  They cleared out the kitchen, put a bunch of bunk beds in there.  It was about 13 people living inside of that house.  inside of that room.  And my mother, she sold everything that she had.  She sold everything that she owned, and she decided to move to the United Kingdom.  If you don't know, Ghana was colonized by the English, so it was quite simple to become a citizen in England.  She wanted to bring her older brother.  Her older brother punked out.  He just wussed out for some reason, didn't want to go over there, and that's okay.  So she went over there and just did some of the worst jobs in the world to try and make ends meet.  And eventually she ended up meeting my father.  They came to the United States and I popped out.  Yeah.  Along with my older brother and little sister.  And the rest is history, man. ",

I thought he was going to do a lot of great things for this country.  You know, my parents coming here and seeing, you know, I never thought we'd ever see an African-American president ever.  And here he is.  He's on television.  And that was a moment when I was feeling ultra gung ho America.  So, you know, this is a great thing.  And, you know, I wanted to do something bigger than myself.  I felt, you know, what's the best thing that I could do to give back to my country?  At this point, my father had passed away.  Mother was having a very difficult time making ends meet.  And I said, you know, I can go to the Air Force because I'm not really getting much of an education here in community college.  So I dropped out of there, decided to sign up for the Air Force.  Initially wanted to be a Marine, by the way.  But, you know, they didn't want to take me.  They said my score is too high.  They didn't. ",

Like, why don't you do like like admin or something?  I don't want to be an admin.  So anyway, I ended up joining the United States Air Force.  I was stationed at RAF Mildenhall and I worked as a aerospace ground equipment mechanic for about two years.  I didn't end up finishing my full term while I was in the Air Force.  And the reason being is because of how things went when Barack Obama decided to get involved with Libya.  So at that time, our base, RAF Mildenhall, we were a support base.  We did inter-air refueling for our sister base, RAF Lake and Heath.  They had all the fighter jets.  They were going out, doing a combat thing.  We had to go and take care of them.  One day, or at least the day when this whole thing kicked off, Nobody had any idea we were about to go into Libya until we were already in Libya.  In fact, that day, I was at the club on base with one of my sergeants.  We were hanging out, had a couple of drinks.  I go home, no big deal.  Alarms start going off on the base.  Jets start going crazy.  They're flying off.  It was at that point that it became apparent that This isn't just the job, you know, because it felt like a job the entire time.  You know, you wear a suit, go to work, do your job, you know, go back, hang out with your friends and rally all night, you know.  And at that point, it became apparent that, you know, something serious is happening.  And at that point, I thought that, you know, it's probably the Russians or the Chinese or something.  I'm like, who's who's going to steamroll England, you know, for us to what's England doing?  It's not happening, you know.  And we ended up having to go to a squadron building.  They come out.  They tell us, hey, we're doing 24-hour shifts.  Well, 16-hour shifts, seven days a week until mission accomplished.  This is orders by the POTUS.  Wow.  We're instilling a humanitarian no-fly zone over Libya.  That's how they try to sugarcoat it and make it sound not so bad.  And me, like a moron, I actually got in trouble for this.  Me, like a moron, decided to raise my drunken hand and say, I don't understand.  Why are we going?  Because listen, whenever a commander or an officer says something or tells you something, not just you do it, it's like they say, oh, any questions?  It's a trick question.  You don't answer the question.  And like an idiot, I raised my hand.  I'm like, well, why are we doing this?  It doesn't make any sense.  Libya is not a threat to the Constitution, the people, or anything like that.  Why are we in England getting involved and putting American lives at risk?  And he kind of just cut me off and said, listen, you do that you get an article 15 and that's it all right.  what is article 15 is like like what are the worst punishments you can get?  you can lose rank and get arrested.  all kinds of stuff can happen to you.  it really depends on the severity of what happens.  um and from that point on you know there were a lot of uh special forces planes that started coming to our base.  at the time the cv-22 osprey was.  uh not many people knew about the plane.  i don't know if you know what it looks like but uh Is that the thing with the jets going up and down?  Right, right, right. ",

These were all Special Forces planes, Special Forces units that were going to be using these planes.  And the entire time, I just couldn't help but think to myself that, man, like... people are going to die tonight.  And at this point, I was very politically involved, but I would say I was still in a daze or in a haze as to what's really, really going on in the world here.  And when I saw this, I decided, you know, if i go out i give his generator to these guys and they go out and do what they have to do people to die before they get hurt.  and um... i didn't really want.  a part of that disobeyed those orders and again trouble.  yeah i got in trouble for that but you know looking back and i don't feel like i did the wrong thing.  you know at the time brock obama made this uh... claim we're going to libya and do this stuff but he did it when uh... He did it when Congress was \u2013 when they couldn't come to a conclusion for the debt ceiling.  They wanted to raise it in 2010. ",

I need a fake news.  It's on television.  You can only really get CNN and AFN, the Armed Forces Network on the base.  And the only thing it was really saying was the humanitarian no fly zone has been successful.  It's like no real no real answers as to what happened.  But when I went off base, I went to my girlfriend at the Times House and I started looking at Al Jazeera, Press 24 and all these other news stations.  The protests that were happening in Libya were saying the completely different thing than what they were saying in the United States.  The United States are saying, oh, we're doing this humanitarian thing and they're supporting us because they want to help get rid of Gaddafi.  When in reality, they're like, we don't need NATO interference.  You know, it's like we've got our own revolution going on.  This is during the Arab Spring.  We've got our own revolution going on.  We don't want any American interference.  Lo and behold, this happens.  Benghazi happened shortly after that.  You start bombing land, you start bombing farmlands and all kinds of stuff.  doing things that in my opinion completely violated the geneva convention.  so when i saw this i was like this is treason.  you know we didn't get we didn't get any authorization from congress to do this and now we're out here killing innocent people like i signed up to defend my country and i go out and wages nonsensical wars and you see what history is as a has laid out.  shortly after that happened you know All these terrorist cells, they came together, took over Tripoli.  They created ISIS, started funneling oil through Syria.  And the rest is history.  And now in Africa, which, and I tell this to a lot of people, a lot of people aren't aware of is, you know, the reason why I don't support Barack Obama anymore is we have the first black president and he has done more for slavery than anybody else in history.  Because right now in Libya, well, it should be, Pretty sure it's still going on right now.  In Libya, they have these open-air slave markets where they're going around collecting people from my parents' country, Ghana.  They're kidnapping people all across the country and selling them off into slavery.  And that would have never happened.  Whether you like Gaddafi or not, it would have never happened if he was still alive.  And when I saw those kinds of things, I kind of just wanted to get out.  I wanted to go back home.  And it was a different story when I came home as well.  Because going to England, I got culture shock going over there.  You know, I saw how... Everything was very different.  There's cameras all over the place.  I'm pretty sure you've been to England before.  Oh, yeah. ",

Everyone's for communism.  Everybody's on this whole Marxist train right now.  And it just blew my mind.  It didn't make much sense to me.  Because the only thing that kept repeating in my mind is I had a seventh grade teacher in school 18 in Patterson.  His name was Mr.  Damacolo.  Growing up, he grew up in fascist Italy during the times of World War II.  And he would tell us these kinds of things about, you know, be very mindful and be very careful about these leaders that come in and promise all these kinds of things.  And they start drifting the country into socialism.  It always sounds like a good idea on paper, but in practice, it never ends well.  I remember a lot of kids were just like, ha-ha, that'll never happen in America.  You know, nobody really believed that.  And look where we are today. ",

But I always kept it in the back of my mind what they were talking about.  But around 2010, when I came back, I started working at JFK Airport, doing the same thing I was doing in the Air Force, but for JFK.  And I couldn't even afford an apartment, right?  I was making like $28, $29 an hour, really good money, but the tax was just ridiculous.  And I ended up living with this guy named Nick in Ozone Park.  And It's a whole other story.  But this guy here, man, that was the first time I ever encountered a socialist and knew what a socialist was.  Like, in his house, he had, like, this massive communist flag hanging on the wall, all kinds of, like, literature from Lenin and all kinds of stuff.  And I was intrigued, I'm not going to lie, because I've never seen any of this kind of stuff.  I'm like, whoa, look at all this Russian stuff, you know what I mean?  So we're sitting down, we're talking about this stuff.  It's like, oh, man, you should totally be a socialist, like, you know, or for free college or for free healthcare.  You believe in equality, right?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I believe in equality.  And He's like, you know what?  You should come with me to this, uh, this rally.  Right.  And it wasn't a church in Brooklyn, massive, massive church.  It was probably about like 200 people inside this church.  And there's this guy, he's up there and he's just like, you know, we're going to, we're going to fight for the rights.  And you know, we're going to get free college because college is too expensive.  Rent is expensive.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, these are all good ideas.  But I remember asking the people next to me, I was like, this is cool.  But like, how, how, how are we going to implement this?  What do you mean?  Are we going to implement this man?  We're going to tax the rich.  And I'm like, tax them what like how much like?  I don't understand.  and where right how long it's like they're the 1% they have the money to pay for this.  and I'm like you do realize these people have like massive jets right like these guys have bank accounts they can wire their money and disappear like there's.  There's no way you're going to write any, unless you're going to write a law to mandate them from not leaving the country or moving their business.  And I highly doubt you're going to be able to do that.  But no one had a real answer.  And it was at that point when I came back from that rally that I went home and I was like, let me look at Ron Paul and see what Ron Paul's talking about.  You see him talk, and he's a very small guy, kind of boring, which is why I believe he didn't win.  And he should have won, honestly.  I think he would have been the greatest president ever. ",

And I'm like, oh, man, this guy definitely knows what he's talking about.  I was like bringing the gold back.  If you really think about it, every single conflict we've got going on in the United States stems from this fractional reserve banking system.  The only reason why we're doing corrupt stuff is to pay all these taxes to pay off this Fed on the debt that will never pay off.  You know, and it really, really changed my perspective on a lot of on a lot of things.  But obviously, I lost a lot of friends, a lot of friends.  And I was a very, very popular guy growing up.  You know, a lot of my opinions towards Obama would be very outspoken about this guy.  This guy is not for us.  He's not for America.  And yeah, I just I just kind of sat in the sidelines for a while.

He's got his ego through the roof.  He's like, you know, he's dating this girl.  Then he's dating another woman.  You know what I mean?  All these kids.  And he's like, nah, that's the American dream, that guy.  You know?  And I'm like, no.  It wasn't until... Late 2015, a little bit before he announced that he was running for president, that they were doing this town hall thing.  And I can't find the video anymore for life.  And if you can, that'll be fantastic.  But I believe it was MSNBC.  It was like a little town hall thing.  And they were asking him questions about just his stance on a lot of different things.  And they asked him about the war and Iraq.  And he was like, you know, the war in Iraq was a mistake.  We should never went into war with Iraq.  If anybody really did their research, they'd find out it was the Saudis.  OK, it was the Saudis.  Said it straight like that.  I was like, oh my God, he's talking about Saudi Arabia.  Other than Ron Paul, I never saw another politician straight up call out Saudi Arabia for doing 9-11 because those hijackers were Saudi Arabian.  They weren't Iraqi.  They weren't Afghani either. ",

I was watching with my boy, Gorber, watching in the room.  And I'm like, yo, this guy's talking about the Federal Reserve.  The only other person I heard talking about this was Ron Paul.
