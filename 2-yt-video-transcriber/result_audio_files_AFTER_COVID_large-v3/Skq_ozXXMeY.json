            "text": "Hey everybody, Writes Crispy here.  This next video comes to us from a channel called Jarvis out of Scottsville, Kentucky.  This man is recording his stroll down a county road that's adjacent to his property that his nightmare neighbors have convinced themselves is their own private property for some reason.  Now, this has been happening for a couple of years.  So Jarvis records the stroll with his friend as a witness.  And as you'll see, his nightmare neighbors just come out, accost him, yelling vulgarities and even admittedly threatening him.  They end up calling the sheriff's department.  and blaming him for the harassment, saying that he's harassing them.  When the sheriff's department arrives, the sheriff's deputy, who is ashamed to his sheriff and the community, ends up illegally detaining him.  He realizes his mistake and calls for backup.  A couple of other sheriff's deputies show up and help him cover up his mistake with even more mistakes.  Now, I only added a few of the many crazy parts of this video because I want you to go to Jarvis' channel and watch the entirety there.  Let him know Rights Crispy sent you.  Let me know what you think in the comments here.  And if you want to call to seek redress for our grievances, the Allen County Sheriff's Department's number and the deputies' names and badge numbers are in the description.  Let them know that they should be ashamed of these clowns in costume pretending to be upholding the law when all they're doing is enforcing stupid feelings from idiotic neighbors.  Enjoy the video.

Like, the county, you know, judge executive was saying that there's been many people do this, and he said the reason that they do it is because of cows.  You know, like, it's a slow-down cattle crossing.  And he says he only does it when there's chaos.  But I just don't know that to be true.  And the gate is right on either side of the road.
