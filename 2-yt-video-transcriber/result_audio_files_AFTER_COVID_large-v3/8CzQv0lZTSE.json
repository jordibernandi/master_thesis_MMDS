            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  And in this video that was requested by a Truth Seeker, I will be talking about Orlando Brown.  What happened to this very talented young man?  Let's talk.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is the Truth Show.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I've not done yet.  I mean, this is the Truth Show.  Oh, yes.  Orlando Brown was born on December 4, 1987, in Los Angeles, California.  Not sure of his parents.  I tried to research it.  If you know, let me know below.  But I do know that he used to stay with his grandmother.  Anyway, he's had a promising career since he was a child.  One of the first movies was in major pain.  Love that movie.  Still have the DVD and still crack up laughing to this day.  Go check it out.  I think it's on Prime Time, actually.  Amazon Prime Time.  He played in many movies, TV series, and so on and so forth in his many career endeavors.  Now let's get personal and serious.  A sign for his many crazy public appearances and headlines.  In April of 2008, at the age of 21 years old, he was reported to have gone missing after leaving his manager's house for a short trip to the 7th, 11th convenience store.  He later in 2016 got arrested in Torrance, California on a charge of domestic battery obstruction of justice, drug possession that he said he was going to sell.  He was also possession of a contraband in jail.  then in January of 2018, calling an altercation with his then-girlfriend in public, whereas police were called to the scene after he struck her in the parking lot of a police station.  Upon finding him, he was in possession of methamphetamine, which is an illegal stimulant drug.  Where he got these drugs, I have no idea.  He was released on bail, and he was supposed to show up in court but failed to show, so they put a warrant for his arrest.  However, later police were called to his private residence in response to a complaint of domestic disturbances between Brown and his girlfriend, yet again, I'm not sure if this is the same girlfriend or not, and his girlfriend's mother.  Well, he was once again faced with additional charges of domestic battery drug possession and resistant arrest.  And again, he was released yet again.  And he once again failed to appear in court and a warrant was again issued for his arrest.  He was later caught in April of 2018, hiding in the closet of a private homeowner by a bounty after fleeing to California, Nevada.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  He was arrested again in a taxi cab after leaving a prostitution hotel.  He was found with methamphetamine again and a pipe.  Oh, I'm still not done yet because months later in September of 2018, he was released from some medical facility where he had been hospitalized for mysterious reasons.  But whatever happened, he was later arrested yet again for breaking into Legends Restaurant and Venue and Las Vegas establishment owned by his childhood friend, Danny Boy.  While attempting to change the locks, police had found Brown on the roof of the building after security cameras showed him entering the building without permission.  Right on the street, he was kind of set up.  But this really takes the cake though.  Brown had appeared on Dr.  Phil in 2018.  Claiming to be Michael Jackson's son and that his name was Orlando Brown Prince Michael Jackson Jr.  I think it was kidding and probably high and just making all of this up.  Except for this part when he said that he has four children ranging from 16 and 18 years old.  Meaning Brown would have been between the ages of 13 and 15 years old.  He also claimed that he had been sober for four years at this time, despite being arrested earlier that year for drug possession and so on.  Oh, and there's more.  You see, Brown was arrested.  week after entering a drug facility after his close friends of his convinced him to do after an intervention he was found shortly after walking down the street barefoot carrying a box of wine.  oh yes.  and then of course recently he made a comment about Nick Cannon in which he said Nick Cannon once performed fellatio on him while dressed as a woman.  later Cannon responded to the claim on Instagram commenting.  When I first saw this, I thought it was blanking hilarious and later on saying we need better support systems for our youth and take care of our own.  I watch various of this young brother's videos and all I see is a cry for help.  So I don't know if there are any leaders or solid individuals in this young man's life, but let's embrace him and tighten him up so he doesn't become another lost victim to these Hollywood circumstances.  Notice he never denied it, as you can see, but I doubt if he did this.  But I do agree with Nick.  We do need to take care of our youth.  This talented young man was left to fend for himself and to deal with people who only wanted to use him.  I'm not sure how he got hooked to drugs, but that seems to be a pattern of many young Disney stars.  they turn into well you know and it's happening to many of them to be just a coincidence.  i pray for this young man.  he has no guidance and he need love and a great example.  i pray he gets it.  i was reading this and as a mother and a huge fan of his i feel like he was lost.  and i do agree with nick.  you know i feel like he was lost and he's dealing with a lot of demons the whole weight on the shoulders it seems.  I saw the picture of his eyes that was slightly dilated.  Oh, yes.  I'm sure he can tell us a lot, though, about what happened behind the scenes.  And some of it, we shouldn't take it as a rantings of a confused and disturbed young man.  I'm just saying.  Well, that's it.  Let me know your thoughts below.
