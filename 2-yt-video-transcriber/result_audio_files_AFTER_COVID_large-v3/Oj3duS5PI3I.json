Get ready, black America, because in 2020, we are going to watch black people die and We're going to be told that race issues are the worst that they've ever been, and we're going to be used like pawns to further power for a political party that really is going to leave us behind if they get that power back.  And it's happened.  You can go back and watch me speaking for the last three years when I've said this, and it's happened exactly as I said it's going to happen.  These protests are remarkably funded.  I don't care who you speak to.  Nobody has the time or the patience to riot for months straight because one person was killed unarmed by a police officer.  It's everywhere.  It's everywhere you go.  I mean, you even saw they were protesting in the UK about George Floyd.  So this is way bigger.  Antifa, it's organized.  I mean, these people, they've got bricks.  They've got Molotov cocktails.  I'm looking at an organized cell of terrorism that's hiding behind the idea that they're trying to further civil rights.  So I view Black Lives Matter as a terrorist group.  I view Antifa as a terrorist group.  And I think it's ridiculous to me that you have so many people that don't see that. ",

If Black Lives Matter, are we attacking illiteracy rates?  What are they doing in the community that they've been able to raise $50 million under an LLC structure?

So the people that are supporting this stuff, people that live in gated communities and have their own security guards, there'll be no impact.  But we're seeing what that impact is right now in the inner cities.  We're seeing in New York City when I think they reported two weeks ago a 267% increase in shootings and killings compared to the year before.  That's what the impact is going to be.  There's not just this random vacuum that happens when you go, okay, we're gonna get rid of the police, right?  It doesn't mean that all of a sudden nothing happens.  Somebody rises to take their place.  That's going to be gangs that take those places, right?  Because people are still going to look for some sort of a protection.  This is the stuff that we got rid of in the 80s when New York City was really bad, right?  Getting rid of the gang culture.  You're seeing a return to that right now.  We're seeing one-year-olds being killed in the street.  By the way, those one-year-olds and those babies that are being shot and killed in the streets because they can't get any control over Chicago and Baltimore and New York City, they're not being buried in gold caskets like George Floyd.  It's incredible.  And that's how you know.  this is political.  This is not about black lives.  Stop pretending this is about black lives.  Everything that they're doing, everything about their mission is to harm black lives.  On their website, they've listed they want to go against and to conquer the nuclear family, right?  I mean, they're against families.  They're anti-family.  Go read Karl Marx, right?  Go read the Communist Manifesto.  That's exactly, it literally mirrors everything and all of the Communist Manifesto's goals is what Black Lives Matter is after.  And why do they want to destroy the family?  Because it's the only way that government can replace family, right?  You have to make sure that there's nothing else.  There can be nothing else that competes with the word of the government.  There can be no God.  There's a strong layer of atheism that we're seeing, right?  There can be no religion.  There can be no God.  There can be no dad.  There can be no mom.  There can be only selfishness and narcissism and rioting and protesting and anger.  And what we're seeing is a communist movement that is taking hold in America. ",

Black people are naturally very conservative, right?  We are the most religious group in America, right?  We are the only group that has what's called a black church.  I mean, it's, it's so, you know, it's an odd thing to say, what is the black church, but there is a black church.  And the reason for that, the reason that we have such a stronghold on faith and on family is because it had to mean so much to us because of our earlier oppressions, I mean, even in the reconstruction era following slavery, the number one thing that black Americans did when they got their rights back was get married.  They went and they looked for long lost relatives that were traded off onto different plantations.  This stuff meant so much to black America.  And now we're seeing an organization that was not put together by black people, that is not funded by black people, right?  That money is not going to black people.  that is trying to strip away all of those things and say that they're doing it in the name of progressivism and because they want to be against racism, when actually they're looking at the old playbook of what Democrats did when they had us as slaves and reintroducing it under this guise of progressivism.
