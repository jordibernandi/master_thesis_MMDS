But one thing I can tell you, in prison, they do allow you to watch the news.  That's probably one of the few things they allow you to watch on TV.  And he did have an opinion.  You know, why wouldn't he?  He lost his son.  along a roadside while he was trying to change a flat tire.  So this is urban Hollywood.  Bill Cosby weighs in on George Floyd killing and protests.

Cosby, who was serving a three to 10 year prison term for his 2018 conviction on charges of indecent aggravated assault.  released a written statement Tuesday via his publicist, Andrew Wyatt.  When I think about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the countless other Black people murdered by racial hatred, I could not help but think about my son, Ennis, who was also brutally murdered, said Cosby.  The comedian's son, Ennis Cosby, was shot to death in 1997 during a robbery attempt on a Bel Air roadside where he was changing a spare tire.  Before racial hatred shot our beloved Ennis in the head and abruptly ended his life, this raging infernal of racial hatred stated, Denier.  before he pulled the trigger.  I understand the pain.  I understand the helplessness.  And I too understand that no parent has willingly filled out an application to become a member of the.  My Child Was Murdered by Racial Hatred Club, Cosby stated.  The murders of innocent Black people will never end until the establishment acknowledged that we are the architects of this prison of racism in America.  They continue to teach racial hatred around the dinner tables.  They continue to fuel racial hatred by portraying Black people negatively on television and movies, and they continue to enhance racial hatred by placing their knee on the necks of Black people, no matter their education, success, or fame,\" he added.  The Cosby Show star also blasted police departments for responding to the protests with officers in tactical gear.  Yes, protests are meaningful and powerful when they are done in a peaceful manner, he wrote.  But mayors and governors of Minneapolis, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Birmingham, And other cities can't send police officers out in tactical gear, ready and willing to inflict bodily harm, which doesn't reflect peace nor the expectation of a peaceful protest.  Come on, people.  Let's not squander a golden opportunity.  Officers, remove your tactical gear, remove your guns, put on your full armor of God.  and march with the people whom you have made your enemies,\" Cosby said.  I will continue to pray that God provides the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the countless other Black people murdered by racial hatred with wisdom, understanding, and peace during these difficult times.  Please be mindful and be safe.  Cosby maintains his innocence and is hoping a state Supreme Court review of the case will result in a new trial.  In April, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued an executive order that allowing many seniors to be released on house arrest amid the coronavirus pandemic, but Cosby's request for release was denied.
