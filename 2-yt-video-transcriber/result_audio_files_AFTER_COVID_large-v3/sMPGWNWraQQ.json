And have some useless hashtag on social media, put South Africa first.  That is a narrow nationalism.  Because the problem of black people is not the problem of South Africa.  A black man is hated everywhere.  Be it in China, be it in France, be it everywhere.  You cannot say South Africa first.  We must say black first.  and defend the black lives everywhere.  It's not a problem of Nigeria.  It is a problem of self-hate.  We must begin to love ourselves.  Then we'll never have a problem anyway.  So, charity begins at home.  The hatred of a black skin must stop here in South Africa and all over Africa.  There is no Botswana.  There is no Swaziland.  There is no Lesotho.  We are one family.
