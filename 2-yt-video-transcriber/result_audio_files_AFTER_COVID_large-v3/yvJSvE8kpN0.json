You've been doing this for a long time, writing some great articles for goldmoney.com and digging into the silver world as well.  Although you are in London and where I guess a lot of this SLV silver is stored.  And Andrew McGuire going to be joining us momentarily, who's talked about it on my show.  And I hear speculation.  He thinks it's impossible that as much metal as they claim to be adding.  The numbers are staggering.  how much supposedly gone into these trusts.  So anything you could share there? ",

            "text": "Well, Andrew and I actually had a \u2013 we had a discussion ahead of this because, you know, sort of both of us are on the same slot, as it were.  It seemed to me that \u2013 I mean, Andrew's really \u2013 he's really got his finger on the button when it comes to what's going on in the markets.  He'll know things about delivery and all the rest of it, all that technical stuff he is best at.  So I'm going to leave that to him if I can.  But what I would rather \u2013 like to do, which was probably going slightly off piece for you, is I would like to give you my view as to the background, if you like, for silver.  And it's an economic background, and it actually has to do with the demise of paper money.  So what I would like to do is I'd like to take everybody through that so they can get an idea as to what I think about silver, why I think about thinking about silver, and therefore how I see silver having a monetary role in the future.  So I think if I can kick off, I mean, basically for 2020 and beyond, I'm extremely bearish on the global economy.  My reasons are very simple, and that is if you go back to last September, we had a liquidity crisis.  Now, a lot of people who've been locked down in COVID and very much involved with that might have forgotten that very fact.  And if we go back a bit further, we saw that global trade started contracting.  and it started contracting.  Why?  Because there was a trade war, tariff war between America and China.  So we have three events feeding into each other.  The first two are bad enough.  Tariffs plus liquidity problems, which actually rise from the end of the bank credit cycle.  The credit cycle basically is quite simple.  You get long periods of expansion, followed by sudden falling off the cliff, and suddenly all the bankers turn risk averse.  Now, in 1929, we had the combination of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and the end of the bank credit expansion part of the cycle.  And we know what happened in 1929.  I mean, initially, stock prices fell by about 33%.  And guess what S&P did earlier this year?  Fell by 33%.  There was then a recovery, the recovery carried on until I think around about May 1930, when President Hoover then signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act into law, and the Dow just went down and down and down until it lost 89% of its value from the top.  That was a major bear market, obviously by any standard, and it led into the problems of the 1930s.  We are on the cusp of a similar situation.  The principal difference is that we have fiat money today, which is being expanded without limitation to try and stop a 1929 to 1936 situation.  And that's against gold.  So, I mean, you had a gold standard which operated then, certainly until 1933, when everybody was told, you're not allowed to own gold.  This is in America.  And then in 1934, there was a devaluation from 20.67 to $35, which held all the way through to the gold pool failure in the late 1960s.  So the price background is very different.  Otherwise, the thing is very similar.  And on top of that, we've got COVID lockdowns.  So how can anyone be optimistic about the economic outlook?  Now, I have quite a lot of people keep on sort of telling me, well, it's deflationary because what they see is they see the bankers not liking the amount of risk ahead of them.  And what they want to do is they want to reduce their balance sheets.  Every sympathy with that.  But the one thing we know is that the Fed will not permit the total amount of money in the economy to contract.  So every move towards bank credit contraction will be more than made up.  by the expansion of base money, M1, if you like, narrow money.  Now, this was actually what the FOMC said back on the 23rd of March when they panicked.  I mean, everybody was beginning to go into lockdown.  On the 16th of March, they cut the Fed funds rate from 1% to zero.  And then on the 23rd, which was a Monday, panic statement comes out.  We will do whatever it takes.  We will print whatever it takes to sort out this problem.  And of course, they were talking about Covid.  They weren't talking about the other problems.  They're still there.  We have a 1929 situation without Covid.  This, my friend, is an extremely serious situation.  And how is it going to be resolved?  It will be resolved any one way.  And that is through money printing.  So that is the background, if you like, to gold and silver and the prices.  And indeed, since that March statement, we have seen gold take off.  We have seen silver take off as well with the gold silver ratio falling from a high of about one hundred and twenty five or one hundred twenty seven was top.  Currently, we're running at about 72 with a lot further to fall, I think.  Now, the thing that's interesting is that we've all been talking about gold, of course, because that is the big money.  That is the money which is recognized as money by central banks.  It is the money where there is no counterparty risk if you actually own the bullion.  And I'd just like to say, incidentally, that I'm talking about money.  I'm not talking about an investment.  And listeners, participants in this conference must not confuse physical gold, physical silver, as an investment, it is money, that's the whole thing.  Now what's happening to silver is it is coming back as money.  And that is why from literally the moment the Fed said, we will do whatever it takes, we will print however much money it takes, the inflationary outlook, the prospect of the demise of fiat currencies meant that a degree of moneyness began to return to silver.  And silver indeed ran up from, I can't remember what the low was, $11 or something, and currently we're looking at, what, $26, $27.  Now, the question really is, what role will silver play as money in this new world?  Well, this is interesting, because if you go back in history, Silver in England actually was money from the time of Henry II all the way through to around about 1820-ish when we were actually off the standard at that stage.  But sterling silver was money all that time.  Gold was a secondary issue when it came to money.  um in the early days of america when um god bless you you were one of our colonies you took on the role of silver as money.  gold had a secondary role in effect and it you know we went into bimetabolism bimetalism and um you know others have done that as well.  and then in uh 1870 um And the Germans won the Franco-Prussian War against France and France had to pay reparations.  They didn't have any silver.  They had gold.  They paid gold to Germany.  Germany then had enough gold to say, right, we're going to go off silver.  We're going to go on a gold standard.  So really, from that point, silver really did lose its moneyness to gold.  And the ratio between gold and silver actually started rising very dramatically because the price of silver fell to the price, if you like, of the next useful asset.  role for it, which basically was as a precious metal rather than money.  So that was the background to it, to the history of silver.  The reason I mention this is that silver is as much money as gold.  throughout history, and probably it has been more the money of people than gold ever was.  Gold, if you like, is the money of kings, silver is the money of people.  And when we get the demise of paper currencies, I can see silver certainly returning as money a lot easier for most people than for gold.  Because more people have got things like silver items and so on and so forth, which they could melt down or swap or whatever.  There are a huge number of silver coins around.  I would think more so than gold.  I don't know what the statistics are, but I'd be very surprised if there are more gold coins around than silver coins.  So I can see silver playing a major role as the replacement money for fiat currency in this brave new world, which we are undoubtedly going to face, and I think we'll probably face fairly quickly.  And it's also worth noting that the above-ground stocks of gold are considerably larger than the above-ground stocks of silver because silver is always consumed.  And the relationship, as I understand it, is that there's probably about $35 billion worth of silver above ground.  Gold, gold over 10 trillion.  Now, that's a relationship of about 280 times as much above-ground stock of gold as there is of silver.  Yet the mine supply ratio is only about eight times.  So you can see that the situation could get very, very tight in terms of silver at anything like even far higher prices.  So I would expect that gold silver ratio certainly in the sort of scenario that I've just described, the collapse of the currency, to return to Sir Isaac Newton's 15 and a half.  And I think I could even justify it going below that.  I mean, the point about Isaac Newton's 15 and a half ratio of silver ounces to gold was that actually overpriced gold, particularly following various gold discoveries in Guinea, which was where we got the term the Guinea.  And then in the 19th century, we had gold discoveries obviously in California, then Australia, and then South Africa.  I mean, the quantity of gold just absolutely rocketed.  So as a monetary metal, we have pretty good evidence to suggest that silver should be more expensive if you like on a gold silver ratio than that isaac newton's 15 and a half to one.  so that to my mind is the background and i think that um Given that the likelihood of the ending of fiat currencies happening quite quickly, really what we need to do, I think, is ensure that we've got silver in our hands as well as gold.  And at current prices, it makes more sense to load up on silver, in my view, than gold.  So if I can, I don't know how long I've been speaking, but I can go on, I can bore for England.  So do you want me to leave it at that for a moment and ask questions? ",

I don't know what can I guess.  I mean, it is a problem, I think, working that one out because, as I said earlier, the relationship of above-ground stock of gold is absolutely enormous, like 280 times the amount of above-ground silver.  So on that basis, I think we've got something like $3 billion.  dollars worth of gold and silver and platinum group metals but it's basically gold and silver.  um i would have thought in terms of weight yes probably more silver than gold.  um i can certainly see that.  but in terms of monetary value i should think it's probably more gold than silver and that would um.  That would, I think, if you like, sort of fall in line with the fact that every time we talk about sound money, we only talk in terms of gold.  Gold, silver is rather like sort of the junior version.  And we talk about gold and we just assume that everybody knows that it sort of incorporates silver as well.  So I think as this situation progresses, I would see demand switching towards silver.  But the important thing is the amount of silver available for what they call investment, but I'm telling you it's money, is actually very, very strictly limited. ",
