            "text": "Wow, welcome to some more Cody.  I'm News and happy new year.  Good riddance to 2020.  Remember that horrible pandemic that's still going on, but it's 2021 and this year has all new features.  Like another election.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So we're going to do this Georgia runoff.  Georgia runoff.  It's Georgia runoff time.  So, okay.  So the Georgia runoff is happening on January 5th and in an election when no candidate gets over 50% of the vote, you have what's called a runoff, which is also what happens when you drink too many Mountain Dew Garitas.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  So the Senate race is between Republican Purdue farms, and Democrat Tom Microsoft.  And the other Senate runoff is between Republican Kelly Lough... Lough... Falafel... Kelly Loof Balloons and Democrat Raphael Warnock.  So why should we care when we already had an election like two months ago?  Well, shut up!  Shut up!  Okay, I mean it.  Get in real close, okay?  I'm going to tell you.  Listen.  Listen.  This runoff election is going to unite the entire country.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, should want the Democrats, John Hasselhoff and Raphael Warlock to win.  It doesn't matter who you are.  Democrats, leftists, Trump supporters, grifters, grovers, the malnourished brain-sucking parasite that lives under Tim Pool's beanie.  Yes, everyone.  except maybe Nancy Pelosi, should be thrilled with Democrats winning the runoff.  And I'll tell you why right after I chug this Pedialyte Tums and Schnapps cocktail, okay?  Okay, so first off, Democrats want the Democrats to win, because as averse as Democrats seem to be to winning and attaining power, occasionally, as a treat, they like it.  You know, spice things up.  But also, disillusioned leftists who are growing increasingly bitter about the Democratic establishment and have to keep eating Tums to deal with frustration-induced GI distress, You should have wanted the Democrats to win too, because otherwise the government will be in definite gridlock as opposed to probable gridlock, with Republicans trying to block everything except military funding, bailouts for corporations, and the ritualistic killing of endangered birds.  So centrist establishment Democrats can sit on their fucking thumbs and go, well, golly, golly, gee, we wish we could give you COVID relief.  We wish we could stop the planet from burning.  But heck, oh, geez, oh, gosh, those rascally Republicans are blocking us and using executive orders or rallying people to protest.  Well, that would be super hecking uncivil.  We want to help.  We do, but can't.  Gridlock means nothing but the most right-leaning neoliberal pro-corporation legislation could pass through the Senate.  Something that deficit hawk Nancy Pelosi would love almost as much as she loves sarcastically clapping, which is so not very much at all.  But if Democrats win the Senate, the Biden administration and the Democratic establishment have no excuses, I mean, they'll definitely come up with more excuses, but it'll be one less excuse to stop from maybe actually passing some, some kind of relief bill and some kind of environmental protections, even if that means setting on fire a little bit less.  And even if not, at least they can't mope and blame Republicans for blocking them for four years without building any movements on the ground.  Oh, you know, like the last four years of the Obama administration that led to, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh yeah, this guy.  probably someone just slightly, slightly less dumb and more competent, but with the same fashy politics who could actually pull off full-blown Trumpism much better will be next.  And wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't that be... Wouldn't it be... So you're probably thinking, Cody, you make great coherent points and all, but why would Trump supporters want the Democrats to win?  How does that make sense?  Well, your first mistake is trying to make sense.  Making sense is for crooks and losers who don't want to stop this.  You see, in Georgia, Trump quote unquote lost.  But Georgia's elections are controlled by Republican politicians.  Georgia's governor is Republican Brian Kemp.  Georgia's voting system implementation manager, Gabriel Sterling, is a conservative.  And the judges ruling against Trump's court cases are judges that Trump appointed himself.  So this means that the Republicans controlling Georgia's elections either don't want to jettison their entire career for a failed fascist whose legal team is even too woo-woo conspiracy theory for Trump's taste, or far more likely, the entire Republican Party of Georgia has turned against Trump, stealing the election from him in order to get their dirty, dirty mitts on that sweet, sweet pile of Antifa money.

Stop the steal!  Stop the steal!  Stop the steal!  Look, I don't even think Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue want to win this election.  I mean, they probably wanna get back to insider trading off the pandemic.  Like how Loeffler sold over $18 million worth of stocks right after a COVID-19 Intel briefing on January 24th, 2020.  Purdue also had suspiciously unusual stock trading activity after that COVID Intel briefing, something we in the stock trading biz like to call the old pandemic dump off.  But don't worry, when asked about whether members of Congress should be barred from trading stocks, the charismatic human being charmed her way out of it here.  Senator, should members of Congress be barred from trading stocks? ",

Or if a necromancer saws off the head of Lindsey Graham while inside a circle of salt.  Do we have a clip?  So no, no clip.  Anyway, even though the last thing anyone wants to deal with is another election, we just, we have to get through this one little runoff and our country will be fully healed.  Wait, sorry, no, that's a little bit of guac on my notes.  It says our country will be healed only after decades of hard work, pain, sweat, and possible extraterrestrial intervention.  So it's good guac.  So anyway, I know it sucks to have to care about another election after being hung over from the previous election, but politics is like staying hydrated, okay?  Not gonna do it.  You have to stay hydrated throughout the year, not just during the one big super soaker event every four years, but constant hydration through activism, protests, direct action, donating time and money to activist groups, learning about, voting in, and advocating for local elections, primarying centrist so hard they feel it in the bowels of their precious status quo.  We can't escape politics because politics shapes the world around us.  So let's crush politics.  Get absolutely crunk on politics.  Yovo, you only vote on multiple occasions and down ballot while also staying politically engaged in many other often more important ways.  So get out there and do your preferred types of political engagement.  How's it going?  phone banking for Georgia, Katie?  Hi, yes, hello. ",
