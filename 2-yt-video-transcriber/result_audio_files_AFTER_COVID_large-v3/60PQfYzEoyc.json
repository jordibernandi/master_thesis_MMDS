            "text": "This November, we have an opportunity to harness your energy and momentum into political power and not just defeat Trump, but also flip the Senate.  Here are six key races you should be paying attention to.  The first is North Carolina Republican Senator Tom Tuis, notable for his Olympic gold flip-flops.  He voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then offered a loophole-filled replacement that excluded many with pre-existing conditions.  In 2014, Tillis took the position that climate change was not a fact, and later urged Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord before begrudgingly acknowledging the realities of climate change in 2018.  And in 2019, Although briefly opposing Trump's emergency border wall declaration, he almost immediately caved under pressure.  Patelis' real legacy is the restrictive 2013 voter suppression law he helped pass as Speaker of the North Carolina House. ",
