This is a really, really, really common talking point with fascists, okay?  You may hear it a lot in the term the silent majority, you know, the will of the people.  When people don't have a good argument, instead what they defer to is like, hey listen, all these people agree with me, all these people agree with me, look at them, they're all so angry at what you're doing.  You are standing in their way.  So it's a way of sort of deflecting the responsibility.  Instead of answering to you, instead now they're answering to the general public that you've constructed.  It's a really effective tactic.  Populists do it all the time.  I think fascists do it like way more aggressively though.  Generally speaking, when a leftist wants to make an argument, even if a leftist purports to speak for the working class, usually the leftist is willing to make an argument on its own merits. ",

If you watch Fox News two years ago, it wasn't like... they didn't do this as much.  Like they would lie sometimes, but it was usually like a bad interpretation or their pundits would come out and they would say some stupid shit.

There are literally now leaked recordings of him threatening people into trying to overturn the election.  Republicans don't give a fuck about this.  Is this legal?  I genuinely don't know whether or not this meets the definition of blackmailing.  Trump has the ability to dictate, like, a lot of public opinion for other Republican officials.  He could actually make or break other people's re-elections.  I don't know.  I'm not going to pretend to be a lawyer.  Regardless of the legality, this is obviously corrupt.  It's obviously corrupt.  It's undeniably corrupt.  Like, for him to personally call people, that seems so unhinged.  You know, like, in the movie, you have, like, the bad guy, but then, like, towards the end, his, like, shirt button's undone, and, like, his hair's mussed up a little bit, and he goes... He's like, I'll handle it myself.  And he, like, personally goes to, like, the laboratory and starts shooting scientists or something.  Like, that's how I feel.  Yeah, like Azula or whatever.  I feel like that's where we're at right now.  Donald Trump is personally making these calls, making these threats.  There's no reason why anyone else couldn't have done this.  But it would have been more threatening if he did it.  There's a really big difference between somebody saying, hey, I work with the Trump admin.  We need to talk to you about these fake claims I just made up.  And the president of the United States just saying it himself.  Very big difference between those things.  Very, very big difference.  Oh, God.  Well, nice meme.  Oh, can we get... The meme.  Quickly, a little bit of hopium.  Remember, folks, there actually has been some positive news over the past couple of weeks.  Namely, Republican support of Trump has dropped, I think, by four points.  I think it went from 96 to 92 following Biden winning the... Biden winning the election, Biden's support is unchanged.  I think Biden right now has a 55% approval rating, which is higher than Trump has ever had.  Additionally, in all likelihood, because of Trump's insane fucking behavior over the past couple of weeks, Warnock and Ossoff have pulled ahead of Loeffler and Perdue, respectively.  By narrow margins, mind, but that's still a pull ahead.  If Trump's incompetence ends up getting both of these seats turned blue, that would be pretty extraordinary.  but don't trust the polls.  yeah guys don't trust the polls.  what does this mean?  this means absolutely nothing but it's something.  it means nothing but it is something absolutely nothing but it is something.  do you think Dave Rubin is worth addressing at this point in online discourse?  oh I'd love to talk to Dave Rubin sometime.  it'd be really fun to make fun of him.  that guy's so fucking stupid holy shit.
