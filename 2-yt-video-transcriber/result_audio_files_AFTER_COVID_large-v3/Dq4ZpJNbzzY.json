And we pick and guide, fresh out, this our patriot party.  Only paying MAGA music, we don't listen to Cardi.  And they said they want war, well then let's get it started.  Who is that?  Why is it coming through with the MAGA hat?  I don't follow rules, only God, and they mad at that.  I keep it a hundred, my haters ain't even half of that.  2A, put my magazine in my MAGA strap.  Hey, I know people that doubt it, they really mad.  I made it wait in line, now I cut a head like I'm the captain.  Played in red hats everywhere.  Real white and blue fabric waving right wing.  I mean, yeah, that's what my dad was saying.  Pro-life abortion is murder is what I mean.  If either a man or a woman, there is no in-between.  Use your preferred pronouns.  What you mean?  You could follow the world.  I'd rather follow the king.  That's Christ.  I'm not on the fence.  I don't lean.  I get a new hater every time I phone lean.  I'm hated by the world, but that means that I'm blessed.  I keep it real and I let God handle the wrecks.  I'm real mad. ",
