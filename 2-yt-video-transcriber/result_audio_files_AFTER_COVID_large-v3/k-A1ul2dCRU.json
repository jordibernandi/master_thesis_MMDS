            "text": "How's the royal family?  I pray that everyone is doing well.  Well my royal family I am very very pissed to the core.  And there are some things that are festering in me related to the world of YouTube.  And the type of person that I am, the way that I'm made up, I cannot walk around with this type of energy because I will not put out good quality videos to the royal family.  So I know some people is probably wondering, well, what is going on with True Royal?  Well, I received an email, and I'm going to read it, and I'm not going to give up no names, about 20 hours ago.  And let me read it first.  So I got this email.  It says... Now, the person I got this email from has always been very nice.  She's always been very cordial, never been no drama at all.  So I wanted to put that disclosure out there because I know eventually she will see this.  I hope this is what she said.  I hope.  I hope it's, damn, let me slow down.  I hope it was not you that he was speaking of.  I see you higher than that.  If it is you, leave the brother alone and let our family gather together however we can.  there are a lot of us that are still waking up.  Love you.  So she's talking about the elder.  And I was blindsided when I got the, um, the email.  Cause I was like, what is going on?  So first I, um, emailed her back and I haven't got a response back.  I said, uh, What happened, Queen, with question marks?  And that was like 19 hours ago.  So then I said, well, I got to go over to the Elder's channel to find out what the hell going on.  So I went over to the Elder's channel.  Let me read the title of this.  And the title that he has for this video is called A Message to Black YouTubers Who Are Hating on Me.  So I listened to the video.  It's slightly over five minutes.  So I responded 17 hours ago and I said, I have never made a video or talk bad about the elder.  Here is my email.  Anyone can send me a video doing this crazy shit.  I'm clueless to what is going on.  So I went back to the person that emailed me and I said, I reached out to him to see what is going on.  I'm clueless and I would not mess with one of our elders.  That is wrong.  So when things fester in you, you know, some things that kicked in in my psyche that I had thought I had let go long ago.  So when I had my first channel, a white supremacist and one of our own that was out of their damn mind threatened the elder and I mean it was vicious it was nasty.  so I put up a video.  that's when I was really green to YouTube and um reached out to him and like hey these people are threatening you and trying to get your channel shut down.  that's how I get.  I'll do that even now somebody.  I didn't understand why somebody would come to my channel to threaten this man's life and then one our own has such hatred for him that would do that.  and it was like in the same day.  so I didn't even know what the hell was going on back there.  so I did that.  so then I got to thinking there was an incident that happened One morning, the elder was doing what the elder do.  He put up a video one morning and he was thanking all the queens.  And I happened to be on that live stream.  Lisa Cabrera happened to be on.  There was a bunch of us on there.  Well, later that evening, Dirty Kitchen made a series of videos and said this man had trashed her and talked bad about her.  And I was like, that ain't true.  We was all over there listening to him complimenting sisters.  And so there were numerous people saying to the elder that he didn't do that.  People made videos.  I went over, there was a bunch of us went over there and he did not want to hear what anybody had to say.  He said that all people do is pick on this woman.  And that ain't the first time she didn't pull shit like that.  And so it didn't matter what we said.  He wasn't fucking with it.  That's okay.  It is what it is.  You can only do what you can do.  Okay.  So then the drama come up with dirty kitchen and, um, Lisa Cabrera and some people, um, don't know who she is.  It'd be either the radical home goddess or, um, the radical sister or whatever she called her channel.  And, um, He made a video saying that Lisa Cabrera is sending people over to his channel to harass him.  And Lisa naturally was supposed to defend herself.  And she said, I ain't did nothing like that.  And how he responded to certain things is, I don't know nothing about that.  And usually when somebody responds like that, when they say they don't know nothing about that, they don't want to deal with that.  So when somebody accused you of something like that, yeah, you're going to feel some kind of way.  So how he dealt with that, with the Lisa Cabrera situation, he just took the video down.  Okay, so y'all hold me to a higher motherfucking standard.  Well, I hold all YouTubers to a higher standard.  Will they meet those standards?  Absolutely not.  So the true royal family kept being brought up on his video and the whole tap or something like that.  Now I'm a responsible content creator and I'd be damned if anybody trash my name.  I done been through some shit and I ain't gonna put up with no shit.  Now the elder, he got to be responsible too.  And I understand people got to wake up and all that type of shit.  But if you're going to hold me to the fire, I'm going to hold them to the fire too.  But they may not meet those standards.  This man ain't no dumb man speaking like he don't know what's going on and all that kind of shit like that.  I ain't going along with that.  You speak with very clear diction when you talk about me because I don't do that shit.  I'm not known for fucking with people.  I don't go out of my way to fuck with people.  I've been accused of going and trolling people's channels.  And I said, if I'm a troll your channel, I ain't hiding behind shit.  You're going to know it's me doing it.  We don't have time for that.  I don't have time for that.  My mind is somewhere else.  I'm worried about our folks.  A lot of us are worried about this coronavirus and all of this.  But see, somebody could put something out and you got people that's donating to your channel and may think, oh, so this is how you get down behind the scenes?  You're irresponsible.  I want somebody to show where I have been messing with the elder.  I want somebody to show the video, show the comment and all of that.  And you come to me and we put up a live stream.  All right.  I'm not going to hide behind nothing, but it pissed me off because I reached out and I got no response.  And I don't like being accused of shit.  that I simply did not do.  I don't even go over there and watch his videos or anything like that.  That's why it blew me off.  I was like, what the hell going on?  I had to dig around and I don't get no response.  You know, I give it a little time and all of that.  And I mean, the sister, I thank her for sending me that because she said, I see you hired in that and I appreciate that.  But I don't do that type of shit.  But see, when you don't get a response, over time you start thinking and the shit start festering and then it grows into other things.  So I said, I gotta get this shit off my chest.  I'm pissed.  Oh, I'm pissed to the core.  You don't throw my name around like that.  You don't put that out there like that when it comes to the true royal family or true royal.  You don't do that to me.  Because I'm going to come at you head first.  Now we can try to resolve a misunderstanding and all that kind of shit behind the scene.  Yes.  But I think over like 5,000 people done watched that and they be like, oh, so this is what you were all along?  You know, she speaking all righteous and shit like that.  And then behind the scenes, she being greasy and slimy and messing with folks.  And this is where I tell people to do their own motherfucking thinking.  Somebody comment and get taken down.  Somebody been a mod and then the rich get taken down and we fucking repeatedly keep telling y'all that YouTube is screwing over our channels.  And you got to do some thinking.  I've been on this person's channel for the longest.  I ain't never had no back and forth or bantering anything and then the slightest motherfucking thing go wrong.  Oh, you got a problem with me?  You get these long ass emails and shit like that.  And I'm like, I don't have no drama with you.  I'm trying to put out decent videos.  I vowed after all that drama that I went through, with all them little silly ass little girls and all that shit lying on me and stuff like that.  And that silly shit that I went through with Dirty Kitchen.  I said, if anybody, anybody, and I mean, I don't care who it is, come with me on drama on my channel.  I will cut you off.  I ain't making no announcements or none of that because that's redirecting energy.  And I don't like redirecting energy.  But I must stand firm on my position on this.  You're not going to accuse me of something that I simply did not motherfucking do.  And we all in our life have been accused of doing shit that we did not do.  I don't have a character of fucking with people.  So I like how the sister at least came to me and said, well, I see you hired in that.  All right.  But at some point in time, there are some messy ass content creators out here and people scared to mention their name and all that.  But they have no problem mentioning everybody else's name.  And I don't have a motherfucking problem mentioning their name, too.  They irresponsible, they reckless and all that shit.  And then people are highly dysfunctional and want to cradle them and babysit them and let them be highly dysfunctional.  And then you come over to me and you demand to me to be responsible, which I have no problem with.  But if you drop my motherfucking name, I'm going to drop your motherfucking name.  Don't come at me like that.  Don't come at me like that because I don't get down like that.  I'm a down to earth, genuine person with flaws.  I stumble and fall with the best of them.  I'm not going to give y'all a picture of perfection.  I often have said, I can let you down, but lie on me, make up something on me.  Oh, I'm using thy voice because I can spit with the best of them.  and I keep it core with the royal family.  We don't have time to be playing.  See, when people playing like that, they wasting people's time.  We are dealing with some very major things in the universe.  So in order for me to be able to do these videos, not being pent up with a bunch of anger and being pissed to the motherfucking core.  I had to get this energy off of me because it's festering.  And I don't like when people do that.  So I'm just letting y'all know and y'all can go run whoever I talked about and they name and all that shit that I don't fuck with nobody on nobody's channel.  I ain't never fucked with the elder.  I have defended the elder more than I should have defended the elder, but he ain't been responsible and he can be reckless with his mouth.  And I'm going to leave it right there.  So my royal family, render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I... ",
