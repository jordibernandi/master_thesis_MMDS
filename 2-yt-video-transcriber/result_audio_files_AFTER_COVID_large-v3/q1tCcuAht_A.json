Now they have frowned over the way the Chinese have treated the Nigerians and other African citizens over there because the Chinese threw out some of these African citizens from their hotels, from their homes, never allowed them to shop for what to buy or even what to eat.  Now, while they were sitting on Tuesday, the lawmakers have said that every Chinese living in Nigeria who don't have proper documents will be sent out of Nigeria.  Let's take a look at this video. ",

Given the sensitivity of the coronavirus, I told my security operatives to hold the six Chinese and the two Ugandans to give me time to cross-check with the Migrations Office in Entebbe and the Ministry of Health.  Indeed, I started with the Migrations Office.  When they checked the records, they told me this people entered Uganda on the 10th and they were put on self-quarantine in a Kibuli African hotel.  Self-quarantines would have taken 14 days, which will elapse up to tomorrow.  So they would be officially allowed to move on the 25th.  But on the 10th day, they violated the 14 days given, which was on the 20th.  they decided to go.  Actually, they sneaked out of the area of confinement.
