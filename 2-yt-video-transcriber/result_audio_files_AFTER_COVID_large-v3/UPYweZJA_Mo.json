You know how many times I've chased you out of the elevator in the hall?  You were so present and we were allowed to fight.  We should... We should... We should fall asleep together every night.  But perpetuate the fight.  What?  Every single time you get dressed and you fucking split the top of a fight.  Never fight me.  You split and you love me because you wanted some safety, some security, some stability, a foundation.  But I need the fight.  You know, like, don't walk away from me.  Okay.  We've got to change how we do things.  And I want to trust you.  And I feel like all the trust is gone.  All the fucking trust. ",
