            "text": "At the moment, there is a very, very, very important industrial dispute going on.  And one of the things that we're going to be doing with this media outlet is to give a platform to people who most of the media otherwise either ignore or marginalise or attack.  And we do live in a country where most of the British media are as hostile as possible to working people when they take action.  action to defend themselves their rights their security and their pay and they attack the biggest democratic movement in the country the trade unions and treat them as though they have no democratic legitimacy whilst bosses are put on tv and radio as though they're impartial voices.  so This is very important.  Across the country right now, British gas workers are on strike.  Their terms and conditions are under attack.  Now, this is a terrible crisis we're all in, but that's not an excuse to ignore the attacks taking place against working people at an already pretty horrific time.  So I'm very, very honoured to be able to introduce our final guest today, Paul Volz, who is calling from Cannock.  He's a service and repair engineer.  Paul, I'm going to give you the floor.  Firstly, could you just explain to us, just set out exactly.  I mean, firstly, solidarity and huge support to you.  Just tell us, what have British Gas done?  Why have you gone on strike? ",

And we've been rewarded with fire and rehire tactics against us to take over our contracts.  You know, it's left the engineers feeling, myself, I've never suffered from anxiety or stress.  And I can tell you now, I've had anxiety, stress, sleepless nights over this.  You know, and it's been absolutely horrific.  And for a company to treat its workforce like this, when we've given our absolute all, just, you know, it's disgusting, really.  It really is disgusting. ",

A lot of people in middle class office jobs, a lot of people, journalists, people like myself can work at home.  What's it been like for you?  Because you've had to keep doing your job.

I mean, you try your best to protect yourself and do all the things that you're told to do.  But, you know, you're inside that property and... People have been very nervous about it.  The company has kind of expected us to work in COVID-positive properties, almost encouraged us that we should be working in COVID-positive properties.  And, you know, to then turn around after we've delivered food parcels to the Trussell Trust and sort of say, we're taking your contracts from you, you know, it's just disgusting.  It's abhorrent.  It really is, you know.  I never thought a company, a brand like British Gas, would do that to their workforce.  Never thought it could happen.

And what I would really like is if anybody watching or anybody who's going to catch up on this podcast, just please go on to the Stop the British Gas Fire hashtag and just share all our videos and just see everything on there because you'll understand the whole story.  The mainstream media is giving us no coverage whatsoever.  This Twitter and social media is our only way to show what's really happening.  it's our only way and we just need the great British public to just get behind us because this if this is allowed this will go across every single company in this land and people the great British people need to wake up and see what's happening and what's going to happen to people's working contracts.  it's happening to us and I must admit when it was happening to British Airways I did take notice.  but when it's happening to you when it's your working contract being taken away from you for 18 years it's there's nothing worse.

Absolutely fantastic.  It's a fantastic feeling to stand up and not be beaten by these people, not be beaten, not allow them to just come in and bully and intimidate us and try and take our contracts from us.  It's a fantastic feeling.  We have had so much solidarity.  You know, we don't want to be on strike.  There's snow and ice on the ground out there.  If they stop this fire and re-hire, we'll get back in our vans tonight and we'll go and help our customers.  This isn't about money.  This is about... a lot deeper than that.  it's nothing to do with money.  we we accepted pay freezes.  we'll take pay freezes but we cannot have our family time taken away from us.  it's unfair.  we already work so many hours we work loads of weekends we work lights and we cannot have any more.

People who do know the last thing people ever want to do is go on strike.  You really have to be posh to your absolute limit to even consider going on strike.  No one does it frivolously.  No one does it for a bit of a laugh.  It's because people have been pushed too far.  So I just want to say this, Paul, hugely inspired by that.

So it'll be a separate video for people to be able to share and show a bit of support.  But thanks so much.  That was hugely, hugely inspiring.  And as you've said, I hope people listen to what Paul said and take that as an example.  If you're a worker, join a union, go to the TUC website, type in you can find out which union you should join, get in touch with your other workers, unionise and fight back.  Because in the coming months, what's going to happen?  The government buggered up this crisis.  They screwed up this crisis and they're going to expect working people to pay.  And people, if workers fight back, as Paul and others are doing right now, they won't be able to do that.  So take this example.  This is leadership.  This is courage.  And it's been a huge honour.
