            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim.  I have to share.  I feel compelled to share.  I was actually talking to our sister Rosemary at the time, and I had an open vision.  And as I've been, that I was talking to Rosemary, I got the dog, Rosemary.  I sent you a picture.  For those that don't know, Rosemary and her husband are just dear friends of mine.  And she's like a twin.  The loveliest bride in all the land says we're like twins.  And so just love Rosemary and Greg and their family.  And so when I refer, you guys will know.  And But anyway, I was talking to Rosemary and I had an open vision.  It was so powerful.  I saw Xi Jinping, the president of China, and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, talking in agreement.  And as I did, I saw invasion, the terror that was coming.  It just... it's an odd feeling because I saw them coming down in parachutes across America.  Now, I'm going to get accused of fear-mongering.  I'm not fear-mongering.  I may look a wreck because I was chasing my grandpuppy, who I'm watching, who decided to take a jog through the neighborhood in the hot, humid weather.  But it's all good.  You know, praise God, I was able to catch that dog.  And she's actually good for me, but... That was not good behavior.  Anyway, I digress.  I have a lot to do yet today.  And, you know, we do it all as unto the Lord.  Amen.  This open vision, brothers and sisters, was so... I saw them coming.  It's invasion, war.  It's coming.  And I also, to our dear brother, Lee, God's messenger, Lee... I saw it on the UK too.  Because as I was a little bit later, I saw it again.  And this time I saw a map, a world map, US, UK in this situation.  So shout out to God's messenger.  I love that brother.  Also to Nancy and David who came to visit us this weekend.  David's from the UK.  I love you guys.  I'm going to be checking in on you here shortly.  Been praying for you guys as you travel back home.  The terror.  with the invasion.  Now, remember, I've had the vision and many others have had confirming dreams and visions.  As we go up, they come down.  I've never been able to say exactly what they are that come down.  But as we go up, they come down.  And the terror that's going to strike at that time is And yet the mixture, it's so odd.  I don't know how to put words to it.  There's a grieving, just a longing for the loss to get saved.  And at the same time, such a joy at knowing that our bridegroom cometh.  And in the meantime, you know, As we talked about on a video earlier today, we occupy and redeem the time.  We should be the most joyful people.  The joy of the Lord should be our strength.  And here's the point of it.  Things are happening so rapidly.  I could be doing news updates all day long and have chosen to do maybe a couple a day.  And we are blessed.  Our sister Ashley is an amazing prophecy reporter.  And Tara helps with that.  And Brother Keegan has been in a season of prayer, I believe.  And Brother Keegan, we love you if you're seeing this.  We are in the final moments of the end of days.  And it doesn't matter who mocks us and scoffs and makes fun.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Here's the important thing.  We believe in the eternally self-existing God and the persons of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  God the Son, the Son of God, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Messiah, left glory, laid down his glory, was born of a virgin, wrapped in flesh, lived a perfect life, never sinned, and shed his precious blood on the cross at Calvary to pay... Okay, Carla, she's staying real close to me now.  To pay the debt for our sins once and for all, past, present, and future.  He died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  The nanosecond, it's an event.  You believe on him, you are saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  Salvation is an event.  It is not a process.  We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.  And again, the ABCs, the scripture for salvation is in the description box.  I've also done a video, Faith Plus.  Nothing Equals Salvation and Eternal Security.  Romans 10, 9 and 10.  If we confess the Lord Jesus with our mouth and believe in our heart that God raised him from the dead, we will be saved.  For with the heart, man believeth and is justified.  And with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.  And so our heart, right?  Metanoia, we often talk about that word repentance.  That word metanoia is translated into repentance.  That's a change of mind.  a change of heart.  and so our heart really encompasses.  it's not just that mental um ascent.  it is where our mind will and emotions are.  what do i mean by that?  we trust in We believe on the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross at Calvary for the remission of all our sins, past, present, and future.  The nanosecond you believe, you've trusted in his finished work.  Ephesians 2.89, for by grace are we saved through faith.  And that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, lest any man should boast.  When we talk about repentance unto salvation, that metanoia, you're admitting you're a sinner.  You have a sin condition in need of saving, in need of a savior.  And you are believing on, you are trusting in the finished work of Christ Jesus.  on the cross of Calvary, his death, burial, and resurrection.  You believe his blood was all sufficient and paid the debt once and for all for all your sins.  It's so amazing, isn't it?  The simplicity of the gospel.  And often people will say, well, the devil and the demons believe.  and they're not saved.  That's right.  They not only believe, Ha-Satan, the devil, he knows that Jesus is the Christ, the appointed one, the Mashiach, that he died on the cross.  He shed his blood for our sins, was buried, conquered hell, death, and the grave, and on the third day rose from the dead.  He knows that.  But he has not trusted in the finished work of Christ on the cross for the remission of all his sins.  In fact, his pride and his arrogance.  And we know that there is no redemption for the devil.  And so that's a ridiculous statement when people make that statement for us.  And that's why Satan hates us so much.  Because God loves us so much.  Oh, God is love.  1.  John 4, 7 and 8 tells us that.  Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.  He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.  God is love.  And remember, the nanosecond you believe, you are born again and dwelt with Holy Spirit.  There is a baptism involved in our being born again.  It's the regenerating work of Holy Spirit.  We are baptized by the same spirit.  What spirit?  Holy Spirit into what?  The body of Christ.  We become part of the body of Christ.  The nanosecond we believe.  Water baptism is not a requirement unto salvation.  However, it's not a requirement unto salvation.  It is an ordinance of the church.  And I'll tell you what, I got saved at five, but The church I attended would not baptize a five-year-old.  I would.  And I have.  But I remember the day I was baptized.  I was sharing with two sisters today, precious sisters.  The day I was baptized, it was Easter Sunday.  1976.  I couldn't wait to share my testimony, how Christ died for my sins, shed his precious blood, was buried and on the third day rose from the dead.  I couldn't wait to share how awesome the love of God was and how I wanted to honor God with my life.  I was already saved.  That water baptism was an outward expression of an inward reality.  And someone said, well, Pastor Tim, why are you talking about that now?  I'm talking about that because so many people are still confused on that.  And it is a wonderful experience.  We celebrate when people get baptized.  We recently did a baptism of a young man who was born in war-torn Bosnia.  His family comes to the States.  He's in Chicago.  He went from atheist to his family's faith of Islam to seeking for truth and now has trusted in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross at Calvary for the remission of all his sins, past, present, and future, his death, burial, and resurrection.  And he wanted to be baptized.  And it was awesome.  It's actually, we have the video up.  And our brother, Dan, just loved that young man.  So here's the point.  If you have not believed on the redemptive finished work, Jesus cried out to Telestai, it is finished.  The debt is paid in full.  The job is perfectly done.  If you haven't trusted in his redemptive work, his atoning work, His death, burial, and resurrection.  He died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  His precious blood paid the debt.  Hallelujah.  If you have not, today is your day of salvation.  Because many of the brothers and sisters, and the Bible tells us this, right?  The prophet Joel said it.  In the end times, declares the Lord, I will pour out my spirit on all flesh.  Your sons and daughters will prophesy.  Your old men will dream dreams.  Your young men will have visions.  Well, we shouldn't be surprised by this.  With all of the things happening, prophecies jumping off the pages of the Bible, we know we are in the final moments.  Now, we don't fear.  We occupy and redeem the time.  And then look up for our redemption draws nigh.  So when I share those visions and dreams and what others do, really we're just sounding the alarm.  But that is not to fear because you know what?  Be renewed in your mind.  We are children of God, heirs of God, co-heirs with Christ Jesus.  We are seated in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.  Hallelujah.  It's glorious.  And remember this, greater is he who's in you than he who's in the world.  And the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead abides in you.  You've got resurrection power in you, all glory to God.  Well, I just wanted to share that open vision.  It was amazing.  I was literally talking to Rosemary and Paul.  And oh man, but the terror that I felt that was going to come upon the land.  Oh, brothers and sisters, wow.  And the joy, I don't even have words to express.  You know, the Bible says, no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind can conceive what God has prepared for those who love him and are called according to his purpose.  Glory to God.  Brothers and sisters, I'm going to close with these three words that was translated from the word to tell us the idea. ",
