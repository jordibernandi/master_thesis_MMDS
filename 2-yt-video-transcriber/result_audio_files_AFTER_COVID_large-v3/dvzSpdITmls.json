            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  It's David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 28 February 2020.  Well, this week I'm going to focus on this article from Miles Franklin written by Gary Christensen on Monday of this week.  First of all, the markets have been in disarray this week.  I think everyone knows that.  There's been several thousand point moves to the downside.  basis to Dow Jones Industrials, and the mining shares have participated with the sell-off.  So as I'm doing this update, and I've gotten a lot of questions about silver, like what's wrong with it, and why isn't it performing with gold, and many things along that line, this article came in, and I asked for permission to basically go through it with everyone, because I thought it was really well done.  So kudos to you, Gary.  and Miles Franklin.  First off the bat, silver is real money, not a death-based fiat currency that will eventually fail.  Silver bullion production requires capital and effort to mine and refine.  And of course, it's used in all kinds of solar panels, iPhones, technology, everyone pretty much knows that.  But I like what he says here.  Gary states silver is monetary sanity.  Prices for silver rises.  Currency units are devalued.  Silver sold for $1.29, which is the official monetary price in the 60s.  And a dollar is a weight.  It's roughly three quarters of a troy ounce.  It's not a troy ounce, even though the Treasury doesn't know that at the current time.  Today's price is around 18 because dollars buy less.  So in that time frame, obviously silver has gone up in terms of fiat.  Why do dollars buy less?  I think we all know.  But here's the key paragraph so far as I go through this.  How much debt have our bankers created?  The St.  Louis Fed tracks total credit market debt.  Current U.S.  debt is $74 trillion.  Over half a million fiat dollars per U.S.  worker.  Insanity.  The debt will be extinguished via default or hyperinflation.  Let me pause there and add that Jim Poplava did a study several years ago, one summer, and he looked at all of the hyperinflations of the past and determined that every time there's been a fiat-based system, it ended in hyperinflation.  And I'm still pretty adamant about what is hyperinflation.  I don't see a Weimar Republic type of hyperinflation.  I see enough, 20, 25%.  I don't know.  In that range, probably enough to take the system down as levered as everything is.  It's geared up so much where $1 does the work of 10 or $1 does the work of 100 throughout the financial system.  that it wouldn't take a big move for this whole thing to continue to the downside.  I'm not predicting that for the stock market right now.  Actually, I think it'll bottom here fairly soon, but we'll see.  Interesting times.  So, moving on.  Population adjusted credit market debt increases in dollars by less year after year.  Take a look at this graph.  remember a cup of coffee cost 10 cents in the 60s.  well most of you aren't as old as i am so you probably some of you probably don't.  what about silver?  take the above population or just a total credit market debt and price in silver ounces.  use the average daily closing price for each year to create an annual price.  debt increase increases faster than the price of silver which is no surprise.  the world runs on credit and debt And currencies are debts.  Federal Reserve notes, as you all know, are debt instruments.  The banking cartel creates billions in new debt every day.  Silver, except in the 70s, have not kept pace with the debt creation.  That will change.  Go through these graphs.  Conclusions from above.  Debt adjusted per population increased faster than silver prices.  So in other words, silver is a buy right now and it certainly is in just about any metric you want to use.  Fake money, debt based currency has prevailed since the 1980s versus real money.  Really since August 15th, 1971.  Silver will catch up someday, and perhaps soon, when fake money is recognized for what it isn't.  Investors and savers will scramble to buy a tiny supply of real silver and bid prices far higher.  Let's be conservative in our expectations.  Population will slowly increase.  Use the past 10 years as a guide.  Debt will increase, unless you think bankers will change their behavior.  The silver population adjusted debt ratio will rise to the upper trend channel, the graph I just passed.  However, the ratio could move far above that trend channel, and silver usually does.  It surprises everybody, usually.  Silver priced at $80 to $250 per ounce, total insanity.  Certainly, there's some out there in the matrix that would say that, but probably not.  In our crazy world, insane prices are likely.  Consider, Tesla stock closed at 9.17 January 19, 2020.  The price may test Tesla's market capitalization larger than the sum of four GM fiat Chrysler plus the annual silver production.  The Fed added $400 billion to its balance sheet in six months.  The Fed is monetizing the U.S.  debt.  If health departments don't test for COVID-19, they can legitimately report no confirmed cases.  Isn't that sweet?  China has closed many businesses because of COVID-19.  Per a politician, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.  The world survived ice ages, two world wars, black death, communism, pandemics, Y2K, hydrogen bombs, and the Great Depression.  $250 trillion in global debt and eight years under several presidents.  The world will survive an increase in carbon dioxide.  Tesla stock was $179 on June 3, 2019, 9-17, January 19, 2021.  Crazy and insane, a matter of perspective.  The Swiss central bank created billions of francs from nothing, sold them for dollars and bought Apple and other tech stocks.  Counterfeiting is legal for central banks, but not for individuals.  Global debt exceeds 250 trillion.  Can the global economy support interest payments of 5% of 250 trillion?  What about 1%?  At near zero, interest rates are necessary to avoid insolvency.  And that's really the reason for the interest rates being where they are.  They're to save the banks.  It has nothing to do with the real price of money, which should be determined by the free market.  And it used to be, even in my lifetime in the 70s, we used to call the bond vigilantes just that because they were actually there and provided a real market outcry system that set the interest rates.  But those days are long, long gone.  So there's some more here.  I think some of these conclusions.  I'll finish up.  Global central banks are part of the problem, not part of the solution.  Fed policies help the financial politically elite, but few others.  Don't expect easy or quick change.  The banking cartel owns the politicians.  Amen to that.  I start off every lecture I do worldwide with that basic premise, and I show a chart that synthesizes that into pictorial forms.  Balance and sanity should return to government and financial markets eventually.  Expect traumatic prod holes on the return to the highway.  Dollars are issued by the Fed, a compromised private corporation.  I think everybody that follows me knows that by now, and so many do.  I remember so many years ago.  being called out on that.  And it was true, but very few people back in the 70s even knew that.  Some of the gold and silver bugs did, but no one else seemed to.  Anyway, moving on, Fed created $400 billion from nothing in six months.  We went through that before.  Gold sells at all-time highs in 70 global currencies.  I think that's something that Just ponder here for a moment because a lot of people think of dollar terms for the gold price only, not realizing that this race to the bottom where all fiat fails, including the U.S.  dollar, is that gold has gone to new highs in so many other currencies other than the dollar.  And gold's not that far from the nominal high of 1950.  Sitting here at about $16.50 or so.  It's $300 away from that nominal high that was established in September 2011.  I do believe in a paper price world, paper paradigm, we probably will see $5,000 an ounce gold.  Or it could be some other number much larger than that.  But I do believe that's pretty much achievable.  Probably before the end of the second term of Trump.  Assuming that there is a second term for Trump.  I don't know who's going to win the elections.  Tech stocks are priced too high, silver's priced too low.  Both will reset to that.  that's more sensible given global political and financial conditions.  And we can't prevent a pandemic.  That is true.  So that's it.  Gary, again, thank you.  Thank you, Andy Sheckman.  Thank you, Miles Franklin.  Not a very long article, but I think a very good one.  I think it's good to put silver in perspective.  And for those that bought too much silver recently, Maybe it won't be too much in the future.  I don't know.  I've never advocated having silver only as your investment.  Some people have definitely taken on large positions and are concerned now that maybe if they bought in the thirties or something like that several years ago, and they're sitting on a huge paper loss, um, because they don't really have the ability to cash out and, uh, Without taking a large loss.  But that's a situation when you put all your eggs in one basket.  And certainly you don't want to be too diversified either.  So there is a balance.  I think the balance is probably around 10% for most people.  Most that follow my work are more inclined to do 20% or so.  But it's an individual choice.  I'll leave you there.  Certainly, the time has come for the truth to be pervasive, and it's anything but.  It's hardly anything.  Even this COVID-19, we really don't know.  I mean, there's so much propaganda out there.  What's the absolute truth about it?  And the answer is, I don't think anyone knows for certain.  It does appear to be... Quite contagious and growing exponentially.  It could die down.  I don't know.  It may continue to accelerate.  I believe it will for a while and probably for a few months.  But again, that remains to be determined.  So I wish you all the very best.  Remember, there is nothing more powerful than the truth.  Speak it clearly and everywhere that you can.  It really does help everyone, everywhere, at all times.  It is powerful.  Be powerful.  Speak the truth.  I'll be back with you next week.  I'll return from the PDAC in Toronto, where I'll be leaving shortly.  And I'll be back with you next week for another Weekly Perspective. ",
