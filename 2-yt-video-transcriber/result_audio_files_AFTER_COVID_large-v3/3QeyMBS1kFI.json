I'm speaking right now to Messianic Rabbi Zev Perat, born and raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, born and bred to be an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, was in school training to do that, actually graduated from the rabbinical training school, really qualified to be a Sanhedrin rabbi, immersed in it.  His father was a rabbi.  His grandfather was a rabbi.  His great-grandfather was a rabbi, all very prominent rabbinical family.  But in the midst of all of that, he came to, in Hebrew, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ as Messiah and Lord.  It was a long process.  His testimony is in the book, The Rabbi, the Secret Message, and the Identity of Messiah.  Zev and I wrote that together.  It's going all over the world.  It's leading Orthodox and even secular Jews to the Lord all over the world.  But he is now a Messianic rabbi.  That is, rabbi is just the Hebrew word for teacher, preacher.  And Messianic means he's a believer that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  So Messianic rabbi, Zev Peratt.  It's good to have you with us, Zev. ",

Something prophetic is in the air.  I mean, this is just too surreal.  And so people are asking questions.  And I know that's happening with you.  The bad is the world is coming unglued at the seams in all of the ways that the Scripture predicted it would happen.  in the days before the return of the Lord.

            "text": "Well, first of all, when you look at a video of something like that happening anywhere in the world, it's very, very troubling.  Here in Israel, on the news, every day, on Israeli news, every day they're showing that video.  Every day they're speaking about it.  And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there were a few violent issues here in Israel several months ago and also several years ago involving the Ethiopian Jewish community here in Israel that unfortunately had some police that... We're out of line, and, you know, it was labeled as racism.  We're not saying that the Israeli police are racist.  We're not saying that the government is.  But we are saying that there are a few that, you know, stepped over the line, just like the ones in America that we see.  And that's, you know, waking up the line, as they say.  And here in Israel, the demonstrations for George Floyd and for an Ethiopian soldier that was killed by military police here in Israel \u2013 and some of the arrests that they show on TV in the last couple of months and couple of years that these Ethiopian Jews were mistreated.  So they're saying, what's to stop Israel from what's happening in America to happen here also?  And therefore, black lives do matter, and this is where the protests begin.  It started also in the beginning of June this month, but it's happening again this week.  It's not only in Tel Aviv.  It's happening in small rallies in Jerusalem.  It's happening in Tiberias.  It's happening all over the country.  And the first Israeli woman Ethiopian in the Israeli government, she's a lawyer, Pina Tamnushata, is a voice right now for the Ethiopian people.  And actually, the reason she was put in government... is because of what happened to the Ethiopian people here in Israel.  But Netanyahu is saying, you know, whether the blue and white are going to continue or not, he wants her in government because he wants a voice for the black community here in Israel because they're trying to label Netanyahu and the Recruit Party as racist.  You know, they do the same thing in America, but, you know, we're trying to clear that up.  So that's the reason the George Floyd killing happened.  is causing a riot here in Israel as well, and it's understandable.  However, in the midst of this bad situation, the gospel is going forth.  We have a large, huge Ethiopian community here in Israel that we're able to preach the gospel to them.  We're able to touch them with the love of Jesus, the love of Yeshua.  A lot of them are hurt.  It's true.  I mean, a lot of times they don't get good jobs because of that reason.  I'm not saying, again, that Israel is like that everywhere, but there is a problem all over the world And the only way the problem can be solved is through the Bible, is through the love of Jesus Yeshua.  Many, many times here in Israel, they would come to us Ethiopian people and say, why are you preaching the gospel to us?  We're low in society here.  They feel like that a lot of times.  And we say, did you know that Moshe, Moses, also married a woman that was probably Ethiopian?  Most scholars believe she was Ethiopian.  And they say, really, we didn't know that.  And we open the book of Numbers, we show them, and the gospel can go forth.  So we're using this crazy situation to do that here in Israel. ",

You told me a lot of stuff I didn't know, so I know our audience probably appreciated that as well.  So let me ask you this.  Two questions.  They're kind of unrelated, but I think they'll be easy for you to answer.  Number one, what's the demographic of black Israelis in Israel?  I know in the United States, the entire black population in the United States is around 20 percent, maybe a little bit less.  So what is it in Israel?  And then secondly, what's the current state of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?  Is he officially prime minister?  Are they still sharing it?  I mean, we've kind of dropped off the radar of international news as to what's going on with all of that.  So those two questions, if you could hit that for us. ",

So it's probably like around the United States.  And regarding Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, he is the prime minister of Israel.  Together with the blue and white parliament, which is the Benny Gantz, they're kind of joint in government right now.  They say in the name of the COVID-19, but we all understand what's happening behind the scenes over here.  The agreement is this call that Benjamin Netanyahu will be the prime minister of Israel for the next 18 months.  And then after 18 months, he's supposed to give his seat over to the blue and white party, which is Benny Gantz.  Most people, myself included, do not think that's going to happen.  We think either there's going to be a fourth election or Benny Gantz somehow is going to be taken out of the government.  A lot of people think that it's kind of a trap for Benny Gantz.  Time will tell.  In the midst of all this, Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted, and Benny Gantz has already tried to make sure that he would probably not be the prime minister.  That didn't work.  Netanyahu says he's innocent.  He asked the Israeli government on television and on the newspaper, please televise.  Everything that I say in the court.  Bring the cameras in.  I allow it, and they refuse to do it.  I remember that. ",

Messianic Rabbi Zefarat from Tel Aviv, Israel is on the line with us.  So good to have you back.

You know, here in the news in Israel, every night you watch the news, it's like a boxing match.  They just kill each other on the news.  They like that here in Israel, and they allow it, too.  So anyways, the questions are always asked, why would you let Benny Gantz have your seat in 18 months?  And his answer is, well, because we have to deal with the issue of the COVID-19 right now.  The answer is not even logical, his answer.  But everybody knows that he has some kind of a plan up his sleeve, as they say here in Israel, to get Benny Gantz out.  I don't think Benny Gantz is going to be here in eight months.  Time will tell.  But we'll play this program again and see where we are in eight months.  Having said that, Netanyahu has been indicted.  But once again, he claims and his lawyers claim that he's innocent, that it's a trap from the leftists to try to get him out of government.  That's probably what it is.  He says, I've got nothing to hide.  Put it on television.  And they refuse to do it.  And the reason they refuse to do it is because they don't have anything on them.  They're just trying to get them out of government.  But anyways, it's going to take much more than 18 months until we find out that result.  But having said that, here in Israel right now, we're seeing something in these demonstrations for George Floyd in Tel Aviv and other places.  We're seeing unity between Arabs and Jews.  I was in the streets today, Friday, and I watched Arabs and Jews unite together because of what happened in America.  So God is turning this evil situation into good.  And right now, to see the Jews and the Arabs together saying black lives matter is You know, it's huge here in Israel.  It's opening something new. ",

But if they come back and say, no, no, no, it's black lives, then what they're saying is that the black race is above all other races.  Now, that is the definition of racism.  If I were to get on the radio and say the white race is above all races just because we're white.  Well, that's racist, see?  But what a born-again believer would say is, look, all lives matter.

That's why I was speaking about the Arabs and the Jews together, that, you know, it's, okay, we understand that what the protest is saying, but we're using it to say yes, and God loves everyone, and we love everyone.

And I don't know if you would know that or not, but over here, if we try to just talk common sense and common humanity and common decency to people and say, yes, what happened to George Floyd was horrible.  We're going to rectify that where the legal system is going to take care of that.  Within three days of it happening, the officer was arrested for murder.  He's in jail.  That's going to be taken care of.  But to say Black Lives Matter, and they don't add the word only Black Lives Matter, but that's what they mean.

But in English, it's immigrating to Israel.  So that's why it's called Aliyah, going up, going back to Israel.  Basically, Israel opens the doors for anybody that can show that they're Jewish, from any nation, from any race, from any background, And so we have all kinds of backgrounds here in Israel, which is beautiful, which is great, which is what God wants.
