We're trying to keep you safe and we're trying to keep your Nana and your Papa safe too.  So the best way to see them right now is to do it over the computer or over the phone and just tell them over and over and over how much you love them.  I know they'll love to hear that too.  Right Bailey?  That's what people like to hear.  Yeah.  Let's hear our next question. ",

Wash your hands a lot, stay inside, and if you do go out, wear a mask.  And the second is try to make this time work.  That means do your schoolwork, read books, but also stay in touch.  Stay in touch with the people who aren't in your house, people who may miss you, and people who would love to hear from you.  Because together, that's how we're going to make it through this.  And we are.  Right, Bailey?  Absolutely. ",

            "text": "It's a good question, Liam.  Like I said, I don't know how long the virus is going to be around and how long the quarantine is going to last.  We know that before we can lift it, we've got to make sure that most people are going to be safe.  That's the key thing.  And I think it is likely that when it gets lifted, there will still be some restrictions.  Some people who may not be able to go out, when people do go out, they may need to wear masks.  It just depends on what happens day by day and week by week.  I know that's a hard answer, especially when you miss your friends, but you know, when you make the best of it, when you talk to your friends, However it is you communicate with them, it makes a difference.  And if you keep yourself safe, then we're going to be able to get through this a lot faster.  Hang in there, Lynn.  Bailey and I are glad to hear from you.  And so send us your questions.  And in the meantime, stay safe.  Right, Bailey?  Right?  Right?  We will stay safe. ",
