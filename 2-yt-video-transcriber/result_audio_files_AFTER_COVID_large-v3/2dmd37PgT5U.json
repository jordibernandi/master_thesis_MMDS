Honestly, ladies, we have to get better at calling this out.  It's really up to us.  Because anytime a guy tries to do it, girl's always like, well... Women are abused way more.  What did you do before that video?  But yet, even though some of these things are said to girls, we know that it is socially unacceptable.  We see people commenting shit like that.  It's usually from like a fake account or a private account because they know that they're gonna get ridiculed.  We don't have that same understanding with men.  A woman can literally feel confident about knowing that she smashed her boyfriend in the face.  He's got it on video.  She still feels like she's in the right to be like, stay away from him.  Oh, and then she called the police on him?  What?  This is why men don't come forward, genuinely.  Women, we do need to get better at calling this out.  We need to teach other women that this is no longer socially acceptable.  We're not gonna fucking stand for it.  Abuse is abuse. ",
