            "text": "Africa is a continent full of beauty.  Its beauty can be seen through its places and its people.  Welcome to the Amazing People of Africa series, where we take a look at some of the indigenous people of Africa.  We'll be looking at their lifestyles, culture, and getting to learn about their life through their knowledge and experiences.  Before we start, please take the time to subscribe and hit the notification bell.  Today we'll be looking at the Himba.  The Himba are an indigenous people with an estimated population of about 50,000 living in northern Namibia and in southern Angola.  Dominantly, livestock farmers focus in on breeding sheep and goats, but measure their wealth through the amount of cattle they own.  In a world full of health issues and rising cases of obesity, the Himba stay clear of that by sticking to their traditional diet made up of sour milk and maize porridge.  On rare occasions such as weddings, the Himba do eat meat, but this is more of an exception than a rule.  Let's take a look at how they go about their daily life.  Women and girls tend to perform more of the labor-intensive work, such as carrying water to the village, plastering their homes with a traditional mixture of clay soil and cow manure, collecting firewood, cooking, and serving meals.  They are also responsible for milking the cows and goats.  The men's main tasks are tending to livestock, herding, and animal slaughtering.  Remarkable Himba traits is that women are not allowed to use water for washing.  This applies to their bodies and to their clothes.  This may be due to drugs where water was passed and only men were allowed to access the water for washing purposes.  So how do they go about their hygiene?  Well, by applying red ochre on their skin and also taking smoke baths.  They put some smoldering charcoal into a little bowl of herbs and wait for the smoke to ascend.  After that, they'll bow over the smoking bowl and due to the heat, they'll start perspiring.  For a full body wash, they cover themselves with a blanket so that the smoke gets trapped underneath the fabric.  They also apply red ochre cream that the Himba are famously known for.  This is made by pounding the ochre stone into small pieces.  and mix it with butter, slightly heated using smoke and applying that to the body.  Hairstyles play a significant role within the Himba community and reflect marital status, age, wealth, and rank within the group.  Hair braiding is a communal activity with a range of styles different from tribe to tribe.  Close relatives spend hours creating elaborate and socially symbolic hairstyles.  The braids they create are often lengthened by including bits of woven hair, goat hair and artificial hair extensions.  Hair is also seen as a symbol of fertility amongst the Himba community, where thick braids and lustrous hair indicates a woman's ability to bear healthy children.  Himba are making money off tourism and that's why they are allowing tourists to visit.  Women stop what they're doing and sell handcrafts to the tourists.  The Namibian government has set laws in place about tribal privacy and how that should be kept.  It also has strict rules about visiting the tribe and is sensitive to their needs.  There is an international law that states that indigenous people have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies, the right to maintain, protect and have access to, in their privacy, to their religion and cultural sites.  All countries should be implementing this law, in my opinion.  What other facts do you know about these beautiful people?  What do you love about their culture?
