            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you from themorganreport.com.  New article out from Jeff Clark of goldsilver.com.  Just did a very recent update with Jeff and Mike Maloney of goldsilver.com regarding an article that Jeff had put out.  And here he comes right back with another one.  The title of this article from Jeff is New Silver Supply is Drying Up Faster Than Death Valley.  Some very interesting things to go over here.  He talks about silver mine production.  And I think the best chart here on this is the second one down.  This is mine production from the top 10 largest silver producing countries.  And you can see it's been on the increase from 2008. all the way up to 2016, and it's fallen off the last four years.  And, of course, I put out an update on my weekly perspective that's for everybody on the free newsletter about silver being curtailed by 66% during this CB19 situation.  Of course, that won't carry through for the whole year at that point.  percentage but we do expect to be seeing a significant fall off in silver mining for this year.  here's another interesting one that he brings forth.  this is from the cpm group's 2020 silver survey or yearbook rather and it's the annual additions to silver mine capacity from development projects.  you can see they are additive but the trend from 2013 is down.  I also want to just digress a bit and remind everybody that silver was in a deficit.  for about 15 straight years from 1990 to 2006.  The deficit was eating away the above ground silver supply, which stood roughly at about 2 billion ounces in 1990.  And by the time that we got to 2006, the annual average offtake eating above ground supplies was roughly 100 million ounces per year.  So at the bottom of the market, as far as above-ground silver stockpiles were concerned, we were at about 500 million ounces in 2006.  But things that started wrapping up in the early 2000s because of the China boom and more and more and more mining was taking place globally.  So from 2006 to present day, the above ground stockpiles of silver have actually been building for the most of those years.  And I'll get into that a bit more.  So we went from a. bottom above ground silver supply of about roughly round numbers, 500 million ounces to today, which we can argue about somewhat, but it's over 2 billion ounces.  I believe it's closer to 2.2 billion ounces.  And I'll be going through that again later in this video update.  Another very interesting fact that Jeff brings, and this is sourced from the S&P Global Marketing Intelligence, Incrementum AG, which is a very good report.  I'll be posting it on our website here for members shortly.  It's available to the public for free, so you can look it up.  It is what the base metal miners are going to be doing from 2019 is in the bank.  That is an accurate number, as accurate as it could be.  But the next three years, you can see that base metal mining, copper, gold, zinc, and others is in a severe downtrend or a significant downtrend.  And 70% or so, Jeff says 80, I would say 70, but somewhere around that 70, 75% of silver is a result of base metal mining.  25% of the silver supply is a result of copper mining.  13% of the silver supply is a result of gold mining.  and about 35 percent of the silver supply result of zinc and lead mining.  so that is something to pay attention to because it does play significantly into the silver supply in the coming years.  so here he shows silver secondary supply sources are in a decline And this is basically your recycling, which has been flatlined about 200 million ounces a year.  This is from CPM Group.  If you look at the Silver Institute, I believe the number from memory is around 165 million, but it's in the ballpark of 200 million.  I think the most important point to note is that it is a flat line.  It hasn't been increasing.  And here's one I want to go into a little more depth.  This is silver bullion inventories that he shows.  He's sourcing CPM and is showing a thousand thousand, which is a million, excuse me, a thousand million, which is a billion ounces.  of silver.  and i do have a bit of an issue with that.  um i don't say he's inaccurate.  he sources it right here but let me just pause there and show you a little bit more.  so this is from again nick laird.  i suggest anyone that's really at rc's market subscribe it's gold charts r us dot com.  and so this is as of today.  i don't know when nick last updated it but i use this in my weekly perspective.  uh just a few days ago.  so here where i am highlighting this box right there shows you that just in the etfs the funds the electronic funds depositories including all the comex stuff The SLV, all that stuff, Sprott, PSLV, all of that totals 1.3 billion ounces.  So that's 1.3 and that's basically commercial bar silver.  Those are roughly 1,000 ounce bars.  So we have 1.3 billion.  if I can get a dot out of there of three billion.  and I'll just put a B for billion.  and now what we're looking at is from Wikipedia.  this is the total amount of silver Eagles that are produced which is half a billion.  five point three.  so point five I should say but half a billion.  so that alone is 1.8 billion ounces.  now I'm showing you what Jeff showed you from CPM is silver commercial bars only.  So it's accurate, more or less.  They're showing, I think, roughly, and it's not a real well-defined chart.  But so it's in the ballpark of a billion.  And it's, you know, I can prove 1.3.  So then we're adding just the United States coins.  And this is kind of.  the most important part of the retail silver market is coinage.  And then you've got to think about who else produces government coins.  Well, the Canadian silver maple leaf, the Perth mint produces a lot of silver.  The European Union produces a silver Euro.  Even South Africa now produces a silver Krugerrand.  And those are official mintages.  And I'm not going to look them all up.  I'm just going to go off the top of my head and say that's probably... all told probably about 0.3 billion or 300 million ounces.  So that already puts us over 2 billion.  And then on top of that, what we need to do is think about how many silver rounds are out there, which are one ounce silver.  quote unquote coins.  We have to call them medallions because legally a coin is a government minted product, but a privately minted product that's identical in size and weight.  that's stamped with a picture of a tiger or a lion or whatever.  somebody's name or Santa Claus.  It really doesn't matter.  An ounce of silver is an ounce of silver.  The point being that how many of those are out there, and it's really hard to get a number, but I would say at least half of what we see in the official government mintages and maybe equal to.  I don't know the number.  No one knows that number.  So I would say conservatively 0.2 or 0.3.  So you can see quite easily how I come to the 2.2 billion ounces of silver In all investable form.  In fact, commercial bars are used as investment.  Obviously, I just showed you all the ETFs, depositories, COMEX inventories, PSLV, SLV.  All that is held for investment.  I'm not arguing that point.  The point I'm making is that the most investable product are your one ounce rounds, your one ounce coins, your one ounce wafers, your 10 ounce bars, your 100 ounce bars, your kilo silver bars.  All of that is investment grade silver.  In fact, that's the most oftenly sought product.  So I just want to make that a little bit clearer because I think it's a bit understating the amount of silver that's available for investment.  And then we've also got to think about what silver could become readily available for investment.  And that's, To be determined, this is a little bit of thought to talk through, but in the great meltdown of 1980, when silver hit that one day, $50 mark, there were lots of candelabras and silverware and lots of silver products that were brought in and actually smelted down into commercial bar form, basically.  So there is like silverware out there that could be melted down into 999 fine rather than 92 and a half percent for sterling and there's other silver art objects etc.  but i don't expect to see a lot of that coming to the market this time but it is out there.  so i don't want to deny that.  uh you know there's more silver than this 2 billion 2.2 2.3. i'm just talking basically what's readily available for investment.  so it's still a very very small number And I compliment Jeff on his write-up.  I think it's very, very good.  Thought-provoking, of course.  So I want to finish up with this conclusion here.  Jeff writes, there's the problem.  The silver price is just too low to solve the mine supply dilemma.  A lot of these mines are marginal at these prices.  Believe me on that one.  So I won't read the whole thing, but a rising silver price will help, of course, but the silver price is like a speedboat whipping around the waves.  The mining industry is like a tanker trying to execute a turnaround.  Good metaphor.  The bottom line is that low silver price has caught up to industry and in essence, holding it hostage.  miners have been spending less and less looking for new deposits.  they're developing fewer and fewer new assets existing reserves and resources are depleting and it takes a lot of time to turn it around.  and i will note that there are a few and i mean few major silver deposits that i feature.  uh on the speculative side of the morgan report one pretty advanced and it will be Mining silver at an ASIC all-encompassing cost.  that's quite low relative to what the price is today for spot silver, but that's a rare find and you that are silver bugs already know the name of that mine.  goes on to say there's little doubt that new supply of silver will tighten further and let me just throw out another name and a compliment to uh steve san angelo.  srs rocco did some excellent work and excellent charting that showed that the grade of silver is constantly declining.  i'm just going to go by memory and it's going to be the correct idea but not the correct dates.  but oh several years back you were looking at i forget somewhere around 12 ounces the ton type of thing and then we're down to like six or seven.  So, and that has to do with a lot of things, high grading being one, you can look up high grading if you don't know what that is.  So, and he says this trend is still in force when the silver price begins its volatile spike.  $250 and beyond and demand spikes right along with it.  What do you suppose happens to the price?  Of course, we all know what happens to the price.  This is going to happen someday soon, he says.  My friends, I hope you're preparing like Mike and I, Mike Maloney of GoldSilver.com.  This is Jeff Clark that wrote the article and are buying silver now before it ignites.  So I hope that was useful to you.  I just wanted to, one, compliment Jeff again, but I also want to be a little more clear on this chart.  where we're looking at roughly a billion ounces.  This is silver bullion, so it's clearly stated, but a lot of people don't think it through, or at least some don't, I know, because of the feedback I get, which means you've got to throw your coins in there, your 10-ounce bars, your 100-ounce bars, your kilo bars, and everything else.  And if you do all that, you'll probably back up into this range where we were, as I said, in 1990, where I said we were at, you know two billion something ounces.  according to this chart we're at three.  uh we saw the big deficit to 2006 and it's actually been building more than that.  if you add in coins it's back up to about there.  so there we go.  hope this was useful.  Silver is going to be making a move.  The silver-gold ratio has dropped from the 125 area down to about 100.  It seems to be hovering there for a while.  And we'll just have to wait and see what silver does and gold here in the near term.  But longer term, I think it's a pretty safe bet that they're going much, much higher in price. ",
