            "text": "Hey guys, welcome to the Liberal Hivemind, a channel solely focused on exposing the abundant hypocrisy of the left.  The focus of this video is the legacy media.  You know, we're constantly harping on CNN, MSDNC, you know, the usual suspects.  But what you might have not realized is the issue is not just left-wing legacy media.  Fox News isn't exactly perfect.  I personally don't like any of them.  I really like Tucker Carlson, but he's just an editorial guy, an opinion guy, who happens to have a great show on the network.  The network as a whole has been really disappointing me quite consistently over the last couple months, and more specifically in peak election season.  And the cherry on top is just the way that they treated the debates.  The front page of Fox News during the night of the first presidential debate looked almost like Biden's Twitter feed.  And then compound that with the way Chris Wallace acted in said debate, they're starting to just lose my trust.  And just when you think it couldn't get any worse, it does.  John Roberts is an absolute joke.  The Fox News chief White House correspondent started to sound like Jim Acosta, and he got absolutely ratioed, censured by not only conservatives on Twitter, but more importantly, by Kayleigh McEnany.  So once again, we're covering this whole thing of the president hasn't denounced white supremacy, and the fact that Fox News is perpetuating said hoax.  They did it during the debates, and now we got John Roberts pushing it to an even further degree.  So I gotta update you guys on all of this stuff, but before we do, please make sure to leave a like, a comment, subscribe, hit the notification bell to be notified every single time I post a new video, since that's by far the best thing you can do to support the channel.  And check out the Teespring shop where you guys can buy the limited edition Three Scoops President t-shirt to celebrate three scoops, three SCOTUS picks, three Nobel Peace Prize nominations, and hopefully two terms.  Now with that out of the way... Let's roll the tape.  All right, so it all starts off with John Roberts melting down.  This is what started flying all over conservative circles.  Check out the man's absolute meltdown. ",

Well, John Roberts, it's because you're the chief White House correspondent.  And frankly, you don't know what you're talking about, not to mention you're spreading misinformation and claiming that Kayleigh never answered your question when she did maybe like five to ten times.  10 times in that interaction that you had with her.

In August 2019, in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.  In August of 2017, racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.

And the man's acting like Jim Acosta in the White House press room.  She's baffled beyond belief.  But she also manages to completely destroy him and the phony outrage narrative that he's perpetuating.  I just covered this in a video that I made yesterday.  There are over 21 provable clips of the president denouncing white supremacy.  Literally a couple days ago, he designated them as a domestic terrorist organization and made lynching a federal hate crime.  How much more can he do?  He unveiled a $500 billion plan for black America, yet these... phony outraged journalists are jumping on this story like the exact hacks that they are.  how are we still talking about what the president said during Charlottesville?  how how has this myth this hoax not been debunked in a bipartisan manner bilaterally across all media outlets especially Fox News?  how is Chris Wallace spreading this information perpetuating this misinformation During a presidential debate, which, what, 60 million Americans watched?  It's because Chris Wallace is not only a hack, but he's wholly unqualified to host a presidential debate.  Period.  It shows the difference between these out-of-touch, misinformed legacy media hacks, who don't know what they're talking about, they just read teleprompters, in respect to independent journalists who bust their behinds getting the facts straight.  People like Tim Pool should be moderating these debates, not these ancient fossils of the legacy media who can't even bother to do basic research.  Chris Wallace mentioning the Proud Boys during the debate as some sort of white supremacist group?  What is he even talking about?  A white supremacist group?  Now of course the Proud Boys, I've said it a million times, aren't necessarily my favorite people on the planet.  But this is just flat out slanderous at this point.  Look at these two clips that I have of Proud Boys who are black.  How is it a white supremacist organization?  Check this out. ",

In fact, they're very heavily tied with Latinos for Trump in states like Florida.  Yet we have these media talking heads, these liberal elites, and these Twitterati folk spreading misinformation in such a despicably slanderous way.  The Joe Biden campaign just recently on Twitter claimed that Kyle Rittenhouse was a white supremacist, based on what evidence?  You may disagree with what Kyle did, but to claim that he's a white supremacist, he's just completely unhinged.  And funnily enough... Kyle Rittenhouse to sue Joe Biden for linking Kenosha shooter to white supremacy in a tweet.  And you know what?  Good.  And I find it so funny how the legacy media is so quick to jump on anything related to white supremacy, linking groups that have absolutely no connection, pretty much anything conservative at this point, is fascist, white supremacist, blah blah blah blah blah.  Without proof, you can just launch these claims left, right, and center, and it just doesn't even matter.  There's almost never any scrutiny or backlash to any of these claims that are made by these hacks in the mainstream.  Yet Antifa, who at this point are like provable terrorists, political ends by violence as a mean, that's the definition of terrorism, they are the boogeyman.  That the left tries to paint the opposing side as.  And Joe Biden says Antifa is just an idea man.  Come on man.  And nobody bats an eye.
