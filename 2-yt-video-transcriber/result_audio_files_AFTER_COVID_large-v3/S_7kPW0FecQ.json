Bill, our buddy Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX and solar roofing material fame... And who knows, oh, boring tunneling.  Hyperloop.  The hyperloop, yes, all of that kind of stuff.  This is something he's been working on for a while, but a couple of British publications are touting the fact that he's now claiming that within about a year, he should be able to accomplish through a company called Neuralink.  an implant that should be able to help humans who perhaps have been paralyzed or have other debilitating brain conditions to resume some of their normal activities or at least to advance beyond where they can now.  And Bill, It was fascinating.  I watched a presentation that Mr.  Musk did last year on this topic.  after hearing this news.  And it just struck me, Bill, that here's a guy who's standing up there very seriously saying, we've got this tiny little device that we're going to implant and we need to make it scalable.  So we don't want neurosurgeons to have to do this.  It's going to be done by a robot.  And it's going to be something akin to LASIK surgery so that you can do it at scale.  And many, many people can get this.  First of all, just in general, the idea that something we saw on TV as fantasy, we're now getting to the point where we're saying, Oscar Goldman, phone your office. ",

            "text": "You know, obviously, Musk is a genius.  I just wish he'd spend a little more time at work and not so much time, you know, goofing off.  I think actually the real breakthrough genius of Musk is not that he wants to go to Mars, but that he wants everybody to go to Mars.  And it's not that he wants to go to Mars, but he wants it to be profitable to go to Mars.  And this is a fundamental difference in worldview.  The idea that What you would have to build in order to put you or a mission to Mars together is very different than what you would have to build if you wanted to send hundreds or thousands or millions of people to Mars at relatively low cost.  And this just seems like another example of that where Elon Musk has this almost unique ability to see something that's past the goal.  You know, it's like, what's the goal?  Well, the goal is to land on Mars.  Yeah, but what's the real goal?  Well, I mean, so what?  We do that, then what?  We landed on the moon 50 years ago.  What's the goal?  Well, I guess the goal is to be able to live on other planets.  Okay, so let's worry about that.  How are we going to do that?  That ability to see past the impossible into the trans-possible, you know, is what really makes this guy unique, I think.  And I have no doubt that he'll pull it off. ",

            "text": "And specifically applied to this case, what you're saying I think is really germane because it's like the average person would say, okay, so what could a neurosurgeon do to help somebody regain partial use of their limbs, for example?  Right.  And even the most advanced devices that are currently approved for medical use, which his device is of course not at this point, but even the most advanced devices, he says his new Neuralink device, which they're calling N1, sexy name, will actually be like a thousand times better than whatever's already in production.  And being able to look at that and see, look, if only a handful of people can have this because it's tremendously expensive and must be done by a Dr.  Ben Carson type specialist, then it's not going to impact the world.  But if we could have a robot that could do this and we could multiply that over and over, so essentially you could walk into that little store that's right between the donut shop and the dentist in your local strip mall and have this chip implanted.  And yes, I know we're going to hear it when I say the term chip implanted.  But, you know, that is what really makes him peculiar. ",
