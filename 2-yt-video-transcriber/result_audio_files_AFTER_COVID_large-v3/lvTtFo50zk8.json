            "text": "Now, it seems I'm doing this a lot.  Before I tell you my philosophical point of view, I feel the need to say, notwithstanding biology prior to everything I say, just to try and head off the past, those people that say, human, biologically, men and women.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Sometimes as I look at who I've become as I've gotten older, more and more a specific type of person, I think, who the heck could actually live with me?  Something to think about in terms of how we harden into a very specific type of personality.  Now, recently I had a really interesting and enjoyable conversation, quite an esoteric one with Quasimandias linked here, where we circled around subjects of courage and how one might navigate the world ethically from a philosophical point of view.  And as I edited and published this video, I was looking at our conversation almost as a third person and thinking, who the hell, let alone a female, could be around my esoteric personality all the time.  I started laughing and I guess it's not a completely funny situation.  But I was thinking about how as we get older, our ability to change or modify, I think from memory neuroplasticity stops between 20 to 25 or something, let alone past that.  I'm approaching 50.  So one has to come to terms with not only finding like-minded friends, But how realistic is it to find your female snow leopard?  To naturally relate to someone hand in glove becomes something that just drifts further and further over the horizon.  Quasimandai said so much in our last chat where he said, as you get older, it gets more challenging.  And I completely agree.  I mean, the friends we have, they are great friends, but let's not ignore the fact that we spend time together and then either we go home or they leave and we're left to the comfort of our routines of being on our own.  The fact that so many men and women can't be friends, let alone have any kind of common interests or life goals to be around each other day to day, hours and hours and feel completely content.  It doesn't surprise me.  And see when you're younger, that's the blind spot of biology.  Biology draws you together.  Ignoring your respective personalities just long enough for you and a woman to reproduce.  And then it tosses you aside.  Biology adrenalizes you with make babies and procreate for the first few months.  And then it says, all right, I'm going.  Good luck you two.  Bye.  This is why I've been saying if you have any chance at all with the opposite sex in having some sort of long-term relationship, look for a friend.  Especially in today's environment, you've got all chance otherwise.  You know, I see couples tolerating each other for decades.  And then as a guy escaping to work or escaping to sports or to your friends or to porn or to the shed or to your car project or anything in any corner of the planet to feel more like yourself.  where you can breathe.  And as one gets older, it becomes crystal clear that sexual chemistry is secondary, tertiary, if not completely in the back seat or a distant memory, and a more meaningful values-based intimacy is about the only thing that will suffice.  One's personality is just too hardened and not hardened in a stubborn kind of way, but just hardened in a very, very specific way.  Think about it.  When you're in your late teens and early twenties, when you're kind of forging your way in the world, you don't know much, you haven't had really an inkling who you are, but you're forming it.  If you find someone at that age, which is what historically happened, you could accommodate and respect each other enough through time because you've started to know yourselves as adults in tandem.  But once you start knowing yourself as an adult, as a singular, it's extremely hard to find like-minded people in personality and values, whether it's platonic or romantic.  I really don't think you get stubborn as you get older as much as you just get very, very specific because you know yourself much, much more clearly coupled with not wanting to waste any more time.  And when I think about it, just look at the conversation I had with Quasimandias.  I can't think of a female I know or have known that I could dive to such creative and philosophical depths.  I mean, I fully agree with Coltane as time goes on.  You learn to compartmentalize, you know.  I mean, I get intellectual depth from my male friends and I get something else entirely from women.  I understand completely a woman feeling alienated by the conversations I like to have.  I mean, it's not just women.  Other guys feel the same way with me too.  Finding like-minded guys that are simpatico with my interests and the conversations I love to have is hard enough.  without trying to find that grain of sand in the universe that is female.  And this is what I think happens with a lot of couples.  You know, the man's interest is somewhere here and a woman's interest is somewhere there and they regress and they neutralize themselves in the middle so they can just tolerate each other.  They compromise themselves to this dull neutrality in the middle where they can both simply exist and not really live.  They certainly don't feel anywhere near alive as they did when they were dating.  They merely exist waiting to die.  I mean, even if a woman wanted to, how many women could be interested in these kinds of conversations?  And you're finding somebody you find physically attractive too.  I mean, I've had women pretend to be interested in my esoteric nonsense, just as I've pretended to be interested in their general nonsense, but it doesn't last for very long.  Honeymoon period goes, everything's revealed.  Look, maybe it's just me.  I just can't relate as a cookie cutter boyfriend.  It needs to be something meaningful.  There needs to be that sort of underlying friendship, that meaning in a platonic or a romantic relationship.  In fact, any relationship in my life.  But the older I get, honestly, I kind of keep thinking like, who the heck could be with me?  You get older, you harden.  You become very specific and it's almost impossible to find that hand in glove.  Something to think about.  As you get older, you become so specific a personality that life may at times feel lonely because you need someone very specific in your life, romantic or otherwise.
