            "text": "Big news today as the billionaire boss of Apollo Global Management has told investors that he will be stepping down after it was revealed that he paid convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein $158 million.  Obviously, this is not the first big controversy involving Apollo.  Notable that former President Bill Clinton, who of course happens to be tied to Epstein himself, also pocketed money from Apollo.  In 2015, while Hillary Clinton was running for president, Bill Clinton pocketed $250,000 for one speech to Apollo Management Holdings.  An article on this back from 2016 adds that the company declined to answer questions about Clinton's speech.  It would not discuss the subject of his talk or any details about the event.  A recent article in the New York Times opened saying the founders of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, engaged in a brief power struggle this weekend over control of the firm, a rift that opened up after an inquiry revealed that one founder, Apollo's chief executive and chairman Leon Black, had paid more than $150 million to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  They continue saying.  on Monday, Mr.  Black announced his plan to step down as chief executive this year.  Quote, I have advised the Apollo board that I will retire as CEO on or before my 70th birthday in July and remain as chairman.  The review ordered by the firm's board at Mr.  Black's behest in October after the New York Times detailed at least 75 million in payments.  found that Mr.  Black had paid Mr.  Epstein $158 million in a five-year period ending in 2017.  He had also lent Mr.  Epstein more than $30 million, only $10 million of which was paid back, the report found.  Looking at a couple more articles with more info about the ongoing relationship between Black and Epstein... The investigation found that Black paid Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017 after the sex offender pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2008.  They claim that this money was given to Epstein for advisory services that helped expand the wealth of one of America's richest men.  while Black published a letter in which he admitted that it was a terrible mistake to associate with Epstein, also at the time adding, \"...like many people I respected, I decided to give Epstein a second  chance.\".  It wasn't nearly enough as some asset managers froze their new capital allocations to Apollo.  It eventually prompted Apollo to hire Deckert to conduct an independent review of Black's dealings with Epstein to clear Black's and Apollo's name.  Here they list the key findings of the report.  First, Apollo never retained Epstein. ",
