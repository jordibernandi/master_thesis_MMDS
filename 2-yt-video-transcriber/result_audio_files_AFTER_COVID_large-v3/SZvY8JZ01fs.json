            "text": "God wants to encourage you that you are here for such a time as this, that he wants cleansing to happen from the spirit of fear because he wants us delivered.  He wants you delivered.  And so I just speak right now that you've not received a spirit of fear, but power, love, and a sound mind.  I declare right now, put on your helmet a hope, a salvation, the positive expectation of good.  Because something good, something good.  It's going to happen to you.  Something good.  Oh, boy.  Now, if you talk about a tangible presence, it just fell on me.  It is now he, it.  It is all over me.  I am like, whoa.  I mean, it's like, yeah, I know it's a feeling, but it's not just a feeling.  It's an anointing.  This is not a cliche.  What I'm going to declare is a living reality.  Something good is just about to happen.  Something good.  I feel that presence of light, the great cloud of witnesses looking in.  I see Oral Roberts in that great cloud of witnesses right now.  I see Papa Kenneth Hagin in the great cloud of witnesses.  I see Derek Prince in the great cloud of witnesses.  I see Catherine Kuhlman in the great cloud of witnesses.  And God has a word.  Heaven has a word to release to earth.  something good.  is just about to happen.  Something good is just about to happen.  It was 50 plus 70 years ago that three movements of God were birthed in the earth at the same time.  The Charismatic Movement, the Messianic Movement, and the Jesus People Movement.  We are back in such a Kairos period of time, and it's going to be one of the greatest.  The Sending Movement.  an empowering movement, and a youth awakening that the world has never seen.  I speak it forth, and God is going to move upon the Jewish people in diaspora, and God is going to move upon uh the middle east.  he's going to move upon iran.  i've been prophesying for a decade that there will be the fastest church growth is going to happen in iran and that there will be a people's revolution that will occur and that there will be iran.  iran will run with the gospel in the name of jesus and there will be a people's revolution that will occur.  and i declare that there will be a great new movement that will be relevant.  it will be historic.  that will happen in the land of israel.  And I declare in the name of Jesus, we are passing over into a new empowering of fire, of presence, of gifting, and with the fire, character to carry the gift.  I got to go back to this statement.  Something good.  Mercy.  Receive it right now.  Receive it for yourself.  It's micro before it's macro.  One time I was teaching out of the book of Numbers, and I said, and the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters covers the seas.  The Holy Spirit interrupted me while I'm teaching, and he says, how do you think that will happen?  And I go, and I'm still teaching, and I go, tell me.  And he says, and I recite it again.  The glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the seas.  How do you think that will happen?  And he said to me, one clay pot at a time.  One clay pot at a time.  You're the clay pot.  You're the laborer in the rice fields.  You're the laborer in the kitchen.  You're the laborer in the family.  You are the one.  You are the one.  And I speak.  Over you, a fresh baptism in the Holy Spirit.  I speak a fresh fire.  I speak a fresh giftedness.  I speak a fresh sanctification that burns out sin, iniquity, patterns, and even addictions.  Someone is getting healed of diverticulitis right now.  Someone is getting the bloodstream getting healed of leukemia.  There's a healing of the generational spirit of infirmity, and it's actually getting burned out by the fire.  of God.  Someone with a stage 4 cancer in their lungs, I see something greater than radiation, it's Holy Ghost saturation of His presence, and it's a Holy Ghost, I don't know really what I'm talking about right now, Holy Ghost like protons, and it's because they're prophetic.  It's prophetic presence, and it's going to infiltrate.  I just see someone with a stage four lung issue and cancer, but God has the remedy.  God has the protection.  God has something for you.  And I just speak forth provision, preservation, protection, presence of God to shift into the new era of the new promise.  In Jesus' name. ",
