            "text": "In the last proof, we decoded some pretty shocking conversations.  In this episode, they're worse.  We're gonna do good.  Well, then I hope for the best to see everyone's testimony.  So do I. Hoping so.  Including you.  We're not out of the woods yet.  So far.  Remember why it's down to half for you, half for him.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  We never wanted a coup d'etat for you.  Are you sure it's not on?  In this episode, we're going to continue listening in all the way up till it's time for the president's speech.  Who is this popular guy?  Look at the eager exchange between him and Swallswell.  And his trusty sidekick, Little Guy.  We're going to have a closer look at Mr.  Popular here.  He's probably a really nice guy.  Last time we caught some interesting conversation.  Wait till you see what we find this time.  I said we could have never had imagined this for a moment.  You're right.  You don't say.  There's no real beginning or ending, so let's just jump right in.  Yeah, I'm hungry, but not doing too bad.  Oh my god, I'm smashed.  So smashed.  I'm so sorry, I'm off.  He motions to her like, oh, you gotta let it go.  I'm gonna try to.  Oh, hi, sweetheart.  Let's watch again.  Yeah, I'm hungry, but not doing too bad.  Oh my god, I'm smashed.  So smashed.  I'm so sorry, I'm off.  I'm gonna try to.  Oh, hi, sweetheart.  Don't let appearances fool you.  Mr.  Popular is such a caring friend.  In the next part, watch the advice that Mr.  Popular gives her.  Nothing creepy here.  It's gonna be okay.  You have to realize that's a superstition to hope all the bad stuff just washes away, okay?  It's sad when death happens, but it's not like it.  just all goes away.  Don't think it just ends.  You're just going someplace.  Alright.  If we back up, we can see what Moderate Joe is saying.  They've got two weeks.  It's begun.  That's why we gotta get this trial over with.  As soon as we indict Pence, there's nothing to it.  And in the sanctuary cities that assured no arrest, that was who we found who had all of them.  In many of the places where there was nobody policing.  We've got surprises for him, but you're not supposed to know that.  I've heard that after roundups begin.  After what?  Down on the left, you can barely see Schumer walks up and greets the group.  And the tall guy and the lady in red completely shut down and turn away and start their own private slash public conversation.  And here's what they say.  I have three.  Who does that gain?  And nobody's supposed to know.  It's just you and me.  If Trump passes away.  The camera cuts, but don't worry.  Yeah, so that's just like I was saying it to everyone.  Except our problem is this is a crime.  And so let's say if she has poisoned him and we see him drop dead, we did not want to do that.  And that's how we may have finished Trump.  Well, there's that, and we have to prove that it was somebody who wasn't a idiot or a bastard.  No, no, no.  Right, but by then, I mean, even Joe Biden said he was going to have my back, quite honestly.  So what's the worst that can happen if she poisons him?  And maybe she should have a proper in-depth, so the Republicans will just have to cave.  She knows that's why she'll do three poisons.  And that's just it.  So far, we're simply just doing it for the people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've been lied to.  Hmm.  Okay.  And the guy had a doctor that actually watches people just to see what would happen.  But I said, that's too cruel.  Yeah.  But I remember before it actually happened, the cries for agony.  See, the problem will always be the horrors of dying.  Yeah.  I should have shot that guy, but now the other poor guy is dead.  Yeah, and the bad one's alive.  Okay.  During each moment of the so-to, there are many conversations happening simultaneously.  So if we go back to that scene and look just behind Mr.  Popular and the lady in the red coat, we see this guy.  Watch his behavior when he first notices the lady coming up to him.  Senator Menendez.  Senator Menendez.  Hello, how are you, sir?  Nice to see you.  Same to you.  I saw all the press around.  We see Grandpa Munster flip around super concerned.  I see them.  They had better not be recording us.  I'll kill them.  So, you know how we see everything that Mr.  Popular says and does?  Well, apparently he's totally invisible to all his friends.  If only his friend in the red coat were there, they could keep plotting against the president.  However, she had to go be with the president and escort him into the chambers.  Whatever.  They'll all be sorry when one of his evil plans finally succeeds.  Madam Speaker!  Private insurance should put it in.  Yeah!  Or a fee.  That's usually how it is for that to work.  It's working out for them wanting to go forward if it's who they want.  Then we can do that if you want.  Did they see you?  No, I didn't.  They don't know you?  Then there's no point in you going.  They're saying it stops who it happens to, no matter who it's for, says the CDC.  That's why we wanted insurance.  I wouldn't know.  Without your insurance, we're not too safe.  Who has to pay for it?  That's what you're supposed to do.  Insure the safe.  But remember, nobody's supposed to know that.  As soon as you see a guy coming up to you, you sneeze.  What the f**k?  Well now we'll just see the Loss of Bores, but what I heard was like, ugh!  He's avoiding us.  It's because she always defends him.  She always does it.  He's definitely acting more than distant.  Do you think you could ever see him the same?  Mm-mm.  Yep.  Mm-mm.  I see him the same as him.  Now, you girls, listen.  You know, there were the Bushes, then there was Dick Cheney, who wasn't agreeing with me.  Cheney hated.  For what it's worth, I know Dick Cheney.  He was a good guy.  Cheney hated our justices.  I had heard it from the senator who was setting him up.  It was something about.  maybe they were going for a safe impeachment after the Senate hearing.  That tries him.  In this next clip, I believe that Swaswell and Little Guy are talking about Tim Scott.  But it's always good to have that in case you might need him.  But I just wish we knew somebody that knows him.  He would plead the fifth.  Although in time, it never works out well for those who plead the fifth.  Well... I mean, there is that.  I bet they wish they knew what happens next.  And I don't think they do.  Get ready.  In this next part, right after Lindsey Graham walks by, it seems Swaswell's dreams have come true.  You should see it.  It's bad.  He shares with his friends the perfect video.  Apparently what he's got on someone is pretty juicy.  Give him a second to find it.  He's got tons of these.  And based on his friend's reaction to it, this might be the one to really yield some leverage.  His friend exclaims, that's an asset.  That's definitely an asset.  You know it's pretty bad when the purple-haired drunk can't understand what she just saw.  And when Swallswell explains to her, she's shocked, so shocked.  In this next bit, check out Rumpelstiltskin.  And I just was saying to people that were worried, oh, we're winning.  It's definite.  And don't say anything around the press because they're always on.  And it's at that exact moment that Rumpelstiltskin looks up at the camera where the gunner's wife is watching him.  And even though what Rumpel says is pretty bad, it's not nearly as revealing as what these guys say.  I forgot about that.  That guy's such a newbie.  Do you always drink first?  Yeah.  Yeah?  That means less for you.  Well, I get your need.  I was just using it for the heat back then.  I would just throw that in.  It seemed apropos.  Yeah, but once you get more of the adrenaline, you always need more.  That's when people begin to lose their way.  Was it in the... Yeah.  Or in the... Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  of the committee on the part of the Senate to escort the President of the United States in the House Chamber.  Maybe he should have wrote her in.  That's too soon to happen, though.  I wish we could have some more people that would switch the votes in Florida.  That's right.  If we could find some more people, we could.  Yeah.  So what happens in Iran now that we completed that mission?  Yeah.  Should I just ask that?  Actually, I could ask that acting like a Republican source, arguing.  I don't like it.  It seems too weird.  Oh, God.  It's bad.  Well, maybe if I scratch that it was a Republican source.  That's why I keep seeing it.  It's Trump.  Yep.  Okay, until before we announce him, we better be sure.  Let's make sure this happened to him.  And if something happens, you'll be right there.  If it still is happening... I think we're on.  You know what I mean?  Everything he trades is why the more I hated him.  It's just, you know what I hated?  He had these noisy speaking.  He just sounded freaky.  He's not sure if it's going to happen, but he's supposed to maybe lose his staff.  And he said, but you'll know if it's still killing them because at that point, it's just, how will we handle them shipping so much more of the heroin coming into this part of the country and changing it?  Right.  It's bad.  Even if they're ready, it always takes a bit.  They'll both be late.  You would think they'd know this.  Pretty sure it's got to start soon.  Is my tie straight down the middle?  Yes, sir.  Good.  Are we ready to go home?  Yep.  We're all ready.  Just a few hours to go.  I just noticed something.  There's more in the aisle than in the seat.  That's how all our members are so strong.  Just look at them.  Now if we were to do this, I'd also expect to have to do more than censoring.  Yeah, you'd have to.  Or this would be sort of tough to sell.  Guess we'll just see.  You'd have to or else there's chaos.  But we're stopping that.  Pence and Pelosi are at the front of the room and if you look back on the right there's a guy moving very quickly toward them.  We're not out of the woods just yet.  But we're gonna do great.  I'll be waiting for you.  Mike Pence has 20-20 peripheral vision.  Just watch his eyes, how he never quite looks when the gavel is slamming.  Or when Pelosi points.  Clearly, example after example, Mike Pence hears and sees everything that Nancy Pelosi does right next to him.  He's very keyed in on her voice.  So you'll see him respond.  You'll see him look where she points.  You'll see him nod his head when she talks, but you will not see him make it even appear that he is focused on her, even though he completely is.  I'm woke.  Finally, there's hope.  Do you believe him when he says he didn't see or hear her tear up that speech?  Finally.  You think that's easy?  That's not easy.  Be sure to follow me on Twitter at.  I double underscore love underscore Trump. ",
