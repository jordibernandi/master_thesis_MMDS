Why are you... Why are you pulling me over?  I see you wanted me to get over, and I'm doing the speed limit.  I was doing 70 miles an hour.  The speed limit is 70 miles an hour.  I'm doing the speed limit.  It don't matter which lane I'm in.  The slowest traffic keeps to the right, so I'm doing 70.  If I was doing below the speed limit, then I need to be over to the right.  That's because they were speeding.  They passed me because they were on the right because they were speeding.  71, 72, you're going to line up for that.  But if you're going behind, we'll line up behind you at 63.  And they're not problems.  And actually, four and three hills are going below that.  Right.  But did you realize them?  cars that was beside me, I couldn't get over?  If you want to pull your cameras up and see that those cars was beside me and I put my blinker on, I couldn't get over?  OK, so if I couldn't get over, OK, so if I couldn't get over, then I'm going to stay right there.  My registration's in the truck.  So if I couldn't get over, so let me guess.  You could get over.  That's the point.  When I put my blinker on, it was cars coming up the right side.  So I cut my blinker off. ",
