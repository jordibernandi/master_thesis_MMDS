The one and only reason I came here to was, how you say, apologize for all the jihads and to let you know that there's no hard feelings for all the crusades.  Cool?  really really that's the only reason you're here.  yes indeed it is oh well.  in that case i forgive you not mohammed.  excellent Um, BTW, it is my understanding that you are having the, how you say, healing powers.  Here we go.  For instance, in the Bible, there were certain people you laid your hands upon and healed them and I was wondering if maybe you could do the same for me, but without any actual physical contact.  Why?  What's wrong?  No, no, nothing.  Nothing at the moment.  But I was wondering if maybe you had a, how do you say, a coronavirus vaccine miracle that would make me immune.  Ahem.  Uh, no, it does not work that way, Notmo.  Uh, you gotta have faith you won't get it.  And, uh, then, um, maybe you will and maybe you won't.  Who knows?  Um, I am having faith, thank you very much.  Really?  It doesn't seem like it.  I mean, uh, why don't you just fly a plane into the virus?  Wow!  Jesus, viruses, first of all, viruses are exceptionally tiny, and I- So?  So, one would have to be a pilot of exceptional skill, and I don't- Doesn't sound like faith to me.  I am so sick of this, you son of a whore!  Hey, I told you, my mother was a virgin.  That is poppycock to the extreme.  Allah himself locked her up in a Motel 7.  A Motel 7, Dad, is that true?  No!  J.C.,  who is it?  Who is coming? ",
