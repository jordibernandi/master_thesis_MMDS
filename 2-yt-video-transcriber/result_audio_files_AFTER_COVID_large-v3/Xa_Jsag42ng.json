He's that guy with the boot on his head and his platform is always something about getting kids to brush their teeth and everybody gets a free pony.  You know, he even got into the debate once, I think, when he was running for mayor of New York, and it was hilarious.  And opening two minutes to Mr.  Vermin Supreme. ",

AOC's obviously been inspired by other talented actresses who've been able to pull off the ditzy, stereotypical airhead like the great Lucille Ball of I Love Lucy, who was not only a very intelligent woman, but a very intelligent businesswoman as well.  Or like Suzanne Somers in Three's Company.  Both very intelligent women in real life.  And like AOC, play very convincing dummies.  It looks like she's even taken a little inspiration from Carrot Top 2 in his prop comedy when she wore that Norton Antivirus CD as a mask to help stop the coronavirus.  Prop comedy is pretty hard and often kind of cheesy, but she was able to pull it off pretty well, I thought.  Another great bit that she did is when she referred to the three branches of government as the three chambers, which was a playoff of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, kind of pretending that she only reads children's books and never read a civics book and doesn't know how the government actually functions.

Another great AOC bit was when she said that the world was gonna end in 12 years, and then every few months, the timeline gets shorter by a year.  You know, like three months later, it's 11 years that it's gonna end, and a few months later, it's down to 10.

I mean, here we have a seated member of Congress openly calling for a communist revolution.  She's talking about giving people free money if they don't want to work, and then the rest of us are going to pay for their vacations.  And instead of the Democrat Party being like, no, that's communism, they said, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  It's tough to do jokes about race these days.  It's a sure way to get yourself canceled if you're white.  But since she's Latino, she can get away with it.
