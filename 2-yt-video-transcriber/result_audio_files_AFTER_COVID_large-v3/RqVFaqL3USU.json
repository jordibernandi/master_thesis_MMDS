            "text": "Dear friends and brothers and sisters all over the world, our lives will never be the same after this season.  The world will never be the same after this season.  Tens of thousands have been fasting in this 40 day seasons around the world.  I've never seen anything like it.  It was God breathed.  And then this virus comes.  And all the structures and idols of the world are being shaken.  But I also think something's going on.  The harvest is being ripened everywhere.  And then at the end of the fast, who could have guessed that it would end on Passover and communion, conversion at the same time.  And literally, I know tens of millions of believers around the world are taking communion and crying out Passover.  I think God has set this whole thing up.  And with that kind of weight on this, then why wouldn't we put the same kind of weight on a worldwide Pentecost in 50 days, crying to God that Jesus would baptize His church in the Holy Spirit?  Therefore, we're actually sustaining this season of prayer and fasting, not fasting, but daily praying, like in the upper room, day by day, intensifying our prayers for the outpouring of Holy Spirit.  Therefore, we're asking you to go and join us at lewengel.com slash Pentecost.  For 50 days, we'll be feeding you materials, stirring your heart, joining us together with a common, united purpose, daring to believe that these are the days of Pentecost. ",
