And so in terms of what hurt, pain, suffering, death has happened so far is really just beginning.  This is going to unfold for months to come yet.  And that's, I think, what people don't quite yet understand.  What we saw in China, I'm convinced as are many of my colleagues, as soon as they release all of these social distances, these mandated stay in homes, haven't left your home in weeks and weeks kind of thing, when they go back to work, they're on planes, trains, subways, buses, crowded spaces, manufacturing plants, even China is going to come back again.  And so this really is acting like an influenza virus, something that transmits very, very easily through the air.  We now have data to show that you're infectious before you even get sick.  And in some cases, quite highly infectious, just breathing is all that you need to do.  So from this perspective, I can understand why people would say, well, wait a minute, flu kills a lot more itself every year than this does.  And I remind people this is just the beginning.  Probably the best guess that we have right now on what limited data we have is say this is going to be at least 10 to 15 times worse than the worst seasonal flu year we see. ",

We conservatively estimate that this could \u2013 And require 48 million hospitalizations, 96 million cases actually occurring, over 480,000 deaths that can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation.  So this is not one to take lightly.  And I think that's what I can understand if you say there's only been 10 deaths or 20 deaths or 50 deaths.  Just remember, two weeks ago, we were talking about almost no cases in the United States.  And now that we're testing for it and watching the spread as it's unfolding, those numbers are going up astronomically.  Three weeks ago, Italy was just living life just fine.  Now they're literally in a virtual shutdown in the northern parts of Italy.  And that's the challenge with an infectious disease like this.  It can spread very quickly, and it also can affect people.  I think maybe to put this into modern terms, because this is something we think of often when we think of, you know, pre-antibiotic days, you know, the old-time medicine.  We have an employee at our Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, and she has a dear friend who lives in Milan, Italy, and she works at a hospital there, and she texted us to this employee of ours last night.  And this was an email that came out yesterday from one of their physicians in Milan at the largest hospital there, and he said... I just got a very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of the Milan's largest hospitals.  They're deciding who they have to let die.  They aren't screening the staff anymore because they need all hands on deck, and they have very small areas of the hospital dedicated to non-COVID patients where they still screen doctors.  Everybody else is dedicated to COVID patients, so even if they're positive, meaning that they're sick, but they don't have a severe cough or fever, then they have to work.  He says that they're seeing an alarming number of cases in the 40-something age range, and these are horrible cases.  So we need to stop thinking that this is only an old person's disease.  This is what's going to unfold not just in Wuhan.  It's unfolding in Milan.  It's unfolding here in Seattle.  And this is what's going to continue to rollingly unfold throughout the world. ",

Those men over the age of 70 who also smoked, 8% to 10% of them died.  65% of older Chinese men smoke.  The case fatality rate or the percentage of people who die in women in that same age group was only about 2%.  In that case, very few women smoke.  Now, the challenge we have is that that's the Chinese data.  But there are a series of risk factors that we worry about that if they overlay on this disease are going to cause bad outcomes.  And we happen to be right at ground zero for one of the major ones here in this country, and that's obesity.  We know that obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really cause severe life-threatening disease.  And 45 percent of our population today over the age of 45 in this country are obese or severely obese, men and women.  So one of the concerns we have is we're going to see more of these, what I guess I would call very serious and life-threatening cases occur in our country because of a different set of risk factors than we saw in China.

That virus would appear, well, that's not a very strong virus.  But in fact, when it infects us, it could kill us.  So we've seen cases of fatal disease that were exposed to people that had minor symptoms themselves.  wow and this is what's unfolding here.  and this is where i think is such an important.  and i said why the timing is so important because you know joe we've really got to get information out to the public.  there's so much misinformation right now and you know we're going to be in this for a while.  this is not going to happen overnight and i worry.  i keep telling people we're handling this like it's a corona blizzard.  you know two or three days we're back to normal.  this is a corona virus winter and we're going to have the next three months or more six months or more that are going to be like this.  And, you know, so far this thing has been unfolding exactly as we predicted it.  We and our center put out a piece on January 20th and said this is going to spread worldwide.  At the time people said, ah, no, it's just China.  We put out a piece the first week of February and said this is going to pop probably the last week of February, first week of March.  Because what happens is it has what's called an R-naught or a doubling time of these every four days.  So the increase is doubling every four days.  So if you go from 2 to 4 to 8 to 16, it takes a while to build up.  But when you start going from 500 to 1,000 to 2,000 to 4,000, that's what we're seeing happen in places like Italy.  We're beginning to see it in some ways up in Seattle.  It's what happened in China.  And, you know, when people are confronted with that, suddenly this low-risk phenomenon that everybody talks about isn't so low anymore.  And that's what we need to prepare people for. ",

In studies in Germany, which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours, they actually followed a group of people who had been exposed to somebody at an automobile manufacturing plant.  And then they had nine people that with this exposure said, if you have any symptoms at all, contact us.  We want to follow up.  And they all agreed.  Well, they got infected.  And so in the very first hours, just feeling bad, sore throat, they went in and sampled their throats, their saliva, their nose for virus.  They did blood.  They did stool.  They did urine.  And they found that at that very moment, when they first got sick, they had incredibly high levels of virus, sometimes 10,000 times that we saw with SARS in their throats, meaning they were infectious at that point already.  And they hadn't even had symptoms yet of really any nature.  They weren't coughing yet.  And that's where we're concerned because that's the kind of transmission.  I always have said trying to stop influenza virus transmission like trying to stop the wind.  We've never had anything successfully do that other than vaccine, and we don't have a vaccine here.  So what's happening is that people in public spaces are getting infected.  And the way you need to address that is, unfortunately, if you're older, over 55, you have some underlying health problems, which unfortunately a lot of Americans do.  We have obesity.  then right now you don't want to be in large public spaces and trying to potentially get infected.  So you can take care of that part.  As far as what can public health do, we can talk about this.  We're not going to have a vaccine anytime soon.  That's happy talk.  We can close schools.  One of the big challenges we have right now, if we close schools, what do we accomplish?  influenza virus.  when we close schools during outbreaks because it turns out kids get infected in school and they're like little virus reactors.  You know, they come home and they transmit it to mom and dad and brothers and sisters.  And so we close school sometimes.  Christmas breaks are always great for kind of putting the dampening effect on flu.  In this case, kids are not getting sick very often at all, which is one of the really good news features of this disease.  In China, only 2.1% of the cases were under 19 years of age. ",

One study showed that they still get infected with the virus, but they don't get sick.  And we have that happen.  There's a disease called infectious hepatitis, hepatitis A, where we have outbreaks in daycares.  And the way we know we have an outbreak is because it's transmitted through the stool, fecal-oral.  His mom and dad and the daycare providers all get sick.  And the kids, those symptoms, we go in and test the kids, they're all positive.  So some diseases will manifest primarily when you're an adult but not as a child.  This one appears to be the same.  So do we close schools or not if we're not really spreading the disease?  Because it turns out that if we close schools, a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are working in the medical care area have kids in school.  And if suddenly we're closing schools for two or three months, who's going to take care of those kids?  One-fourth of the American population has no sick leave.  If we close schools, they don't get paid if they have to stay home.  So when you ask what can we do, we have to really be thoughtful about what we do.  Are we doing more harm than good by closing schools, for example, even though everybody will say, oh, we've got to do everything we can?  Or do we just tell people, you know, it's going to be limiting your contact as much as you can, and that's really about what we can do. ",

You know, one of the other things we're doing right now, Joe, this is really one of the things that has me most concerned about this whole situation is our group has been studying for the last year and a half with support from the Walton Family Foundation looking at critical drug shortages.  It turns out that we identified 153 drugs in this country.  that people need right now or they die.  I mean, it's on the crash card.  It's acute critical drugs.  100% of them are generic.  All of them basically are made offshore of the United States.  And a large part of them are made in China and India.  And at this point, we have shortages anyway every day, just before this crisis happened.  Now these supply chains have gone down.  Our group is actively helping the United States government try to figure out where they can get these drugs.  Now, just think of this.  If I came to you and said the Defense Department was going to outsource all its munitions production to China, you'd look at me and say, come on.  You know what?  The U.S.  Defense Department has no more access to these drugs than anybody else.  They are beholden to China for these drugs.  690,000 Americans have end-stage renal disease right now.  Most of their primary drugs are coming from China.  And now with the shutdown and what's happening with this, and this is what I talked about in the book, why I was so concerned, because we are at risk.  So even this situation as it unfolds, it's not just about what the virus does to you.  It's about what the entire system is rigged up to be and what this virus does once it gets into it. ",
