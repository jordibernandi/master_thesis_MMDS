            "text": "Hello there, Carlton Pearson here, inviting and welcoming you to 21 days.  for some of you that's already begun.  Some of it will begin today or tomorrow.  21 days of separating yourself for higher purposes, higher enhancements, higher consciousness through prayer.  Meditation, prayer through 21 days of a Daniel's fast.  Some of us are going the first several days with total absence from food, only drinking water.  And then when we do start eating, we will just eat fresh vegetables or fruits or grains and seeds or nuts, things like that, and stick to the plant based diet for 21 days.  Daniel did that in scripture, refusing to eat the king's dainties, saying away from because the whole thing is about detoxifying ourselves, taking the poisons out of our system, allowing ourselves to be cleansed and purged and purified.  The universe is correcting itself, and we're part of that correction.  So enter in.  And what we start this month, many generally continue several months, or some have started with me several years ago and stayed with it, have never gone back to eating regular meals with meat in them.  Occasionally they might have something, but some have become vegans.  I've never gone that far, but I appreciate it from time to time, and I do it.  So listening to these brief conversations, Short little meditations or affirmations that I give you over the next 21 days will be a blessing.  And of course, you can repeat these during the day, during the month, during the year.  They'll always be encouraging and elaborate on them.  Add to them what you want and share them with friends.  Just share them randomly.  A lot of us are walking into a new age of expansion, enlightenment, science, technology, and a deeper spirituality than we've ever known in the past.  So I welcome you.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you for allowing.  Your consciousness is important both to you and to me.  God bless you.  God be you.  Here you go.  Welcome to 2021, a year of change, a year of powerful, pivotal transition, a new age, a new day, a new pace, a new spirit of enlightenment.  We're calling it the age of Aquarius.  I'm very excited about this age and about you in it and us together walking and working out our existence and our evolution.  One of my favorite poems I want to offer to you this year, and you can use it all year long and think about it and even meditate on it.  It's called Desiderata by Max Ehrman.  Just listen to these powerful words.  Go placidly amid the noise and the haste and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant.  They too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons.  They are vexations to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter.  For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your own career.  However humble, it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs for the world is full of trickery, but let this not bind you to what virtue there is.  Many persons strive for high ideals and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself, especially do not feign affection.  Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  but do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.  You have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding exactly as it should.  Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him or it to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations and the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.  Be cheerful.  Strive to be happy.  I love you.  I believe in you.  Your best is yet to come. ",
