They're extremists.  It's their political ideology.  It has nothing to do with who their parents are.  I'm sure, in fact, their parents worked very, very hard to get here and are probably very upset with them.  Let's read a little bit of this and see what they have to say, because the tweet they put out, it all seems so sympathetic to these poor Black Lives Matter supporters, protesters who there's a photo of them in a car holding molotovs.  Oh, wow.  I mean, it like it looks like them.  I'll put it that way.  I'd be very careful because we're dealing with it, you know, innocent until proven guilty and all that stuff.  The NYPD van on a Brooklyn street was banged up and empty, a battered steel shell with shattered windows and a mask of spray paint.  shortly before 1 a.m.  On Saturday, May 30th, the fourth straight night of nationwide protests against police brutality, a Molotov cocktail set into blaze.  A surveillance camera perched outside the NYPD's 88th precinct down the block captured the incident, including a tan town and country minivan at the scene.  Around 10 minutes later, officers pulled over a vehicle fitting that description.  Colin Ford Mattis, 32, was at the wheel, and Aruj Raman, 31, was in the passenger seat.  Officers found a lighter, a tank of gasoline, and a bottle stuffed with toilet paper in the back seat.  Raman and Mattis were handcuffed and transported into holding cells at the NYPD headquarters.  Two of 23 people arrested in Brooklyn that night for actions connected to the protests against police brutality.  They're facing life in prison.  And based on what BuzzFeed just wrote, I kind of think they'll get convicted. ",
