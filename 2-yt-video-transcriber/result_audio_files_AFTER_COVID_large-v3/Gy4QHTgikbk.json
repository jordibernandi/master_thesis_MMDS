And it usually takes, and this is a pretty good kind of description of what it might feel like on the ground.  Um, the caveat is it's, it's, it's, it's a completely insufficient description and someone's going to be listening.  It was like nothing you could say is going to come close, but it'll take about three big hits inhalations in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.  Um, And there's no great definition of that, but basically meaning moving away from, you know, not just having the typical psilocybin or LSD experience where like things are radically different, but you're still basically a person in this reality to go in somewhere else.  And so that'll typically take like three hits.  And this stuff comes on like a freight train.  So one takes a hit, and around the time of the first exhalation, so we're talking about a few seconds in, or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit, it'll start to come on.  And they're already up to, let's say, you know, what they might get from a 30 milligram or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip.  They're already there at the second hit, but they're going, their consciousness is geared.  This is like acceleration, not speed, to speak of physics, okay?  It's like you.  just, those receptors are getting filled like that, and they're going from zero to 60 in like, you know, Tesla time.  And- At the second hit, again, they're at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience they've ever had.  And then if they can take that third hit, and some people can't, they're propelled into this... other reality and the nature of that other reality.  it will will differ depending on who you ask but you know folks will talk often talk about and and we've done some survey research on this entities of different types elves tend to pop up.  yeah all the caveat is i i strongly presume all of this is culturally influenced you know.  but Thinking more about the psychology and the neuroscience, there is probably something fundamental.  For someone, it might be colored as elves.  Others, it might be colored as, I don't know, Terrence McKenna called them self-dribbling basketballs.  For someone else, it might be little animals.  Or someone else, it might be aliens.  I think that probably is dependent on... who they are and what they've been exposed to.  But just the fact that one has this sense that they're surrounded by autonomous entities.  Right. ",

Like there's communication between these entities and often they're telling them Things that the person says are self-validating, but it seems like it's impossible.  Like it really seems like, and again, this is what people say oftentimes, that it's, It really is like downloading some intelligence from a higher dimension or whatever metaphor you want to use.  Sometimes these things come up in dreams where it's like someone is exposed to something that \u2013 I've had this in a dream where it seems like what they are being exposed to is \u2013 physically impossible but yet at the same time self-validating.  it seems true like that they really are figuring something out.  of course the challenge is to say something in in concrete terms after the experience.  that where you could um you know verify that in any way and i i'm not familiar of any examples of that ",

And so there's that kind of sense that you can take something back, but you can't, where our cognition is not capable to fully grasp the truth, we'll just get a kind of sense of it, and somehow that process is mind expanding, that there's a greater truth out there.  That seems like what, from the people I've heard talk about, that seems to be what it is.  And that's so fascinating that there's fundamentally to this whole thing is the communication between an entity that is other than yourself.  So it's not just like a visual experience, like you're like floating through the world, is there's other beings there, which is kind of, I don't know.  I don't know what to sort of, from a person who likes Freud and Carl Jung, I don't know what to think about that.  That being, of course, from one perspective is just you looking in the mirror, but it could also be from another perspective, like actually talking to other beings. ",

What might be happening is that just the associative net, the level of learning, the \u2013 The comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to.  that the only way for the nervous system, for the aware sense of self to orient towards it is all by metaphor.  And so I do think, you know, when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist, I think we always got to be careful and be as grounded as possible.  But I'm also... willing to speculate and sort of cast nets wide with caveat.  But, you know, I think of things like archetypes and, you know, it's plausible that there are certain stories, there are certain, you know, we've gone through millions of years of evolution.  It may be that we have certain characters and stories that are sort of that our central nervous system is sort of wired to tend to. ",

And we think about This is why metaphors are always more powerful than laying out all the details all the time, speaking in parables.  This is why, as much as I hate it, if you're presenting to Congress or something and you have all the best data in the world... It's not as powerful as that one anecdote as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session and it transformed her life.  That's a story that's meaningful.  And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change and experience happens with DMT ingestion, these stories of entities, they might be that.  Stories that are constructed.  that is the closest, which is not to say the stories aren't real.  I mean, I think we're getting to layers where what it doesn't really right.  yeah yeah yeah but it's the closest we can come to making sense of it.  because i do what we do know about these psychedelics.  one of the levels beyond the receptor is that the brain is communicating it with itself in a massively different way.  there's massive communication with areas that don't normally communicate and so it i think that comes with It's casting the nets wide.  I think that comes with the insights and helpful novel ways of thinking.  I do think it comes with false positives.  That could be some of the delusion.  And so when you're so far out there, like with the DMAT experience, like maybe alien is the best way that the mind can wrap some arms around that. ",
