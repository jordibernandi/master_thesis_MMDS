            "text": "So during lockdown, I've been up on the channel time and again trying to... explain to people the story of what's going on.  In 2018, 300 people came across the channel in inflatable dinghies.  Last year, the number was nearly 2,000.  This year, it's over 3,000 already, bearing in mind more people come in the August, September months when the weather's warmer, the sea's warmer.  We're on course this year for something like 7,500 people to come across the channel.  I've exposed the fact that despite giving \u00a361 million to the French, that the French Navy actually escort the boats over the Channel.  I've proved that.  It's not disputed.  Since I've tried to get the public to understand the problems with this, the fact that over 80% of those that come are young males, generally between sort of 18 and 26 years old.  Nearly all of them have no identity papers.  They claim to come from Iran, but clearly many now come from Eritrea and goodness knows where else.  And a lot of you have been in touch with me to say that all over the country they've seen some strange things happening.  They've seen local hotels being filled up with asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, call it what you will.  And one of the first places that got in touch with me was some residents here in Bromsgrove in the West Midlands.  So I've come up today to have a look.  We're going to go to Bromsgrove Hilton to find out if it's true that 147 people who've come into the country, been put from Dover onto coaches, which are there almost every day, are going to find out whether it's true that that hotel is now full.  Now I think it probably is because You try and book a room in the Bromsgrove Hilton, have a go.  The number doesn't answer.  The booking form says that basically it's full for the rest of the year at this during the middle of the crisis.  So let's find out what's going on here in Bromsgrove.  But I promise you, whatever we see here today is but the tip of the iceberg.  So the staff there all got sacked?  Not all the staff.  I don't know where.  I think she was a chamberlain up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Must be someone working there.  Strange, isn't it?  Well, I'll get to the bottom of it.  I will.  Thank you, nice to see you.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  Well, there we are.  What we're getting is people saying the biggest problem is that young women are a bit scared to go out because there are gangs of eight or ten and they're being wolf whistled and they're feeling uncomfortable.  That's the main thing.  We've heard other stories too, but that's the main thing.  At the moment, we seem to be getting it.  I understand the local MP, Sajid Javid, said nothing but he said to you that it would be temporary did he?  i had an email from him saying that it was tentatively arranged.  yes yes but it doesn't look very temporary because we tried to book a room and you can try for this week or next week or september and there are no rooms available.  well i'll come to visit your butchers of course.  no I, so, I did these videos about the English Channel, about all the migrant votes coming over, illegal migrant votes coming over.  Since I've been there, I've been told, Sajid Javid said it would be temporary, and it's not, it will just be permanent.  Really?  Well, that's, you know, that's the impression I'm getting. ",

And here you are, a little village in Worcestershire, and you've got 147 young blokes.  You know... now people have told me that Sajid Javid said it was going to be a temporary thing but it's not is it?  no no it's not.  never is is it?  no never is and we tried online to put rooms.  you know I tried as well when I was trying to check it out.  we're in Catshill.  we're finding out how local residents feel about what's happened to the local hotel.  we're 147 young men mostly between the ages of 18 and 26, have been parked.  What we've learned already from residents is that Sajid Javid promised it'd be temporary.  But when we try to book a room, there are no rooms to book.  I mean, you'd have thought hotels were empty.  This one is full.  Thank you for letting me into your home and both of you for talking to me.  Did it come as a big shock when you found out what had happened? ",

            "text": "Well, she keeps talking about the doper stuff, you know, but nothing so far has happened.  And the consequence of open doors is what you're seeing down the road here.  They're staff cars.  So here we are at the Bromsgrave Hilton.  Here's the car park.  Completely empty.  Completely empty.  And yet we couldn't book a room when we tried.  We did try.  They're booked for months and months it would seem.  I wonder why.  Windows are open so people are staying here.  This is the Hilton Bromsgrove.  Let's have a quick look.  Can we book rooms there?  I'm afraid not.  When?  If I'm talking to my friend.  Er, yes, hotel is closed to the public.  Who's it open to, then?  I can't disclose your information.  OK.  Hello.  I'm fine, and you?  Goody good.  You staying here?  Yeah.  Could you not worry me, please?  OK.  So this is a completely closed-off site now, is it?  Yeah.  You work for Serco, do you?  Er, yeah.  OK.  OK.  Well, nice work if you can get it.  Not for me.  Well, that's the end of our visit to Bromsgrove.  As you saw, I walked into the hotel there.  It was not welcome.  It's closed, but it was not closed because all 147 beds are taken.  Challenged by the bloke, asked to get out, told not to film.  I asked him, do you work for Serco?  He said yes.  They, that company, has been awarded a \u00a32 billion contract over the next 10 years.  Now, given... that the numbers coming in across Dover are actually bigger than projected, it'll be more than 4 billion.  And I want to make this point, all right?  It's costing us 4 billion quid.  There are 48,000 people in this situation already.  Even if... Their claims for refugee status are refused, which they mostly are.  They will still stay in the country.  They'll leave the hotel.  They'll finish up working, you know, picking fruit, working in the rag trade in Leicester or whatever it is.  They will move into the illegal slave economy in this country.  This government, conservative government, and we're here, by the way, in a conservative constituency.  Sajid Javid, former Home Secretary, is the MP.  This government is doing nothing about it.  There is a big sign.  on the White Cliffs of Dover saying, everybody, welcome.  It's costing us a fortune.  And a further thought, we've no idea who some of these people are.  We've no idea whether some of these might be ISIS.  It's possible.  I don't know.  But we have seen failed asylum seekers committing horrible acts in our country before.  We should not be doing this.  I want this story to be out there and be talked about.  Oh, yes, I know.  Of course, mainstream media will condemn me for even daring to talk about it.  But it is the truth.  We should have a proper debate about it.  And please, if in your local area, one of your hotels has been filled up in similar circumstances, please contact us at the end of this video, because I want the full story of what is going on in our country.
