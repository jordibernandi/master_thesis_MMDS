I'm not sure why that's necessary.  The truth about same-sex marriage is simply that sometimes boys like boys and sometimes girls like girls.  So girls who like girls might want to marry girls and boys who like boys might want to marry boys.  That, right there, is the whole truth about same-sex marriage.  It's really not that difficult.

            "text": "I mean, if you want to be anti-abortion, allowing a form of sex that can't possibly lead to a baby seems like a no-brainer to me.  That being said, abortion is a very complex topic that often can't be boiled down to a black-and-white pro-life versus pro-choice stance.  Most people that I have spoken to on the matter have nuanced positions.  Abortion is okay until the brain develops.  It is okay if the life of the mother is at risk.  It is never okay.  It is always okay.  It is okay up until the point where the fetus can survive outside the mother.  It is okay, but only as a last resort.  All of these are distinct positions with their own arguments in favor of and against them.  Personally, I tend to fall on the okay until the development of the brain, with the caveat that the health, both physical and mental, of the mother is the first priority.  But then even this position is a bit more nuanced than that.  There isn't some magical line where it's the last day of the second trimester, better hurry up and abort it before the brain shows up on the first day of the third trimester.  All that being said, the cerebrum, which is the part of the brain that basically makes you you and is responsible for thinking, feeling, and remembering, doesn't start to develop until just before the baby is born.  So that is why I can caveat my stance with the health and the safety of the mother being primary.  The fetus doesn't start to have thoughts, memories, or emotions until just before it is born.  So while I recognize the potential that a fetus has to become a person, and I feel that potential should be respected, it should not come at the cost of another person's safety if that other person is unwilling.  But let's continue with the video.  I'm curious to see how you're going to equate same-sex marriage with the Pearl Harbor attack and abortion. ",

So the days that live in infamy, over 2,400 people die in the Pearl Harbor attack, over 60 million babies killed, and now a day so bad that it belongs on the same list as these two events.  Men are allowed to marry other men, and women are allowed to marry other women.  Like, seriously, even if I agreed up to this point, whether the marriage is legal or not, they will pair off and form relationships because that's what humans do.  And there will be sexual activity in those relationships because that is also something humans do.  Literally nothing changed except now the government recognizes that those relationships exist.  Nobody died, nobody got hurt, and yet that day should live in infamy alongside Pearl Harbor.  Give me a break. ",

Should we worship the original Constitution as inerrant?  When there is ambiguity in the Constitution left there explicitly for future protection of unnamed rights, how are we to interpret that when these rights that were unnamed in the past become named and they are now in question?  The guys who wrote the Constitution were smart, but they were not omniscient and they were smart enough to know that they were not omniscient.  That is why there are legal ways to change and reinterpret the Constitution.  The Constitution was drafted by men who owned slaves.  Many of them didn't seem to see the irony of writing a Bill of Rights while owning people as property.  Do you suppose that we should use the pre 13th Amendment Constitution, seeing as how the 13th Amendment clearly went against the wishes of the people who wrote the Constitution?  How about we just stop worshiping documents and stop pretending not only that they are perfect, but that your specific interpretation of them is the only possible correct interpretation? ",

Not that wisdom can't be found in old writings from other cultures, but we need to treat these old writings as what they are, the representation of a different culture.  I don't think it's okay to buy slaves from the nations surrounding Israel, even though it says it's okay in the Bible.  Does that mean that the Bible is completely devoid of any advice that could improve our lives?  No, it does have some good stuff in it, but it's few and far between.  The Bible is far more interesting as a book of cultural significance than as a manual to live your life by. ",

Seems like the Bible generally says that the governmental authority is given by God, and so should be obeyed.  In fact, side note, but Romans 13.6 explicitly tells you to pay taxes because taxes are how the government pays for their workers, and the government workers are servants of God because all authority is given by God.  So according to the Bible, churches should pay taxes voluntarily, even if they are technically exempt.  I wonder if any of them do that. ",

How does giving out a marriage license violate their moral code or religious freedom or whatever if the marriage doesn't count unless it's a straight Christian marriage?  You said it yourself.  It doesn't matter if the government says they're married.  They aren't unless God says they are.  So if these are godly public servants who want to do God's will, then handing out a marriage license that won't result in an actual marriage seems, at worst, harmless.  They can't be acting against God's will if the government is incapable of performing a marriage against God's will. ",
