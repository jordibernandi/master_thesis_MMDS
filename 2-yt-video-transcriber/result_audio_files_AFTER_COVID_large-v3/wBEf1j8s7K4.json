And every single one of those assumptions is a bias that we make.  Actually, I was doing creative writing on this last night and talking about it.  We always have to... make some form of judgment in order to make an action.  So for me to literally decide to walk out of the McKinley Humanities building and come through the Student Union versus coming down these stairs, I had to make a judgment assumption.  And that is technically a bias.  I chose because I wanted those bathrooms versus walking down to these bathrooms because the main bathrooms on that floor were full for the guys.  So I decided to come knowing the student union would have more open stalls than going down here and going to the student union over here on my way out.  So I had my assumption as to where traffic would be by watching different things and patterns and being here long enough that I made my choice coming from my bias of being here and knowing the different traffic flows that happen or from what I perceive as the different traffic flows that happen at this current ",

You go down there, you study them, you're already coming from your culture as a bias.  And then you have to try and break that down to understand them and what everything means for them.  And what anthropologists do when they write their ethnographies about these people, be it in the Amazon or be actually even here in the  U.S.,  where most anthropological work is done, is they have to recognize their bias and show as best as they can that they've gotten past it, but also recognize how it affects how they view.  So anthropology recognizes it, accepts it, and does its best to work with it.  Now, when you're working with a quantitative factor of math, we have less of an ability to have a bias.  Now, I'm sure we don't usually just do high level math for absolutely no reason.  We're always trying to prove something.  When you're in the physics department, you have a bias to how you actually think something is.  That's called your hypothesis.  in a way that is a bias.  And so when you go to prove your hypothesis with math or science, something quantitative, you're already kind of stating your bias.  And you're trying to look for, you think A plus B will equal C by saying you are starting at A and you believe C, that is stating your bias.  But in this case, your bias can be tested by other people without that same bias.  And every single time anyone does any work where it's peer reviewed, that's the goal is to help remove bias and actually say, yes, this is a standardized claim.  Yes, this is something that can be backed up and believed and recognized despite there always being a bias. ",

You know, I put my glasses on and that helps me see things and make a choice from where I am and what I've experienced.  And therefore I'll make my choice A plus B equals C. But there's always that factor of we're human beings.  We've all had different experiences.  We all come from different backgrounds.  And that's where your bias really lies.  Now, yes, we can work our best to recognize and remove our bias as best as possible.  But anthropology does a really good job by recognizing it, stating it, and then trying to state, I have it.
