            "text": "Not long.  It ain't nobody's business.  But here come the research system.  Okay.  You know, I've been doing research, and I shouldn't be giving Felicio.  BJ.  I know you don't know what that word means.  BJ.  Just look at a BJ.  Urban Dictionary.  BJ.  What is that?  She used to give a BJ like nobody's business.  She could suck a golf ball out of a truck exhaust.  But now she's doing research.  And in the research it says sodomy.  And she goes, oh, that's sodomy?  Listen, that's not the biblical definition of sodomy.  The biblical definition of sodomy goes with same sex.  She's doing research.  So now she don't want to, she don't want to, she don't want to.  Oral sex.  Brothers, I'm going to help you out here.  Here we go, brothers.  You know what you do?  What we do, what we do?  Tell us all.  You get you some jelly, put that jelly on.  He said, listen, you got, you got 10 minutes.  Now you're giving her 10 minutes.  If you don't do what you used to do, I'm going out this door.  Wait a minute.  I'm telling you, I ain't got time for anybody playing games.  So he said, if you don't do what you used to do, he's out the door.  So where do you think he's going, y'all?  Where do you think that man's going?  To another woman's house.  The same brother, this elder here, Bishop Nathaniel, he teaches against religion.  He even says that sister wives are whores.  But yet his proposal is if the woman don't wanna do fellatio or BJ, which is that blow job, his counsel to his congregation is for the brother to put some jelly on his penis.  So we know what he's basically gonna force us to do, suck it off.  Since you don't wanna do it, I'm gonna give you some, basically I'm gonna give you a treat with it.  And if you don't do what you used to do, I'm giving you 10 minutes.  If not, I'm out the door.  Where do you think that brother's going, y'all?  Come on now.  We know men.  He's going to another woman's house.  It's the same brother who teaches against polygyny.  It's saying, okay, well, if she don't want to do it, y'all get the pass.  Go ahead and leave, brothers.  Where do you think he's going?  He's going to get what he's not getting at home.  Think about it.  In this same lesson, he got to talking about how a person called, talking about the husband was watching porn.  He told his wife to tell her, well, go to a store and get some edible panties.  And you ain't got to worry about that no more.  So obviously he's putting a solution in it.  So what do you think the brother's going to get from this?  All right, well then, since I can't get it at home, I'm going to go somewhere else.  The same exact way how he proposed to the other sister saying, go get some edible bananas.  You ain't got a word about him doing that no more.  So what do you think he's going to do here, y'all?  What do you think the brother's going to do here?  He's going to go leave and go find it elsewhere.  Worst case scenario, he's going to divorce his wife.  And that's even worse.  So, brothers, Mr.  Nathaniel teaches, put some jelly on it.  If she don't want to suck it, let her suck that off.  What is dad going with it?  What the hell is this?  Cause you know, if she went with the white man, he'd have her doing the nastiest thing ever.  And she would never tell the white man, I don't do that.  Okay.  White man got his foot in her head.  She's vomiting and he's still knocking her back out.  She don't say nothing.  But here you go, put some jelly on it.  What the hell is this?  Some jelly.  Or syrup, whatever you like.  Or syrup, whatever you like.  You know my damn nerves, you research sisters.  The Bible says the bag is undefiled.  I'm tired of the emails.  Sisters don't do no research.  And listen, listen, here go the sister.  After we tear up in the scriptures, she gonna go, well, well, here she go.  How am I?  Satan goes, say his balls stink.  Oh, his balls stink.  These are the emails.  I said, let me see the email.  He don't wash downstairs, so I don't feel comfortable doing that.  Well, put that nigga in the shower.  Now, wait a minute.  So... Proverbs 11, 13 says what, y'all?  A talebearer revealeth secrets, but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.  So what do we got there, y'all?  Huh?  What do we got there?  Somebody's in error.  Sirach 19, verse 8.  It says... whether it be a friend or foe, which is an enemy, talk not or speak not of other men's lies.  What he doing right now?  What he doing right now?  Once again, it says, whether it be a friend or foe, talk not of other men's lies.  If thou canst without offense, reveal them not.  Reveal them not.  Huh?  Look at right here.  If you have heard a word, let it die with you.  Don't go running your mouth and be bold.  It will not burst you.  So here it is.  What is he doing, y'all?  Speaking of other men's lives, right?  Nobody correcting him.  Speaking out of other men's lives.  Revealing secrets, embarrassing them.  You know people talk.  You know the words out.  People know who you talking about.  Those were people who trusted and confided in you.  And what you do, you go tell a business to the whole world that people like me who not even your congregation know about it now.  You embarrass them in front of the world.  You embarrass them in front of the world and then you are proposing to men to put some jelly on it.  If your wife don't wanna suck the penis and give her 10 minutes, 10 minutes.  Going up out the door, bro.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Now, who gonna justify this shit?  Who gonna justify that?  Give her 10 minutes out the door.  Let's not play stupid.  We grown.  We know where that man's going to another woman's house.  To another woman's house.  Think about it, they live together.  So he go out the door, where he going?  Another woman house.  Where is he going?  The only woman he got on earth won't do it.  He's gone.  Where you think he's going?  Where you think eventually he gonna end up?  What about the new brothers coming to the truth?  Where you think they gonna go?  Now, you teach against Polly.  You call the sister wise whores.  What would you teach in here then?  Divorce?  Or polygyny?  Which one is it?  Put some soap on it.  The hell is this?  Yeah, the royal penis is clean now.  I'm going to take a bath.  Why?  Have them nice hot eggs.  Because you know, he said, babe, have it ready when I get home.  Make sure the bath is there.  Babe, get in the tub.  I'll wash you.  I'll do it for you.  Treat the man like a king.  Get on my nerves.  Get on your nerves. ",
