            "text": "What they're trying to say, from my understanding, like I said, is this idea that we assume and do things based on logic, right?  Like logic is kind of this thing that we more or less agree on.  Did we discover it?  Did we invent it?  Yeah, that's a different kind of question.  But we kind of have it, and we can kind of use it.  And they're kind of pointing out this fact that Well, like this is an assumption that you're making that your logic makes sense, that logic is even true, that logic is even meaningful.  And how can you even make that assumption as they would frame it?  Right.  That that this is making sense without without a creator, without a God kind of making that happen, without laying the groundwork.  And I already know some precepts are going to comment on this and say I'm not telling this right, but that's a loose understanding of what's going on here.  And the problem I hope is obvious in that you just can't start with a god as the basis for knowing something because \u2013 You have to \u2013 I mean it's begging the question.  It's proving what you've already assumed to be true.  And so you can't go anywhere with that, and that's why these conversations feel like they go around and around and around and around in circles, and they just keep asking you, well, how do you know that?  Well, how do you know that?  How do you know you're not a brain in a vat?  Because like I \u2013 kind of in tandem to the previous call here, I don't think that we can start anywhere with this idea of truth unless we start with our observations, unless we just admit to the fact that we are \u2013 beings and we just were.  inputs are coming into our systems whether it be through our eyes or ears or mouth or nose and we have to start with our senses at some point if we're going to examine the physical world and make sense of it and yeah we figure out oh there's some fallacies in our thinking.  oh we're not as rational as we think when we when we put pen to paper and we and we talk about like economic systems and stuff for example.  right but like that doesn't mean that we can't like demonstrate things or make predictions about things, even if our logic or rationality is still kind of wonky, I could still say the sun's going to rise tomorrow and we can demonstrate that.  So like, if we can make these basic demonstrations, then I, there's no reason to put God into it.  There's just no reason to start there.  And so that's kind of my take on it.  Matt has a take on it as well.  Obviously you, you mentioned this, he had a debate with Cy and he has a video on his channel about it, but, For the most part, for talking to somebody who is really entrenched in presuppositionalism, it's... Well, it's a waste of time, honestly, because I think out of all the people on Earth that are going to be the least willing to change their mind, in my experience, a presuppositionalist is going to be the one where it's probably not going to happen.  But I could be wrong.  I could meet a presupp that has changed their mind.  I haven't seen that.  I haven't read any testimonies of former presuppositionalists, but I guess they're out there.  I don't know.  So hopefully that answers.  Does that answer your question, Vern? ",

And suppose I'm teaching the class how to solve equations, like X squared minus 5 plus X equals 7, solve for X. what if I'm in the middle of class and the student raises their hand and they say, you know, professor, I've noticed that at the end of all of these problems, X always equals X. How do you account for that?  Before we explain why that is, we can't do any more problems.  There must be a math God.  that's behind all of this.  That's the only reason why X always equals X. And that's kind of what I hear them saying.  And I'm wondering if that's what they think they're saying. ",

Because like math, we think math is like, oh, you know, if we can prove something with math that it has to be real, like.  that's something that we say.  But the truth is math does work on axioms, too, whether they're self-evident or not, you know, whatever.  But it does work on a system of axioms.  You really can't have.  Any kind of philosophical constructive system without axioms, at least the one that makes any sense. ",

And so I'm always very shocked and surprised by my younger creationist Christian friends when they tell me their stories.  I grew up in a different kind of Christianity.  So like I don't I imagine there's some sort of experience to your life that a presuppositionalist argument is going to make sense.  But I've yet to meet somebody that wasn't already a presuppositionalist, you know, that are that is convinced of any of the arguments that are made there, because it certainly doesn't convince me.  Right.  And even if it was true, let's say, let's say presuppositionalist apologetics makes sense and is true.  There is no reason why they couldn't demonstrate the existence of God or Christianity through any other means.  It doesn't mean we can't look at the historical accuracy of the Bible and the events that it portrays or the claims that people make that God intervenes into the world.  We could still do that even with their proposed system.  And yet we still don't have the evidence necessary to lead us to the conclusion that, you know, any of that stuff is real.  So it's It doesn't matter either way.  And that's why I get frustrated with these calls, because it's just it's just.  it's sound and fury.  It's sound and fury.  You know, it's all just nothing.
