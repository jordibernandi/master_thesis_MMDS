            "text": "Video has released of a white cop punching and breaking the jaw of a black business owner after the owner called the cops because he was being robbed.  Now, as I'll get to later, this happens all the time.  And it really gives you an idea, I mean, if you didn't already know, of how the system treats the black community.  Now, this happened in Decatur, Alabama.  I will show you the video, but for some context here.  Kevin Penn, the 47-year-old owner of the Star Spirits and Beverages liquor store in Decatur, Alabama, was punched and tackled by police after reporting a robbery at his own business.  Although the incident occurred last month, video of police assaulting Penn appeared online this last weekend and had no audio.  On Monday, Decatur Police Chief Nate Allen said the officer mistook Penn, who was holding a gun.  We will see about that.  For the robbery suspect, police showed body-worn camera footage from the incident, saying Penn refused to put down his gun when instructed by the officers.  Now, it's weird they say that because I'm going to show you the video here.  Um, again, there's no audio, but we can watch from about when it starts.  So he's out here.  It appears the cops arrive.  Um, Goes back into his store.  Now watch.  What he appears to be doing here is taking apart his weapon.  And he's not holding.  You can see here.  He's not holding a gun.  He may be holding the cartridge.  But he's not holding a gun.  And watch what happens.  Like.  Three cops on him.  The guy that called the cops because he was being robbed.  Again, let's watch it.  So he walks back into his store.  Here he is holding his gun.  And before I even say anything... You are allowed in Alabama to hold, to have a gun on you.  It's his store.  He's allowed to have it.  He was holding the robber at gunpoint until the cops arrived.  That's why he had it on him.  So let's say he was holding the gun.  He's allowed to do that.  It's his store.  It's his gun.  He can do that.  But even apart from that, just going off the police story.  They claim he was still holding his gun.  But it doesn't appear he was because he puts it down here.  And again, you can see his hands.  And when before he had this giant silver gun in his hand, it goes down and it's not in his hands now.  It's not there.  So he may be holding the ammo, but there's no gun on him.  And then he gets punched.  Like this is, it's blatant.  Josh Moon, here a reporter in Alabama, tweeted out, Decatur PD had body cam footage.  It showed at the press conference today.  The chief said the store owner who called him to report a robbery was reaching for a gun when he was punched.  He's saying um because he was not reaching for a gun.  Let's watch the clip again.  Reaching for a gun when he was punched?  Where?  The cops straight up walked in and punched him in the face.  That's what happened.  Where's the reaching?  They just punched him in the face.  So, tweet here.  Can y'all continue to spread this?  This is my cousin, Kevin Penn.  The cops literally broke his jaw and shoulder when all he did was call them because this white dude was trying to rob his liquor store.  They let the robber walk right past them and immediately attacked my cousin.  Now, this happens all the time.  This was just on June 1st.  You may have seen this go around, but this was a big story as well.  The LA cops showed up to a store that requested help against looters and immediately put the black store owners in handcuffs.  So there's a longer video of this, but let me play just... I'm not going to play the audio.  There's no point of it.  But here the reporter is telling... is telling the cops that that's not them.  As you'll see, she jumps in here and saying, nope, those aren't the robbers.  See, she's pointing away.  She's pointing at somebody else as the looters.  And the cops come up and basically say, ma'am, be quiet.  We're doing our job.  Meanwhile, they are arresting the store owners that were being looted.  And it continues.  Here they are.  They're against the wall.  i mean it couldn't be more.  it could have been more obvious than that and of course many other stories like this.  2019 texas police tried to arrest a black man in his own yard after misidentifying him from bbc news.  january 2019 man arrested for stealing his own car.  luckily he won a settlement for that.  um and here police broke into an innocent black man's house and arrested him.  it was all caught on camera and these are just a few examples.  i mean within the past year.  these are all 2019 or 2020. this happens all the time and you wonder.  you wonder why the black community doesn't trust the cops.  i mean if this is how they treated you what would you?  what would you think?  how would you feel Crazy.  All I can hope is that more people are seeing this kind of thing, are seeing these news stories and understanding what has been happening forever.  And you are seeing now, I don't have it in front of me, but you are seeing now, since these protests have started, there's been a massive shift over the past few years from public opinion on Black Lives Matter.  So back, I believe, in 2018, Black Lives Matter didn't have a majority of support from Americans.  Now it has a big majority of support from Americans.  So... This kind of thing, when it comes to public opinion, it can turn on a dime.  And you're seeing that now with all of this evidence continue to prop up and people actually paying attention.  I mean, it's been there forever, but I guess now people are actually paying attention.  So hopefully we will see some real changes come out of crap like this.  And... Defunding.  the police needs to be at the top of the list.  And that means taking, I mean, if you look at city budgets, all the money has been going into the police force.  Meanwhile, there's been cuts to education, cuts to healthcare, cuts to infrastructure, cuts to everything else.  Meanwhile, the police get more and more money every year.  And that's why they have all this riot gear.  That's why they have all these toys, armored vehicles.  Are you kidding me?  So defunding has to be done.  And you have to move a lot of these responsibilities into other areas.  So when it comes to mental health calls, the cops shouldn't go to those.  I mean, how many times have we seen mental health, the cops show up and they shoot the guy that has a mental health problem?  It happens all the time.  When it comes to domestic disputes... Cops shouldn't be involved in that either.  When it comes to homelessness, the cops shouldn't be involved.  There are ways to offset these responsibilities to other areas.  So defund the police.  Understand what that means.  Understand how much money has been pumped into police forces, how it hasn't helped anything.  It's only made things worse.  And how really, if you think about it, even if you... What it's really doing in some way is actually helping the cops by taking these responsibilities off of them.  As for so long, they've been this one size fits all approach to dealing with all of these issues.  It just doesn't make any sense.  So hopefully now we will begin to see as we're seeing opinion shift.  Hopefully we will also see a policy shift when it comes to enacting real changes because this just can't keep happening. ",
