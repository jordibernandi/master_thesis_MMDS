            "text": "We got a problem.  Welcome to the video guys.  Former Detective Chief Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Service Kevin Hurley appeared on Sky News earlier today talking about what happened in Brixton last night which I covered in a video earlier.  He is an old school London copper starting out in 1979 so naturally he did not stick to the media narrative and instead pointed out some home truths about London Estates and the relationship between the youth in London and the police force or farce as it should be known under Sadiq Khan and Cressida Dick even pointing out the real goals of the BLM movement which forces Adam Bolton to abruptly cut him off and go to a break in order to protect the narrative.  the media are pushing 24 hours a day.  Now, before we get into the video, I am now on the Parler app, as most of you will know, which is a free speech alternative to Twitter, available on Android, iOS and internet browsers.  So come over there and check me out if you want.  The link is in the video description.  Anyway, enough of all that.  Let's watch Adam Bolton and the media narrative get destroyed by Kevin Hurley here. ",

Well, joining me now is the former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley.  Mr Hurley, thank you for being with us.  Put this event into proportion for us, if you can.  I mean, quite often in hot weather, you do get incidents, certainly, of street parties going on long into the night, don't you? ",

            "text": "Right, let me stop that there.  You can see him already trying to frame the narrative and take it away from what really... happened and part of the reason why things like this will only increase.  As I said in my previous video these things do happen in London and other places from time to time when it comes to street parties and the violence they bring.  But the Met Police, Sadiq Khan and the actual government pander into this Marxist nonsense.  We'll only embolden those who did it anyway to be more brazen about it as we are seeing now.  Adam Bolton though is determined to steer the conversation away from reality by blaming the weather and focusing on them being out late and not the violence these people committed despite the fact it all kicked off when it wasn't even that late.  Police got called, driven off, backup was called, driven off again before more arrived.  The point is it takes time.  We heard about it when it had been going on for a while at least.  Also a street party will often run into the small hours of the night providing it is not pissing down.  It being hot or not makes little difference from street parties I have seen.  It was a nice try though but as we will see in the next few clips the copper is not having any of it so let's check it out. ",

But the reality of it is you will get street parties, particularly in African Caribbean areas, where they will turn up in large numbers.  And because of the relationship between police and black youth, when police ask them on behalf of neighbours to be quiet and stop spoiling their life, What happens is they then turn on the police.  More police are called and eventually the police are driven away.  This is quite a regular event now in many of our housing estates around London.  And of course, the tragedy of this is it's the ordinary men and women, frankly, people like my grandmother, my grandfather, who live on the council estates who have to put up with it. ",

Also mentioning the people who live in these areas having to deal with this shit.  Which as we know Sky News and the media do not care about in the slightest.  They have a narrative to push and a cause to support with all their hearts.  But this is not really what they expected to hear from the former Met Police chief, Kevin Hurley.  And he is not finished there because being a former copper in the days when coppers police the streets and not Twitter, he knows what goes on in these London estates, as do I. So he can pinpoint some of the reasons why we are seeing this nonsense, which will only grow.  So let's move on and see what else he has to say. ",

And I'm talking about intervening and supporting families when the children are three and four years of age to prevent them going down this route of rebelliousness and often abuse.  offending, because you can sanction the police, you can put cameras on them, you can investigate them as much as you like, but in the end, police only react to what goes on in front of their faces.  There's a well-known psychological tool called a Batari box, which says, your behavior influences mine which then influences your behavior which influences mine and so on.  so we've got into this kind of vicious circle of police officers dealing with young black people who always come from a perspective that the police are there to suppress them and the police very quickly start to learn that dealing with young black people is quite frankly aggravation and puts their mortgages and careers at risk.  that's the reason actually why so many black youth are killing each other in London because a lot of police officers have given up on trying to stop them carrying knives and guns to kill each other.

            "text": "Now he talks about the breakdown of the nuclear family and single parent households that disproportionately produce children who are more likely to be in trouble with the law during their youth.  I can say this is true from the things I have seen in my own life.  It's by no means a universal rule of single parent families, but it is a lot when the statistics are looked at which is what he is pointing out here.  I don't know about you guys but I could actually feel Adam Bolton's brain working overtime trying to figure out how to swing what he is saying to make out he did not say that and meant something completely different.  it's actually pathetic.  Kevin Hurley is right when he talks about the Batari box and how confrontational behavior will breed more confrontational behavior that in return puts the police officer's careers at risk, no thanks to weak leadership, right the way up to number 10, I am sorry to say, this has continued for decades, including up to this very day.  This makes the police less likely to do their job as we have been seeing over the years.  He then goes on to point out these factors are part of the reason why young black men and kids are killing each other in droves, which I'm sure you all know has been facilitated by London Mayor Sadiq Khan's insanity that removed stop and search and his constant woke bullshit that has destroyed London and the Met's ability to police it.  Adam Bolton is clearly incensed by it and tries to dismiss it with the now common response these losers love to give saying this is not a good time to speak the truth because of the BLM movement which is funny because we all know it does not care about young black men killing other black men.  them deaths do not push.  the UK is racist narrative.  BLM and the media want to push of course.  But let's move on to our final clip, and probably by far the best, where the truth gets too much for Adam Bolton, and he has to silence the former Met Police chief for stating the cold, hard facts of life.  Well, I don't think... ",

This is an issue relating to people of West African heritage... in terms of the relationships between police and the public.  There is a real lot of misinformation going on about police officers killing black people in custody.  Last year, 16 people died for various reasons in police custody, generally drug overdoses.  Of those 16, only one was black.  Last year, police shot three people dead.  Only one of those were black.  There is a real narrative that's going on here, I think driven by people within the Black Lives Matters movement who want to destabilise and disrupt society. ",

Of them 16, only one was black.  And if I remember the figures, it was like 9 in 10 years or something like that.  Kevin pulls no punches though, stating he thinks people within the BLM movement want to dismantle our society, which is not even up for debate.  It's literally on their fundraisers and they make no effort to hide it.  The only people who make effort to hide this is the snivelling shit weasels like Sly News, the BBC and most media outlets in this country.  I mean you see it for yourself at the end there.  I would bet them cold hard facts of life from Kevin Hurley.  had Sky News editors screaming in Adam Bolton's ear to cut him off and move to a break because they can't have him pointing out the truth on live TV to the mindless sheeple they want to brainwash with their propaganda.  This interview here exposes Adam Bolton for the disingenuous fuck pig we always knew he was.  I really hope the average Joe watching this live on Sky News earlier noticed him cut off a former police chief because he did not like what he was saying.  The truth hurts these left-wing losers as we all know and I would bet Kevin Hurley won't be invited onto Sky News or the BBC in a hurry if he ever is again.  Adam Bolton had nothing for him throughout the interview and even tried to say it's not the right time to point out the truth because of the bullshit they are promoting 24-7.  Well done to Kevin Hurley though for having the big brass balls to come on here and say it like it is.  Now as always I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who supports the channel and my other social media.  links are down in the video description.  If you want to come and support me on Twitter, Bitshoot and a variety of other platforms including my second YouTube channel.  As I said all links are down in the video description.  There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on the oppressors.  Slaves against their owners.  The peasantry against the feudal barons. ",
