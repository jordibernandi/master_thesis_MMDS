            "text": "So as we all know, the alt-right like to use memes to spread their propaganda.  They usually entice teens with edgy jokes, often using really racist or just generally bigoted humour.  And this comes with appropriating symbols that aren't necessarily linked to fascism.  So of course the most famous is the Pepe the Frog meme, which essentially became the icon for the alt-right.  There are some other ones.  They like to use clown images.  They like to use, I guess, knights from the Crusades.  And they might say they just like these things, but we all know it is a way to identify each other.  Now, one that has kind of faded into a bit of obscurity, but I still see him on the profiles of people in the alt-right, is Moonman.  Now you guys might not remember, but Moon Man was extremely popular on YouTube and the general internet in about 2015-2016.  But Moon Man is actually a McDonald's mascot.  Moon Man's original name is Mac Tonight and he starred in McDonald's adverts in the 1980s.  Now in the first commercial he appeared in, Mac Tonight sung a parody of Mac the Knife, obviously a swing song made popular by people like Bobby Darin and Frank Sinatra.  When the clock strikes half past six, babe, time to head for Goldilocks.  It's a good time for a great taste dinner at McDonald's.  It's McDonald's.  Come on, make it McDonald's.  He was actually quite a fairly successful mascot for McDonald's and they'd actually put animatronic versions of him in restaurants and make people dress up in costumes and go to different outlets across the country.  But eventually he fell off and I think his last appearance was in 2007.  Now this is the same year.  he was reborn as a type of meme on message boards and there was one joke video that featured a short loop of his advert where he sings the popular nonsense song Chacaron by reggaetown singer El Chombro.  So what people started to do was use text-to-speech programs to make Moonman sing rap songs that they would create or they would parody.  Now I'm gonna play you one right now of Moonman singing the Knuckles song, so you get an impression of what this sounds like and what it looks like. ",

I'm hard as nails, it ain't hard to tell, I break em down whether they're solid or frail.  Unlike the rest I'm independent, it's my first breath, first test.  feel the right then the worst's left.  Born on an island in the heavens, the blood of my ancestors flows inside me.  My duty is to save the flower from evil deterioration.  I will be the one to set your heart free.  Must cleanse yourself of that evil spirit. ",

            "text": "In about 2015, Moonman was discovered by Nazis and the alt-right on message boards like 4chan and 8chan.  And what they started to do was take the text-to-speech program, I think it was AT&T's version, and they would write Moonman racist raps which would talk about incidents like the George Zimmerman killing, talk about Trayvon Martin, talk about Michael Brown.  It would talk about Ferguson.  It would also talk about things like race war.  It would have numerous slurs against all types of people, Hispanic people, black people, Jewish people.  And this was before the adpocalypse, so these videos were everywhere on YouTube.  I remember seeing them on YouTube.  And now if you try and find them, you can't find any of the alt-right ones.  Even if you go online and try and find them, it's very, very hard to find some of the original videos and songs that were so prominent throughout YouTube when he exploded as a figurehead of the alt-right.  Disturbingly, they also use a text-to-speech program that featured an African-American voice, who in the raps would offer to be saying stuff to Moonman, which he would counter.  So they would say stuff like, Black Lives Matter, and Moonman would say something like, no they don't.  Obviously, in a lot worse terms than how I've just described it.  Now, what also doesn't help Moonman is that his weird moon-shaped head kind of looks like a KKK hood.  Again, makes them quite compatible with Nazi propaganda.  Now, AT&T made it harder to really use their program to make these wraps.  McDonald's has also seriously distanced themselves from the mascot.  But I think it's interesting how the alt-right really, really adopt these figures and then they become symbols of something else.  But it also speaks to a larger problem and it explains how they really get younger kids and teenagers who this edgy style of humor appeals to.  So I showed you that Moonman video of him rapping the Knuckles rap earlier, right?  So back in 2015, if you looked on YouTube for Moonman raps, you would actually find quite a lot of them.  And of course, it started off as a pretty harmless meme back in the day.  But what happens with a lot of things is that if you watch that and find it funny, I guess you keep clicking on YouTube suggestions and eventually you're going to start clicking on the racist raps.  and for a lot of edgy teenagers who exist online these ultra ultra offensive raps might be quite funny in the context of this ridiculous moon man character with a really really crazy monotone voice and him just dancing around the screen.  but again it sort of speaks to the meme pipeline like pepe the frog.  of course everyone knows it wasn't originally an alt-right symbol, but when you start liking memes about him, I guess it makes you more susceptible to liking racist memes, and I guess that can set you down the path to becoming an actual member of the alt-right.  Now something to remember, it of course doesn't mean you're necessarily going to join that, even if you do find the more edgy ones funny, But it goes to many people's theories that the rejuvenation of the white supremacist movement across the world really is thanks to the internet.  It's thanks to things like the gaming community.  It's thanks to, you know, all these young white men congregating online, talking to each other and sharing these jokes.  But symbols like Moon Man, symbols like Pepe the Frog, symbols like the clown and symbols like the Crusader Knight, while now we might know the connotations of these mascots, What it does is give them plausible deniability.  If you call them out for being a white supremacist, it's, no, I just like these things, they're funny.  How could you say that Moon Man or Mac Tonight, who was a McDonald's mascot, has anything to do with neo-Nazis or white supremacists?  And it helps them normalise themselves into the general discussion online and they can really start embedding themselves in different communities before people find out what their views are.  And of course, we understand that the normalization of white supremacy by adopting, I guess, cultural norms and cultural symbols goes back to people like David Duke.  Now, of course, David Duke is a very, very out and out white supremacist.  But what he did that was so different is that he put a polite face on it.  He spoke well.  He dressed well.  He put outward white supremacy in a normalized societal package.  And many of the arguments he popularized remain very, very prominent today in neo-Nazi circles.  Mainly that they aren't a bunch of violent fascists, they just want to protect their culture and live peacefully.  And while they might not necessarily agree that different races can live together, they say they don't believe in and everyone should live in their own homeland peacefully because clearly they can't exist together.  So this is why symbols like Mac Tonight aka Moonman can be so dangerous just because they help normalize Nazis into the conversation and it's a double-edged sword because of course it's also used to indoctrinate young kids and attract young kids into this edgy humor and once they become snagged by someone in the alt-right they can go down the path to becoming an actual neo-Nazi.
