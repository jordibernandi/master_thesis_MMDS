            "text": "As I've mentioned before on this channel, I live in Germany, but I'm originally from the United States.  A few days ago, Disney Plus was finally released here, meaning that the streaming catalog of German subtitles and dubs was finally complete.  Something I appreciate about speaking a language that's not my native tongue is that I'm able to rediscover a lot of media I enjoy in different ways.  Though many people have learned English by watching the American versions of Disney films, the company Disney also has a strong library of dubbed films in over 45 different languages, thanks to its Disney Character Voices International division.  Recently I put on the German version of The Little Mermaid, because I really loved the 1990 dub that Klaus Peterbauer and Andreas Rommelsheim put together with the Berliner Synchron GmbH.  When I was first learning to speak German, the dub's version of Part of Your World was my first entry point to the art of translation and helped me appreciate text setting in German.  The performance by Ute Lempa is also wonderful and for me is definitely up there with the original Jodie Benson rendition.  However, I quickly realized that the dub on Disney Plus was not the version I was familiar with.  By the time I reached what I knew as Ein Mensch zu sein, I was shocked to hear that the song was actually called In deiner Welt.  You see, in 1998, a new synchronization of Achille die Meerjungfrau was released.  It's unclear as to why exactly this was necessary, but based on the fact that the second version is much closer to the original English text than the 1991, it's possible that it was made to be a more faithful interpretation.  There's also always the possibility that there were licensing issues that made it more reasonable for Disney to create an entirely new dub.  Put simply, the 1998 dub is very controversial among German Disney fans, with many preferring the 1991 and even urging the company to stop prioritizing the newer one in circulation.  But why do so many fans prefer the 1991?  And what does it even mean to make a faithful translation of a Disney movie?  That's what we'll be talking about today. ",

            "text": "As you can imagine, the need to translate films into other languages results from the desire of production companies to have their films reach as many markets as possible.  However, translating films is often easier said than done.  Not only do you have to maintain the integrity of the original script, but you also have to make sure that the new dialogue matches the mouth motions of the original.  This is also referred to as matching the labials, in other words, the consonants that cause the mouth to open and close.  The process of translating a film typically begins with studios hiring local translators to create a literal translation of the original script.  Because different languages have different idioms and grammar, among many other things, sometimes the translation isn't a literal one-to-one representation of the original words.  The translators will also adjust their script to fit the labials of the already recorded film.  Translating lyrics for music, though, is often more complicated than simply matching the labials in a dialogue.  Language has a huge influence on how music is made, and can affect rhythm and melody in more ways than you might think.  If you're interested in a more in-depth breakdown of exactly why that is, I'm including a link in the description to the Sideways video, How Disney Uses Language.  I'll also be linking to other resources if you're interested in reading more about how studios translate films for international releases.  Without being on the inside of Disney, it's virtually impossible to know exactly what their process was when preparing The Little Mermaid for its German release.  However, I think there's a lot to be learned from comparing the two different translations and seeing how they both approach adapting the English version for the German language.  To break down this process for you, let's take a look at both translations of Part of Your World.  I'm choosing this song because it's something I've already analyzed on this channel and therefore easier to contextualize, but I definitely recommend those not already familiar with the song to either listen to it or watch my video on Howard Ashman before continuing.  Before I go into the lyrics, I also want to clarify that I'm not a linguist.  I'm just a musician with an interest in Disney songs.  I'm also not a native German speaker, so my analysis is only indicative of my perspective in rediscovering this song in a new, to me, language.  I also wanted to quickly shout out my friend Vincent Long who is a native German speaker and offered a lot of insight to this video on top of proofreading my translations.  He's a great songwriter and you should check out his music.  Because the 1998 version is more similar to the English version, let's begin there.  To show you all of my process in analyzing these songs, I'm including the German version on the left, my translation of the German version in the middle, and the original English version on the right.

References to Ariel's collection, and specifically focusing on the amount of things she has in abundance, is as close to a literal translation as you could get without sacrificing poetic integrity.  There is a slight liberty taken in changing the line, how many wonders can one cavern hold, for nichts \u00fcbersteigt mein geheimes Revier.  But the concept is the same.  Ariel has access to a place, and there's no debate that it's not unique when compared to other caverns.  Something I like about this version as well is that it retains some of the silliness and whimsical nature of the original lyrics.  Instead of gizmos, gadgets, and thingamabobs, the lyrics swap those colloquial nonsensical terms out for words that function similarly in German, like schnickschnack, krimskrams, krempel, and dingsbumse.

            "text": "This translation of the song also retains the point where Ariel wonders what actions others take regarding their daughters.  The linguistics of German changes this line slightly, but the intent is clear.  Ariel assumes that there must be other women like her who want something more than what they already have.  However, the most important part of these translations in my eyes is the last few lines.  The ending and general framing of the song is similar to the English version.  In their world is a remarkably similar sentiment to part of that world, both involving Ariel wanting to exist in a world different than her own.  As you can see, this 1998 translation is pretty similar to the original English version as far as representing metaphors is concerned.  The lyrics have been adapted for German, but there's little poetic difference between the stories.  This approach is much different than the original 1990 version of the song, Ein Mensch zu sein, the title of which specifically means to be a human, a sentiment that's a bit different than just being in the world of humans.  Ultimately, Ariel does want to be a human, but highlighting what it means to be a human is a slightly more poetic take on the narrative instead of just wanting to be with Prince Eric. ",

The opening lines communicate something much different than the other German translation, but they represent something that I think involves more passion.  For example, allusions to Ariel having achieved all that she can achieve in her current environment highlights her need for something else.  Her need to experience something more is also directly linked to her emotion.  For example, she's able to find all of these wonderful things, but has yet to find happiness. ",

The verse about Ariel wanting to be where the people are is remarkably similar to the English version and is more accurate than the 1998 one.  I think this version of the song communicates the emotions of the original better.  For Ariel, it's not just about being next to humans, but becoming one herself.  Once she does this, then she'll be able to live a truly free life.  There's also the line about fire and asking how it burns.  Though it's true that the 1998 version accurately translates this by asking Was ist Feuer und wie ger\u00e4t etwas im Brand?  The passion behind Was ist Feuer und wie ist es hei\u00df?  feels for me closer to the original and is less wordy than the other translations. ",

The last lines of heute und hier w\u00fcnsche ich mir ein Mensch zu sein feel incredibly painful and poetic.  They are demanding, direct, and so desperate to the point where I can think anyone listening can truly feel Ariel's isolation even if they haven't experienced it firsthand.  So I definitely have a bias as to which version I prefer.  However, it seems that almost everyone who has a personal connection to Disney films has a specific version that they prefer to the rest.  I believe this is what happens when you have a company like Disney whose main marketing tool is nostalgia, making it difficult for people to separate their enjoyment of certain art from their memories of growing up with it.  My aforementioned friend Vincent shared his opinion on the translations with me, saying that he grew up with the English version of the film and never saw either of the German ones before I asked about them.  He agreed with me that the 1990 version is definitely more eloquent and artistic when compared to the other one that just translates the English version directly.  However, it's also worth mentioning that Vincent said that many of the German translations of American films can be read as awkward and unnecessary and also just lazy if not done correctly.  Like I mentioned at the beginning of the video, many people learn to speak English by growing up with the original versions of Disney films.  However, that's only a portion of the scope of Disney films and how they affect individuals.  I think a special thing about translations is that they allow someone to not simply translate text, but reinterpret certain artistic sentiments for other cultures.  This is why I believe it's important to acknowledge and remember Klaus-Peter Bauer, Andreas Homolsheim, Frank Lenart, and Quirin Amper.  Even if you don't understand German, I recommend you check out the other work these people did.  Just pop it into DeepL or Google Translate, whichever you prefer, and maybe you'll find new perspectives to appreciate certain songs with.  But don't let German be the only language you look at in a different way.  There are some interesting Disney adaptions in Swedish, Italian, and Spanish, among many other languages.  I only made this video because of my specific circumstance as an American who now lives in Germany and has learned to see linguistic beauty in different ways than I had growing up.  My go-to is typically just to turn on the subtitles if I don't understand the native language of a certain film, but I have learned a lot from experiencing these classic Disney films from a different perspective.  Though I grew up thinking of translation as a purely utilitarian practice, I now understand it to be its own form of poetry. ",
