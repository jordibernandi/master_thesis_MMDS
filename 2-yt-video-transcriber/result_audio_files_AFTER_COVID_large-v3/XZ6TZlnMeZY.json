            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat and welcome to a special outreach update from Bnei Brak Israel.  Bnei Brak Israel is one of the most dangerous places in Israel to preach the Gospel.  It is a city of Orthodox Jews and Orthodox Rabbis isolated from the outside.  They have their own newspapers.  They don't have television.  They have their own radio.  It is a city where the name of Yeshua, Jesus, is not only forbidden, but it is a stoning offense.  It is said to be even more dangerous than Ma'a Sha'arim, the Hundred Gates Orthodox City in Jerusalem.  Praise Yeshua, our ministry goes in there to preach the Gospel when the Holy Spirit tells us to go.  Because if you go in there without the protection of the Holy Spirit, you could be killed.  For this reason, no tour bus has ever entered that city because if they even see the word of yeshua they will throw rocks at that bus and that bus will never leave the city.  nothing has changed in 2000 years.  john chapter 10 verse 30-33. i and the father are one.  the jews picked up stones again to stone him.  Yeshua, Jesus, answered them, I showed you many good works from the Father.  For which of them are you stoning me?  The Jews answered him, For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you being a man make yourself out to be God.  That same spirit today is operating here in Israel, especially in the city of Mnebrek.  So the question is, is it really dangerous to preach the gospel of Mnebrek?  The answer is yes, but it's more dangerous not to preach the gospel because they need salvation.  They need to hear that Jesus, Yeshua is God, that he died on the tree on the cross for our sins.  He rose on the third day and by his blood, all who repent and believe have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  And not to preach that message is dangerous.  During the COVID-19, we continued to preach the gospel.  As of the making of this video, Israel has now been open over 90%.  And we've been launching outreaches all through the land of Israel, south to north.  This week, we went into the city of Nebach.  We give all the glory to Jesus Yeshua.  We're small people with a big God.  As the Jews were preparing for Shavuot, Pentecost, we began to preach the gospel.  As believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, we know that Pentecost, Shavuot, is when the fire of the Holy Spirit came down and enabled the believers to go out and preach the gospel.  It was given to the body of Yeshua.  We pray that the Jewish people and all nations will receive the power of the Holy Spirit and call on the name of Yeshua, Jesus, as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  As the team were praying, I began walking around the city of Bnei Brak and asking people, when was the first Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks, in the Bible?  I noticed one of the main rabbis of Bnei Brak, Harav Moshe Weinberg, Rabbi Moshe Weinberg.  I approached the rabbi.  I said, Shalom, are you Rabbi Weinberg?  He said, Yes.  I introduced myself and asked him a question.  When was the first Shavuot in the Bible?  And what happened at that first Shavuot?  Shavuot in Hebrew is the Feast of Weeks, known as Pentecost.  Rabbi Weinberg was very happy that I asked him the question.  And he said, when Moshe Rabbeinu came down from Mount Sinai, Moses, and gave us the Torah, the word, that is when we believe it was the first Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks.  I then asked the rabbi, what else happened?  He said, what do you mean?  I opened the Bible and read together with the rabbi.  Exodus chapter 34, verse 29.  And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant for speaking with the Lord.  I told Rabbi Weinberg, as you can see on the first Shavuot, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, When he was to give Israel the word of God, his face was radiant, glowing.  I asked Rabbi Moshe Weinberg, do you know why it was radiant and glowing?  He said because he saw God.  I said, but what does seeing God have to do with being radiant?  The rabbi did not have an answer.  I turned to the rabbi and said, the reason Moses' face was radiant, was glowing, was because the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit, was upon him.  And we know that Israel was disobedient to God's word, and 3,000 men died that day.  But the question is, how can we get that radiant that Moses had?  How can our face glow like Moshe with the power of the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit, the fire of the Holy Spirit, which is the true Shavuot, the true Feast of Weeks?  The rabbi did not want to answer.  but tried to switch the conversation.  He said, we celebrate this feast by bringing cheese and making cheesecakes and having a cheese festival.  I asked the rabbi, can you show me where that is in the Bible?  He said, it's not in the Bible.  It's in the oral Torah.  It's only written in rabbinic books.  I told the rabbi, certainly God has much more than just making cheesecakes and eating a lot of cheese in this feast.  God wants us to be radiant with his glory.  Let's focus on what the word of God says and not man-centered tradition.  If you want to eat cheese in the feast of weeks, that's fine.  There is nothing wrong with eating cheese, but we need to focus on the Word of God.  God wants us to walk in His light.  Isaiah 2, verse 5, Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord.  God wants us to be radiant, to shine with His glory, but it can only be done with the true Shavuot, the true Feast of Weeks, the giving and the power of the Huach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.  Rabbi Weinberg turned at me and said, I'm a rabbi.  I have God with me.  But do you have that Shekinah glory?  Do you have that fire of the Holy Spirit?  Are you radiant?  And do you want to be radiant forever, not just in the Feast of Weeks?  At that moment, praise Yeshua, something supernatural happened.  The rabbi did not answer.  It was time for the full gospel.  I told the rabbi, only God is righteous, and the only way we can obtain that glory is through him.  I turn the Bible to Jeremiah, chapter 23, verse 6.  In his days, referring to the Messiah, Mashiach, Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell safely.  Now this is the name by which he will be called, the Lord, our righteousness.  This is a compound prophecy because the Messiah has already come and the Messiah will come again.  It's a compound prophecy.  The rabbi was trembling.  I began reading Bible verses to him, Psalms 2, Psalms 22, Micah 5.2, and many Bible passages.  He finally spoke.  He wanted to intimidate me and asked me, who is this Messiah that already came?  He knew the answer, but he wanted to see if I would be afraid to answer him.  I turned to the rabbi with love and compassion and told him, surely you know.  I opened the Bible to Proverbs chapter 30 verse 4 and read in Hebrew.  Who has gone up to heaven and come down?  Whose hands have gathered up the wind?  Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak?  Who has established all the ends of the earth?  What is his name?  And what is the name of his son?  Surely you know.  Surely you know, Rabbi Weinberg, his name is Yeshua, Jesus, who died on the tree on the cross for your sins, rose on the third day, and by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life, and that power of the Holy Spirit falls upon you, and you glow and become radiant like Moshe and Moses did.  And that is the true meaning of the Feast of Weeks, the Feast of Shavuot.  The rabbi was in complete shock.  He took the Bible and he started to read the Bible verses.  He was in complete shock.  The power of the Holy Spirit was working on him.  Praise Yeshua.  He then saw other Orthodox Jews walking by and he was scared.  So he turned his back around and read with me quietly.  I told the rabbi when he turned around, Do not be afraid.  Psalms 119 verse 45.  I will walk in freedom, for I have devoted myself to your commandments, to your word.  If you follow the word of God, then the word of God will do one thing, and that is set you free.  I will walk in freedom, for I have devoted myself to your commandments.  God has always called Israel to be a priesthood.  And all, through Messiah Yeshua Jesus, who enter into that priesthood, will have the radiance on their face, will glow with the power of the Holy Spirit.  In Hebrew, Esh Shel Ruach HaKodesh.  Praise Yeshua, this was supernatural.  The fact that the rabbi continued to stand with me and did not move.  Although he wanted to, but he couldn't.  The Holy Spirit was gluing him to the ground.  I asked the rabbi a question.  Do you read the priestly blessing every Friday?  The rabbi said, yes, I bless my whole family with it.  I told the rabbi, that's very good that you read Numbers chapter 6 verse 24 to 26.  But the only way, that blessing, now and forever, is through Messiah Yeshua.  There is no other way.  As it says in Hebrew, in verse 25.  The Lord make his face shine on you.  That shine is the same shine that Moses had when he came down from Mount Sinai and the glory of God was upon him and he was radiant.  This is the priestly blessing received only from the high priest, Jesus Yeshua, HaMashiach, the Messiah.  The Lord make his face shine on you.  This Shavuot is your deliverance.  This Shavuot is your salvation.  This Shavuot, the power of the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit, will fall upon you.  The Rabbi's legs were shaking.  I've never seen anything like it.  At that moment, the Rabbi said, I need to leave.  I gave the Rabbi A note with my contact information.  We pray for his salvation.  We pray that God will visit him in dreams, in visions.  And not only will this main rabbi come to faith in Messiah Yeshua, but his whole synagogue.  A Shavuot Pentecost harvest.  One thing is certain.  Rabbi Weinberg and all who heard the gospel will never be the same again.  And for this, we give all the glory to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Jesus Yeshua.  We will continue to preach the gospel in Bnei Brak.  In Israel and around the world.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11.26.  And for Zion's sake we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 verse 1.  For Zion's sake I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  her yeshua like a blazing torch.  and he's coming back as the lion of the tribe of judah with fire in his eyes to take back everything that the enemy has stolen.  and until that time we will continue to preach the gospel.  let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
