So if you want to get the latest from Harvest, hit the subscribe button.  So you have two choices at a moment like this in human history.  You can look up or you can freak out.  You can look up or you can freak out.  Jesus speaking on how people will react in the end times says this in Luke 21, people will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world.  Is that not an accurate description of the way that many people are feeling right now?  They are apprehensive.  Some are fainting from from terror, drinking, partying, drugging, anything to distract them from the reality they're facing.  Sales of anxiety medications are way up.  So you can freak out or you can look up.  Jesus says when you see these things begin to happen, look up, look up, for your redemption is drawing near.  Now some wonder if this COVID-19 vaccination program that is coming could possibly be the mark of the beast?  Short answer, no, I don't think so.  But it is interesting.  But we should not be looking for anti-Christ, folks.  We should be looking for Jesus Christ.  That's where our focus should be right now. ",
