            "text": "Hello, I'm Alistair Begg, inviting you to join me from your home this December for a wonderful evening of music as we celebrate the birth of Jesus.  Consider the meaning at the very heart of Christmas.  You know, if you've ever wondered who Jesus is and why he's come, why it even matters all these years later, then this will be a program you won't want to miss.  So I'm inviting you to invite your friends and family to join me on Friday, December 18th, 8 p.m.  Eastern Standard Time.  I'll be here along with my friends, Brenton Brown, Michael O'Brien, Fernando Ortega, Laura Story, our own Parkside musicians, and a special appearance by members of the Kodai Children's Chorus.  Find out all about it at truthforlife.org forward slash concert. ",
