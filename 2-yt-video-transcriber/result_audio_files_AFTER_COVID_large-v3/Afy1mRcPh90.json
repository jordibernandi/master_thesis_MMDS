            "text": "All this was an excuse to tell you a wonderful old Jewish joke, which, I'm so sorry, I will disappoint you, it's not a dirty joke.  I like to do things which today in the United States require, as they say, trigger warning, you know, now in American academia, and once I even proposed that a student should enter The room prior to my class with a great poster, trigger warning, trigger warning.  So the joke is a well-known one quoted already by Derrida, by others.  I'm sure you probably know it.  On Saturday in a synagogue, Jews are... saying things to each other, not confession in Christian sense, they don't confess, but okay.  So the rabbi powerful figure says, oh my God, I am nothing.  I'm not worthy of your attention, I am nothing.  Then a rich Jewish merchant stands up and says, oh my God, I'm also nothing.  I'm not worthy of your attention and so on.  Then a poor ordinary Jew stands up and says, God, I'm also nothing.  And then the rich merchant kicks the powerful rabbi and says, but who is this guy?  There's nobody he can say, who does he think that?  he can just say that he's also nothing and so on.  It's a very interesting joke because... What you find in this joke is the idea, precisely, that's the point of this joke, that to say you are nothing is not as innocent.  It may appear as an utter self-humiliation.  But this very gesture of claiming, of denying all your particular features, of abandoning your identity, brings... Object A brings a surplus enjoyment.  Now I will give you precisely a very problematic example.  It's more adapted to United States situation, but I think it's a nice way.  Involved in many polemics and debates in the United States, I encountered this problem.  I noticed how, first, it's a very simple observation.  Some people even claim it's not true, but more and more I commit.  it's true.  How the more you are perceived as marginal, powerless, the more you are, it's not only tolerated, but you are even required to assert your particular identity.  Like, to be vulgar, if so-called Native Americans, I say so-called because I have many friends among them and they hate this term.  You know what?  I'm sorry if I repeat an old joke.  You know what one of them told me?  He told me, I much prefer to be called Indian than Native American.  Because Native American means what?  We are native, natural, and you white people are cultural, or what?  He told me, if you call us Indians, at least At least the name Indian is a reminder of your white man's stupidity.  You thought that you were in India, you know.  No, they have an incredible sense of how false this... patronizing respect towards them is, you know, like, we white people exploit nature, but when Native Americans dig a mountain, they first ask the spirit of the mountain for permission and so on, all that stuff.  They hate this.  One of them wrote a wonderful book, short essay, not book, sorry, trying to prove that Native Americans killed more buffaloes and burned more forests than all white men combined.  No, I mean, probably not true, but his point was, we are tired of this false... So, what I want to say here, that in this line, okay, Native Americans, if you return to your tribal traditions, oh, wonderful, wonderful, they are restoring their culture and so on.  Shh, shh, shh.  Then, blacks, okay.  Still absolutely okay.  Especially if I always thought it was the worst ideology.  If you like that roots idea, you know, you go to Africa, ooh, I discovered a tribe from where my grand-grand-grandparents were.  Incidentally, that's why I like Malcolm X. He was absolutely opposed to it.  He said, Malcolm X, X means we don't have roots, we cannot return to roots, they are destroyed, and this gives us a unique chance of new freedom.  But what I want to say is that, and then it goes on.  Japanese, Orienters, yes, still.  You begin to smell bad, but still.  Italians, suspicious.  Germans, aye, aye, aye.  And then at the end, white Protestants.  If you say we want to assert our identity, you are practically immediately denounced as white supremacist, fascist, and so on.  I am well known of discrete power relations, why it's not innocent to assert your identity.  That's not my point.  My point is the hidden bias of those who pretend to say, you know, this eternal self-whipping, like, you say, we, our identity embodies oppression of others and we don't have the right to assert our identity.  But you know what I notice systematically again and again?  How?  Okay, they absolutely prohibit to their own group, white, anti-racist, multiculturalists, to assert their identity.  No, and then, you know, the more you are away, marginalized, the more you can.  But it's so evident from all the debates where I participated of how this apparent self-humiliation, we are guilty of blah, blah, blah, gives them an extraordinary position of authority, precisely as negating their particular identity, they stand for universality.  They always... I was so often... For example, after that thing happened, you know, Indians didn't want to be called Indians, but Native Americans, there was immediately a good white guy who told them, you shouldn't call them this, this is, you are falling into the trap of white ideology, whatever, whatever, whatever.  It's incredible to what extent, and this is the surplus enjoyment.  I apparently humiliate myself.  Who am I?  Nobody.  But you know very well that this nobody gives me a certain ideological preference and so on.  And what I am afraid, we will not have time to go into this today.  What I am so afraid is that in parts of Me Too and so on, you have a similar logic of using victimhood, proclaiming yourself powerless, gives you an immense power.  I mean, I often am, maybe because I talk in decent ways often, I am often a victim of this.  Like, people attack me, they stop, even interrupt my lectures and so on, and claim that They talk from the position of victim.  I'm making fun of victims.  But it's so clear that in the concrete academic constellation when they say this, they act as the pure figures of brutal power.  I'm not even allowed to defend myself and so on. ",
