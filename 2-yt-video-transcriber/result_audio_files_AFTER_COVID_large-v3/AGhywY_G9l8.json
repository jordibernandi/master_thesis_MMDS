            "text": "All right, does anybody else have a cat in there?  All right, to celebrate the end of 2020, we decided to have our staff read comments that ASLU has received this year from both our supporters and our critics.  They are reading and hearing, oh, sorry, I don't think, am I saying that?  They are reading and hearing them for the first time.  The ACLU is such a left-wing, irresponsible, exaggerating, anti-Christian group of buffoons.  Damn.  You Twinkle Puffs don't know the first thing about the Constitution.  I appreciate the Twinkle Puffs comment.  I can relate.  The ACLU are my heroes.  Number agreement aside, I totally agree.  Oh my, this one's long.  Ooh.  The Lord of... the lord.  rebuke the satan lord god almighty jesus christ in your name and blood.  bind satan's aclu his illuminati the new world order and all his forces and cut them down at the root and let your people prevail here and around the world.  i like to be considered illuminati.  people think beyonce is so i like the possessive there satan's aclu.  These are like legit ones that we just get.  Speaking of the history of the American Civil Liberties Union seems to take on only cases that are anti-Christian family, but pro-sodomy, abortion, pornography, prostitution, euthanasia, sexual perversion, infanticide, crime, humanism, atheism, built on a foundation of Sounds right.  Sounds about right.  Well, I partially agree.  I would rephrase some of these.  But yes, we do like to defend people's civil rights.  So, good and bad.  I don't think people really know what communism means because it's being used very loosely in our political discourse.  Thank you for protecting my right... my right... to eat ass.  You're the best.  I'm glad I asked my mom to leave the room before recording this.  And you are very welcome.  You're welcome.  We do what we can.  We do what we can.  And that is your right.  Eat away.  A bunch of whiny bottom of their class.  Ouch.  Liberal lawyers that couldn't get jobs out of law school.  Well, they all have jobs out of law school.  That's why they're at the ACLU.  Thank God for the ACLU.  We'd be a much worse nation without them and people like them.  I like that, yeah.  I just know I'm meant to marry an ACLU lawyer.  I'm single, I will say.  Hit me up on Hinge.  Yeah, you are.  I'm going to have my mom come back in the room for this one.  She'll be thrilled.  I think... I think everyone in my project's married, so I don't know if you are that too.  ACLU, pay attention.  You are anti-Christian, anti-America, and a bunch of baby-killing crazy people.  Lots of American think the same about you.  Go have sex with yourselves.  All right.  Joining the ACLU makes your teeth whiter, your waistline smaller, and members of the gender you desire irresistibly attracted to you.  Try it today.  I feel like that's a staff member that wrote that one.  Like, kind of feels like that.  But I agree.  All parts.  Life gets better.  ACLU, never give up.  This organization is so incredibly valuable to our democracy.  Especially throughout these last four years.  You are heroes for us.  Thank you.  That's why I work here.  I like the nice ones.  Also outside of the last four years too, but yeah.  Go get them, ACLU.  We're going.  Go get them, ACLU.  Oh, I knew that was going to happen.  Mentioned the ACLU to my grandparents.  And they reacted like I had just summoned the devil through a satanic prayer.  Oh no.  Okay.  Wow.  I didn't really know.  Yeah, that impact across generations.  Sorry, grandparents.  But keep talking to them about it.  Yeah, this one we get a lot.  American Communist League United, parentheses ACLU, hates America and will align itself with any liberal group that vows to destroy America.  Again, I don't know if the definition of communism has changed.  And sometimes American communists... liberal union, you know, the communists is often a C. Fake, period.  Like, like I'm fake?  You know, I think all of us are a little bit fake.  Just fake?  I mean, they were trying to be punchy, but I don't think it landed. ",
