            "text": "You see a lot when you're the first born.  I saw my mother and how she worked hard and she was full of pride and would never want anyone to ever pity her.  She never complained about anything.  But I also knew how she suffered.  I knew how she stayed up late at night trying to figure things out.  She was a brown woman with an accent.  I remember going into a store and us being followed.  I remember how people would look at my mother and make certain assumptions about her intelligence or her capacity or her right to belong.  As the eldest child, you see this.  My mother was very well aware that she was raising two black girls to be two black women.  And she did that instilling in us pride in our culture and cultures, always knowing that we would face all kinds of obstacles, but she never let us believe that anything could get in the way of our dreams or pursuits.  My sister Maya is two and a half years younger than me.  So at the age of two and a half, I was told, look after your sister.  And it is something that is very much a part of just who I am, which is that look after those who need your support or need your help.  And that has been what has motivated me to do the work I've done, to look after and protect people. ",
