            "text": "I was telling Warren Lance that I like a good ramble and he basically complimented me saying that my rambles are the best and I don't know about that.  but I haven't rambled in a long time.  so I have to say forgive me subscribers for I have not rambled in such a long time and I don't think this is going to turn into a rant because I really don't want to turn into a rant.  but Recently, and it's over the past few days, on Facebook, under Dr.  T. Hassan Johnson's Facebook, he actually posted a link going back to Kevin's video talking about what should a woman do for a high-value man, specifically black women.  I do believe that was the video.  And in that video, Kevin actually mentioned about the non-black women that would take Dr.  Johnson's class because Dr.  Johnson is a black masculinist and he actually... teaches a black masculinity class.  you know ever since it started he's had black women.  black women want to come take it because it's an easy class right because it's a relatively non-technical class.  so they can get good grades out of it even though they choose not to.  but the non-black women actually take the class not because it's an easy grade or they want a non-technical grade, because Dr.  Johnson does teach thorough material, but they come in because they have black boyfriends, you know, because Fresno State is very famous for athletics and a lot of the Guys that go to Fresno State are athletes.  And of course athletes have women of various ethnicities that date them.  And even the black men that go there, even though it's a majority Latino area, that are black, they have white and Latino girlfriends.  And what Dr.  Johnson was saying is that the students that are most invested in that class happen to be white women and Latino women because they want to understand the men that they date, the men that they are actually involved with.  And what Kevin was saying is that that showed a deeper interest in the men that they date, that these women were invested in the men that they date so that they would actually take extra steps to actually understand them, even though these men did not come from their culture.  and that showed a level of competition that these women are willing to go take that extra mile and actually compete for their men.  and the funny thing is is that some black women came into the post and took exception to it and now there's a very long thread going back and forth about white women especially fetishizing black men and black men allowing it and what kevin's video actually highlighted was the deficiency in the level of engagement that black women have with their men or the level of an investment that black women are willing to put into their men unlike other ethnicities.  and we can go through a whole lot of a cultural background going all the way back to antebellum slavery but needless to say that has always been true.  Now, most women are entitled and they have a long list about what they require from their men.  White, black, all women have it.  Black women have it too.  The difference is the level of investment that these women are willing to give back to their men.  And black women's investment are willing to give back is perhaps the lowest.  Now, there's one thing black women will do that a lot of other ethnicities won't do is that black women will put up with a lot of foolishness, which is probably why they love knuckleheads.  Because the one thing that black women do have in spades, or supposedly have in spades, is tolerance for some foolishness.  I guess that's their one superpower, so if you have a superpower, you will tend to use it.  Okay.  So, you know, if you, if you're a hammer, you want to find a nail, you don't want to find a screw, but the thread was going back and forth about why should black men allow Becky or Maria, whoever to fetishize them, because evidently they want one thing, even though that one thing was never specified.  And only thing that i could think of was looks and sex because black men aren't the most you know successful of the groups of men as far as financial success.  and clearly black men do have cultural deficiencies as all black people do because of the environment we're raised here in america.  so black women say that the only reason that black men could be wanted in the United States is for looks and sex, that they're actually a sexual fetish.  And some of that is true.  because guess who says the exact same thing that black women say?  White men say the same thing.  In fact, that was the big thing going on about BLM.  In fact, on both sides, because the vast majority of people out there protesting, carrying BLM signs are white women.  And a lot of your white men are saying that the white women out there looking for eggplants, which is the same thing that the black women are saying, that the only thing that black men are good for is sex and whatever resources they can actually use.  supply.  But guess who says the same thing?  Black women.  Really, the sexual prowess of black men is what black women actually bank on and actually brag about.  The most thing that the black women will actually brag about about a man that they have is how he looks and how good he can actually blow backs out.  So, in essence, they're accusing Becky and Maria of doing the same thing that they did.  But this conversation kept going round and round and round and round and round and round.  And what they expected from black men is to reject all suitors, all offers, anything that's not black and sometimes anything that is not below the paperback threshold.  That black men should reject it and pick only a certain brand of woman.  And if you don't, then there's something wrong with you.  You hate.  you hate your women.  You hate yourself.  You hate your mother.  You hate your race.  Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, on and on and on.  I don't have to go down the ad hominem list for you to get the point.  And I got to thinking that for black men in America, the game is always rigged.  It's not just rigged in the United States with getting jobs and dealing with the police and dealing with society and all the other hurdles that black men have to jump on a daily basis.  The game is also rigged with your woman because God knows black men have complained about a black woman's bad behavior, which is legendary, not just with black men, but also with all other men.  Their bad behavior is legendary.  So much to the point that you can actually have statistics that point to black women's bad behavior.  They have running statistics about their bad choices and their bad behavior, and it shows up.  They have bad behavior that shows up in stats, in cultural outcomes and family outcomes.  They actually don't look at it as a point of shame.  They look at it as a badge of courage.  They look at it as an asset instead of a deficit.  They look at it as a virtue instead of a problem.  And if black men don't like it or don't change for them or don't adapt to it or don't choose it, then there's something wrong with them.  If you think about it, it's like being a casino.  Now, in Las Vegas, even though the gambling percentage is in the house favor, okay, everybody knows that.  Whether it's slots, whether it's cards, whether it's sports gambling, there's always going to be a slight edge to the house.  So it can stay in business, so it can make money.  Otherwise, why would you be there?  It's rigged, but it's actually rigged slightly.  you don't want to rig it to where the people won't play and go someplace else.  you rig it to the point where that even the gambler has a fighting chance to actually make some money.  a lot of them won't but enough of them will to actually entice them to actually sit down and put their money down right.  okay in the black community for black men the game is so rigged that they expect you to get nothing.  They expect you to take abuse.  They expect you to, to be talked down to.  They expect you to take disrespect.  They expect you to put up with uncooperative attitudes.  They expect you to take shaming and ridicule all while you work in yourself to death and making her hopes and dreams come true and making her feel comfortable and happy.  In other words, you are there to serve.  That's why single mothers expect to get wifed up even though they've had two or three babies by two or three guys.  They expect to.  In other cultures, that's a high, high negative.  In black culture, that is a positive.  They have an expectation for black men to fill in the gaps.  Why?  Because they always have.  And just like Las Vegas, even though the game is rigged, it's rigged across the board.  And basically at the end of the day, it's the only game in town.  Either you want to play or you don't.  In the black community for black men dating black women, the game is so rigged that not only are they the, or used to be the only game in town, but they coerce you.  to actually play the game at their rules with a rigged game and tell you that it's rigged and you're supposed to be happy about it.  You're expected to play and treat them like they're the only game in town.  And that's what the whole point of the thread was.  And that wasn't the first one.  Because not only are you expected to play a rigged game, not only are you expected to bow down to the only game in town, not only are you expected to serve, you don't have a right to complain about it.  Because if you complain about the rigged game and the unfairness and the mistreatment that you have to put up with, then not only do you hate black women because it's the first card they pull out, And as a sister said on a panel I was on, you also hate yourself.  And in fact, I'm not going to call her name.  In fact, I had to correct the young lady because she was saying the way black men on YouTube.  And sometimes on Facebook, talk about black women.  That is a sign of self-hatred.  And I had to inform the young lady that she needs to stop using it as a crutch.  And why do I say that?  A lot of black women use that talking point about self-hatred or actually self-hatred.  projecting self-hatred onto black men as a way to deflect from black women's bad behavior and the behavior that black men find not appealing.  And so much so that even thinking about or even entertaining another casino, another house, another game that does give you better odds, does give you a chance to win, does make the game fairer.  Because dealing with women is not a fair game, especially in the United States.  Black women expect you not to take it, not to entertain a better deal.  Not to entertain better treatment.  Not to entertain being fetishized.  Because black men seem being fetishized, at least they pretend like they want me.  At the very least, I get the pretense that I'm desired, that I'm wanted.  The whole mating strategy of black women is to pretend like they don't want you.  That they don't like you.  that they don't want to be around you.  And for them to even to be nice to you is an affront to their dignity and a violation of black womanhood.  Her mere cooperation, even though it would enhance the family, even though it will make a better lifestyle, even though it will make you happy and you easier to get along with, they figure it's an affront to even do that.  And the only way that they will even consider even giving you basic cooperation because that's all submission means for black men.  Black men have no inkling, no thoughts of black women submitting like other groups of women do.  That's not even in the cards.  We already know upfront that's not gonna happen.  All black men want is basic cooperation, basic consideration, basic niceness, just basic.  Black men like to have their ass kissed too.  All people like to have their ass kissed.  At least every now and then.  Black women believe if you're not kissing their ass or your lips are not firmly planted on their ass, then there's something wrong with you.  And in Dr.  Johnson's thread, two threads, two or three threads, That he had black women came in trying to basically reattach your lips to their ass and basically come in and actually mommy.  all the black men in that thread and basically discount all the experiences of all black men because guess what what you feel what you see and how you think is not what it is.  who are you gonna believe me?  or your lion eyes which is no different from the slave master?  and black women sell this this point.  sell the these shaming tactics as a loyalty test.  if you don't do this if you don't kiss black women's asses if you don't reject all other offers from all over women all over the world then you are not loyal to your race you're not loyal to your women.  becky can't even smile at you without your loyalty being tested.  you're not supposed to avert your eyes not supposed to look you're not even supposed to listen and if it were up to black women you wouldn't even be in proximity of these women unless that's where they sent you.  but they can send you to an all-white school with all white women treating you nice and then get mad because you like being treated nice.  you like to being spoken to in a respectful manner.  you like being approached because female approach and masculine approach are two different things.  you like women to actually start a conversation with you and treats you like you're a human being instead of a piece of meat.  If you look at any media that has to do with black men, the interaction with black men, black men are always treated like the bitch in the relationship.  And if you're not treated like that, then you're treated like the monster, both of which they're in love with.  But I think this ramble has gone on long enough that it wasn't supposed to be a rant.  And it is a stream of consciousness.  I just wanted to get out.  I just had to say it.  If I don't cut it off now, I'll probably go on for an hour.  But black women expect black men to play in a red game where the dice is loaded, cards are marked.  The dominoes are tilted.  The slots are actually illegal.  And the odds of winning are way, way, way too low.  And they deem that as acceptable, preferable, and standard.  Why?  Because it always has been.  Because until now, they were the only game in town.  And with that, I'm going to jump off of here.  This is BGS out, and I will see you guys on the next. ",
