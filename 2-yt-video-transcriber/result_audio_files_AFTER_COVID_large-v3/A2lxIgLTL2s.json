            "text": "I am the radical left, and I didn't realize it.  So I'm the radical left, apparently.  The president has told me that I am.  I hear it from politicians and from preachers, and I'm really taken aback.  I'm quite surprised because up until now, I had no idea that I was an extremist.  I just thought I was an ordinary, regular, decent human being.  I thought that living here in America, that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was something I was supposed to take seriously for everyone.  I thought as someone raised a Christian that loving my neighbor as myself was supposed to be a priority for me, that the golden rule actually meant something.  I always thought decency was mainstream.  I decided that I better take an inventory of the things that I believe to check for my extremism.  I believe in full LGBTQ rights.  I believe that black lives matter.  I believe that we should protect the planet.  I believe that everyone deserves healthcare.  I believe that diversity makes us better.  I believe that the world is bigger than America.  I believe that to be pro-life means to protect all of life wherever it is under duress.  I believe that people should be free to have religious beliefs and free to not have religious beliefs.  I believe that non-American lives are as beautiful and valuable as American lives.  I believe that superiority is not found in whiteness.  I believe that compassion and kindness and generosity are always going to be the better path.  And I believe that there is enough here for everyone, enough food, enough care, enough money, enough opportunity, if we only unleash our creativity and unclench our fists.  Now, I'm not sure how these ideas became radical, although it seems to have happened over the last three or four years, but I grew up being taught that they were just part of being a decent human being.  I grew up being taught that loving my neighbor as myself meant that I actually worked for their well-being as much as for my own.  I believe that as an American citizen, that the inalienable rights of other people was something that I pursued relentlessly.  And I don't think I'm alone here.  I think that most people reside here in this place believing that equality and diversity and love and justice, they're not fringe ideologies or extremist positions.  They're actually just the best way to be human.  I don't think we're the radical left.  I think we're the humane middle.  You see, regardless of their political affiliations or their religious worldview, I think most people right now want more humanity and not less.  The fact that these aspirations are threatening to some people should be an alarm to them that they themselves have moved into extremism.  That they have been living so long in a heavily fortified bunker of their ideologies and prejudices and phobias that they no longer realize that there is a better way to be human and that they're missing it.  That equality now seems oppressive to them.  That justice seems excessive.  that decency is actually threatening.  Maybe the problem isn't that we are radical, it's that humanity now looks radical to people who've embraced inhumanity.  I could be wrong, but I don't think I'm the radical left.  I just think I'm part of the humane middle, that vast, disparate, compassionate community, we the people of this nation who are tired of cruelty and malice and fear and hatred defining us, and who believe that there is a better path.  But if all that makes me radical, I'm going to be okay with that.  I'm going to be content here alongside like-hearted people in our compassionate, kind, generous, and loving extremism. ",
