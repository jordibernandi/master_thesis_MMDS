That's according to veteran journalist Bob Woodward.  I think the bottom line here is that the president, by his own admission in private on the record, acknowledged the depth of this crisis and yet told the American people something very different.  How is that at its core not an abject betrayal of the public trust? ",

Again, from this podium, he acknowledged that this was serious back in March, that 100,000, 200,000 lives could be lost.  And with regard to Dr.  Fauci, you're referring to a quote he allegedly told Bob Woodward, and I can give you quotes that we can all play on loop and video of him, saying that this response was impressive, and he can't imagine anyone under any circumstance doing anything better.  Dr.  Fauci saying this, I can just tell you, the President, the first and only time I went and said, you need to do mitigation strongly, the response was, yes, we will do it.  The second time I went with Dr.  Birx to the President, and said 15 days to slow the spread are not enough.  We need to go to 30 days.  Obviously, there were a lot of people who had problems with that because of potential secondary effects.  Nonetheless, the president went with the health recommendations.  So there's a long litany of praise from Dr.  Fauci, and you're referencing something he allegedly told Bob Woodward. ",

It's a very different thing, respectfully, to lie and mislead the American people about a crisis that has claimed nearly 200,000 American lives? ",

This president has expressed calmness from this podium, mobilized the greatest mobilization of the private sector since World War II, got more tests than any country in the world on COVID, a vaccine, which, by the way, it'll be a record for a novel pathogen.  The timing of this vaccine, should we get it by the end of the year or should we get it even three years, which was the timing of Ebola?
