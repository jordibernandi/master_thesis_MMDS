            "text": "All I did was take this picture holding the AR-15 I just bought for self-defense.  And next thing you know, I got a knock on my door at midnight, and my college charged me with intimidation, making threats, and a hate crime, all for holding an automatic weapon.  Fordham University, see you in court.  I am not backing down.  My name is Austin Tang.  I'm a senior at Fordham University.  And a month ago, I posted two photos on Instagram, leading to an explosion of outrage I never could have predicted.  The first was a picture to remember the life of St.  Louis Police Captain David Dorn, since many in the outrage mob and mainstream media ignored his brutal death.  The other was a photo of me holding my brand new AR-15.  I bought it because of everything happening in our country right now.  A pandemic, police being afraid to do their job, looting, and people who look like me, Chinese Americans, being targeted more frequently.  I immigrated to this free country when I was six years old and posted this photo on June 4th, the 31st anniversary of the 1989 Chinese democracy movement.  Those innocent students were forever disarmed and never experienced freedom.  Here in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms.  This is what keeps America free.  What happened next was shocking.  Hundreds of activists from my college flooded the comments section of my posts, saying things like, die and snap your neck.  The outrage mob found their next target, a law-abiding Chinese-American who simply wanted to defend himself.  People I was once good friends with attacked me and blocked me on social media, while others called on the school to kick me out.  Ultimately, Fordham University bent a knee and sent safety officers to my door at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun.  which they deemed to be an automatic weapon.  An extensive hearing with the dean days later, I was charged with making threats, intimidation, a hate crime, and disorderly conduct.  But it doesn't just stop there.  They have given me a list of things I have to do just to be able to finish my degree online.  It includes writing a letter of apology for hurting the community, the completion of activities related to learning about implicit bias, and multicultural sensitivity training with the Director of Multicultural Affairs.  But even if I complete all of those things, I'm still banned from stepping foot on campus.  You might be thinking my story is crazy and wondering why you haven't heard about it.  It's because the mainstream media has completely ignored it.  My college claims to stand with free speech, but the second I presented a view they disagree with, They put in a plan to brainwash me into their ideology and threaten me if I didn't comply.  To that, I say that is what they do to people in dictatorships.  I refuse to fall into that trap.  You see, the Second Amendment was put in place to stop a tyrannical government from oppressing its people so free people can protect themselves against crime and violence.  If you think I'm just going to give up my rights because the mob is offended, you're sadly mistaken.  My story should be a wake-up call to everyone in the country.  Colleges are becoming Marxist indoctrination centers that can't even tolerate seeing an imposing point of view.  And if we don't start standing up for our rights, we can kiss this country and what makes it so great, goodbye.  Whether you're a parent or student, No one should ever be worried about posting a picture exercising their rights in this country.  Thankfully, America's oldest civil rights group, the National Rifle Association of America, came to my defense.  Me, my fellow 5 million NRA members, students for 2A, and the tens of millions of governors will never stop fighting for the Second Amendment.  And that is why I am planning to sue Fordham University.  Because leftist academic elitists will never silence us.  I am Austin Tong.  I am a student for the Second Amendment and a proud member of the National Rifle Association of America. ",
