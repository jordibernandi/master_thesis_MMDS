            "text": "Hey, what is up guys?  Welcome back to the channel today on our 4th of July weekend.  Enjoying a nice 4th of July weekend.  I woke up today and there was a new group on the scene.  Lots of headlines of a group out of Georgia.  and we're going to talk about this group out of Georgia because it is very important.  because the words that they came out and used, their message of who they are, what they're about, affects many of you based off your skin color in general.  So it's important to put the word out there so that you guys know, because anytime anyone comes out identifying their adversaries as a color, it's a big deal.  So let's get started.  All right, guys, so the group is NFAC.  We try to keep it a family show, so we are not going to tell you guys what that stands for, and it doesn't matter, okay?  NFAC sounds a little more professional.  So NFAC, a group out of Georgia, we're going to call it a militia.  That's what they seem to be.  I don't know, it's just easier to call everyone a militia, okay?  So NFAC, Georgia, militia out of Georgia, all black militia.  These guys came out, the leader specifically.  Now the leader is important, guys.  The leader is always important in any group.  It kind of sets the tone for who they are, how they're led, the mentality, the seriousness of how you should take them.  Many times you get organizations with no leaders, right?  And you just don't take them serious because clearly if you guys can't organize, no one even cares what your point is because you're just going to run out of steam because you're disorganized.  If you have a leader that is a clown, same thing, right?  You just don't give them credit, okay?  Because you know, oh, they're going to burn them down.  This leader's charismatic, so it's good.  This leader is, he seems literate, right?  So it's... This isn't your normal little hoopla over the weekend.  This is something to take serious, guys, and we're gonna talk about it.  I'm gonna give you a little more information about their message, but we're gonna talk about whether or not you should take this group serious, and I'm telling you why you should.  So the NFAC, they rallied, I believe it was 4th of July, the day of 4th of July, down in Georgia, and they wound up marching to the Stone Mountain Confederate Monument there in Georgia.  Which is symbolic, right?  Because everything that is black related is slavery related, right?  We have to go back to the roots of black people when they were slaves.  And that's where we dig up the hate for other people, right?  So it's a catalyst of where we can always just tie hate to.  And we're talking hate here, right?  We are talking about a hate group.  This group specifically hates white people.  They openly came out and they called out after assembling, after dressing in all black, so a... a uniform, right, they're all in a uniformed color, all black, called out the Boog Boys, an elusive Hawaiian shirt wearing, Bujahedin boys, right, called out three percenters, called out the white militia, I don't know if that's a specific group or if he just assumes militias are all white, called them out, said, we are in your neighborhood, where you at?  Let's go.  Let's go, right?  Was he inviting them to come and parade with them?  I doubt it, guys.  Let's go is pretty universal for, you know, let's get it on.  Declaration of war.  Did these guys just hit the scene and declare war?  Yeah.  They did.  We're gonna talk about it.  We're gonna talk about it more.  Yes, they did.  They came out, they called out white people.  They're done with white people.  They're done with the boog boys, the 3% and the white militias.  They're not having it, right?  So they are opposition.  They said, we are your opposition.  What do they want?  Well, they don't wanna be around white people anymore, right?  So here's what they want to do.  This is the intentions of the group per the leader.  whose name I didn't catch, which is fine.  I think this is gonna grow.  I think we're gonna see more of them. ",
