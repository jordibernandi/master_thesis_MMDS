The root end of the log usually gets soaked with water, becomes heavy and sinks, but they float in upright position.  Then we noticed that they fall and disappear and they stand upright on the bottom of the lake.  When I did my diving at the bottom of the lake, discovered large logs with root mass flaring out at the bottom of the lake, just standing there as if the tree grew there in the bottom of the lake, but it didn't.  It grew on the slopes up here.  The log was ripped loose by the water wave.  It floated on the lake a little while, probably prone, and then went vertical and then finally fell to the bottom and replanted in the bottom of the lake.  We did a sonar study of the bottom of the lake.  We had sonar contacts with hundreds of upright logs on the bottom of the lake.  There's evidence.  if we extrapolated the bottom of the lake, maybe there were 10,000 logs standing vertical.  What would Spirit Lake look like if you drained it?  It would look like a forest that grew there.  But no, it didn't grow there, it's been replanted.  And the implications of that are enormous. ",

Well, in the explanation and the process of going through a PhD thesis and dissertation, The university said, you can't turn in a thesis disproving a theory.  You need to turn in a thesis proving a theory or generating a new theory for the origin of coal.  So don't tell us what's wrong with the old theory for the formation of coal.  Generate a new theory for the formation of coal.  Well, the day before Christmas, 1978, I was taking a bath, thinking about the plant material and especially the tree bark accumulated in coal and the thick layering in coal.  And I was thinking about the root-penetrated, very disorganized structure of modern swamp peats.  As I thought about this, I was playing with soap suds and imagining logs floating on an ocean.  And I imagined an ocean full of logs and these logs would rub against one another and the bark would peel off and sink to the bottom.  And that's what I call the floating mat model for the origin of a coal bed.  what we see here essentially is the first step for the formation of a coal bed, like the coal beds in Kentucky.  And the modern swamp peats are intensely root penetrated and create this homogenous texture that's quite different than the coal beds that we have in the world today.  And those coal beds are better explained by this type of environment. ",

And so this log mat environment is a piece of a puzzle that helps us understand the rapid and catastrophic process to form coal.  and coal-bearing strata.
