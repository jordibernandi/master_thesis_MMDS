Was it the man evil?  Or was the system evil?  Or is evil too strong a word?  Because what I see is the presence of, of this particular human being in the eyes of many destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weaken the ability, like weaken the institution of MIT by making everybody quiet, like almost making them unable to say anything interesting or difficult.

The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this.  woke crap about power differentials, okay?  In general, you can talk about, hypergamy and power differentials are Russell conjugates of the same concept.  Just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically provable to be attractive in females to males, Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power and success and all these sorts of things.  The relationship between consenting adults is, quite frankly, not something I want to sort out.  The relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors, and particularly, you know, there's the 17, 18 issue.  That's very different than 12, 13.  We're talking about really sick depravity.  with respect to what it appears that Jeffrey Epstein was involved in at some level.  I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing Jeffrey Epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement, and support to scientists.  Another thing he was doing, I believe, was giving tax advice to very rich people.  I believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.  Another thing he was doing, I think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.  So there's an entire spectrum of different stuff.  And at the moment, nobody can pull apart or deconflate anything because the woke thing comes over it and says... I think it's disgusting that a 43-year-old billionaire would be partying with a 23-year-old.  Okay, I don't want to adjudicate that.

And it's about the Citizens Committee to Investigate the FBI, which was run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist, and broke into FBI offices in Pennsylvania to steal files, which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered a huge conspiracy.  It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government, a double conspiracy story.  which launched multiple conspiracies.  I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that they don't even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven.  So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction. ",

I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein.  Right?  So I'm just trying to let it be known that I don't know anything more than I've already said.  Now, your friends at MIT... Their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person capable of continuing U.S.  scientific tradition.  You see, the U.S.  scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.  It's combative.  Okay?  Okay?  And we're a free society and we act like a free society.  We're a rich society and we research like we're a rich society.  That is historically.  And then came the 1970s.  And William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece Awards and the idea that we're paying too much and these are welfare queens in lab coats and blah, blah, blah, blah.  We need more transparency, more oversight.  Everything went to hell.  And the national culture of US science was lost.  The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.  And then Jeff Epstein shows up.  And a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Kavli, maybe Yuri Milner, Maybe who else would be in this category?  Peter Thiel to an extent.  Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things, which has different grant structures than the NIH.  Gave people a modicum of risk-taking ability.  Okay, well when Jeff Epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science.  And suddenly, a charismatic billionaire says, hey, I can make that work for you.  Here's $100,000.  Go research something crazy.  Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities.  And the federal government and the taxpayers welched.  Okay? ",

But the point was, there wasn't enough money to be moral.  So it was time to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.  And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, hey, come to my world.  We can do it like we used to do.  So in part, my point is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of religious commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science.  The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have to say, look, this isn't about me and you.  There isn't enough money in the world to buy the kind of legacy I want to leave to this planet.  this is one of the great things about science, you know, potentially it's worth dying for. ",
