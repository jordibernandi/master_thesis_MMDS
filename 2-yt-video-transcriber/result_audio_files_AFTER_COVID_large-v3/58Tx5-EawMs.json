I'm your host, Mr.  P, and today we're going to be talking more about flowers, and I'm joined by Dr.  Jennifer Rivera, and she's going to be here.  She's got some fun stories to tell us about flowers.  Hurts I'm learning.  So when we think about the idea of flowers in our episode called the function of flowers, we talked about how God created flowers.  We read from Genesis one that they're created according to their kind and that they have seed in them to produce after their kind.  So have you ever planted spinach seeds and gotten dill? ",

So we see a very discrete unit, a very clear unit of things inside the plant world that we can think about created according to their kinds.  Roses are always going to produce more roses.  Lilies are going to produce more lilies and types that look like them.  That's an incredibly important concept.  I haven't always believed that way.  I used to be an evolutionist.  I was trained in the evolutionary way of thinking when I was in college.  When I started teaching science, I taught it from an evolutionary perspective.  But I didn't understand a lot of the issues involved in there, a lot of the assumptions.  I just believed what my professors told me.  I thought science was the way to know truth.  And that was a little bit of a shift for me when I came to a biblical understanding.  changed my heart and he changed my mind on those issues and now I understand things from that biblical perspective.  I understand why that is.  I wrote papers about plant evolution in college and studied that in a lot of detail, but now I understand all the false assumptions that were hidden inside of there.

So this lab we've got for you is a flower dissection.  Now we're going to look at the lily today, and lilies make a great specimen for us because they're very open structures.  So if we think about this big yellow lily that I've got here, you can look inside of here and you can see all the different parts in there just with your eye just peeking in there.  You don't need any special tools to be able to see that.  So if we think back to our episode, we talked about all of these different structures.  So these outer pieces here are the calyx, and then we have the petals on the inside.  We have the stigma here, the male parts, and then we have the pistil here, the female part.  All those parts of this complete flower are clearly seen.  Now this is a monocot.  It's got petals in groups of three.  So we can think about this.  This is a perfect flower also because it has both the male and the female parts.  Those are all things we discussed in that episode.  Here's a rose and it's a different type of flower.  You can see it has a different leaf pattern.  This is actually a dicot and it would form a different style of seed.  It's got veins in its leaf that spread out in a web out from the middle vein here.  A little bit different.  If we go into here, we can see the sepals around the bottom that would form the calyx.  We've got the corolla here, the petals, and all the parts inside are hidden.  And we cultivate these types of roses to be more beautiful.  So we can use God's creation and our knowledge of how we crossbreed these and how plants pollinate with one another to create these beautiful structures.  But because the lily and the rose are two different kinds, are we ever going to get a lily rose to be produced?  Never.  No.  And that very fact of the pollen that comes from the lily is never going to fertilize those ovules that are inside of the rose.  Why not? ",

And the teacher was an evolutionist, but she was very knowledgeable, had a master's in botany.  And she knew an awful lot of information about the structure of plants.  But she was describing the different parts, which we're going to learn today when we dissect our flower.  And she was talking about the stigma, which is the female part of the plant.  And part of the stigma, the very top of it is the stigma.  And the stigma is attached to the style, which is then attached to the ovary, which is down here.  Now, that whole complete thing is called two different things.  What we could say is the pistil.  That has a couple different names.  But the very top here is the stigma.  And when the pollen falls on the stigma, the stigma will allow those pollen granules to go down to the ovary.  And this evolutionist instructor said, she goes, you know, it's just interesting though that plants will only allow the pollen down from.  you know plants that are within their same taxonomic family.  right.  a lily is not going to allow rose pollen down to stigma because it won't fertilize its ovary.  there's no sense you know.

Okay, so for a basic flower dissection, you don't need any fancy tools.  If you maybe happen to have a dissection kit, if you use those for homeschool things, you might have things like these little probes and scissors and little forceps and maybe even a scalpel inside of there, those types of things.  You can use something like that, but that's not necessary.  You could use something as simple as a steak knife or a pocket knife, a pair of tweezers from the bathroom, those types of things.  And if you don't have a pair of forceps this big, it'll be okay.  You can just go with the smaller ones, all right?  But I do need those every once in a while.  So it doesn't take a lot of special tools.  You might also want to have something like a hand lens or some type of magnifying tool.  Sometimes you can get apps for your phone that can turn your phone camera into a magnifier, basically.  Microscope, if you have a microscope, you could do those.

That's because these pollen grains that are in here have fallen on the surface of this and it's sticky and they've attached to there.

But if this were an edible fruit that's the structure that we'd eat.  Now on a rose you do get that type of structure and it forms down here at the base and we call those rose hips.  So if you see on a rose bush after all the petals fall off this little ball will form down here at the bottom.  We typically call those rose hips, and those are used for medicinal things and flavoring of things.  If we were to look inside the rose, we wouldn't find things in groups of threes because it's not a monocot.  We'd find them in groups of fives or fours for other dicots.  All of these different structures are really cool to look at and really cool to explore and understand how God created them.  All right, so here's another little thing you can do, and this would be great if you had a microscope, and you can even do this with a hand lens.  If I take this piece of paper right here and I put one of these anthers that's got all of those pollens on it, I can actually knock off some of those pieces, and all these little pollen grains.  Do you see that brownish stuff?  All of those little pollen grains are actually the things that hold the male gametes, the sperm, to carry them down to the egg.  And if I kind of smear this across here, you can see it makes kind of a, oh, we got yellow on yellow.  That was a great job, Mr.  P. But you can see it smearing out over here and you see it all over my finger as well.  You get that color, that very distinct color.  So that's part of the pigment that's inside the pollen.  So you can actually look at the individual pollen grains if you have a microscope or some way to magnify that a little bit.  Other things that you could do to explore this, you could find more mature structures like this, if you've got anything.  You could cut this in different sections, see what's inside of it, see if you can identify where each of those little ovules is, how many chambers there are.  Each of the seeds might be sectioned off into a specific little locule.  They're all different kinds of structures.  So if you go and explore some of these different things, you're going to find really cool stuff that God's made in different patterns.  Other ways that you could explore, you could look at the seeds that are produced from them, the different colors that you find in the flowers, the way that things are arranged on the stem.  There are just so many things to study about plants.  They just have such variety in all the ways God's made them.  Okay, so you're going to be doing this dissection of this lily or another flower that you can find.  And we want you to be careful.  Slow down, take your time.  We've got some questions for you to think through and especially some biblical application as we think about how God's made these plants and how we can glorify him through all of those things.  We hope you enjoy this dissection and learn all about God's amazing creation.  And until next time, get out there and explore it. ",
