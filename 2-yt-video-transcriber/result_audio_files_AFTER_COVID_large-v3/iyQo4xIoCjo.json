Are you ready for the incoming asteroids that certainly are going to threaten this planet?  and has planet X or a binary system?  caused, causing the heavens to shake and the earth to quake.  Well, the Bible says it in Isaiah chapter 24, that the earth is going to reel and rock like a drunken man.

And you'll really appreciate them.  Now, here's what's going on.  There was an article just came out by the International Business Times.  And it says, despite NASA's denial, the biblical preacher assures that Nibiru will trigger the apocalypse on Earth.  I'm not so sure NASA has said no to this.  I've actually went back and found documents where NASA even had a Nibiru task force for seven years.  Matter of fact, on the little green file that we got from several of four NASA scientists that put this on the little green file, they talk about the binary system that's bringing a ton of asteroids and debris toward the Earth.  No, we have not.  I don't have.  I haven't seen Planet X or Nibiru.  But there's a lot of mathematical proof and a lot of scientists and astronomers who do say that this dark planet that's so far out there on the edge of our solar system that it's creating five waves of energy.  that is shaking the heavens matter of fact.  i read the article today and it said the business international international business times said several conspiracy theorists have been claiming that a rogue planet named nibiru is currently in its collision course toward the earth and once it hits the blue planet it will trigger devastation everywhere.  The conspiracy theory initially gained popularity back in 2017.  That's not correct.  In 1985, it was brought forward, even before that, by Jeremiah Stitchin.  But even NASA put together a Nibiru task force from 1985 to 1992.  I mean, this Nibiru, planet X, coming back around, read the book written by Immanuel Velikovsky called Worlds in Collision.  It's a tremendous book on tying the planet X or call it the binary system.  It's God's way of shaking the heavens and brought the plagues of Egypt and how it was documented not only by the Egyptians and in the Bible, in the Torah, in Exodus, but also the Peruvians, the Mayans, ancient scripts, along with the Incas, the Aztecs, also the reports in some of the European documentation and even in Asia.  how it affected the earth during the time of the plagues of Egypt.  but anyway they went on to write that the conspiracy theory initially gained popularity in 2017 and nothing happened on the probable collision date predicted by a conspiracy theorist.  that was Scotty Clark who predicted that we would have rapture on September 23rd 2017 and including the infamous David Mead who said that we would see Planet X or Nibiru in the fall of 2017. of course that didn't happen.  now NASA and the United States Space Agency have informed the general public that Nibiru is nothing but an internet hoax.  Well, there is some people who have made that statement, but NASA has also said that there is an invisible planet that is so far from the sun it can't get a reflection, but all of the gravitational pull and shaking and affecting the planets Has to be there.  Matter of fact, I don't know, but I'm telling you, they say that.  Now, however, Pastor Paul Begley is a popular American preacher who has been making doomsday predictions for years.  I've never made a doomsday prediction.  I'm telling you the signs that the end is nearing, but I've never set a date.  But that's okay.  He believes that Nibiru is a real deal.  I do.  And according to Begley, Nibiru will soon reveal itself to the world, and it will mark the beginning of the apocalypse on Earth.  That's true.  I do believe that.  Now, anytime, and that's because the Bible says it.  All right, the deep impacts are in Revelation chapter 8.  The earth is going to reel and rock like a drunken man.  Jesus said there'll be mighty earthquakes, major earthquakes.  He said there'll be signs in the sun, the moon, the stars, and distress of nations with perplexity.  The sea and the waves will be roaring.  All kinds of apocalyptic events in what's called Isaiah's, the oracles of Isaiah.  If you read Isaiah 24, Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, Joel 2.  We can go on forever, okay?  Revelation, Daniel, it all talks about these events coming.  Anytime you have a sun event, You have an Earth event.  I said that.  Anytime there's a space event, it affects the Earth or even the sun.  That's true.  I said that.  And right now, we're dealing with Planet X, Nibiru, Planet Number 9, Wormwood, the Dwarf Star, the Goblin.  Call it what you want to.  It's a binary system.  And even according to Mike from around the world for the last seven years, of course, he's been saying it is approaching us for the last seven years, getting closer and closer into sight.  Okay, Pastor Begley does predict that people will start freaking out, and they will, after seeing the dreaded events that are going to hit the planet and on the earth very soon.  The preacher revealed that the Bible has predicted both fearful and great signs from heaven.  That's exactly right.  It says it right here in the book of St.  Luke's Gospel.  It says there will be great signs and fearful sights will be from the heavens.  And I'll read it for you.  It's Luke chapter... 21 verse 10.  Jesus said, nations shall rise against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms and great earthquakes shall be in different places and famines and pestilences like the locust plagues we're having and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.  So that is Luke chapter Holy Scriptures, the words of Jesus, St.  Luke 21, verse 11, if you want to know where that verse is at.  So that's why we preach that as a biblical truth, okay?  Now, even though conspiracy theorists like Paul Begley are assuring that the existence of Nibiru and the entire scientific community and space agencies like NASA have dismissed it, all of the doomsday hoax i'm sorry that's not true.  i've got four nasa scientists who have already confirmed that it's true and that's there's.  there's a lot okay um But it's okay.  The international business time is making you aware that there's something going on.  See, it's going to become unexplainable.  Somebody's got to explain it to the people.  When these events really start getting worse, I'll be still around.  I'll help you through it.  Okay?  Lord willing.  And I hope that you come to the understanding that now you're living in these last days.  We're running out of time, folks.  Get saved before it's too late. ",
