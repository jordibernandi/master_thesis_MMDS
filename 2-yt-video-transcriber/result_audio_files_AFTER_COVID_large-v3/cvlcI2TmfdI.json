            "text": "And when a message is urgent enough, sometimes help arrives.  City of Flint, USA.  May 5th, 2016.  POTUS has arrived.  The people of Flint had one last beacon of hope.  We were all invited to this big thing where the President Obama was going to speak to us about the problem.  Oh my gosh, this is so cool!  Oh yes!  Oh yes!  He's finally here.  We've been waiting.  Once he sees, he can make a conscious decision to push this with urgency.  President Obama!  While President Obama was on his way to the event, Governor Snyder thought he'd take to the stage and warm up the crowd.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  I understand why you're angry and frustrated.  I want to come here today to apologize.  We have a short-term water crisis that needs to be repaired.  Thank you for caring for us Obama.  Flint's recovery is everybody's responsibility.  And I'm gonna make sure that responsibility is met.  That's why I'm here.  To tell you directly that I see you and I hear you.  We invest.  Can I get some water?  Come on up here.  I want a glass of water.  I want a glass of water.  Everybody settle down.  This is a feisty crowd.  I really did need a glass of water.  This is not a stunt.  What?  He wet his lips.  He did not drink it.  He didn't sip it.  He wet his lips.  There was an audible gasp in the audience.  People were just like absolutely dejected.  Why would you do that?  I am sure that somewhere when I was two years old, I was taking a chip of paint tasting it, and I got some lit.  Yeah, that's like talking about, like, well, I didn't wear a seatbelt, and I'm fine.  It's like, but there were tons of people that died.  Backstage, the president, sitting at the table with the criminal governor, decided to perform his stunt all over again.  You know, generally, I have not been doing stunts here, but, you know.  That's not what I expected.  That's what Snyder did.  It felt like he minimized what people were actually going through and struggling with.  If you were actually lead poisoned, you would not be president.  You would be janitor Barack Obama.  We were holding onto hope that he would declare a disaster area.  A disaster would give us FEMA.  It would give us pipe replacement, get engineers in here.  Then we could get Medicare for all the residents of Flint.  As soon as he took a drink of the water and said, everything's fine, that was that.  And look at it, years later, it's still poison.  When he came here, he was my president.  But when he left, he was not my president.  I would again go back to the president's visit last week.  He reinforced the message that filtered water has been determined to be safe for people to drink.  This, again, was our hero, and we thought he was going to come here and help us.  But they do have a mural of him, and DeRipe has it now, and his head is busted out.  It was devastating, and it depressed the vote.  And I know people that stayed home and just said to hell with all of them.  I don't know.  I just don't.  I don't know.  I don't know why anybody would have advised him to do that, and I don't know why he would do it.  And to the average person, then, then the Democrats don't look like the people who are going to come to the rescue.  Right.  So in Flint, the number is something like 8,000 African-American voters who voted twice for Obama, chose not to vote.  Hillary lost in Michigan by two votes per precinct on average.  Two votes per precinct.  10,000 and some votes was it.  So where are we left? ",
