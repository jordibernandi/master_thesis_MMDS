And I believe you mentioned earlier that you changed your mind.  C.S.  Lewis was an atheist and he changed his mind, but you both changed your mind in this lifetime.  And my question is kind of a moral question.  Why would God give us that blink of an instant of our lifespan here on this earth, cut short by evil and human suffering and lack of direct empirical evidence of his presence, to make the decision that will impact our entire existence in eternity?

It doesn't state this directly, but David, after his baby dies in the Old Testament, says he stops mourning after the baby dies.  And his assistants are going, why did you stop mourning?  He says, the baby will not come back to me, but I will go to him.  The implication is he's going to see the baby in heaven.  So, no, I don't think God sends people who haven't reached the age of accountability to hell.  I think there's two possibilities.  He sends them to heaven, or he knows what they would have done if they had lived longer.  Now, what is the age of accountability?  Well, back then, maybe, who knows, seven or eight?  I think now it's about 37.  Okay, 38, something like that. ",

            "text": "And we are judged.  I mean, the Scripture says that to the one who knows the will of God and doesn't do it, there's a harsher judgment.  In other words, we're judged based on what we know.  So Romans 1 says that the evidence for God is apparent.  And what we do is we suppress that truth, like trying to hold a beach ball under the water.  So getting into the mind of why didn't this happen and why didn't that happen?  I was asked this on national television in Poland.  When they asked me in Warsaw, they said, if then they ask it this way, what about the Thomas who Jesus rebuked?  It's seemingly like, you know, you know, you've seen, but blessed is the one that is not seen and believed.  And they said, why is that meaning that evidence is not necessary?  And I said, Thomas wasn't.  Thomas wasn't rebuked because he wanted evidence.  It's because he had more than enough evidence.  See, we have enough evidence to make a decision.  Now, we don't have, there's no such thing as absolute proof.  We think that we're going to prove God to 100%.  You don't even have that in mathematics.  G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem proved that.  That even in a system as simple as arithmetic, there are certain truths, G\u00f6del said, that you know are true but that you cannot prove.  Just like in our Declaration of Independence, we said we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all are created equal.  Well, how do you prove that?  We know it's true, but that's not an IQ test.  It's not a bank account test.  So there are truths that we know are true.  Euclid built this whole geometric system on a faith in a dimensionless point.  And so I think the question is, we come so far, we have enough evidence, and now it's not a leap of faith, but God is asking us to take a step of faith in the direction that the evidence is leading.  So I think every person has a different amount of evidence, a different place, but I think we're all going to be judged based on what we know, ultimately.  And what did we do with that?  So when I tell people that, they say, well, what about the people over in some country that haven't heard?  I said, I don't know that I'm as concerned about them as what about the people in this town that have heard and heard and heard and heard and heard and heard and rejected it.  So... I don't know if we're answering your question, but... ",

            "text": "Jackie, let me take one other quick thing on this.  I should have said this earlier.  There's a difference between belief that and belief in.  Belief that is getting evidence that something's true.  But belief in is after you know that it's true, trusting in it.  Like Jesus, we get evidence that Jesus was who he said he was through evidence.  right but trusting in jesus is not just a matter of the head it's also a matter of the heart and we know this in relationships.  right.  when i first met my wife 34 years ago i got evidence that she would be a good wife but all the evidence in the world didn't make her my wife.  i had to take a step of trust in her to ask her to be my wife and in a momentary lapse of judgment she said yes See?  She's here, but I won't point her out because she'll kill me.  Okay?  So there's a difference between belief that and belief in.  When Caiaphas saw that Jesus had resurrected Lazarus from the dead, intellectually, I think he knew that Jesus was the Messiah, but he didn't trust in him.  The demons know that Jesus is the Messiah, as James says.  Even the demons know that God exists, but they tremble.  They don't trust in him.  Why?  Because we have free will.  We don't have to trust him.  We don't want to.  We want to do our own thing.  See, most of us are not on a truth quest.  We're on a happiness quest.  And we're just going to believe whatever we think is going to make us happy.  Here's the problem.  You can make yourself happy over the short term doing a lot of stupid but fun things.  However, over the long term, it's a disaster.  And everyone in here who's over 40 knows what I'm talking about because most of us have tried it ourselves, right?  We're going to do it my way.  No, it didn't work out.  Does that make any sense?  Thanks, Jackie.  Thank you. ",
