            "text": "There have been many controversies in church history.  In the history of the, quote, organized church, it doesn't mean that they were all real believers or not, but some of the famous ones were, one was called Arianism, which held that the Messiah, while the Son of God, was not quite as divine as the Father and wasn't eternal.  Nestorianism, that, that Jesus, Messiah, and this was, and the Son of God were not quite the same.  His, His humanity and His divinity were kind of separated.  The Gnostics and the Docetists, which said Messiah's body was just an illusion.  Because, because they said that the physical word is evil so it had to be an illusion that he was even here.  The Marcionites, that the God of the Hebrew Bible was different from the God of the New Testament.  In other words, the God of ... and some, some believers still act like.  that's true.  The God of the Old Testament isn't always angry in a bad mood.  The God of the New Testament, He has a change of heart.  He's a nice God.  Not true.  Not true.  Pelagianism.  That you could earn your way to heaven without grace.  And much, much more.  But, but the first of all controversies in the quote church or faith was very different.  Well this is actually the true church.  This is Acts and here it is.  Acts 15 verse 1.  Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren, unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.  Okay.  The year is approximately 49 AD.  This is an event that is of such gigantic importance.  Without this many of you, or most of you, wouldn't be saved today.  All those who came, who come to the Messiah who were not Jewish by birth, back then had either been proselytes, meaning they had already, already converted, or God-fearers and they, and they may have already been circumcised.  Only Cornelius, the Roman centurion in Caesarea, who, who called for Peter to come and was the first one to be baptized, only he didn't fit the pattern.  But that event was apparently seen as something exceptional.  Didn't fit in.  Not for changing a policy.  And they may have assumed that Cornelius would then go under the law and be circumcised.  A persecution comes to the believers in Jerusalem and it scatters them.  They end up, some of them end up in Antioch.  In Antioch it's Jew and Gentile.  And there's no real, doesn't, the Bible doesn't speak about a distinction.  They're just there.  And they start, from Antioch comes the first world mission as we saw, Paul and Barnabas.  And when Paul goes and Barnabas, they, for the first time they're preaching directly to the Gentiles.  It's not just, okay we went here and then, you know, it's kind of a side people are coming to the, as we, as we seek for the Jewish people to come.  But now they're going directly to the Gentiles.  So this was a matter of far-reaching concern to Jerusalem.  They're saying, what's going on here now?  Because things are changing.  It is about 19 years after the crucifixion, to get an idea, and the resurrection.  That would be like, the resurrection and the crucifixion would be like when 9-11 happened.  Okay.  That's about 19 years ago or so.  So that's where you are.  That's how far they are.  So here, now, now they went all that time though, almost 20 years, without coming to this decision about circumcision.  That means they were pretty much all Jewish believers except for the God-fearing Gentiles.  Because that's all that it was.  But now it starts going on.  So this is the first, the first church issue controversy for, for Christianity, what would be known as that later on, is focused not on all these other things that came later, but on circumcision.  That shows you right there how Jewish the faith is.  The first church controversy is about circumcision.  They thought that in order to become a Christian you had to be circumcised or you had to become Jewish by flesh.  And there.  So it comes all the way up to this point.  Now it also shows you not only how Jewish your faith is, and it's for everybody, Jew and Gentile, but it's the, it's, it's what God has given.  But also it shows you how far things departed.  Because just about in the, in the fourth century, the 300s, not, not, not that long, much long later when you look at the whole age, Believers, the church councils were saying that any believer that still celebrated the Jewish holidays was condemned.  It actually made a thing that if you celebrated the death of Messiah, which happened on Passover, on Passover you were condemned.  It was outlawed.  They called them, those who did, the Kordodesimans, which sounds like a heresy, but it simply means the 14th day of the month.  That's Passover.  So see how far it went from its roots when the very first thing was, can we let in non-Jewish peoples without being circumcised?  Can you become a Christian without being circumcised?  It comes along because of a great victory.  Paul and Barnabas go out and Gentiles are coming in.  But every time you have a victory in the Lord there's always the enemy to start trying to mess it up.  And so there's opposition.  And there's opposition and there's attack and there's controversy.  And that's when you have to stand because God will even do something greater when you're getting attacked.  Stand because He is something even greater if you press through the attack. ",
