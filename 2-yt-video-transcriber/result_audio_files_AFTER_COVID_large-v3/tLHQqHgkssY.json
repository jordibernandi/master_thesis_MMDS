As far as what's happening here, well, you know, of course, we have no services at Beth Israel.  So I'm live streaming for the first time.  So we're doing that.  So I go to the building to do that about twice a week.  We do it on Friday and Sunday.  We had, well, the only time I get out is pretty much there and going to the supermarket with a mask on, which is a new thing for me.  And we did, for the first time, we did a Passover online because of that.  And we've had about 200,000 people take part in it.  So it's a whole new thing, but God's purposes don't stop.  at all.  I've been working on the new book.  I'll tell you about it because it links with everything here.  So it gave me time to do it.  So, you know, it's an amazing time.  It's a prophetic time.  It's a fearful time, but it's also a special time because we're with the Lord and all of God's people know that God is with them.  So a really quite amazing time and very prophetic. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Yeah.  First, I was telling people, well, first of all, there's much in the Harbinger that has to do with this.  I want to touch on that.  But also, I was telling people before this year began, months before, that I believe this was going to be a year of shaking, an important year, a critical year, a year of shaking, and for the purposes of God.  And also, I mean, for a long time, we've been saying this is coming, you know, At the beginning of the year, I give a word for the year.  And I just looked over the notes today, what I shared.  And what I shared was that I said I saw several scriptures for this year, linked to judgment and judgment.  And one of them about the Lord roaring from Zion and the causing the world, things in the world to dry up, the Lord coming forth.  I said, you know, I spoke about 9-11 and linked it to this year.  I said, remember what happened at 9-11.  And everybody's blocked to churches, but without repentance.  And I said, it often takes an event like 9-11.  So this is all the word for the year.  And I spoke that, you know, that I believe that there were going to be dark days.  events happening that, that in this world and that beyond anybody's understanding.  And that, that, that I shared at the beginning of the year that I often am asked, do I see judgment or revival?  And I said that I said that word for the year that I believe that revival can come through judgment and often through calamity will come revival.  And I said, we could see, I'm just, I'm basically just telling you the notes that I actually said that the I said we could see great things at the same time as often great things come through dark, dark events.  And so, yes, and one of the other scriptures I got for the year was something I got actually when I had left.  I remember one time I had left Morningside for the airplane to leave, and I'm praying to the Lord.  And the scripture I got was Ezekiel 33, that God has appointed us as watchmen.  And we need to warn and we need to sound the trumpet and we need whether they listen or not.  We need to do that.  You've been doing that for years.  We've been doing that for years.  And there's there's much to speak about here.  There's much also in the harbinger.  that is warning of where we are now.  But so the answer is, yes, I gave words for the year.  I spoke of the show of a shaking.  I felt it very strongly, in fact, because of that.  I was led to do something, which I believe, which I will, we will announce it.  I haven't announced, you know, we posted it, but we have never, I've never announced it on television or anything.  And I believe it's the right thing to announce it with you guys, an event that we planned before for this year, but it's linked to all that's happening now. ",
