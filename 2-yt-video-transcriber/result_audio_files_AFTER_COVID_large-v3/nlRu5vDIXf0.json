And so far, I'm not seeing anything about a helium balloon and an upside down weighing scale, sensitive or otherwise.  But what I have found is this.  In physics, a force is an interaction that when opposed will change the motion of an object.  A force can cause an object with a mass to change its velocity, which includes to begin moving from a state of rest to accelerate.  A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.  So yeah, there was definitely no mention of helium balloons or upside down weighing scales.  Sorry.  Not sorry.
