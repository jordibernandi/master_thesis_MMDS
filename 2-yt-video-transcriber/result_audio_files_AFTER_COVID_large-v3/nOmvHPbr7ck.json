You know, reassuring when we think that this is, you know, 50-50 chance is going to be the person who the Democrats put up against Donald Trump.  I mean, you could say this is good for Bernie Sanders because now it's just him versus Joe Biden.  And I mean, we're going to look at some more examples of this a bit later in the show.  But Joe Biden does struggle sometimes on stage to be coherent, to finish sentences, to not repeat himself, to recognize his wife.  How do you see this developing as the primary goes on? ",

He sounds like he's having a stroke.  He's not even like, I can't actually make out what he's saying.  And it's like, It concerns me on many levels, one of which is that he will lose almost certainly to Donald Trump who will make mincemeat out of him when he talks like that on stage.  The other thing that concerns me is like, if my God, he becomes president, You know, like, is this man remotely coherent?  I mean, we already had Ronald Reagan running through this with like the early stages of Alzheimer's when he was president.  And I, you know, I don't want to be ableist here.  However, I would like the president to be relatively aware of what's going on.  But I mean, he'll lose.  I said this on Twitter yesterday before anybody voted that if Biden goes up against Trump, he'll lose worse than Hillary Clinton did in all the same places that Hillary Clinton already lost because the same people who hated Hillary Clinton hate him.

Let's just get down to basics here.  He can't finish sentences.  You know, I don't care if he's a Marxist-Leninist and a narco-capitalist.  He can't tell his wife from his sister.  Okay?  There are big problems here.  There's a great film from the 1980s, ironically called Weekend at Bernie's, It's about two guys that go to this guy's weekend summer house and he dies.  And they have to pretend a weekend he's still alive.  And at this point, that is effectively what the Democratic establishment is doing with Joe Biden.  You've got, you know, the DNC and the big donors, they've got their hand up Joe Biden's ass.  It's like Emu with Rod Hull.  And the mouth is moving, often doesn't make much sense.  But like you said at the start, you've got so many negative ads going out through TV networks and so on.  Kind of doesn't matter.  And that's a big lesson, by the way, for the left.  Same as what we learned in this country.  They're now learning in the US.  Legacy media is really powerful.  You can build a movement, have a great ground operation, have great canvassing, great new media.  In 10 years, that's going to win you nominations.  Right now, it's actually still touch and go. ",

This is the first time, Saturday was the first time he'd won a primary.  This is a guy who did not really get very far for a lot of really big negatives.  I cannot say Joe Biden without saying Anita Hill.  But... He now has this sort of image that The Onion used to make these joke articles about Uncle Joe Biden washing his Trans Am on the White House lawn.  He did get this sort of cuddly Uncle Joe image after eight years in the Obama White House.  There's a lot of people who would, in fact, sort of like to just go back and pretend 2016 didn't happen.  We in here know that that's not a possible politics because the planet's on fire, among other things.  But there is that feeling.  And so for people who aren't super high intensity election watchers, like the people in the UK who are watching this election more closely than most of the people who voted yesterday, Joe Biden has that thing.  And Somebody was noting earlier on Twitter that Joe Biden did better in the states where he hasn't been campaigning than the ones where he has.  He did better in the states where he hasn't been on the ground than in the states like Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada, where the candidates have been on the ground for a while.  And that is because the more you see Joe Biden, the more it becomes clear that the man has lost his dang mind. ",
