And then they've helped us by building at the exteriors and interiors of the building, which cannot be generated by GeoPipe.  Pretty much from the announcements on Thursday that we were all going to be sent home because of COVID-19, we've seen a number of students come on consistently for multiple hours.  Some students have spent over 25 hours on the server so far just helping us build.  For admitted students, it's kind of our responsibility to do the best that we can in order to faithfully replicate Brown's campus in order to give them the best experience that we can possibly give them.

The true feeling of Brown is it's something that you can't replicate.  But we're trying our best to try to make that experience for other people.  So I think one really big aspect of this project is that we want to bring the community together right now.  We want to unite everyone over the common goal of building a Minecraft, right?  And so one really important aspect of that is people have to sign up, right?  So we need people to join us, right?  And we need people to choose a location that they want to build on and add one block to the project or add three hours of work to the project.  But in general, we want a lot of people to be helping and a lot of people to get involved, not just for us to finish our project, but for the community to work together towards something awesome. ",
