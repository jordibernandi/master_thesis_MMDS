            "text": "I just arrived back from Georgia.  I'm taking a Christmas break, a Hanukkah break, whatever, and trying to stay a little bit safer.  But, my God, it was skullduggery, fun and games madness.  You have no idea.  Well, actually, I'll tell you what the idea is.  Please, please do so.  Okay, so when we last left our tail, our last discussion, Black Voters Matter, the Hispanic Rights Group, Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, Operation Push, all these big voting rights organizations sued the state of Georgia because they had\u2014I discovered, if you remember, the removal\u2014 of a hundred and ninety eight thousand voters illegally from the voter rolls of georgia.  they just said they moved in.  they never did.  they're right there.  i'm talking to them i'm filming them.  they're sick hike.  why can't i vote?  i'm i'm still in georgia.  so uh... these major organizations and the top voting rights lawyers led by the national bar association ck hoffler uh... fred gray who was uh... uh... Rosa Parks is a lawyer back even back in 1954.  He turned 90 at the trial.  So here's what happened.  The judge gave us a trial, but he said, on a technicality, we didn't give enough notice to the state to get an injunction to get people back on before the election.  So the lawyer said, well, okay, so let's give them notice.  So we filed a new suit with new notice.  So that would be two.  And we notified the Secretary of State were coming by to drop off the suit and give him notice, followed by, by the way, all the local TV cameras and CNN and everyone else.  And so we went up into the Capitol across from Brian Kemp's office.  and to deliver the material to Secretary of State with the cameras rolling.  They locked the doors.  They turned out the lights.  They put on a little yellow taggy with a cell phone number.  We called that.  It just went to voicemail.  So they were literally hid in the dark for two hours.  So we said, okay.  We have another route.  Latasha Brown of Black Voters Matter said, let's go another way.  So we went over to another state office building, and lo and behold, there, hiding behind a door, was the director of elections for the state of Georgia.  And he came out, and we slapped the suit on him.  But even more, the judge had said, listen, you've got real problems with your.  With your, you know, you've clearly removed people who haven't moved.  There's, you know, terrible discrepancies in your purge list.  That's the term for removing voters.  And you have to meet.  You should meet with the experts and meet with Black Voters Matter and Greg Palast.  So here we were.  And they said, so when are you going to meet with us?  The judge said, meet with us.  And he was hemming and hawing.  And then also, and the cameras are rolling, so he's trying to get out of there.  And at the same time, So then I asked him something else.  The state said, the state told the court that they had checked with the post office.  You have to use a licensee.  There's licensees who can get in the post office computers.  Because, you know, who knows if you moved?  It's the post office.  And they said that they used the post office check.  We checked, and they didn't.  They claimed that they hired some contractor named Anchor.  We hired Anchor, that is Black Voters Matter and the Palace Investigative Fund.  They said they never worked with the state of Georgia.  They basically pulled a con on the court.  And so I confronted them with it.  I said, you actually, in effect, you perjured yourself to the court to get out of putting these voters back on the voter rolls.  And don't forget, Tom, what's unusual about this case is here's about whether voters were wrongly removed from the voter rolls and we know what color they are because we met them, Mr.  Diaz, Mr.  Watson, Martin Luther King's cousin, these people who've never left Georgia.  And, you know, so they conned the court into, with this material to try to avoid getting these people back on.  And the Republican National Committee joined the case on behalf of the state.  It's like, why is the currency here?  Why is the But the top hit men, including Trump's, by the way, personal lawyers who were defending him against potential criminal charges in New York, why are they in the case?  Why are they trying to stop voters from voting in Georgia?  I mean, if you want to win the election, isn't the Democratic small d, the Democratic way is to convince the voters to vote for you as opposed to blocking them because you don't like their color? ",
