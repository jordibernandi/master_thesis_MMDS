I know you know.  People were really talking about that, sharing that.  They were going crazy on that.  So I want your honest assessment, bro, and I ain't going to take it no way. ",

Um, they try to do a lot of study and a lot of research and not just with what's thrown in front of them.  They try to go back as far as possible and try to do as much research as possible.  And that's what humans are supposed to do.  So, um, I fuck with the Israelites for sure.  And the scripture that's written, most of these religions that use to control people, with all of the books that they use, these books been translated and interpreted and rewritten so many times.  But if you go back to the original way these scriptures was written, like at the Old Testament, and you look at the original way that the scripture was written, they wasn't calling the higher power the things they calling them now.  You know what I'm saying?  He had a name.  You know what I'm saying?  And the name that they used was Jehowah.  And the name that they used for the son of God was Jehowashah.  So if you look in the real original scriptures, then that's what you will find.  But, um, um, Yeah, I mean, people just got to do their research, man.  And then the people that do do their research got to continue to spread information and document it so that the next generation and the next generation and future generations could just be in a better predicament.  Because when me and you was born, We was born off the strength of the information of the people that came before us.  When you was born, cars already was invented.  Phones was already invented, electricity.  Everything was already here.  You didn't just come like the original first man that was born with no information.  You had a lot of information just off the strength of all of the people that came before you.  So your parents that raised you had a bunch of information off the strength of the ancestors.  If we keep learning, keep growing, keep connecting, and keep passing down the information, the better the next generation and the generation after that, and the better that we'll just keep continuing to be.  Spacious air, reflecting the way of life under the Florida sky.  Even the lobbies funnel in the great outdoors.  Chosen.  Chosen. ",
