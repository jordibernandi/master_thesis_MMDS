            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, this is Amy Cooper.  This is the woman that was in Central Park falsifying a phone call to NYPD against a Black man that just simply told her to put her dog on the leash, and not to mention there are signs all over the park telling you to keep your dog leashed.  Well, she's been fired from her job, y'all.  This came out in the New York Post.  May 26, 2020, Amy Cooper, Central Park dog walker at center of race storm is fired.  Yep.  So look like her job parted ways with her.  The white Central Park dog walker accused of launching a a racist tirade against a Black man has been fired.  Her former employer said Tuesday, following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved effective immediately.  We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton.  The investment firm tweeted, of worker Amy Cooper.  On social media, Cooper is being referred to as Karen.  The social media shorthand for white woman who called the cops on black neighbors over harmless incidents.  That's a Karen.  Cooper was caught on video a day earlier calling the cops on Christian Cooper, a black bird watcher.  when he dared her to put a leash on her dog as required in the park.  She snarled at Christian.  I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life, sparking widespread outrage from critics accusing her of racism.  Christian had just asked her to leash her pooch.  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.  So this is the latest follow-up.  Her job gave her the ax.  So I looked at another article.  She's crying, talking about her.  life is going down the drain.  Well, it didn't have to go down the drain.  All you had to do was follow the rules up at Central Park.  When that man told you to leash your dog, you should have just done it and went on your way.  But you caused this whole thing to happen in your life.  You caused it by making a fake call on a man that did absolutely nothing to you.  So.  The Amy Coopers of the world, they are the problem.  They are the problem.  And they're going to continue to be a problem in this society, ladies and gentlemen.  By next week, we'll see another one cropping up to call the police on someone Black.  It never ends.  It's a cycle that never ends.  It never goes away.  We have been around this BS for centuries now.  And you know why it continues?  Because they never get tired of it.  They never get sick of it.  So, ladies and gentlemen, do what you did to Amy Cooper here.  Keep filming it.  Keep uploading it.  Keep putting it on social media.  That's how you deal with the Amy Coopers of the world.  You know, it's been done many times before, you know, with Barbecue Becky and all of the others that have tried to pull this stunt over and over and over, making these remedial phone calls over a bunch of nothing.  So this is the price they're going to pay from now on.  As long as we got social media, you can best believe somebody's going to be uploading these stories and outing the Amy Coopers of the world.  You know, at one point in time, they were able to do this unchallenged for a long time.  But now that we have social media, it's not so easy for her and people like her anymore.  So there is an outlet, ladies and gentlemen, that can deal with these kind of people, and that is social media.  You know, one thing about social media, there's going to always be someone online that will recognize you.  And that's why her life is falling apart.  And, you know, the article also acknowledged that she no longer has that dog, the rescue dog.  I guess this group that do rescues for Cocker Spaniels now have that dog.  She does not have possession of the dog anymore.  But y'all, I'm glad this happened to her.  You know, I hope the brother, Christian Cooper, that this happened to, I hope he continues to go to the park.  And if he likes birdwatching, hey, that's not harming anybody.  He should continue to go out there and birdwatch.  And I hope this is the last incident that happens to him.  But we are in the land of, we're in this land.  So it's no guarantee that he won't have another encounter.  But I sure hope it doesn't happen to him.  He didn't deserve this at all.  But y'all, please tell me what you think.  You know, I'm just glad the cops didn't come out there and harm that man.  Because this thing could have easily have turned ugly.  Please leave your comment and subscribe.  Don't forget to hit on the notification bell.  And I'll see you on the next video.  Peace, family. ",
