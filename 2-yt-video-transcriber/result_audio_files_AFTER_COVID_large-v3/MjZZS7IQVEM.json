            "text": "Thank you.  Introductions are important.  It literally opens doors that you don't ever see open.  When you don't introduce yourself, you have a mental image of whoever that you see, depending on skin color, size, just a look.  And all of that vanishes once you get those introductions in.  All you have to do is say hello, and you'll fully understand more about a person once you understand about them.  Understanding is the main part of why we are divided.  We don't understand the people that are next to us.  We don't understand the systems that we are in.  We don't understand what people are thinking or what they do or what they bring.  So once we all know about our neighbors, once we all understand where our neighbors are coming from, what they're going through, then we're more open to being able to be helped by them and to help them.  So nothing's going to be possible unless we understand our neighbors and our community. ",
