            "text": "Thank you.  HaKadosh Baruch Hu, Baruch Hashem, Baruch Shemo, He has put us in a situation where we are all going to have to arrive at the conclusion that there's nothing else but Him.  There's nothing to rely on but Him.  There's nothing to do without Him.  And that's just the reality.  Every single person will get to that understanding at some point.  Hopefully it's before they die.  HaKadosh Baruch Hu is cleaning up the world in different ways in order to wake us up and He's giving us a clock that we're not so familiar with.  Chazal tell us that before Mashiach comes, Hashem is going to speed up time.  What does it mean?  speed up time?  Doesn't mean that there's going to be less than 24 hours a day, doesn't mean that the 60 seconds in your minute are going to go faster, but rather things in the world will move faster.  First, you're gonna have to put everyone in a circumstance that you're gonna have your last chance to do chuvah.  The point is that sometimes, It's not for us to understand everything that Hashem does.  We still have to do it.  We still have to listen to what He says.  We still have to accept everything that He does because we know it works.  So, the whole situation that's happening with Corona is forcing people to get closer to the understanding that we have right now.  That Hashem is the one running the show.  A thousand will fall from one side, ten thousand from the other side.  There's nothing going to come to you.  Even if I walk in the valley or the shadow of death, I will not be afraid because you're with me.  But you have to check yourself real good.  if you are 100% with the G-d.  If you don't observe Shabbat, be trembling from fear.  If you still sin with Zima, be extremely afraid.  If you're still lying and cheating and slandering, be trembling from fear.  You should be looking at your actions now with a magnifying glass.  If you do real Shabbat, Hashem will accept it.  When there will be a day that God will bring the world to a situation that all the foundations of life will collapse, everything will collapse, and the peace will be. ",
