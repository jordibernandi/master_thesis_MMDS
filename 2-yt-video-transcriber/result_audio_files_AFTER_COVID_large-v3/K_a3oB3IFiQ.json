            "text": "Okay YouTubers, this is the Angry Pepper.  So today's video is going to be Don't Panic.  And I'm going to elaborate on that a little more, obviously, because it's not what you think it is.  Now, the Don't Panicking is talking about certain situations guys that we mentioned here on youtube.  it's just a heads up.  we're not sitting here fearmonger and we're not trying to get you guys to panic we're trying to put certain things on your radar now.  yes some preppers do fearmonger.  some preppers do uh play the the holy.  this is going to happen right now.  card to get more views.  um it doesn't work and at least not anymore.  but When we mention certain things, like in my case the EMP or an asteroid, all it was was a heads up.  It was not going to say it's going to definitely happen.  It's going to say, it's saying that it might happen.  It could happen, right?  And the probability of these things happening are probably low, but nonetheless they're on your radars.  This is why we prep.  We prep for the implausible and the plausible things.  that's why preppers do what we do right and it's nice to know certain things.  so that's not taking you by surprise.  so don't let fear cloud your judgment and your decisions.  don't let it.  don't let fear turn into denial and then denying the things that could happen because then you're short-sighting yourself.  uh you're limiting your imagination on the things that can happen.  Because of fear, you might not consider a certain situation.  Or, denial.  Denial's a big one.  Denial's going to have you think that'll never happen.  Look at the Trade Center.  Politicians and, I guess, armed force generals would have never thought the Trade Center was going to happen before it did.  The United States' lack of imagination is why the Trade Center happened.  The lack of finding it possible for men to fly planes to the building or hijack a plane was going to happen.  Now, some of you are going to say it's an inside job and all this other bullshit.  It doesn't matter if it was an inside job.  At this point, I'm making a point.  My point is that whether it was an inside job or not, whether the terrorists did it or not, the fact that we didn't have the wherewithal and the imagination to see this coming, it's why it happened.  So as preppers, We try not to have those things surprise us.  It's why we prep.  Now, do you have to consider everything?  No, you absolutely don't.  Again, just put it on the radar or think about it.  That's not saying everything.  you hear, you go, you know what?  That's just going to happen.  Let me get ready for that.  Oh, that's going to happen.  Let me get ready for that.  That is not what you should be doing.  Yes, that is not what you should be doing.  You shouldn't be playing everything out, but you should be considering everything.  mostly everything and then looking at the probability of it happening and put it in on a on a checklist or scale if you will.  right and I get the bottom my scale is EMP attacks alien attacks and whatever zombies.  right and obviously that scale changes over time.  now EMP moved up because of China's capability.  But, I'm still not worried about it.  I'm a little more worried about what's going to happen in November because we don't know what the fuck's going to happen in November.  So, these are just heads up, guys.  That's all there are.  They're not fear mongering.  They're not to sit there and run to the prepper store and buy more shit.  All we do is pass on the information we read and we let you guys decide.  But, if you still want to break balls and leave comments and, you know, this is not going to happen, that's fine.  Don't be short-sightedness and don't be an asshole.  Take the information for what it's worth and then decipher it for yourself.  Don't sit there and start screaming at the YouTube screen that it's not gonna happen because again, two planes in a building were never gonna happen and it happened.  right we had a blackout in 03. people never thought that was going to happen again since 97 uh 77 sorry 1977. it was a blackout in august that caught everyone off guard.  why?  because they didn't see it coming.  when you're caught off guard is because you didn't see it coming.  that's all guys.  anyway this is the angry prepper.  thank you for watching.  you can like and subscribe to this channel.  you can also follow me on instagram facebook tumblr and twitter and other than that guys thank you for watching.
