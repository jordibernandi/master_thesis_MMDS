The media is desperately trying to get everyone to coronate Joe Biden as the next president.  But that's not how it works.  The media does not get to select our president.  The American people get to elect our president.  At this point, we've got numerous states that are very closely and vigorously contested, from Pennsylvania to Georgia to Arizona to New Mexico to Michigan to Wisconsin.  In all of those states, there are serious disputes about the vote totals.  And there's a legal process to resolve those disputes.  So at this point, we should allow the rule of law to operate.  We should allow the legal process to move forward.  And when that process is concluded, which it will be in a matter of weeks, We will know who prevailed in the elections.  But the fact that the big newsrooms in New York City want Donald Trump to lose, they don't get to decide that.  That's a question for the voters. ",

You are a constitutionalist, an expert on the Supreme Court.  How does this work in terms of the federal court system with these lawsuits pending? ",

            "text": "Well, we've seen multiple lawsuits already filed.  I expect there will be more lawsuits filed probably in each of those states that I mentioned and maybe more.  We may well see states cases filed both in state court and in federal court.  We will have trials on the matters that are contested.  And the purpose of a trial is to hear evidence.  We're hearing lots of allegations of a dead person voted.  We heard a report from one county in Michigan where the election software mistakenly counted 6,000 votes that were cast for Donald Trump.  It switched them to Joe Biden.  Now they apparently caught that.  But that same software is used in 47 counties throughout Michigan.  That needs to be examined to determine that there's not a problem counting the votes.  And the legal process is how you resolve those questions.  You know, one of the frustrating things, just as an American watching this, is you hear all these allegations of what's going on.  And it's hard to know what the facts are.  It's hard to know what the truth is.  We have a process for ascertaining the truth, which is that you can go and present evidence and test it in a court of law.  And then those appeals will go up both through the state appellate system and the federal appellate system.  And this case could very easily end up at the U.S.  Supreme Court.  You know, you mentioned Bush versus Gore, which which I was part of representing then Governor George W. Bush in the course of 36 days.  We had multiple cases throughout the state of Florida.  It went twice to the Florida Supreme Court.  It went twice to the U.S.  Supreme Court.  It took 36 days to resolve, and we got an answer.  I would expect a similar process to play out here, despite the media trying to tell everyone, give up, go home, we know who we want to win.  That's not how it works.  We need to follow the law, and that means allowing the legal process to play out. ",

            "text": "Yeah, that's right.  And if you look at the federal statute that governs the timing of presidential elections, it actually anticipates that there will be recounts, that there will be contested litigation.  If you look at the federal statute, December 12th is the date that the electors meet to vote.  December 8th is what's called the safe harbor deadline, which is that any contest election before that, if it's resolved, that resolution is presumed valid.  So the federal statute anticipates that there are going to be contests, there are going to be recounts.  And here's one dynamic that's important to understand.  Particularly in this COVID time, this has been a strange election.  On election day, Donald Trump won a large majority of the votes counted on election day.  That was true throughout the country.  With mail-in votes that were early votes, Joe Biden won a significant majority of the mail-in votes that came in.  Now, in several states, we're going to see a recount process.  A recount process, you look at those votes, you determine if they're accurate, if they're fraudulent, if they have sufficient signatures, if they meet the statutory standards for a legal vote.  What is interesting is historically mail-in votes are much more likely to be disqualified in a recount than in-person votes.  Generally in-person votes, they're conducted at the polling place and then they usually stand.  That means what we're likely to see in the next few weeks as the recounts go forward is that Joe Biden's very, very narrow majorities in some of these states Those totals are likely to drop if we see mail-in votes when they're examined being invalidated as contrary to the law.  So we could easily see, I believe President Trump still has a path to victory, and that path is to count every single legal vote that was cast, but also not to cast any votes that were fraudulently cast or illegally cast, and we have a legal process to determine what's legal and what isn't.

            "text": "Well, the next two months are extraordinarily important.  It looks like right now in the Senate, we're 52-48.  The media still hasn't called North Carolina Tom Tillis, but it looks like Tom has a significant lead and is going to win that race.  If that's the case, it means there are two Republican senators in a runoff in Georgia.  That runoff is going to occur on January 5th.  If the total is 52-48, if the Democrats win both of those seats, we have a Democratic Senate, assuming Joe Biden is president, Kamala Harris is vice president.  If the Democrats win Georgia, they have a majority.  If Republicans win, we have a majority.  I cannot overstate how important to the country those two seats are.  I'll be traveling to Georgia.  I've spoken with both David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two senators.  I've told them I'm all in.  Anything I can do to help, the answer is yes.  And the difference.  If we have a Chuck Schumer Senate and a Joe Biden presidency, they will pack the U.S.  Supreme Court.  They will end the filibuster.  They will pass massive tax increases.  They will pass the Green New Deal, destroying millions of jobs.  If we have a Republican Senate, none of that happens.  And so it really is.  By the way, if they have a Democratic Senate, they'll add two new states to the country.  to give them, they believe, four new Democratic senators.  So if you want to check, hopefully Joe Biden does not prevail at the end of this.  But if you want to check on Joe Biden, if you don't want to go over the edge to the socialist abyss, Georgia is the big enchilada.  I'm going to be there.  And everyone who wants to see some semblance of calm and reason and sanity, Georgia is the battle where that's going to be determined. ",
