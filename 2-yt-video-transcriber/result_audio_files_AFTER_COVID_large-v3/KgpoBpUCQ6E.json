We're talking about Charles Barkley here.  Charles Barkley, I liked him a long time ago, right?  I feel like Charles Barkley reminds me of my dad.  You know, just a logical dude that's just not buying into the BS.  You know, somebody that's not afraid to put his foot forward.  Somebody that's not afraid to stand up for values and really don't care what people think about him.  Charles Barkley do not care what people think about him.  I... He's one of the most genuine and one of my favorite athletes, or you could say retired athletes, Hall of Famers.  And I think Shaq is one of my favorites as well.  Now, some of them can sometimes be SJWs, but Charles Barkley in this video.  I took the words right out of my mouth.  And I just love how Terry Crews and all of these other celebrity types are coming out.  I mean, brothers who are coming out and speaking the truth to these lanes.  These lame black folks that always whining about some always complaining about something.  It has to get checked by the veterans.  Anyway, before I say too much more, I want you to watch the reason why I made this video.  Roll the film. ",

            "text": "Listen, Deshaun Jackson, Steven Jackson, Nick Cannon, Ice Cube.  Man, what the hell are y'all doing?  Like, y'all want racial equality.  We all do.  I don't understand how insulting another group Helps our cause.  And the only person called y'all on it was Kareem.  We can't allow Black people to be prejudiced also.  Especially if we're asking for white folks to respect us, give us economic opportunity, and things like that.  I'm so disappointed in these men.  But I don't understand how you beat hatred with more hatred.  That stuff should never come up in your vocabulary, and it should never come up in your heart.  I don't understand it.  I'm never going to accept it.  And I'm asking you guys.  I'm begging you guys, man.  You guys are famous.  You got a platform.  We got to do better, man.  I want allies.  I don't want to alienate anybody.  and to take shots at the Jewish race, white race, I just don't like it because it's not right.  And I had to call him on it because it's really been on my heart. ",

            "text": "These are the same questions that I have for these activists, these weekend activists, because they don't do nothing in our season, most of them.  All they do is take a knee and stuff when it's expedient politically or when it's expedient to make money or to get fame and celebrity or to say it because it's jazzy and it sounds good and it's hip, it's popular, all of the above.  But my question is, What have you accomplished?  Like, what are y'all doing at this point?  Because Martin Luther King already dealt with the civil rights thing.  I don't know if y'all know your history, but the Civil Rights Act was already passed, right?  Black people are equal under the law, equal under the Constitution.  So what are you complaining about?  Now, the thing is, is that black people are not going to be favored in the law.  They're not going to be favored in opportunities.  And I don't believe that they should.  I believe that black folks should be given an equal opportunity to succeed like everybody else.  There shouldn't be, you know, a ball and chain hanging on your on your ankles where you can't even, you know, progress in life.  I don't believe that that should be the case.  But in America in 2020, man, look.  It's a free country.  You can do whatever you want to do if you pursue it.  If you dream big, if you view yourself in a positive manner, you have positive self-esteem, you treat people with respect, you believe in God.  I mean, what can you not do?  But these celebrity types who feel that they have to overcompensate.  Let me explain to you.  Deshaun Jackson grew up in the hood.  Long Beach.  I believe in Long Beach.  I played football with Deshaun Jackson in high school.  U.S.  Army All-American game.  A little rough around the edges.  He grew up in the hood.  First time he make millions, he moved to the burbs with the wild people.  With the white people.  He moved off.  All these other dudes move off.  Colin Kaepernick raised by all white family.  All of these people.  Are in some way abandoning.  The hood.  And they feel bad about it.  So they try to overcompensate.  So now you got to be walker than thou.  What's his name?  Can't even think of his name.  Wilding out.  Cannon.  I can't think of his first name.  I think Joe Biden is rubbing off on my mind.  Nick Cannon.  Nick Cannon.  So Nick Cannon is the same way.  Nick Cannon was wealthy ever since he was a youngster doing Nickelodeon stuff.  And these people feel like they got to overcompensate.  And that's why they're coming out and being outrageous.  And people like Charles Barkley is like, what are y'all doing?  Like some of these elder people were around in the civil rights movement.  They were around when Jim Crow was in place.  Some of these people were around at the height of tension against black people in this country.  And now these little youngsters ain't read no history book, don't know nothing about nothing.  They out here complaining and trying to protest.  I would like to see them be more productive.  I wish that Charles Barkley would watch this video because I would love for Charles Barkley to work with me and I work with him.  So we can do things for the black community.  Charles Barkley live out here in the valley.  I live in the valley too.  And I probably live close to you.  So we probably can connect and do something special.  But anyway, if y'all know Charles Barkley, let him know I said that.  But I would like to see African-American people, Americans of African descent, and I fall into their little jargon, Americans of African descent come together and actually do something that's going to make a difference.  And there's no need to protest.  Everybody knows what the issues are.  At this point, everybody knows what the issues are, at least at this point.  Everybody want equality.  I don't think nobody in this country except the five racists standing in the corner with KKK hoodies on.  Everybody wants what's best for this country.  Everybody wants what's best for their neighbor.  And so it's enough talking.  It's time to do action.  And the biggest problem, and I made a video about it before, is fatherless homes.  How about we address that?  The abortion meal.  How about we address that?  Those are things that we can actually tangibly fix and we don't have to run around picking and protesting all day long.  It just makes no sense.  And I like that Charles Barkley and others are calling this out because it needs to be called out.  We need to actually do something about things that make a difference.  And I'll say this before I end.  The difference that you will make, the greatest difference that you will make starts in your own home.  Your own home.  You can do all that activism.  You can do all that yelling and cussing and screaming.  But until you can fix the things that you can control in your own home, you can't fix nothing else.  Y'all out here, home burning down, y'all trying to save the world.  What about your house first?  Are you taking care of your kids like you're supposed to?  Are you a good father?  Are you a good husband?  Are you a good wife?  Are you a good mother?  Those things I think are invaluable for you to be concentrating on.  And before you get out and want to fix Joe Schmo over here, you got an auntie that probably needs your help too.  You got an auntie that probably want you to come out and take her to counseling to get her off a crack.  But you're trying to do this for everybody else.  Anyway, my phone is telling me I'm doing the right thing.  But I'm just saying, I'm just saying, ladies and gentlemen.  But anyway, I could talk about this for hours and hours and hours, but I want you to watch the rest of my videos, comment in the comment section, like and subscribe to the channel, visit TatumReport.com.  I'll see you on the next one.  I'm out. ",
