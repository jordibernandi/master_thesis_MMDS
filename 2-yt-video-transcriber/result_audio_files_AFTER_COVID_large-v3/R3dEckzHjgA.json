            "text": "The other day someone I follow on Twitter tweeted something that has sort of stuck in my head ever since.  Unfortunately, I can't remember who it was.  I remember what they said, but I can't remember who it was, and I actually just went back through my likes hoping I could find it a few minutes ago before I stepped in front of the camera and I couldn't find it.  It might have been Wajahat Ali, but I'm not positive about that, but somebody said Do not make saving the souls of white racists central to your political activities, or central to your praxis, something like that.  That always seems to be the narrative \u2014 after Trump won in 2016, there were all of these think pieces in mainstream media outlets about Trump supporters.  and why did they vote for him?  and what's the appeal?  and, you know, there are lots of people who are Trump voters who don't think of themselves as racists, so what do we think about them?  What do we do about them?  How do we solve the puzzle of the supposedly non-racist?  Trump supporter, and it's so tedious, and it's such a waste of time, because turning Trump supporters away from the dark side, first of all, is probably a waste of energy, because most of them aren't going to turn, and it's not necessary.  We don't need to turn Trump supporters to support our candidates.  All we need to do is encourage people who are sympathetic to our side to vote more than they do, and when we win elections, use the representation, use the political power that we gain through that to take down all of these barriers that have been erected by Republicans for the most part to keep people from voting, so that the balance of political power in this country is more representative of how people actually feel and would actually vote if more people voted or more people were able to vote.  So we would not have a minority of Republicans controlling a majority of our political institutions, which is what we have now.  Now, I was thinking about that as I was driving home today from the battlefield.  As a lot of people who watch my stuff regularly know, I live relatively close by Antietam Battlefield, and it's a beautiful place to go and just spend hours walking.  There are hiking trails for miles and miles, and you can just walk in the woods and walk through fields.  It's a beautiful, wonderful place, and today was a gorgeous day.  It was a little cloudy, but the temperature was just perfect to go out and have a nice long fall walk and look at the autumn leaves and just \u2014 and it was wonderful.  And as I was driving back home, I passed a house that I pass every time.  It's this old white guy who lives there.  And he's often sitting on the porch when I pass by, and he was there today, and he was sitting on the porch by himself, kind of sunk into a deck chair, and he had on one of those caps that is from the military.  He wasn't close enough that I could read exactly what it said, but it looked like one of the caps that people wear when they served in the Navy, and it has the name of their ship on the front of it.  So, he was a veteran, and he's sitting there on his porch, and there were two flags flying on the eve of his porch, and one of them was an American flag and the other one was a Trump 2020 flag.  I looked at this old man as I drove by, and I looked at that flag and I thought of everything it represents, and I thought of the what must have gone through his mind, what rationalizations he must have undertaken when he bought that flag, when he flew that flag.  And there have been times when I have driven by his house when the flag hasn't been out, so it's not like he just put it up and left it there a few months ago.  He puts it up and takes it down.  So presumably he got up this morning and decided, yeah, I'm gonna put the Trump flag out again today.  So I had a moment of reflection and of contemplation and sort of musing about what goes through this old guy's mind when he's doing this.  And I felt a twinge of sympathy for him.  I really did.  I think about, I try to estimate his age, I assume from how old he looks that he served perhaps during the Vietnam era, maybe even earlier, maybe during the Korean conflict, I don't know, but around fifty or so years ago, let's say, is when he would have served, based on my guesstimate of how old he is.  Served in the military.  However long he was in, it obviously meant something to him, it's part of his identity, he wears the cap, he identifies himself outwardly as a veteran, and he chooses to publicly support Donald Trump, who, in addition to all the other ways that Donald Trump is a massive piece of shit, has shown nothing but the most superficial, patronizing, false form of respect for people in the American Armed Forces.  He reportedly called them losers and suckers.  He treats them even more like props than politicians usually do.  He's just shown nothing but disrespect and dismissal of American military service members since he has been president.  And here's this old guy putting up a Trump 2020 flag and wearing a veteran's ball cap.  What must go through his mind to reconcile that cognitive dissonance?  I thought about that, and I did.  I felt a twinge of sympathy for him, because I think about people like him \u2014 and if any of you are watching this video, which I doubt it, but if any of you who are like that old guy, if you're an old white man and you're a veteran and you're a Trump supporter, it's sad to me.  Because you don't realize or you're not willing to admit to yourself that you've been played.  That you've been played.  that Donald Trump doesn't care about you, and neither does the Republican Party, because Donald Trump or the Republican Party \u2014 like, Donald Trump did not change the Republican Party nearly so much as a lot of people seem to want to give him credit for.  All Donald Trump did was take a lot of stuff that the Republican Party had been trying to keep under wraps and, through his buffoonishness and incompetence and just open, uncontrolled vulgarity, put all that stuff out in the open.  So now we all have to see it, right?  So the Republicans can't hide it now.  They can't deny it.  We know that they don't have principles.  You know, we know that all they care about is consolidating their power.  We know all of that.  All the things they claim to care about, like small government and low taxes and blah, blah, blah, individual liberty, they don't actually care about any of that.  All they care about is maintaining their political power, and the way they maintain their political power is through white supremacy and misogyny and anti-Semitism and poor-shaming and continuing perpetuating wealth and income inequality in this country to keep the poor and the working class down at the bottom, keep them from getting any more than they have, and in fact continue taking more and more from them, while the people at the very top continue to take a larger and larger piece of the pie that they already have way too much of as it is.  And they have convinced people like that old guy on the porch with the Trump 2020 flag \u2014 they've convinced him that it's those brown people coming up from the South.  They're the reason that people like him don't have anything.  Or it's all those black people who don't want to work.  It's their fault that people like him don't have anything.  All these LGBTQ people, these gay people and trans people who want to upset the natural order, it's all their fault.  And what people like him don't realize is that the problems that afflict him, the reason why people like him don't have anything, it's not because of all those people I just mentioned.  It's not because of all those people he has been taught to be afraid of for decades.  It's because of the people who told him he should be afraid.  All the things you like, all the things you cherish, all the things you hold dear about your country and your culture and your way of life, they're all going to change and there won't be anything you can do about it.  because these people from the outside and these people from the bottom, these people who should be beneath you, these people who have enough already and how dare they ask for more from you, how dare they demand more from you who fought for this country, who worked for his whole life, how dare they demand more from you, they're going to rise up and they're going to take even more of what you have than they have already taken.  The Republicans have been feeding that bullshit to people like that old guy for as long as I've been alive, and for longer.  And when I think about that, for a moment, I feel a little sorry for him.  I have a twinge of sympathy for him.  But then I think about all the people who are suffering because of people like him, who have bought into the Republican message for the last forty or fifty years.  Because, yeah, he's been played.  But he allowed himself to be played.  And I think that's the detail that a lot of people overlook when they try to push this narrative about, oh, let's try to understand the Trump voters, let's try to be sympathetic to the Trump voters, let's try to unlock the mystery box at the center of all their hearts.  They allowed themselves to be played.  Because everybody has heard the same bullshit.  Not everybody has internalized it.  Not everybody has chosen not to question it.  And there comes a point when, yeah, maybe you've been played, but if you have bought into it so much that you're willing to sit on your front porch outside of your house weeks after Donald Trump lost the election and still proudly fly a Trump 2020 flag, as though that means anything good, as though that is anything to be proud of.  If you have bought in to that line of bullshit to that extent, I'm sorry.  That sympathy I feel for you doesn't last very long.  I think of those immigrants coming into this country over the southern border, who are coming here in many cases trying to escape economic devastation, natural disasters, political turmoil, violence in their home countries, who just want to come here to have a better life for themselves, for their families.  And they are vilified and demonized and attacked by people like the President of the United States.  I think about black Americans who have been protesting for years about something that is obviously wrong \u2014 police brutality, racist, institutionalized police brutality \u2014 that obviously exists and is obviously wrong.  And they \u2014 for daring to raise their voices about this, for daring to take a knee sometimes during the national anthem, for daring to block traffic every once in a while.  And because of that, they have been vilified.  They have been demonized.  All these marginalized groups, trans people who just want to be able to be themselves, who just want to be able to use the right fucking bathroom.  like the rest of us do, like cis people do every day, and don't give it a second thought.  For that, they have been demonized and vilified and subjected to higher percentages of violence and assault and discrimination, and have been marginalized as much as any group of people in this country.  And for what?  For wanting to be who they were born as, for wanting to be who they are.  They are vilified and demonized and harassed and abused.  And all those other marginalized people that I mentioned, who have been made the scapegoat to try and scare people like that old guy on the porch into supporting the Republican Party.  I think about all those people, all the people who are hurting, who are suffering, who are having to live with the injustice that that old guy supports and enables and seeks to continue.  I think about all that.  And my sympathy for that old guy on the porch just evaporates. ",
