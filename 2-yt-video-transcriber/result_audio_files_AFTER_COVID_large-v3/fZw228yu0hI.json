            "text": "This video gives a real behind-the-scenes view of how Trump behaves when he thinks the camera isn't on.  We see him bragging about threatening to sue the Better Business Bureau to get a better grade out of it for Trump University.  And it seems to show that when it comes to attacking a judge, his instinct is to go racist.  In the middle of the 2016 campaign, in December of 2015, Donald Trump, who was leading the presidential field on the Republican side, had to take a day off of campaigning to sit for a deposition in the Trump University fraud case.  At Trump University, we teach success.  Trump University was one of the many failed business ventures of Donald Trump.  It was set up to sell people the secrets of his success.  But it didn't work out that way for a lot of the people who took the courses.  And they sued.  They sued Donald Trump personally because he put out promotional material saying that he handpicked the instructors who knew how they could teach you how to be like him.  The video of the deposition was sealed.  Now, I was given a video from this deposition.  Not the deposition itself.  but from a break during that deposition when the camera was still rolling and Donald Trump and his lawyer, Dan Peptocelli, didn't realize they were being captured on video while they were talking about the case and revealing some very interesting nuggets.  Trump seems to brag about what happened with Trump University and the Better Business Bureau.  This is not a government agency.  It's a nonprofit group that gives ratings to businesses and charities.  It's like going to school.  You get an A to an F. And for a period of time, Trump University had a D or even a D minus.  Well, Trump tells Petruccelli, if you have a D, it's a kill.  It kills you.  And he did something about it.  At least he says he did something about it.  Now let's watch that bit together.  Okay, so he says the Better Business Bureau gave it an A. Then he lowers his voice and he says something we can't make out.  And he says, gave it a D. Adi, do you know what that is?  It's a kill for you.  And he goes on.  So now he's saying, and you can't make out all the words, but somebody called them up, presumably the Better Business Bureau, and said, and again, he's lowering his voice, I'm going to sue you.  An A?  They got an A. Got the D removed.  So here he goes back.  He's telling the story again.  Do you know we were rated D?  In this case, it seems as if Trump is bragging that they got a D to an A by threatening to sue the Better Business Bureau.  Now, I called the Better Business Bureau to figure out if this really happened, and they never got back to me.  But we do know from the campaign, the 2016 campaign, the Better Business Bureau did say that, yes, Donald Trump had a D or the Trump University had a D, and it did go up to an A, but it went up to an A in 2014 or 2015.  Trump University closed in 2010.  Trump was fixated on the judge handling the case and Trump kept trying to find a way to challenge or undermine him.  Okay, so that was hard to hear again, but now they're talking about the judge, Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who's handling the case.  And Trump asks his lawyer, is he an asshole or?  And we can't make out what's on the other side of the or.  And the lawyer says, latter, I think.  And then Trump says, you really think so?  You know him a little bit, don't you?  And let's hear what the lawyer says.  You know him a little bit, right? ",

            "text": "So what Trump says, right after the lawyer says, you know, he's the Democrat, that doesn't help.  Trump says, what about the Spanish thing?  So the question obviously is, what's the Spanish thing that he's talking about?  Now, you might remember, a few months later, he accused, you know, he said the judge was a Donald Trump hater, was after him because he had been born in Mexico.  His name is Gonzalo Curiel.  Wrong.  He was born in Indiana.  We're building a wall.  He's a Mexican.  We're building a wall between here and Mexico.  This seems to suggest that early on, Trump wanted to make an argument, maybe even in the courtroom, maybe in front of the judge, that the judge was biased against him.  During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump said again and again and again there was no merit to the cases against him and that he would never, ever settle.  I never settled. ",

That was a big coup for him because it didn't have the publicity of going to trial while he was a presidential candidate.  Several days after the election, he settled.  He settled for $25 million he had to pay to students who claimed they had been defrauded.  But under the terms of the settlement, he didn't have to acknowledge any wrongdoing.
