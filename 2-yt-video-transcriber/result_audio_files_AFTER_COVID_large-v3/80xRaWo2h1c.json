He didn't mean cognitive.  He meant covid.  No, he said cognitive.  I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that because, you know, you don't have those tests that often.  He said, I take them all the time.  And no, he meant covid.  But I think he was confused by the question and the words and everything else.  He didn't mean that because he hasn't taken any cognitive test because he couldn't pass one.

Okay, so he aced.  this cognitive impairment test that is supposed to diagnose things like Alzheimer's and things like that.
