            "text": "Take a walk.  I'm good, bro.  Take a walk.  I'm good.  You don't tell me what to do.  I didn't see you at Thanksgiving dinner.  You don't give me no rules.  You don't call no shots.  This seems to be taped off if you guys are gonna-.  I wasn't asking you, I wasn't asking you, officer.  I'm telling you what it is.  I was asking, one of you guys said, I'll leave.  If this is a crime scene, it would be taped.  No, we asked you to leave and I'm telling you to leave, sir.  And the threat of arrest?  I'm not telling you to arrest, why are you-.  Well, why would I leave?  Because I asked you to.  No, if you're telling me- Stay right there, don't stand in the middle of the alley.  Blimey, I'll walk in the middle of the alley if I want to.  That's what people do, this is a public easement.  That's why I get from this side of the street to the other side of the street.  Be nice.  I'm not asking a lot.  You were being nice and all of a sudden you just decided to get all crazy for no reason.  Oh, he called me up.  What'd you call me?  Ignorant.  Ignorant.  He kicked this off.  No, no, no, no.  Are you being ignorant?  You kicked it off.  I'm a grown man and all this stuff.  You don't give me orders.  No, you just contradict yourself.  You said if you told me to leave, I'll leave.  I'm the threat of arrest.  No, nobody's threatening you to arrest me.  Well, then I ain't going nowhere.  Now what?  You can't stay there.  Stay out of the alley and that's it.  Don't tell me what to do again.  I just did.  I'm not going to do it.  I'll go where I want.  You can't come into the alley.  I said blow me.  I'll go wild light.  What does that mean?  That means screw you, officer.  Really?  I'll do what I want.  Really?  Yes.  So you'll be belligerent and you can start swearing at me and all that stuff.  But I say you're acting like a nigger and you're going to treat me all right.  Absolutely.  You're an officer.  You cannot be a fucking offended, bro.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Did you not know that?  Oh, please.  You cannot be offended.  I'm not being offended.  All right.  Then I can do it.  It doesn't mean it's okay for you to do it.  Blow me.  You don't give me orders.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's a new generation, right?  It's a new day.  Then what?  They're going to say the officers were sitting there.  They didn't tell the gentleman to move, right?  They probably would.  However, I'm breaking the laws.  You're a law enforcement officer.  You are not psychic.  You don't get to determine what may happen.  Shit, it may be a car bomb in her car.  You gonna go check her car?  Say what?  It may be a bomb in her car.  Do you get to check her car?  No, I'm not saying.  You're saying what might happen.  Anything might happen.  so you get to tell me what to do.  I'm a grown.  no fucking chance.  I'm a grown man.  I got my own sense of discernment.  There you go.  That's what you told us to do to begin with.  You don't tell me what to do, sir.  Blow me again.  We're doing this and all this stuff.  Sorry, I don't go that way, sir.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  grown man in my neighborhood.  He's a grown man telling me, you can't stand there, move on.  No, you're contradicting yourself.  I'm sorry, you just cut me off.  You just cut me off.  You don't even know what I was about to say.  You can't tell him.  Okay, well, let me finish and I'll let you finish, yeah?  I have my own sense of discernment.  I would try to stay out of trouble on my own.  I thank you for your advice, but you're telling me what I have to do.  I'm a grown man.  I can't accept it.  Sir, you just told me a couple of minutes ago.  Yeah.  If you're asking me all the stuff, I'm a grown man, I can do whatever I want.  I told you to ask me.  Hold on, hold on.  Give me my time.  I'm sorry, I apologize.  Then you said, if you tell me to leave, I'll leave.  Isn't that what you said?  It is, yes.  So why are you contradicting yourself?  I was leaving.  Why are you making this a bigger issue than it is, man?  I think you are.  I was leaving and you decided it sounded like an order coming out of your mouth to me and I don't follow orders.  You said if I order you to leave, you leave.  Let me ask you this.  Didn't you just order me to stand here?  You can stand there if you want.  I just want you in the alley.  But you ordered me, yeah.  I don't want you in the alley.  Why is that, sir?  That's reasonable.  We can talk about that.  But you don't tell me I can't goddamn walk across this fucking sidewalk.  Because there's a reason.  You told me to stay here and don't move, yeah?  I didn't tell you don't move.  I'll start that.  Maybe I'm wrong, but my man agreed.  All right, maybe you didn't say that.  You said stay here?  I assumed I can't move.  There you go.  Assume.  Assume.  What did I teach you when you were a little kid, when you were younger?  Assume.  Be nice.  What is assume?  Be nice, bro.  Once you saw the authority come out, you felt like, oh, hell no.  You're damn right.  You're damn right.  Why?  Because I can't stand you cats in this hood.  It doesn't matter.  But see, we're not all the same.  What are you talking about?  I disagree.  I guarantee you something happened, right?  Why are you calling us?  I haven't called you.  So which one is it?  I haven't called you yet.  Which one is it?  Yet.  Yeah, I won't be calling you unless I can think of something that happened where I would.  I don't know if my neighbors show.  No, I call an ambulance.  I'm sure there's some reason.  I pay your taxes.  I should be able to.  But I haven't needed you in 40 years, bro.  You're being based on one bad.  One bad.  I'm not, sir.  Okay, listen.  Okay, maybe one or two bad conflicts or interactions you had with the police, right?  No, you're wrong.  Okay, many.  And then you based it off on everybody else.  Yes.  Come on.  That's not fair.  Is that fair?  What you're saying is not fair.  Be honest.  What you're saying is not fair.  No.  It's not fair, man.  You can't come at all of us like that all the time, man.  I disagree.  This is Chicago.  So, okay.  You can't stop.  I do not correct your own.  That's my issue.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's the thing is, man.  Yeah.  They always said, you know, it's like there's one bad apple in the bunch, man.  You can't judge us all like that.  I wouldn't do that.  I gave you guys years.  I gave you guys years of going through the system.  Hey, I've had bad experiences with people.  Yeah.  But I don't judge everybody the same way, man.  You keep thinking I'm simple and I would base it on one bad experience.  Go on your back up.  You can come blocking us off.  All right.  Hey, it was nice rapping with you.  That's what I'm saying.  A little bit more.  All right.  All right.  Could I have your name and your ID and stuff?  I can see it, Cabrera.  And that, too, you're supposed to ID.  You don't point to it.  That makes you look bad.  Come on, man.  It's Cabrera.  It's right there.  Come on, man.  You already said it.  When I pointed at it, you said it, so you stopped me from saying it.  Okay.  All right.  Then I apologize.  That's what I'm saying.  Do it.  And you, the cool cop, what's your name, bro?  Eagle.  What's up, man?  You're a cool cat.  They all should be like you, bro.  You're taking it easy out here.  You are.  I'm sure you're attacking me, all right?  All right.  You too.  All right.  Easy, baby.  Be careful now.  You as well.  I do not want nothing bad to happen to you.  I'll be careful to get behind that SWAT truck if something jumps up.  Thank you.  That's how we should have started and finished, man.  All right.  Love you, baby.  Be careful.  You too. ",
