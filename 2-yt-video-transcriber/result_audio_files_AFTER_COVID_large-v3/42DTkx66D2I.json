            "text": "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.  This is Catania Alvin.  On the 1st of December, I start to look at the various information coming in, and we've got this one that you can see, apparently put out by Conservative Beaver from Canada, and because there's been a news blockage, so former President Barack Obama arrested for espionage.  So here we... What I did read, there we are, there's Biden, was, let's come down here, more breaking news, Tony Blair charged for war crimes against Iraq.  So, take a deep breath, hold on to your hats, guys, the arrests have started.  I've been aware of these things for approximately 20 years, thereabouts, and certainly from the farmers' claims, where their farms were foreclosed on by the bankers.  And that was in the, I think the major ones were around the late 1970s, 1980s, but there's also a tremendous amount of information that the other day I came across.  But let's focus on this one, because this is just happening.  Now, Michael Jaco is reporting on it, and I'll put that link in the description box, but it's a little bit quiet, so I'm going to read it myself.  Okay, Barack Obama, a former president of the  U.S.,  was arrested on November 28, 2020. on a charge that he conspired a business partner of his, who also was a former CIA officer, to communicate classified information up to the top secret level to intelligence officials of the People's Republic of China.  Actually, that's CCP.  The criminal complaint containing the charge was unsealed this morning.  Now, what I'd go on to say is that I heard, I can't remember what source it was, that because Obama had pardoned all the criminals before he left office, what has been happening is President Trump has had to set up and discover the criminal acts since he came into office.  So this maybe is why when we that have been following this have seen so much criminality going on, but because Obama pardoned, according to the information I have, pardoned all those people, President Trump has had to catch them at their criminal acts again.  And of course, the 2020 election with all the fraud that was going on and Biden actually in a carton publicly announced they'd put together the biggest fraud.  I can't remember his words, but paraphrase them.  So they'd set up this huge fraud.  And that, of course, is being brought down by Giuliani and also Sidney Powell.  So to carry on with this one, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S.  Attorney for the District of Hawaii.  Kenji M. Price, Assistant Director for the FBI Counterintelligence Division, Alan E. Kohler,  Jr.,  and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Honolulu Field Office, L.S.  Miranda, made the announcement.  So we'll come on down here.  The judge has imposed a media blackout, but Canadian outlets like Conservative Beaver, and thank you Conservative Beaver, are not subject to those rules.  Other Canadian and Spanish language outlets have already reported on this development.  The trial of Chinese espionage is long and sadly strewn with former American intelligence officers. ",
