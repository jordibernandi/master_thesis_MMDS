            "text": "Good evening everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  I want to share with you about this weekend.  We have been watching.  There's so many signs pointing to this weekend.  I want to share something else with you.  I shared earlier about the first temple starting on the second day of Iyar, but I want to share with you about the first temple.  That began also on IR1.  We're going to see something very significant within both temples.  Both temples.  This is connecting us to the abomination of desolation because the Antichrist is connected to the temple.  We need to understand this and I believe this is a very important piece of information that I'm going to share with you.  Ayar 1. in 372 BCE, the foundation of the second holy temple was laid as recorded in the book of Ezra chapter 3 verse 8.  The grandson of a Jewish king, Zerubbabel, led the first band of Jews back from the Babylonian exile.  He helped clear away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the Second Temple, and the foundation was laid amid public excitement and rejoicing.  The Second Temple would become the center of Jewish worship for 420 years before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.  Today, the Western Wall is a remnant of the temple complex, the focal point of Jewish prayers for millennia.  Ayyar 1, the foundation of the second temple was laid.  The foundation of the first temple was laid on Ayyar 2.  Is there a coincidence that both temples began exactly within 24 hours of each other between the first day of Ayyar And the second day of Iyar, 2.  Chronicles 3, verses 1 and 2 tells us, Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  He began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.  Second day of the second month, the first temple foundation was laid.  First day of the second month, the foundation of the second temple was laid.  Do you see how important this is?  Now we need to remember that not only did both temples begin on Iyar 1 and Iyar 2, Both temples were destroyed on the same day also.  On the 9th of Av, Tisha B'Av.  It's the same day that both the first and the second temples were destroyed.  This is a very important piece of information.  Both temples... began and ended on the same day.  IR 1 and IR 2 is Basically within a 24 hour period.  both temples began at the same time the same day of the calendar.  so both holy temples began on IR 1 and 2 and Both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av.  What what a sign.  What a sign that there's a meaning to this, okay?  Now, if the first temple was laid on Ayar 1, and the second temple was laid on Ayar 2, what about the third temple, okay?  Would the third temple Remember that we are the temples of the Holy Spirit The.  the talk right now is the people waiting for the temple.  Okay, those who are waiting for the third temple.  This is an amazing sign that The first and second temples were both laid on the same day.  Now is there a third temple?  Are we the third temple?  Okay.  Let me share this information.  so we are watching Saturday April 25th which is the first of Iyar and we're watching Sunday the 26th of April the second of Iyar.  now I want you to see another detail here that I had never seen before but I want to just bring this to your attention Sunday April 26th Okay.  It's the second of Iyar.  It's the second month.  And look at the number of the day of the Omer.  The 17th day of the Omer.  And it's the second month.  Isn't that what the Lord said in the book of Genesis at the beginning of the flood?  On the 17th day of the second month.  See what I'm saying here?  Now, this is the day that the first temple began.  And it's the 73rd prophetic birthday of Israel by number of days.  Okay?  73 times 360 days per year, 26,280 days.  and from May 14, 1948, 26,280 days to April 26, 2020.  Now, let us read 2 Thessalonians 2.4, where it talks about the Antichrist sitting in the temple, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.  2 Thessalonians 2.4.  Now, this is the prophecy of the Antichrist sitting in the temple, proclaiming himself to be God.  See how the importance of the information of the temple is that both temples began on the same day, okay?  And what does it mean?  the antichrist sitting in the temple of God claiming to be God, showing himself that he is God?  What does this mean?  Is this a physical temple?  Remember Jesus said, destroy this temple and I will rebuild it in three days.  The third temple that was rebuilt in three days is his body, which is now his church.  And Paul repeats throughout the New Testament, that we are the temples of the Holy Spirit.  So what does this mean, the Antichrist sitting in the temple of God?  If this is not a physical temple, if it is our body, what does it mean?  Now, I want to share with you from Barack Obama's Twitter account today, today today.  okay i want to share with you.  i want you to see this visually before i show you this.  i want you to understand the antichrist sitting in the temple of god.  the temple is the body.  our body is a temple of the holy spirit.  okay so when the antichrist wants to put his mark or his vaccine in the believer's body, that is the destruction of the temple.  That is the ninth of Av.  That is the abomination of desolation.  So let me show you now the tweet from today of Barack Obama.  If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program.  It's not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs.  The case for ending the COVID-19 pandemic with mass testing.  The Antichrist sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be God.  Mass testing and mass vaccinations.  And here you have today Barack Obama's Twitter account showing the mark of the beast being put inside the body of of the believer, or of the human, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.  So for those of you who still think that the tribulation is seven years and there's going to be three and a half years of peace before the abomination of desolation, why are we seeing right now the beginning of the mark of the beast?  Mandatory global vaccinations of which... Just as Bill Gates said, you will not have a choice.  Okay?  So this picture is the representation of the Antichrist sitting in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.  Do not take the mark of the beast.  This is why I am so hopeful.  this is the weekend I am hopeful that this could be, or this is, the weekend of the rapture.  What more do we need to see?  They are wanting to chip and vaccinate every human on earth with a digital vaccine and with a tracking device.  And who is promoting it?  The same one I have been sharing since 2013.  Barack Obama is the Antichrist.  Okay.  So, I'm so ready to get out of here.  I'm so hopeful that this weekend is truly our time.  Okay.  I'm hopeful.  I'm not stating it has to be.  I'm not stating this definitely is.  I'm just saying I'm hopeful.  I'm sharing signs why this could be the time.  It's the birthday of Israel.  It's the same day that both temples began, and the Antichrist is connected to the third temple, okay, which is the body of Christ.  I hope you are ready for the return of Jesus Christ and I hope you've understood that the third temple is not a building we're waiting for to be built in Israel.  What a deception.  Jesus told us clearly destroy this temple and I will rebuild it in three days.  The third temple was built.  In three days.  And when Jesus Christ rose from the dead, his followers became the body of Christ.  The third temple.  We are the temples of the Holy Spirit.  Do not let the Antichrist sit as God in your temples.  I so pray you guys are blessed tonight.  I'm just really hoping that this is the time.  Okay.  I'm just really hopeful that this is the time that God has given us for the escape.  So I pray you're blessed tonight.  This is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  The sign of his coming revealed. ",
