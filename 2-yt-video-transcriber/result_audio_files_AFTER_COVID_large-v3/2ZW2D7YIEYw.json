            "text": "One sign says, saying all lives matter is like saying all organs matter when someone is having a heart attack.  All lives cannot matter until black lives matter.  That's actually a pretty good sign.  Way too many words for a picket sign.  But the other one, which is more artistic, If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.  Way to regurgitate an old bromide.  that isn't true.  Whether or not you know history, it resurfaces.  The third decade of the 21st century opens with global disease, national rage, localized tension erupts into hostility.  All of these mutually existing with an unfair yet justified inception and onset.  The cultural soil welcomes friction.  When there isn't fighting, class war, and disease, we are defying probability.  After driving home, I changed my mind about that second sign.  While it is unoriginal, I think it's quite poignant right now.  If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.  There are no more bystanders.  There are actors and carriers.  And if you're not acting, you're kindling.  I would like to say, as I careen towards homelessness and bankruptcy with ins... inordinate amount of stuff that isn't fit to store at the rescue mission.  I am downtown in bankrupt, shitty-ass.  Syracuse, New York.  Syracuse is considered Central New York.  It's far enough away from New York City that anybody who knows anything about journalism would probably assault you verbally for climbing here from New York.  It's about as New York as a barn fire.  It's such, it's intemperate, and I'm probably not gonna be able to light my cigarette.  I just lied to a nine year old who represents a social movement who's dressed very much like Sub-Zero.  Sub-Zero!  Okay, is there an organization you want to promote?  They're showing their support by blaring out voices of truth and justice in true Syracuse fashion.  I can hear bankrupt R&B music by somebody other than R. Kelly and somebody social distancing themselves from the great outdoors.  We are in Syracuse, New York.  And I gotta tell you, I changed all my online dating stuff.  Oh, come on, dude.  Do we have to have a fucking crane while I'm trying to talk?  Three inches away from a camera?  Your tax dollars hard at work.  supporting a fat man in a crane as if the Walmart people with four wheels and an overbite aren't enough picking out dildos in the adult vibrator section of Walmart.  But he is a minority and he has a job in these uncertain times and that counts.  And I am either brave or a bitch-ass white.  fuck it for saying such a thing.  So I guess the question is, what should happen?  What is an adequate response to the murder of George Floyd?  Definitely what's been happening and we've been seeing is the prosecution of all of the officers that were present during the murder of George Floyd and they all get what they deserve, especially for the police officer Chauvin.  We certainly hope that he's prosecuted and that he gets the prosecution that is coming for him.  It seems entirely adequate.  I would like to ask you, aside from just prosecuting the four police officers, the one who murdered George Floyd and the three who were present for it, what do you think a larger response would be that would be adequate for black lives matter and uh for this incident in particular?  what do you see is the necessary change in the system?  so i can speak for our organization and the demands that we have for the city of syracuse in response to george floyd's death and of police brutality that's been happening in America across the United States.  Our first and main demand is asking for police officers to be taken out of our city schools because they are not only aggressive, but they also pose a problem to our student union, our student bodies.  Our second is that the Citizens Review Board here in Syracuse is reformed so that they are able to address the problems that the citizens of Syracuse bring up to them and that they have the power to bring about the change that we ask for.  The officer that knelt on George Floyd's neck vigilante style to prove a point by a white person.  so it's not a racial issue.  We had a young African-American protester social distancing himself from Flavor Flav.  What should happen?  I think the three officers that were there should be checked in the camera to see if they were attentive to his irresponsiveness for four minutes straight.  Law enforcement institutionalizes this type of behavior.  Whether it's racist or not, they train these people to do this.  And it needs to be stopped.  And this extreme measure needs to take place.  And this corner cannot be fucking more loud.  And this city sucks.  And I'm moving to Los Angeles.  The problem with law enforcement, and I urge you to read the new Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander.  an Ivy League minority professor.  It's institutionalized racism.  They get African-Americans three strikes.  you're out, stop and frisk into the criminal justice system, destroy their right to suffrage.  alienate them from other members of their family, and I think we should react.  There's no overreaction.  They murdered somebody unnecessarily, and this is what happens.  Defund the police.  Let's see what happens.  Do you advocate violence?  Well, I don't necessarily always advocate violence.  I advocate retroactive response.  Meaning if somebody murders somebody else, there is a window of opportunity where you have the right to respond and... out of a justified emotion, especially when the murder was as unjustified.  Was this first degree murder?  Yes, it was.  Was it premeditated?  We allocated tax funds to train the police to squat and put their weight on somebody's neck and pin their esophagus to the ground.  It's premeditated.  It's first degree murder.  This has been Dan McCourt, your On The Spot correspondent.  I'll tell you something.  In the face of aggressive diversity, an African-American is never hard-pressed enough to find decent gospel music.  I'm suicidal and things are going well for me.  Just got my masters.  I just got a loan.  I just got a car out of a camera.  My YouTube channel is picking up speed.  Things are going well and I'm miserable.  So if it sucks for me and people are finding the time to protest in Syracuse, 366 days of a non-leap year, here's the state police as we are still funded, discriminating the types of vehicles socioeconomically.  I see a Dodge Saturn.  I think the last year they made them, that's probably a social worker.  They're fine.  But whoever they represent, we have a bunch of non-protesters who are wearing face masks.  outside, worried about their own lives and not the lives of innocent people counterfeiting small currency.  The police, the problem with the police is they show up and they escalate the situation.  They show up.  They say, what's happened here?  They say, he yelled at me.  They separate the parties.  And they get the woman to say, he hit me.  And then they don't find a bruise, but they try to get somebody to corroborate.  Like, I think he might have.  Then they arrest the guy.  I don't know which amendment it is.  I think it's either the fifth or sixth is the right of.  U.S.  citizens to unlawful search and seizure, a right that has not been upheld throughout the late 20th century into the 21st century.  And the reason this is important is because search and seizure always leads to contraband, which leads to incarceration, disproportionately, because as a culture, police are out of proportion with their rates of search and seizure of African Americans and culturally, socioeconomically impoverished African Americans are more likely to be carrying contraband.  So if you search them unlawfully, you get them into the criminal justice system unjustly.  And that's what I'm down here trying to say, well, my cameraman is trying to say a lot.  Correct.  Because he's worried about his own welfare, because he's a white man.  I'm not actually from this planet. ",
