            "text": "Thank you.  Why hello, my fellow apes!  Thanks for tuning in.  I'm Stephen Woodford, and here's a question for you.  What was the chance of me rolling exactly what I just have in the exact order that I just did?  This is a brief debunk of the argument from Improbability.  The argument from improbability is a teleological argument, that is, argument from design, in which proponents insist that since the probability of us emerging by random chance is infinitesimally unlikely, it is therefore reasonable to assume that we are the product of intelligent design.  The argument has existed since antiquity and was notably conveyed by Cicero, but its most prominent rendition is ironically credited to the atheist Fred Hoyle.  Whilst Hoyle accepted evolution by natural selection, he was a stark critic of abiogenesis \u2013 that is, the theory that life emerged from non-life.  Hoyle believed that the universe is in a never-ending steady state, and that single-celled organisms have always existed, being transferred throughout space via celestial debris.  As a critique of abiogenesis, Hoyle wrote that the chance that higher lifeforms might have emerged in this way is comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.  Proponents of the argument from Improbability, however, take Hoyle's argument against abiogenesis and apply it to macroscopic organisms such as ourselves, and in doing so give us the argument.  The argument is flawed for numerous reasons, but here we cover just three fallacies.  The most obvious flaw of the Argument from Improbability is that it commits a black and white fallacy.  It does this because it forces us to consider just two explanations for a phenomena without justifying why there are only two.  It's as erroneous as asserting that the pyramids were either built by random chance or by aliens, and then stating that since it's infinitesimally unlikely that they are the product of a tornado sweeping through the desert, they must have been built by aliens.  Now just as we are in this case ignoring all other possibilities, so too are the proponents of the argument from Improbability when they insist on either the black that is intelligent design, or the white that is random chance.  Now in order to make this flaw more obvious, let's contrast it against some other black and white fallacies.  Will you donate monthly to starving children, or do you hate children?  Damn, that's some vicious marketing right there.  What if I told you it's possible to donate and hate children?  Yeah, you didn't expect me to go there, did you?  I thought you were a good person, but I haven't seen you at church recently.  And I thought that you were a good person, but I haven't seen you being intelligible recently.  What defines a good person is their good deeds, not their intelligence and certainly not their geographic location.  The improbability of the human was either brought about by random chance or divine providence.  Yeah, let's take a voyage back to before Darwin set sail on his, for this is the only epoch in which teleological proponents wish to dine.  We today are very fortunate to know exactly how natural selection can and has produced creatures most wonderful and most beautiful, but even before Darwin's voyage, proponents were still guilty of the black and white fallacy, they just didn't know it.  Case in point, only insist on two possibilities if you can prove with certainty that there are only two possibilities.  Ignorance is no excuse to be close-minded.  The second fallacy I'd like to highlight is one that isn't committed by the argument itself, but is almost always committed by its proponents, and that is special pleading.  The argument is predicated on improbable entities being the product of either random chance or intelligent design, but proponents make an unjustified special exception to this rule for the intelligent creator itself.  That is, they don't assume that God is the product of either random chance or intelligent design, more often they assume that God has simply always existed.  But to borrow a few words from the astrophysicist Carl Sagan, if we say that God always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe always existed?  For the purpose of contrast, let's once again look at some other cases of special pleading.  With the exception of Jehovah's Witnesses, all babies should be vaccinated for protection.  If protecting babies is the goal, then a baby's parents' religious beliefs are irrelevant.  And I say a baby's parents' beliefs because, as Professor Richard Dawkins has made clear, a baby is no more a Jehovah's Witness than they are a Marxist or a Nihilist.  Faith is the excuse that people give for believing something when they don't have evidence, except for when they believe in God.  Oh, how suspiciously convenient.  God, in all his love, has created us so that we require extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims, and yet provides us not nearly sufficient evidence of his own existence.  This would be comical if the threat of eternal damnation wasn't in the balance.  All things improbable are either created by random chance or intelligent design, except for God.  Enter the ultimate Boeing 747, courtesy, again, of Dawkins.  If proponents of the argument from Improbability insist that us existing without a God is as implausible as a tornado sweeping through a junkyard and assembling a Boeing 747 from the materials therein, then we must insist that the chance of God existing without an even greater God is the ultimate Boeing 747, that truly does require the seemingly impossible to explain.  Case in point, we must not grant an exception to a rule without adequate justification.  A third fallacy, if known, is another which isn't explicitly committed by the argument itself, but is almost always implicitly committed by its proponents, and that is one of personal incredulity.  Evolution by natural selection has indisputably proven that extremely complex organisms can and have emerged through natural, unconscious processes, and thus we have a third option, which is supported by an insurmountable amount of evidence.  Hence, the argument from Improbability is akin to asserting that the pyramids were either created by random chance or by aliens, and simply ignoring the overwhelming evidence that they were built by humans on the account of their own incredulity, or to use a more common word, ignorance.  Let's take a look at some other examples of personal incredulity.  I didn't hallucinate, I know what I saw.  It was a ghost.  No one is questioning what you think you saw, we're questioning the veracity of your senses.  The science is clear, humans can and often do hallucinate and mistake things for other things, and considering that there's no empirical evidence for ghosts, Occam's Razor dictates that we assume it's more likely that you were mistaken or hallucinating.  Only sheeple believe we went to the moon.  In my experience, those who use the word sheeple tend to be goats.  They blindly believe, with all the same cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias as the sheep they berate, the narrative of their herd queen.  The evidence that we went to the moon is, if you'll forgive the pun, astronomical.  Get over it.  I didn't evolve from a chimp.  No, you didn't, but you do share a common ancestor with chimps, and it's ironically your chimp-like cognitive bias that's preventing you from earnestly researching and digesting the facts.  Or to put it another way, your personal incredulity of evolution is a product of evolution.  Case in point, ignorance is no excuse.  Let's get back to the question I asked you at the beginning and answer it obliquely.  Given a fair 6-sided die, what's the chance of rolling a 6?  Well, that's obvious, it's 1 in 6.  Okay, what about the chance of rolling two 6s in a row?  6 to the power of 2 is 36, and so the chance is 1 in 36.  The chance of rolling 3 sixes in a row is 1 in 216, 4 in a row is 1 in 1296, and 5 in a row is a whopping 1 in 7776.  But here's the thing, since each face of the die has an equal probability of coming up, 1 in 6, the chance of rolling any sequence, such as what we rolled at the beginning, is also 1 in 7776.  My point is that when it comes to the argument from Improbability, the man behind the curtain is the arbitrary significance that its proponents assign.  They emphasise, for instance, that you are the result of one sperm out of 100 million, but the brute fact is that whatever sperm won the race could argue all the same.  In 1913 at the Monte Carlo Casino, roulette gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning that since black had come up 25 times in a row, the chance of black coming up a 26th time is 1 in 67,108,863.  What they didn't realise, however, is that the chance of black coming up 25 times in a row and then red turning up is also 1 in 67,108,863.  They, just like the proponents of the argument from improbability, arbitrarily assign significance.  To conclude, in interest of being brief but efficient, we've here covered just one fallacy committed by the argument from improbability, and two fallacies very commonly committed by its proponents, but there are many other significant objections which we may or may not cover in the future.  To recap, the three fallacies are 1.  A black and white.  We must only insist on just two possibilities if we have proof of there being just two possibilities.  2.  Special pleading.  If we assume the rule that improbable things are either the result of random chance or intelligent design, then it follows that the intelligent designer is either the result of random chance or intelligent design.  3.  Personal incredulity.  Ignorance is no excuse to discount facts.  So that's that, my fellow apes, a brief debunk of the argument from Improbability.
