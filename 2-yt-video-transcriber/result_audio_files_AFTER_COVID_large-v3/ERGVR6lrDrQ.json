            "text": "hello all welcome to the truth show.  in this video I will be talking about the sudden tragic loss of John Legend and Chrissy Teigen's son.  Chrissy complained of having headaches prior so she did some Botox.  but it's not just that it's the activities that had taken place prior to the announcing of the pregnancy.  so let me ask you something was this just one big publicity scam?  or I don't know.  let's talk.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is a truth show.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  I mean, this is a truth show.  Now, before I dive deep, let's have a moment of silence in memory of all who lost a loved one or a child.  Let us stop what we're doing and have a moment of silence.  My condolences.  Now let's dive in.  As you know, John and Chrissy made the surprising pregnancy announcement when he released his music video for the song Wild in August.  Revealing and pregnant Tegan at the end.  Then a couple of months later, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend just suffered.  And on imaginable loss, their son had died.  Chrissy shared this devastating news Wednesday, yesterday, saying their son, who they named Jack, couldn't survive complications.  Chrissy said this, we are shocked in the end, the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before.  Teagan was recently hospitalized for severe bleeding during her pregnancy and revealed their baby boy was in the danger zone.  In her post, she said this, we were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed despite bags and bags of blood transfusions.  It just wasn't enough.  And I'm reading this via TMZ.  She also continued, we never decided on our baby's names until the last possible moment after they're born, just before we leave the hospital.  But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly, Jack.  So he will always be Jack to us.  Jack worked so hard to be a part of our family and he will be forever.  And she ended her post saying, we are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we've been able to experience.  But every day can't be full of sunshine.  On this darkest of days, we will grieve.  We will cry our eyes out.  But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it.  So sad.  Just devastating.  Whew.  Okay, Keisha, think, think, think, concentrate.  Time to get into the zone.  Time to get into the zone.  Don't let me get in my zone.  Don't let me get in my zone.  Don't let me get in my zone.  Okay, I'm in.  Now, there are some events surrounding this pregnancy that causes some concern.  For example, Chrissy had just been accused of supporting pedophile trafficking the late Jeffrey Epstein and the exploitation of young girls.  so much so she was trending on Twitter and was being cyber attacked and had to hire a professional team to help delete thousands and thousands I believe she said even in the millions of old tweets.  she even claimed to have inquired about a lawyer but got nowhere.  I know how that feels.  oh yes take a look.  Okay, first of all, let me just remind some of you, you should already be aware of this, Chrissy Teigen is a model, okay?  So, she may have came across Epstein's path at many times.  He did manage to con his way into controlling the CEO, Victoria's Secret's Wexner, entire estates and funding for the brand.  How, I don't know, but we can just say blackmail.  With that said, she may have met Epstein, just like Naomi Campbell and many other models, not giving her an excuse, just getting that out of the way, you see.  Now, the trashy model, I mean, the ex-model, I did a video about them.  you can click it at the end of this video.  it anyway.  it seems that someone has leaked that Tegan and John Legend name appeared on the flight plan.  they can be easily forged and edited.  I've debunked many photos of some of these sick claims.  oh and to learn more I think you should follow my girl at.  I am Patrice Meeks.  she knows more than me.  her link is below.  But that doesn't disregard her sick, disgusting tweets.  I mean, Chrissy isn't operating with a full deck or filter.  She says whatever comes to her mind.  But still, these tweets are sick.  with that said she ended up having to and i'm reading verbatim blockchain over one million people.  one million people today and i'm still flooded with sick psychopath.  she wrote.  so please spare me the just ignore me.  they're just trolls.  she said many others as well.  she went on a rampage.  okay then she went on to say this you know chrissy.  Anyhow, I'll do my best to stop entertaining them.  They have definitely been living for this and have zeroed in on only me.  Thank you everyone for helping me in and out of the DMs.  People I've never met have been so, so kind and huge thank you to journalists at Yashar, especially, whatever.  Anyway, she also called on Twitter.  to act on her harassment by trolls.  i have a family and a job.  there are too many to target.  she expressed.  i tried everything.  every lawyer says it will take many years and not change a blanking thing.  i completely agree with her with that.  i talked to lawyers as well about the whole youtube bias thing and they pretty much gave me the same answer because they will always be crazy.  she wasn't done.  listen they've.  They have no idea how hard this is to cope with.  They won't stop until I die.  I'm convinced of it.  And even then, they'll think of another conspiracy.  This is where Chrissy Teigen is in.  Then suddenly, we all hear she's pregnant with the announcement of John Legend's wild video.  Hence, biblical black horse, the sign of famine.  Yeah, money and balance, you know, the whole thing.  Read the Bible.  Then we all receive the tragic news of the loss of their son.  Now, here are my theories.  Now, with that said, if you look at the feed of Tegan's social media, she doesn't really show any sign of being pregnant prior to them announcing it, especially after showing how far along she claimed to have been.  But I could be wrong.  So is this another Kevin Hart crash situation?  I did a video about him as well.  You can check that out in my Patreon because YouTube flagged it.  Is this one big publicity stunt?  I hope not because that would be so low and so heartless.  But Tegan has been known to not operate with the full deck at times and she loves the attention.  She didn't want a baby in the first place and made it known from the activities and some of the things she'd done prior to this miscarriage.  For example, Her complaints of headaches and so on, which could be high blood pressure, stress, a number of reasons.  So what did she take?  She decided to take Botox.  Now you all know I looked it up because that's just how I am.  And here's what I found.  There is no clinical evidence suggesting that having Botox is unsafe in pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  But it is sensible practice not to inject a toxin in pregnant women just in case something happens to the baby.  meaning if you weren't sure you shouldn't inject inside you while you're pregnant okay yes it doesn't get in your bloodstream.  at least that's what they said but they still haven't really tested it.  but since no botox studies have been done on pregnant women there is no way to determine the safety of this popular wrinkle eradicator.  there have been animal studies that show in an association with fetal abnormalities but since you're not pregnant with the mouse it's hard to extrapolate from mice to humans so it's better to play it safe and slightly wrinkled than sorry.  I say this because Chrissy and John had just shared their support of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.  And we all know they don't like Trump.  They made that abundantly clear.  It's also been leaked that Teagan doctors are all Trump supporters.  I'm not pointing any fingers, but a detective will find it suspicious.  And was her miscarriage premeditated?  Stillborns, black kids, black people who oppose anti-Trump supporters, of course, are rumored to have been.  last but not least creasy was in need of a sacrifice.  hence the warning she was given with epstein's warning which often happens prior to the elite moving on to bigger problems for him.  so what did she do while pregnant?  she decided that she was still young and she can always have more kids.  so she may have decided to unwillingly deceive the media into believing that she just had a miscarriage that she herself allegedly caused.  but please don't take that.  these are only theories so please strike carefully.  okay I honestly have my concerns and the timing is strange and convenient.  oh I'm not the only one who thought this was an overshare.  here's what it's been shared on Daily Mail.  I have to say I did feel ",

I kind of question whether there are some things that you shouldn't have to share on social media. ",

            "text": "I slightly agree.  While the ladies were incredibly sympathetic to the sad news, their words led to impassioned tweets from viewers who said, it's not for you to comment on how a woman grieves a pregnancy loss.  And while every member of the loose women panel were sympathetic to her loss, some felt their opinions on the matter should not have been voiced and that Chrissy's openness would surely help others in similar position.  Nadia Swalia, may I mispronounce her last name, admitted that she can relate to Chrissy's decision to post the images on her Instagram page.  And she detailed suffering and miscarriage herself, but she did call Chrissy and John's news heartbreaking and sad.  This is what was said.  I wonder if they're in such shock that because they share stuff, it's on a wider level because it's social media.  I often think about that.  It must have really hard, I'm so ashamed to say, been hard for Mark, a.k.a.  John Legend, who may have done what was needed because he was in the same position even though he hadn't physically done it.  Because we all know that John don't like telling his business.  He's very private.  But you also have no control over what Chrissy do or say and often having to bail her ass out of hot water.  Hence the song he wrote.  all of me.  Pay attention to the lyrics.  So tell me, do you agree that this is an overshare for them and should they have kept it private?  Oh, and what theory do you believe of your own?  Tell me yours below.  Well, that's it.  Let me know your theories below.  On that note, don't forget to subscribe, share, and like.  Hit that bell so you get notifications when I do post my videos.  Love you all.  See y'all later.  Bye.
