And I predicted at that time that that was the end of the cycle and that the very next move.  Despite what Powell was saying and the hints that the Fed was giving.  Oh, yeah.  I said the next move would be a cut and that then they would return to quantitative easing.  Both of those predictions have come true. ",

Expanding the money supply, putting up money and buying government bonds is the definition of inflation.  The Fed has been inflating like crazy.  So to say that we see no danger of inflation, why did he think the stock market went up?  Why did the real estate market go up?  Why did the bond market go up?  Those are all prices.  What made those prices rise?  The inflation created by the central bank.  I mean, they did that on purpose.  So clearly, inflation is a threat.  And what's going to happen with inflation is the effects are going to move from the financial assets to the real economy, to food, to energy, to stuff like that.  But the Fed doesn't see that. ",

You want to buy foreign stocks that derive their revenues outside the United States so they don't earn U.S.  dollars, they earn foreign currencies, and then they can return those appreciated foreign currencies to you in dividends.  so you can avoid the inflation tax.  Forget about the payroll tax.  The real tax that's going to clobber every American is inflation. ",
