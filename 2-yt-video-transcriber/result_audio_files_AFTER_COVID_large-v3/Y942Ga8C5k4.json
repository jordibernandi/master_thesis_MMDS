And now because of YouTube, average people, and I mean that in the best sense of average, all of us can watch incredible thinkers give lectures.  You can watch Jordan Peterson lectures on YouTube for free and maybe get more information from that.  than you can from a semester that you're paying 25 grand for.  So talk about your foundation and sort of, can you just relate that a little bit to what you see happening with higher ed relative to, if you have a trade right now, it's like you are essential, again, in the best sense of essential, that's not, I'm not putting down the non-essential.  Maybe we can come up with a better word for it right now. ",

            "text": "Well, we should because everything has a season.  And part of the reason we're locked in this endless feedback loop of nonsense is because we're in love with cookie-cutter advice.  And so we dispense it with certainty.  And this is what politicians do to be elected.  They have to.  They have to say the thing that's going to resonate with the most people.  And so they wind up retrenching to bromides and platitudes and tropes.  That's what safety first is.  That's why Cuomo said, no measures.  no matter how draconian or drastic, could be deemed unjustifiable if it saves a single life.  Reasonable people, reasonable people know that's a lie.  Reasonable people know that when United Airlines or American Airlines says, here at blankety-blank airline, your safety is our priority.  We don't really believe that.  because seconds later they invite us to strap ourselves into an aluminum tube and defy gravity at 700 miles an hour, okay?  The truth is on the back of the ticket, rules of carriage.  Read that, and you'll hear the truth.  So we don't tell people the truth in a lot of ways, but when we lie to them now, the consequences are catastrophic.  So we've got to get past the cookie-cutter advice, the bromides and the platitudes.  If there's a silver lining, to answer your question, And I think there probably are a couple of them.  I don't know when we'll see them, but the way we learn surely has to be among them.  What we're doing right now, I mean, opinions will vary, obviously, but this is meaningful.  No, no.  No, no. ",

So you're doing a bunch of stuff right.  And two weeks ago, I watched on YouTube a lecture from MIT for free.  The same lecture that would have cost X thousands of dollars, right?  So I think when the dust settles, higher education is going to be revealed for the luxury brand that it truly is.  And when you take away all of the stuff that has nothing to do with learning or connecting, you're going to be left with a breathtakingly overpriced product.  And when you look at schools like Harvard, who didn't refund the tuitions for canceled classes, they didn't even refund the room and board.  Well, people are going to get used to this screen.  They already are.  But I think more and more are going to take deeper dives into more interesting ponds.  And they're going to find big thinkers with easily accessible ideas who are exponentially more interesting than professors.  And soon, I hope, our obscene love affair with credentialing is going to stop.  And we're going to pause in every imaginable way and look at what is essential.  not just in workers or in work, but in education, in food, in fun.  Everything is going to be forced through a different filter.  And I wish I were smarter to say specifically how that's going to come out.  But you never get to see how the sausage is truly made in our industry really or in any until the dust settles.  So we've got to get through it.  But I don't know that we're going to recognize the airline industry.  I don't know that we're going to recognize higher education, I don't know that we're gonna recognize exercise.  Everything is going to change.  Something's for the better, something's not.  But that level of uncertainty through all of it is the reason why everybody's walking around like an extra in The Walking Dead right now, waiting for clarity. ",

            "text": "I think so.  Look, I liken it to, I mean, every major transformative moment in your own life was probably preceded by something akin to a splat.  Sometimes things have to go splat, you know?  Sometimes in little ways, sometimes in big ways.  Um, this is a biggie.  This is the biggest thing I've ever lived through in terms of a, uh, you know, a transformational event.  Um, and so I, again, I, I don't know how it's going to shake out, but, but yeah, the machine just got shook.  We just, something grabbed us by the lapels with big muscular hands and shook really.  It's still shaking us and we're, We're trying to make sense of the shaking while our glasses are flying off of our head and the change is coming out of our butt.  We're still being shook.  But here's the thing.  I mentioned this, I think, to Glenn Beck the other day.  You know, the thing nobody is thinking about with regard to a premature opening versus an unnecessary sequestration is what happened to the Brits in 39, right?  I mean, Hitler dropped a lot of bombs on London every day, day after day, day after day after day.  For weeks, they stayed in, hunkered in the bunker, in the air raid shelters.  And then about three weeks into it, they started venturing out.  Bombs were still falling, right?  Started opening shops.  The bombs were still falling.  They opened the schools.  The bombs were still falling.  They were cleaning up.  Now, I'm not saying for a second that we ought to do anything premature.  But I'm saying that no matter what we do first is going to feel premature.  It doesn't matter what it is.  It's going to feel reckless.  It has to, by definition.  But the thing is, what really drove the Brits out of their bunkers?  I wasn't there.  I don't really know.  But from what I've read, my sense of it is they got bored.  They got bored of being terrorized.  And they just said, No.  And they had enough time, as horrific as it was, they had enough time to let it sit for a minute.  There's no way you're coming out after day two or five or eight or 12, 14, 20, right?  And so it's very personal.  And there's a herd mentality, just as surely as there's a herd immunity.  And the first ones to go will look reckless and crazy, but then others will follow.  And then pretty soon, you're a guy who gets behind the wheel of your car and drives across the state knowing full well that 40,000 people are going to die this year as a result of traffic fatalities.  But you get in, and you strap up, and look, you do a lot of things.  I mentioned Cuomo earlier, and I'll circle back.  If you really believed it, if you really believed it, then why not get together\u2014 Just get together with the governors and say, look, we're lowering the speed limits to 20.  We're all wearing helmets and we're outlawing left turns.  You could save 40,000 lives this year, but you won't do that because we have baked the risk into our lives.  And at base, we are a safety third country. ",
