Who set this fire?  It's the same arsonists who set fires all around the world.  Fires that have torched other nations, burned their prosperity down to embers.  That fire is the fire of socialism.  If you live in a large city in California, chances are there's a street that looks like this near your home.  Poverty, homelessness, drug use, desecration.  This is not what cities in America are supposed to look like.  I was born in Los Angeles in the 1980s.  This is not the state of my birth.  And I'm not the only one who doesn't recognize California today.  Millions of people have left this state in my lifetime.  What happened?  Why California?  California has been described as the crown jewel of America.  Songwriter Woody Guthrie called it a paradise, a garden of Eden.  Pioneers got in wagons and used ox to get here and traveled for years to set foot on her soil.  When they got here, it was worth the trip.  California was rich in natural beauty, rich in resources, rich in land.  A huge and powerful and prosperous state.  1850, statehood for California, and the boom was just getting started.  After statehood, California had a gold rush, then an oil boom, then an agricultural boom, then Hollywood and the entertainment industry boomed and changed the world forever.  Then, a tech boom.  California has not stopped growing.  In fact, doubling its population approximately every two decades.  Until now.  Since 2004, the state of California has seen 5 million people.  flee the state.  700,000 California residents left the state just last year.  This has led to one of the slowest growths of any state in America.  The growth rate for California for the last two decades has been less than 1%.  In Los Angeles County alone, they've seen a decline in births by 17%. ",
