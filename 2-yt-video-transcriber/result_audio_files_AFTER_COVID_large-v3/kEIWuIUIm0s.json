            "text": "Next news.  God gave me an anointed vagina.  Okay.  You only have to sleep with me and get healed of all your fertility problems.  Pastor Mrs.  Veronica.  two men okay so the news that was a weird headline but let's see what the summary is.  it's probably even weirder than the headline.  the summary is pastor mrs veronica who is the founder of life of faith and prosperity ministry where the hell is this?  let me actually figure out the location.  location is assaba nigeria of course.  um so as so in delta state has made a wonderful statement and offer a solution to men who have infertility problems.  She said during a church service she was offering a sermon and said that any man that makes love to her will be healed of his fertility problem.  She said that her mission on earth is to cure fertility problems in men and once any of them sleeps with her and her body fluid touches his cucumber, What the hell?  Such a man will be healed of his fertility problem.  She went ahead to give her phone number so that any man with such a problem can contact her for a session.  Okay, the weirdest thing, weirdest part of this is that she has no problem saying vagina, but she refers to people's dicks as cucumbers.  Okay, what?  This is so weird.  I don't even know.  So basically, she's a prostitute that is using religion as a marketing.  This is genius, by the way.  She's now becoming the most... Is she charging?  Obviously, she's charging.  No?  I'm actually what I'm really bothered by this because she said her bodily fuel.  Yeah, they're not using condoms.  Right.  This is unsafe sex, which is a real huge problem in sub-Saharan Africa with regards to not just regular sex.  TDs, but in particular HIV AIDS.  And a big issue there is getting people to use condoms.  They're working so hard on that.  Isn't she going to die soon if she's going to be like, hey, here's my number.  People come have sex with me without any... I don't know.  I'm inferring that from what she's saying about bodily fluids.  I mean, maybe she's letting them, maybe she's going to make them use condoms.  But the fact that she's saying that almost gives me the sense that the bodily fluids touching the cucumber sounds like there's no latex in between and that really is a problem because I mean there's people that have been working for years and years and years and years to make the idea of using condoms socially acceptable to people and I just I'm like, wow, lady.  All right.  But let me finish what I was saying, because I was saying that she's not going to survive this.  if she's saying like, hey, everybody, come have sex with me and let our body fluids touch.  So it takes one person in this whole mess to infect everybody else, right?  I mean, you are astronomically increasing your chances of STDs and I don't know what else.  And now, wait, does Corona passes through?  No, it doesn't.  But you're getting close.  I don't know.  You're muted, Rivka.  Oh, Corona's respiratory.  It's through... but droplets but still Yeah, but you're still close to whatever the body fluids part and sexually transmitted infections is just wow.  Yeah, I mean, even... Okay, so first I thought this woman is a genius, but now I'm thinking she's a moron and she's going to get herself sick.  Because at first I was like, okay, she's a con artist, but she's a very clever con artist, that she's being a prostitute, but she's using people's gullibility as a way to charge a lot of money for not just... People are like, oh my God, I get to sleep with a woman and I get to get healed at the same time.  she's gonna charge like 10 times more than your average prostitute right especially if it's like divine stuff associated with it.  so people are going to be lining up and she put a number out there like she's going to need 10 secretaries to be able to just go through those phone calls right?  So I don't know how many, like I think that phone number is completely useless right now.  How many people are going to be calling her?  It's publicly available.  So at first I was like, this is genius.  She could do this and have like 10 people behind the phone and taking people's numbers and charging them a lot of money.  But the part that makes her an idiot is the whole fluid part touching because you're going to be very rich for a very short amount of time if you're just having unprotected sex with so many people.  right unless it's a big lie and she's just gonna not really have sex with them and she does something gives them some kind of roofie and makes them think that they have sex.  and i don't know the whole thing's just weird.  but i do know that religiously there is a history in a lot of religions and um about sacred prostitutes and i know that shepom can probably talk about that in some Hindu traditions, and I know in a lot of pagan traditions, so the idea of having sex with someone to heal yourself or as a means to a god isn't necessarily bizarre in terms of religious traditions.  It's pretty common in a lot of religions, or it used to be, but I don't know.  In this day and age, if it's actually happening, it's unsafe.  You know, in Africa, what passes as Christianity is taking a whole bunch of different shapes.  I like to blame things on Christianity and Islam all the time, but a lot of these things You can't find any traces of these things in anywhere in the Bible like they have.  you know the Christians in Africa.  they have taken the art of Making it up as you go to a whole new level like these the.  I've seen things that people do in churches in Africa that like Each church is doing something so different from the other church and so bizarre.  It would be so entertaining if people weren't being harmed by it.  But it's just so bizarre.  Christianity in Africa, It's just weird, bizarre.  We have wish burning.  You have people just having funerals for people that are dead, but they all of a sudden climb out of their coffin.  And you have women that have divine vaginas.  You know, so many weird things.  We have people kicking pregnant women in their tummy, trying to heal them from I don't know what.  You have people touching themselves in weird places on the ground, on the church, crawling around the garden, all the people in the church just watching them.  I don't know, just Africa.  I don't know what's happening with Africa.  Are you describing Africa or are you describing Catholics in India?  Because Catholics in India have seen them.  do that.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, you're right.  Christians, Catholics in India also do take this.  But none of this is in the Bible.  I don't know why.  I think Muslims have a stronger leash on their people.  Mean there's a lot of weird things that Sufis and Shias do at the same time.  But I think Sunni Muslims Sunni scholars have a tighter leash on their people as what's actually?  no This is like.  do not do that.  This is not Islam.  I understand that we have exceptions like people like oh Islam is gay friendly, but those are fringe.  most most Sunni Muslims are are very, you're like, okay, no, this is Islamic, this is not Islamic.  We are very clear of where the boundaries are.  And they call it Beda, like innovation.  As soon as people try to come off a little bit, I think certainly the Islamic, certainly Islamic community has managed to done a better job at like, do not go off track with what's Quranic and Hadith more than Christians and Hindus.  Hindus never had that to begin with anyways.  But what, yeah.  I was going to say, I think that Islam and Judaism tend to be more similar in that there's a lot of rules that make the religion.  As long as you're following the rules and there's a box and you've got to stay within the box.  Whereas Christianity seems to be more friendly and more open to absorbing all kinds of other things and turning it into your version of Christianity.  Because if you look at Christianity as it's practiced in a lot of the Western world, it's some Christianity from the Levant and a lot of paganism.  And then you go to India and there's Catholicism there and a lot of whatever their version of it is.  And then in Africa and then in South America, there's a lot of indigenous... Native stuff mixed with it.  And in Central America, it just seems like as a as a ideology, it just seems more open to allowing other stuff to absorb into it.  or it absorbs other stuff and then it just.  merges into whatever whereas Judaism and Islam have these rules and this is it and you're either one of us or you're not.  yeah and that's what the really religious Jews say you know you're not one of us or you are one of us.  I mean there are exceptions but in general there's more.  yeah all in general yes.  So another godless atheist is saying, by the way, we lost Chopin.  I think there's a storm happening.  Another godless atheist saying, don't sub-Saharan Christians mix witchcraft, voodoo into their belief system.  Serious question.  Yes, they do.  And they also burn the witches.  So it's kind of like contradictory.  So they are very much anti-witchcraft and voodoo because they're Christian.  And they also let witchcraft and some elements of witchcraft and voodoo into their Christianity.  So it's kind of contradictory, but it's religion.  What do you expect?  The top comment is saying, I will believe in God no matter what is the result as long as it's free.  So it's referring to the headline.  The top comment is saying, if I get to sleep with this woman for free, then I will believe in God.  I would not sleep with somebody that is exchanging bodily fluid with so many people so I would not suggest it.  I do still want to know if this was she's charging because if she's like is she charging or I'm think she's charging or if she's not charging I have no idea what her motivation is behind all of this unless she's completely insane her motivation And she wants to heal people for God.  Sure.  Another person is saying, yeah, Chopin, you're back, but you need to mute yourself.  There's so much background noise.  Another person is saying, I had a vasectomy.  Does that count?  I don't know if she can heal your vasectomy.  Well, all right.  So Chopin, you're back.  Did you want to add anything?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I just don't know what happened.  You don't need to explain.  That's too much.  All right.  That's fine.  Thank you for joining us.  Subscribe to our channel.  Hit the bell thingy.  If you haven't, I don't know why.  What's holding you back?  Okay.
