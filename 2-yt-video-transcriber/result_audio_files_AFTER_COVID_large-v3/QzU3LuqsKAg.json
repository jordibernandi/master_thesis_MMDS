Your yellow hair still flies in spite of all that spray.  You're tight with Putin and with Kim Jong-un.  You said to drink the bleach you big buffoon.  Just leave the Oval and go back to your boardroom.  Pack up your Adderall, your grubby hands so small, they'll shove your stupid wall, we'll send a nice U-Haul.  Pack all your lies away, your flabby thighs away, your Russian spires away, you're moving out today.  Say bye-bye to the mall.  We won't miss you at all.  We'll send an extra car if you'll just take Bill Barr.  And here's our final pitch.  We've saved the trunk for Mitch.  You're moving out today.  Hi, Donnie. ",

I'm sure your family's going to miss you, but I won't and the rest of us won't either.  In fact, we'll be dancing in the streets.  But you do have something to look forward to.  I think they might feature your cell in Architectural Digest.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Well, nice talking to you.  Have a nice trip and enjoy Rikers.  Say hello to all the fellows for me.  Hasta la vista, chump.  If I lose to him, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I will never speak to you again.  You'll never see me again. ",
