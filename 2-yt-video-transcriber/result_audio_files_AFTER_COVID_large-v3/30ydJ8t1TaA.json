And I want to see what's going on.  Hi there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to see, I was just contacted by a gentleman over there that had kind of like undercover clothes on.  And I was basically, I just wanted to get some information from the public works facility over here.  I guess that's what that is, or the fleet maintenance.  And there's one of the crashed patrol cars down there I wanted to get a photo of.  This area is not marked off at all for being restricted access.  And I was kicked out of there.  And there was no state law or anything like that, so.  Would you like to speak with my deputy to see?  I guess, I don't know.  He said as a major that was a supervisor.  I'm just not going to give it.  Retaliation with him, I don't want anymore.  No problem.  If you just want to have a seat, it'll just be a minute.  Okay, thanks.  I was just trying to get a couple footage pieces of the car that's over there.  There's no restricted area over there.  It doesn't say restricted authorized personnel.  And it's right off the main public access.  One of the deputies kicked me out of there, said he's gonna trespass me for being over there. ",

They don't train you guys just to like fully just like suspect people all the time like planting bombs like that was.  that was a harsh statement because I definitely down here with it.
