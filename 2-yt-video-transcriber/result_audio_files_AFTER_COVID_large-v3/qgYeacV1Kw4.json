            "text": "Your petition violates our community guidelines.  This is the message we received after we set up a petition on Change.org to stop the Coronavirus Act 2020.  The petition reached 10,000 signatures in just over 24 hours, and then it was removed by Change.org without any notice.  We are aware that Bill Gates has donated heavily in the past to Change.org, and it was never our first choice, but when we logged a petition directly with Parliament, we were advised that the petition has to be reviewed before it goes live to the public, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be a matter of weeks, so we didn't want to risk missing the 26th of September date.  However, one of our supporters informed us, there is a petition already logged with Parliament that's been frozen on 11,000 signatures, and we have no connection with the person who created it whatsoever, but the cause is the same.  So we decided to help promote this petition so it reaches a minimum of 100,000 signatures by the 26th of September 2020 to be considered for debate in the House of Commons.  Remember, this act will be in place for six months on the 26th of September, so it will be up for review anyway.  If we can add to that petition with as many signatures as possible, this will increase the pressure on the government to review.  Now I know many of you don't believe in petitions.  To be frank, I never really did either.  But this war is psychological, and the success of this petition will have a very positive impact.  Think about the message it will send to the government, and most importantly, the rest of the population.  When they see large numbers taking action, and their friends and family talking about it, they will start to question things.  People are waking up every day, but unfortunately, we are still the minority.  I'd say in the UK, less than 30% of the population is aware that this is no longer about a pandemic.  Our best course of action is to awaken the rest of the population.  Turn that 30% into 70% and the pressure on the government will be immense.  To the point where they will have to back down.  This will allow us to organise and start taking control of our destiny.  The large numbers will also make it harder for them to censor us.  If we are at the point where they are removing petitions and the email service providers are blocking us from emailing the link to the government petition to our subscribers, means they realise the danger of people waking up and shattering the illusion.  This is a long war.  They have a plan, and it's been in motion for decades, and the reason their plan had been working so far is because they had us all duped.  Things are changing.  This time, my friends, they overdid it, and the more oppression they inflict on us, the more people will wake up and unite.  This is why educating others is the thing we should all be doing.  We need the numbers.  I know how hard it is nowadays.  We have all lost friends over this, and it takes real courage to speak the truth in these dark times.  We must contain them, be kind and patient, and they will come around.  The next few months are crucial.  We have a sure window of opportunity, and we can still change things for the better.  It is not too late. ",
