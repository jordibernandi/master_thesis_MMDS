Britain's gone through the longest squeeze in living standards since the Napoleonic War, the worst squeeze for workers of any OECD country, the industrialized countries.  And the United States, as you've written about, median male income is pretty similar to where it was in the 1970s.  How would you explain that phenomenon? ",

            "text": "Pretty simple.  We'll go back to 1980, 1981.  We got some instructions from Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman, speaking for strong, powerful forces in the society behind them.  The instructions were very straight.  Government is the problem, not the solution.  decisions have to be moved away from government, which is partially responsive to the general population, to the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies, the corporate sector, no accountability to the public.  There is no society, just individuals trying to make it for themselves somehow in the facing the ravages of the marketplace.  That's apart from the rich and powerful who are guaranteed substantial government subsidies and support.  For them government is the solution.  Then what's the responsibility and goal of these of the corporate sector.  that's now in the decision-making position.  Milton Friedman, economic guru of the movement, wrote a very influential article right at the time in which he said the responsibility of a corporation is solely self-enrichment, has no responsibilities to the workforce, the community.  True, the right of incorporating is a great gift from the community, but you don't have to pay anything back.  Just enrich yourself.  So, just to make sure that there's no defense against this, Reagan and Thatcher immediately opened their terms by moving to destroy the labor movement, the one source of defense against attack and bitter class war.  So put all this together.  Decisions are in the hands of the corporate sector.  There's no society, no people to kind of associate to defend yourselves, no labor movement.  The new masters, the old masters, but now given new authority, have only the duty of self-enrichment.  Does it take a genius to figure out what's going to happen?  Well, we now have 40 years of experience in what happened.  put some numbers on it.  The prestigious Rand Corporation in the United States just did a study of the transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class and their statistics.  That means the lower 90% in income in the population.  The transfer of wealth from them to the very top, not the top 10%, actually the top fraction of 10%.  Their estimate is $47 trillion over 40 years.  Vast underestimate.  Reagan opened the spigots and all sorts of other ways prior to the Reagan, Thatcher, neoliberal regime.  Tax havens, shell companies were illegal.  The Treasury Department enforced the law.  This was all opened up.  Then come tens of trillions of dollars of more money to the private sector.  that's running the show.  goes on in many ways.  For the general public it means stagnation, decline, obviously a decline in the functioning of democracy.  that's an immediate consequence of concentration of power.  For the top 0.1% of the population, it's been a bonanza.  Their share of wealth in the United States has doubled from 10% to 20% of total wealth for most of the population.  It's a matter of trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck.  benefits have declined.  The health system, which was never great, has declined in Britain, which once had the highest rated health system in the world.  There's been a major effort by the political class to convert it into the worst system in the developed world, namely the privatized US system, with double the costs of of other OECD countries and generally where South comes.  Well, this has been going on for 40 years.  That's not very surprising when you look at the principles.  led to disaffection, anger, resentment, contempt for political institutions, which is quite justified, very fertile terrain for demagogues of the Trump variety.  You have your own examples who can put themselves forth as your savior, somebody who really cares about you, going to save you from the attack on you by elites who have contempt for you.  Meanwhile, stabbing you in the back at every opportunity.  That's the world we're living in. ",
