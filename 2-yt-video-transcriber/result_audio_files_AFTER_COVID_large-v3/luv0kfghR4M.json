            "text": "Good evening, folks.  It's Diamond with the Oppenheimer Ranch Project and Magnetic Reversal News, bringing you a volcano update, Sangay Volcano, largest eruption since 1934, potentially exploding just seven hours ago in Ecuador.  Here you see the eruption ongoing about six hours ago.  Large village here, huge amounts of smoke, and there is a close-up of that.  Now, Sangay Volcano in Ecuador eruption, began 12 hours prior to the big boom with a 20,000 footer and some pyroclastic flows, the front of the volcano breaking down.  And then it was followed by a 40,000 foot blast.  Washington warned about volcanic ash plume that rose 40,000 feet altitude to flight level 400, moving 10 to 15 knots to the west.  Satellite footage, you could see that large plume here to the left and some stringers at this elevation.  We do have some video on the sat footage and all links will be below.  Now here you can see some evidence of the proximity to villages and people and infrastructure.  So that's the volcano erupting at a distance and this is from the backside.  Fantastic lightning in there.  Let's just go back and see that again.  Clearly you can tell that this is a major event on the amount of lava.  Now let's look at it from space.  And you can see that massive plume as it changes from night to day there.  Quite visible.  Big puffer.  And here we see it from the side.  Pretty amazing eruption.  And all the links to all these videos will be below, especially Lugiu1305.  Give him a thumbs up.  Subscribe to the channel.  Tell him Diamond sent you that this is some amazing footage.  Now, over at the Global Vulcanism Program, Sangay has an eruptive history.  If you just click on this tab down here, and you can see that it has erupted VEI 2 and 1 since 1934.  Minor eruptions, this might be VEI 3, in my opinion.  Largest eruption since August 8, 1934.  Here's another close-up of that pyroclastic flow as it turned to morning.  Just a beautiful shot.  Once again, Sangue in Ecuador erupting to 40,000 feet in spectacular fashion. ",
