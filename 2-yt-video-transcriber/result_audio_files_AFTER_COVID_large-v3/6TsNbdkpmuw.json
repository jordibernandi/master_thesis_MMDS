            "text": "The Bible is not necessary for salvation and the Bible is not necessary to have a robust relationship with God.  All them false teachers you gon' pay for.  And it's coming back soon, so just wait for it.  Better hope he have mercy, better pray for it.  John 3, 36, what you say, Lord?  Whoever don't obey the Son, get to rap for God.  Don't ask me questions, better start asking God.  Because you ain't mad at me, you really mad at God.  And I used to rap for the devil, now I rap for God.  You scared of persecution?  Yeah, I understand.  What happens when you do not guide in front of man?  Y'all running around questions about the LGBT.  But God said a man shouldn't be with another man.  He said it's an abomination.  The word is the word.  Forget the denomination.  I'm switching the word to avoid confrontation.  You're serving the world.  You ready for that conversation?  I listened to Christian hip hop.  I heard a lot of verses.  They talked about cause.  I ain't hear any Bible verses.  Y'all taking advantage of Christians.  No, they got to purchase.  I guess it's for the money.  I mean, I hope it's worth it.  Revelation 3.15, that's what this about.  You could have stayed with God, but you took a different route.  Instead of telling the truth, you kept it in your mouth.  You know what he do to Luke?  Warm, he spit him out.  Y'all always talk about the love, but forget the wrath.  The road to the kingdom is narrow, so you do the math.  The way is broad to the darker path.  The Bible tells you who's going, so we ain't got to ask.  1 Corinthians 6, 9 through 13.  The most important words are do not be deceived.  People will lie to you, but we know where that leads.  They're here in soft Christianity.  Y'all got what they need.  And all them false teachers you gon' pay for.  And it's coming back soon, so just wait for it.  You better hope he have mercy, better pray for it.  John 3, 36.  What you say, Lord?  You're high for high salvation to justify your sin.  And when I ask you for scripture, then you gon' lie again.  And now you angry.  Well, there go your plot again.  And they questioning your faith.  For you gon' hide again.  You saved with grace and faith.  But how does that work?  First off... Faith is dead without worse.  You did not God, you go to hell.  You don't get the purse.  And that's the truth.  You've been lied to.  I know it hurt.  James 2.26.  You know I got receipts.  Being a warrior for God isn't for the weak.  So I follow when these false teachers lying every week.  Leading the listeners to hell every time they preach.  This for Joel Osteen, T.D.  Jakes too.  And every TV preacher that's making bank too.  franklin and every christian rapper they threw.  the bible says i gotta expose the faith too.  you know i drop an iron.  let me break through.  let's talk about money start bringing up the faith too.  and you need to run from seeing if you gay too.  if not then you getting denied at the gate too.  and if i'm preaching hate to god put your hate too.  adulterers they gonna end up in the lake too.  and i got another message from the crate too.  i just want to see you better.  i don't hate you.  how do you feel about same-sex marriage?

I think that's been.  the big problem is that I think that as Christians, as the church, we've come across like the police.  You know, what comes across like, you know, where the spirit of it, it feels like the world police.  So, you know, whatever my lens is, it's always going to be Trying my best to see something through what I believe. ",
