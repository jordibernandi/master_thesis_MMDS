            "text": "KWT Slayin'.  Bye.  so uh i'm answering the calling from tail ministries to share my testimony on when i realized who the true hebrews are.  and i have to say that idea first entered my head in the middle of my search for truth about three and a half four years ago.  um i think it was just like.  Honestly, it was something very just random.  It was like a meme or something that a good friend of mine had posted or shared with me or texted me or something.  And it said something about, it was just like a paragraph explaining, you know, if the world really knew who the true Hebrews are, they would, you know, it would turn the whole reality upside down.  It was something along the lines.  But the idea, you know, just, I didn't really look into it.  I just saw the meme.  I was like, oh, that's interesting.  And, you know, just kind of idea just was planted in my head.  Just kind of festered there.  But I started reading the Bible.  One day, it was like three and a half years ago.  It was about three years ago when I first read the Bible, just started reading the Bible cover to cover.  said you know what forget what.  i don't want to hear what these pastors have to say i don't want to hear i don't want to get my the word from somebody.  i want to get the word directly from the source.  so i just started reading the bible Page one, all the way cover to cover.  It took me one year.  I think this was 2017, if I'm not mistaken, when I decided to do that.  So I read it cover to cover.  I still wasn't reading it with the encryption key, with the lens of who the true Hebrews are.  But it wasn't until the second time I went back, because then I would, as I was reading, I would do search on the internet and things and find what other people's interpretations are and see how I felt with that, things like that, or just doing research.  And then the second time, and that's when I stumbled on, it was somebody on YouTube explaining Breaking it down, there's another YouTube channel.  I didn't find Teal Ministries until about a year and a half ago.  But when I finally did read, we went back the second time about two years ago.  So the idea was in my head about four years ago.  So it was like 2016.  But I actually said, wait, let me give this a try.  Let me actually read the Bible with that knowledge and then when I did that all the pieces just fit together, you know, it was like wow, that's and it totally and it just made complete sense.  I mean even What's going on in the world and it's just one of like what?  Teal ministry says what I've heard brother Yokoba safe minister Yokoba say, um You need that encryption key it's it's and it not only does not only do I the Negroes meet the prophecies of Deuteronomy, but it's all the prophecies of the entire Bible.  And so that was just a real eye-opener for me, and it changed everything, because you can, everything unfolds like a story once you realize that, and the story makes complete sense.  And it was really, the fact that everything, I just started seeing how everything was fake.  I mean, we have fake everything.  We have a fake, the fake traditions.  I mean, you know, I realized all these European Christian traditions that everybody follows, Christmas, Easter, all that stuff.  You know, I threw all that stuff out the window years ago, well, about three or four years ago, because I first realized that those were false, and I realized the The people that are in the so-called Israel now, I knew they were false, you know, about three or four years ago.  I hadn't put all the pieces together, but I just realized everything was fake.  I didn't know what the real was yet, but I knew everything that had been presented to me was fake.  From the fake image of Jesus to the fake.  Sabbath, to the fake holidays that we celebrate, the fake calendar that everybody's on, the Gregorian calendar, the fake, let's say, image of Jesus, the fake Israel, the fake Jews, the fake, everything's fake that's presented to us, the fake cosmology, the fake.  So what's real?  That's what I want to know.  So what's the real?  What are we supposed to do?  If this is all the stuff that we're not supposed to... I mean, that's fake.  What's the real?  And so digging into the word and knowing who the true Hebrews are really helps unlock prophecy.  It's the only way to know the end time prophecies, knowing who the true people of Yahuwah are.  So knowing that... Well, first of all, I've always had a deep connection with the Israelites, with black people, the Negroes, the descendants of slaves, my whole life, really.  And having this knowledge just kind of like solidified that for me, like, wow, that actually now everything makes sense.  Like that's, I can, I can, I can, I understand now, a lot of things a lot better.  So, and knowing that is like, it doesn't change my relationship.  What's the word I'm looking for?  It doesn't change the way I act towards anybody.  It simply confirms what the connection.  i guess that that i already felt.  um because i mean that to me people because people might ask oh well if you're not israelite then why does it matter to you who is what's?  why is that so important?  well it's very important no matter who you are in the world.  because uh if those are if if a certain group of people is who who's important to yahoo it's a father yah to God, then it needs to be important to everybody else too.  They need to be important to everybody else too.  And then the fact that for so long, at least my entire life and so many generations before me, that's a group of people that has been treated quite the opposite of being God's people.  need to really think about that and see where that puts them individually.  I know me individually, I've always, I've always, I've always treated everybody with, ",
