            "text": "Rising brethren, this is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praise to the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  I was with Yehawah Shai, pray to the Most High, blesses this lesson this morning.  Because we're in knowledge and understanding of the events of the past.  In order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth.  So we get a much better understanding of things that are soon to come on the Earth.  Brethren, a subscriber sent me this video, and I want to say thank you for sending me this.  I found that the information was really good, and I'll leave the link to the video in the description box.  The subscriber told me to start at the last 10 minutes, and it was really good information talking about Babylon.  One thing that... you know, was really important was this rabbi here admits that America is the land of Joseph.  And if you look, this video is a couple of years old.  See, these people understand, they know the truth and they've been hiding it the entire time.  They've known it.  They've known the whole time that these are the lands of Joseph and everything revolves around the blessing that, um, the most high, gave our people, and then he switched it and gave it to the other nations.  Hold on.  So this is prophecy and the fact that they are admitting all these different things here at the end.  And they were not gonna admit this stuff to us.  We weren't gonna be able to put two and two together.  until the Most High awakened us, gave us the Holy Spirit, and she led us to this understanding.  Now, I understand through the scriptures, and if you start to read, that all of our blessings revolve around the land.  Whoever possesses the land gets the blessings of the Most High.  That goes back to Deuteronomy, 28, okay, when you actually read about the blessings, see, we've been concentrating on the curses in order to identify who we are.  But now we need to look at the blessings because there's a huge part of, huge significance of the lands and the blessings.  The Mosai took the blessing from us, which was the land, and gave it to the other nations.  And they've been using that to pretty much control the rest of the world.  through the blessings of our lands.  And this guy actually admits that right here.  That's why in Joel 2, we'll read a little bit of it.  It talks about how the Most High talks about the land and the people, how he has pity for the land and the people.  When you look at Deuteronomy 28, you look at all of the... Blessings that come from the land, having possession of the land.  When you go into the book of more, it talks about how he kept the whole nation separate from us.  As long as we follow the law, sessions, commandments, the most I would keep the other nations separate because then we would be able to enjoy our blessings and we would not be subject to captivity or anything else because we would be in charge of the land.  When the Messiah took away the land, he took away the blessings, and therefore we were allowed to go into captivity, be subjugated to these other nations, and everything else because we lost our land.  Now, just listening real quick, we're going to listen to a little snippet here of what this guy has to say, but look at how important the land is even to the United States today.  Everything that they are, everything they're allowed to do is all revolved around the land.  Now, he's talking about how.  you'll see how.  He's talking about how Babylon is America, yeah, and to a point it is, okay?  But to another point, it's the land of the Mosai, the land that he gave to Joseph.  So the whole thing about them destroying the land of Joseph, why would the Mosai destroy the land that he already gave to Joseph as an inheritance forever?  He's going to cleanse it, but see, they don't talk about the cleansing part of it.  It's either it's destroyed or it's enjoyed by the Gentiles.  That seems to be what it is.  It's okay for it to be destroyed, I mean used by the Gentiles, but then when the Gentiles are, it's going to be taken away from them, it's just going to be destroyed.  Let's take a look here. ",

He says a rumor will come in one year, and after that, in another year a rumor will come.  and violence in the land.  Ruler against ruler.  So again, we have more than one seat of authority, more than one house trying to take hold of the lawmen.  And what we see in the Zen times is the four horses fighting.  So we have team black-white, you might call the Genesis 35 alliance, the Judah-Joseph, the military-industrial complex.  And then you also have team red-green, which is Esau and Ishmael.  So Ishmael does not really care for Esau, but he is using him, and everyone effectively in the end is against the white horse. ",

It's already starting to happen.  Okay?  So, that goes with prophecy.  That, you know, cool.  Now, check this out.  You know, you don't hear about these Jewish people talking about this.  You don't hear Christians talking about this.  This is the kind of stuff that's hush-hush that they don't talk about.  Here we go. ",

            "text": "But notice there is going to be civil war in the lands.  And Yahweh is warning us to leave the United States before the civil war, if we can.  And a lot of people will say, Well, I would leave the United States, but the economy is so much better here.  The economy is so much more difficult in these other nations.  And one of the reasons that the economy is so much better in the United States is because, on the one hand, it is the homeland of Joseph.  On the other hand, it is the land of Babylon.  It is a military economic empire and it maintains a certain flow of goods and luxuries to itself through the subjugation of other nations worldwide. ",

            "text": "Okay.  That's huge right there.  So this guy's admitting that America, and I don't believe it's just America.  I believe, like I said, it's also probably Central America, right down in South America, you know, as well.  So these lands right here would definitely be, like I said, a blessed land.  And the people who have these lands in their possession are Maintain a certain amount of economic power, which then feeds into the military power, you know, and the things that they can actually do with the goods and services that they actually get from the land.  Now, let's read that real quick.  Let's go to Deuteronomy 28, 7 and 8.  Let's go there real quick.  Deuteronomy 28, 7 and 8.  This is all part of the blessings.  This is the blessings that the Most High gave to the Gentiles, okay?  The Lord shall cause thine enemies to rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face.  So America, you know, has been a powerhouse.  They've been a military powerhouse since they came over here and took over the lands and got the blessing, okay?  They shall come against thee one way and shall flee before thee seven ways.  This is why these Gentiles over here, these Edomites and these Gentiles over here have been so proud because they've had such a, you know, they're so quick to run and go get their guns and go blow stuff up.  You know, I said, because they've had the blessing.  They were given the blessing.  And that was all part of the blessings here in Deuteronomy 28.  Let's go to eight.  The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and And in all that thou settest thine hand unto, and he shall bless thee in the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  So they took our land, they took our labor, and it became an economic powerhouse.  That's all part of the blessings.  See, they don't admit that.  They don't tell the world that.  They try to make it sound like it's all they're doing because they're very prideful.  And now the Most High is taking away those blessings that he had already given them.  So they're admitting, they're talking about a civil war.  He actually later on talks about running to South America.  See, these people know.  They're talking about running all these different places.  You know, when they got here and got the blessings, but now they want to run.  Because they understand about the cleansing of the land.  Numbers 35 and 33.  So they don't want to have any part of that.  So therefore they run, they hide, they go under, you know, they go to their bunkers because they are totally aware of the cleansing of the land that the most high is about to do.  And they don't want any part of that.  And they didn't run.  Well, we'll talk about this in another video.  Okay.  So they leave it at that for that point right there.  So when I read yesterday in Jacob five about the, um, you know, the cleansing of the land as well, And then how, as we begin to grow, the multi takes the, he cleanses the branches that produce bad fruit.  Okay.  So right here, Jacob third, Jacob five, let's look at part of 64.  And if it so be that these last grass shall grow and bring forth a natural fruit, then shall you prepare the way for them that they may grow.  It's kind of like the Civil War right there.  And as they begin to grow, ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit.  And according to the strength of the good and the size thereof, and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be strong enough, okay, for the graft.  And the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.  66, for agree with me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard, wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the. ",
