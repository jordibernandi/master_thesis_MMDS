            "text": "When I read that a warrant of arrest has been issued for a sitting senator, I have to do a vlog on it.  Viva Frye, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber, day two of my week-long trial.  This is the Montreal courthouse right behind me, and for anyone who's interested, I am an impleted third party, what we call in French a mise en cause, so I don't really have to do much during this trial except for sit in the back, stay quiet, and look pretty, and I'm not good at two of those three things.  Now, someone recently tweeted at me that a sitting Virginia senator was arrested on felony charges of conspiracy to deface a monument in excess of $1,000 and I immediately knew I had to do a vlog on the subject.  I don't know who that guy was.  And where do we even begin with such a story?  Well, I guess we should begin from the beginning.  Now, some of you might remember that back in June, a group of protesters partially dismantled a statue of Robert E. Lee in Virginia, and in doing so, the statue fell on somebody's head and caused permanent life-altering injuries.  Apparently, the person has to learn how to walk and talk again.  Thank you.  And in the wake of that incident, the local police announced that warrants for arrests had been issued and they included some notable names.  Portsmouth police on Monday charged State Senator L. Louise Lucas with being part of a conspiracy to topple the city's Confederate monument, drawing outrage from political allies who called the accusations payback for the legislator's work to rein in police abuses.  Police Chief Angela Green announced felony warrants against Lucas and more than a dozen others, including three local public defenders and three representatives of the Portsmouth NAACP.  So, bearing in mind that I am starting from scratch on this entire incident, I don't know who L. Louise is, and I am a little suspicious when I hear of public officials getting arrested.  I had to look into it immediately, and this is who L. Louise Lucas is.  Lily Louise Boone Lucas, born January 22, 1944, is a member of the Senate of Virginia, representing the 18th district since 1992.  The floor leader of her Democratic colleagues in the state of Virginia, who won a majority of seats in the 2019 Virginia Senate election, Lucas succeeded Republican Stephen Newman as the president pro tempore of the Senate of Virginia.  She is the first woman and first African-American to hold that office.  Now, I vaguely knew of the incident because of the injury sustained by the person on whom the statue fell, but how does a senator get arrested for the incident?  Well, it turns out that she might have said a few things to the crowd to incite them to deface the monument, and she might have actually told the police to stand down at the incident. ",

I didn't get a response, but in fishing around on the internet, I actually found a copy of the warrant of arrest and the probable cause summary of the statement of facts, and it is fascinating to read.  Alright, and it's getting a little hot in the car, so I gotta roll down the windows all the way, so I do not return to court drenched in sweat.  Warrant of arrest, felony.  To any authorized officer you are hereby commanded in the name of the Commonwealth of Virginia forthwith to arrest and bring the accused before this court to answer the charge that the accused within this city or county on or about 06-10-2020 did unlawfully and feloniously in violation of section 18.2-22 backslash 18.2-137 Code of Virginia conspire to intentionally destroy, deface, or damage property belonging to another with the value of or damage to such property being $1,000 or more.  The accused is Lily Louise Lucas, but I'm not going to show you that part of the arrest warrant because it has her address, but you'll just have to take my word for it, or I'll just show you her name and cut out everything else around it.  And the second charge reads as follows.  Did unlawfully and feloniously in violation of section 18.2-137 backslash 18.2-18 as a principle in the second degree intentionally destroy, deface, or damage property belonging to another with the value of or damage to such property being $1,000 or more.  Now there's too much wind in here, I'm gonna close one window and leave the other ones open.  These are the perils and pitfalls of having a vehicle for a work office.  Okay, here we go.  It is the probable cause.  summary statement of facts where things get really interesting and start to make a little more sense as relates to these charges.  On June 10th, 2020, Portsmouth NAACP leaders James Boyd and Louise Gibbs were arrested for trespassing on the Confederate monument, the monument.  located at 400 Court Street in the city of Portsmouth, Virginia.  Following their arrest and subsequent release, Boyd and Gibbs returned to the monument where they met with Portsmouth School Board member Lakeisha Atkinson, Lakeisha Hicks, a.k.a.  Onyx Kearney, Dana Worthington, Kimberly Wimbish, Amira Bethia, and others yet to be identified.  Senator L. Louise Lucas arrived a short time later and met briefly with the group at the corner of Court Street and High Street.  Senator Lucas then approached a group of police officers and told them she just talked to the mayor and city manager and said, quote, they are going to put some paint on this thing and y'all can't arrest them, end quote, while gesturing towards the monument.  Lucas continued by saying, quote, they're going to do it and you can't stop them.  They got a right.  Go ahead, end quote.  PPD Sergeant Johnson informed Senator Lucas that she could not tell people they could do that.  Lucas replied, quote, I'm not telling them to do anything.  I'm telling you, you can't arrest them, end quote. ",

Protesters toppled a statue which landed on a man causing serious injuries.  Tim Anderson says Lucas incited a riot when she allegedly told protesters they could trespass at the monument and when he says she told police officers to stand down.  If Anderson can collect the names of 4,700 registered voters in the 18th senatorial district, he can proceed to circuit court, where a judge will decide if Senator Lucas incited a riot and misused her office.

Sure as sugar, we're going to do it.  And as the meme goes... But wait!  There's more!  Hang on to your seat, baby!  Cause this one's a screamer!  And it gets even worse.  Once other elected officials arrived, Vice Mayor Lucas Burke addressed the group and tried to explain the process the city council was taking to have the monument legally and safely removed after July 1st, when the state law was slated to change to make it legal to do so.  Vice Mayor Lucas Burke also explained that the monument was city property.  Senator Lucas then proceeded to announce loudly, quote, the city has had three years to cover it, end quote.  And gesturing to the group gathered yelled, quote, let them cover it, end quote.  The group gathered with her were shaking up cans of spray paint and shouting, quote, cover it, end quote.  Someone in the group yelled, quote, y'all heard her, go cover it, end quote.  At which time people began climbing the protective fence, which was posted with a no trespassing sign, and began spray painting the monument.  While the monument was being painted by a number of people, Senator Lucas asked Boyd if they had enough, quote, cover, end quote.  And he said they were going to buy some more, end quote.  We are going to put Black Lives Matter probably around the front of it, end quote.  Senator Lucas told him, quote, I just wanted to come down here and make sure nobody else got arrested, end quote.  Ma'am, you can't tell them to do that.  I'm telling you to call Dr.  Pat.  I'm not telling them to do anything.  I'm telling you, you can't arrest them.  Call Dr.  Pat.  Let them on the side.

            "text": "It's a city problem.  Senator, this.  Over the next several hours, dozens more people arrived and spray-painted the monument.  They also dumped buckets of paint on it and defaced the bronze statues with hammers and other objects.  They eventually broke pieces of the statues off and ultimately pulled one of them down, which struck a man and caused a life-threatening injury.  The rest of the probable cause summary goes on to describe the monument.  Apparently it was built in 1876 from granite and four bronze statues, and apparently it was defaced once before in 2005, and that defacing caused something like $43,000 in damage.  According to this probable cause summary, if the damage itself is not irreparable, it is going to cost well over $100,000 to repair the monument.  And the probable cause summary ends with the following observations.  I was present June 10th, 2020, and observed most of the incident firsthand, and at least one witness provided information to the Portsmouth Police Department.  I also reviewed multiple police body cameras and viewed numerous videos of the event posted to social media.  Based upon the investigation by the PPD, warrants are being sought for the following individuals.  Lucas's arrest is being politicized on the basis of identity politics.  Others are claiming that this is retribution by the police force against Lucas for some of her policies.  as relates to the police force.  I am only left wondering if the allegations in the probable cause summary warrant an arrest.  Pun intended.  Based on the allegations in the probable cause summary, there certainly is more to the story than what I was getting from the articles on the subject, but is there enough to warrant the arrest of a sitting senator as a result of what she did?  Or is this in fact political or policy payback by the police department against Lucas?  Time will tell and I will be following this to see where it goes.  At the very least, at least you know a little bit more than the headlines, or now you know of the story if you had not heard of it before, and it is, in fact, a fascinating story, and if you like my videos and you like my content, please be sure to like, share, subscribe, hit the notification bell, and drop a comment in the comment section below because it feeds the algorithm.
