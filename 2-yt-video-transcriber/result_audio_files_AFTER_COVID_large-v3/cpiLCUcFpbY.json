Rome belongs to the people.  A city for the people.  An empire.  Roman scum!  I want your Plataeus.  Yeah!  Punchers!  Down!  Down!  Keep down!  What are you waiting for?  The audience is getting bored!  Oh, God.  I'm going to brace you!  Nothing!  Die, Robin!  Father!  This way!  They're coming, Marius.  They're hunting us.  Now, warrior, kill him!  Yah!  Let's go.  We can't go this way, Marius.  You'll have to go back and lower that bridge.  Lower the bridge, Marius.  Help me across.  That's it, son.  Keep going.  To the forum, Marius.  Don't stop for anything.  What the?  Come fight me!  Let's see what this son of a bitch can do!  Run!  He'll be dead soon, you know!  Your father!  Dead!  With me.  We haven't got much time.  Time for what?  Father!  I'm gonna kill you all!  Gah!  This is Rome, you... Spill your... Thirsty for money?  Don't let them leave the forum!  This ends here!  Squire, I could not have managed it.  You must save Rome.  Save it from... Save it from them.  You bastards!  You murdering barbarian bastards!  I will do as you bid, father.  I will save Rome from them.  I'll spill their blood.  I'm Commander Vitalian of the Fourteenth.  I fought with your father.  If it's blood you want, I promise I will give you as much as you can handle.  You were the second, aren't you?  Yes, sir.  Not anymore.  Welcome to the Fourteenth, lad.  My father taught me that we are fated by the gods, but that we alone choose our path.  You were fated to be an emperor, and I, a soldier.  My father's sense of honor drove him to follow a path that served the people.  But what drove us to take the paths we did?  What made us the men that we are today?  My story begins some ten years past. ",
