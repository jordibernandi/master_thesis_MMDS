            "text": "I've got an online church member asking me a question, you know, what are the horses?  Many people think that the horses of the apocalypse represent the tribulation.  I believe they represent the birth pangs.  I believe they represent the pre-tribulation signs.  So I've explained that many, many times in the 22 future events of Revelation.  So let's just dive right into it.  Very quick answer.  What could the white horse be?  If we're already in the black horse, what could the white horse be?  The white horse represents a deceiver, someone who is deceiving the world in the name of peace and got a Nobel Peace Prize.  That seems to me to point to Obama, Barack Hussein, Obama.  the man who got a Nobel Peace Prize for nothing and dropped more bombs on the Middle East than even George W. Bush.  Then the red horse is Syria.  Remember Obama said the red line, I draw the red line on Syria, and God seems to draw a red line on Syria.  The destruction of Damascus in Isaiah 17 matches the red horse of Revelation 6.  After that comes the black horse, which is hyperinflation, scarcity, and then the green horse, which you know it's green in Greek because the word is chloros, and chloros is the root word for chlorophyll.  It's the chemical that makes plants green.  So there's no question chloros should have been translated green.  But in your Bible, it's probably pale or something like that.  That doesn't matter.  It's fine.  But what's interesting to me is, did you notice that during the coronavirus crisis, the drug that now everybody knows is hydroxychloroquine?  and that's a compound from chloroquine.  Chloroquine sounds like Latin for green horse because chloros is green and equine is horse.  Now, maybe that's not perfect etymology because drugs are just made up words, right?  They're just made up words.  And it's very hard to prove the etymology of a word, but God will use these play on words.  He will use things that sound like this.  This sounds like that.  He did it to Jeremiah in chapter 1, verse 11.  He asked Jeremiah, what do you see?  Jeremiah said, I see a sekad.  That's the Hebrew for almond tree.  And then God says, very well, you've done very well because I will saked my word.  I will watch over my word.  Now you totally would miss that in English, but it was a play on word between saked and sekad.  One means almond, one means watch.  But God says, it sounds similar and I'm playing on the words.  Well, chloroquine sounds a lot like green horse.  So are we in the black horse stage of the seal proceeding to the green horse?  It looks like it's entirely possible.  And if it's not, then it certainly is a setup.  It certainly is conditioning the world to accept this kind of global control, global lockdown, loss of freedom, a great transfer of wealth and power to the elites.  Because of a green something.  Green something.  And people are wanting to take this hydroxychloroquine.  I don't want to take it.  I believe that, in fact, it's a medical thing.  It's a scientific thing.  I believe my immune system is the most important defense against any virus.  I don't know if you realize a virus is not quite a living entity.  It doesn't eat.  So when you take a vaccine, it's not like you're putting poison to kill the virus.  All you're doing is stimulating, you're stimulating your own immune system with a more benign version of the virus.  You're actually getting a part of the virus so that the body begins to recognize that, oh, this is the virus and I should attack that.  That's all a vaccine does.  So wouldn't it be better if I just support my immune system and get it to do what God designed it to do?  Then I'll be perfectly fine.  And you see a lot of people who supposedly got infected with the coronavirus and they have recovered.  So that is the best thing that you can do.  Chloroquine really seems to me to fit the green horse.  But time will tell whether we're actually quite there yet.  I think the black horse is very soon a market crash, some kind of economic turmoil, which is already happening because of the lockdown.  Another term that everyone is hearing about but may not be understanding fully is quarantine.  Quarantine, it means enforced isolation.  That's how we use it today.  But actually, it originated during the Black Death.  The plague that killed one out of three Europeans.  Can you imagine that?  It is way more than what's happening right now.  Even as bad as Italy is, it's not like the Black Death.  During that time, they figured that they had to tell all ships to isolate passengers and crews for 30 days.  They called it the Trentino.  But after a while, they found out 30 days wasn't enough, and so they bumped it up after it didn't work.  They bumped it up to 40 days, and that's why you get quarantine.  Like French, 40 is 40.  Quarantine means 40 days.  And it's very interesting to me, if you look in my book, The Divine Code, and you look up the number 40, you will see how 40 really relates to the quarantine.  it is a time of testing and trial and this number comes up again and again in the bible.  i say this 40 is the number of testing trial probation or transition.  on the year of the flood god waited 40 days before telling noah it is time the time of judgment.  once the judgment was announced on the 10th day of the second month Noah had seven days to load the ark and get to safety.  Then it rained for 40 days and 40 nights.  Moses spent the first 40 years of his life in Egypt, the next 40 years of his life in the desert of Midian, and the last 40 years of his life leading the people of Israel to the promised land.  Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days.  The spies searched the promised land for 40 days.  For their lack of faith, Israel wandered the desert for 40 years.  There are 40 chapters in the book of Exodus.  You see, so that number 40, quarantine, even that is prophetic.  That's why we have this book, The Divine Code, an encyclopedia of prophetic numbers, encyclopedia of numbers.  So I just thought that's very, very interesting because if they didn't bump it up to 40, it would be called the Trentine.  Now, where did this idea come from?  that people should isolate themselves when they didn't even know anything about bacteria or virus.  They didn't have the microscope.  Well, guess who knew about bacteria and virus?  God did.  And in Revelation chapter 13, the Bible says that if anyone comes down with symptoms of leprosy, that's a skin disease that was very contagious back then, very deadly, the Bible says quarantine him for seven days and then present him to the priest.  so the priest was immune.  The anointing protected him.  He wasn't afraid of getting leprosy even though it was a contagion.  Come to the priest.  Come to the house of God.  So this is a place of safety, the house of God.  And the priest would check.  If he seems to have no more symptom, then still quarantine him another seven days.  See, why would you say that if you don't believe in invisible signs viruses.  Why would the Bible say that?  Because the Bible knows that you could be asymptomatic, and this was 4,000 years ago.  And you know, the first quarantine that happened in Italy, I'll tell you the year.  It happened, the bubonic plague arrived.  Listen to this.  Listen to how long it took for the Europeans to figure this out when they forgot the Bible.  Had they just known the Bible, they would have figured this out sooner.  The bubonic plague arrived in Europe in October 1347 when 12 ships from the Black Sea docked at the Sicilian port of Messina.  See, so they called it the Black Plague because it came from the Black Sea.  That's why it makes perfect sense to call this coronavirus the Wuhan virus or the China virus because points of origin matter.  We need to know where it originated.  Now, so listen, it came in 1347.  The first quarantine was issued in Dalmatia, which is present-day Croatia.  In 1377, that's 30 years later, how many people have died and they couldn't figure this out?  So don't say to me, oh, with the Enlightenment and with the philosophy of the Westerners and with the logic and the rationality, they figured it out themselves.  No, they couldn't even figure out for 30 years what the Bible had written 2,000 years earlier.  She goes to show God knew.  God knows everything about science.  He's the one that invented it.  Scientists, you're just studying a tiny sliver of all the vast knowledge of the universe.  He's allowing you to understand just a tiny, tiny little sliver.  Please don't let it get to your head.  So this idea of quarantine is now... Common practice.  People know this.  When the Apollo 11 returned from their mission to the moon and they came back to the earth, you see that President Nixon could not go and see them.  In fact, he saw them in an isolation chamber.  The poor people, they're very famous for going to the moon, but they were in like this isolation chamber for under quarantine.  Because they didn't know, could you get something from the moon and bring it back?  Because that would be an absolute nightmare pandemic if you bring a completely new kind of enemy.  But they obviously now know there's no life out there.  There's no life on the moon.  So again, if you want to know more about the meaning of numbers, the meaning even of the sequence of the book of Revelation, the best resource that our ministry has produced is really my magnum opus is this divine code.  And by the way, I'm holding a version of this that none of you have.  I mean, virtually nobody has because this is not available on Amazon.  This is the two volume in one.  And we got this especially done, a ministry friend helped us to do this, and it's very beautiful.  And for those who are watching this, we'll make it available, but literally there'll be like 10, 15 copies of this, and it'll just go like that, and it'll be gone.  So if you wish to have the only hardcover version of both volumes in one, so this is numbers running from 1 to 1,000, the prophetic meaning of these numbers, they don't include all the numbers, but within that range, 1 to 1,000, you can go to discover.org.au as fast as you can and grab a few copies.  And hopefully we get a shipment more.  Right now everything is disrupted and these books I don't even have.  I have my copy and they're out there in storage in a different country.  Just grab them while you can.  I hope you enjoy it.  And if we run out, it's okay because you can go to Amazon.com and look up the divine code and it's there as well.  It's really one of the biggest blessings that we have to give from this ministry to you is the meaning of all of these hidden codes and patterns that God has provided us in Scripture and in nature.  It's so wonderful to see the proofs of God, the evidence of God everywhere.  And understand prophecy a lot better too once you know what these codes and sequences and patterns mean.  So God bless you, enjoy that, and we'll see you next time. ",
