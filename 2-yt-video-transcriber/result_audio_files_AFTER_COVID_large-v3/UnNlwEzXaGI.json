Now, this is not me being cruel.  I've made this point using many psychiatrists and scientists and advisors on my channel.  I've made this point many times before.  The wall is inevitable.  It's unbeatable.  Try as you may, but women eventually smash into it.  And I've said this before, many times, many times, how I do feel sorry for some women and the war.  And I know, man, I know, man, come on, feeling sorry?  No, no, no, no.  It's in a selfish way.  More the fact that, oh, she used to look so good and now it's like, oh, oh God, it's like, what happened?  It's so heartbreaking knowing how hot... How hot she used to be.  How fine she used to be.  Good God.  And now it's like, oh my God.  Jesus Christ.  You kind of become a Christian because now you repent.  You kind of repent for ever finding her so attractive.  Repent your sins.  But seriously, things do change.  Time can change many things.  It can hide some scars or just make some people just... trash already trash.  but why do women expect more when they get older?  it's like more high maintenance combined with high mileage.  it doesn't work that way.  it doesn't work that way.  most men don't want a woman with so many miles on her.  the amount of d. that was okay.
