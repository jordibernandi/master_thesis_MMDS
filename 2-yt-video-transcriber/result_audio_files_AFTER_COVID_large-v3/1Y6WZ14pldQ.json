            "text": "Reporting in Atlanta, Alex.  So, you know, hey, young, young.  Children, y'all got to realize, man, social media is very dangerous.  It's a very powerful tool.  It could also be a very dangerous tool for... I want to know, you know... Alright, so this young girl was 16.  This was after the day after Christmas.  And she's out at midnight.  You cannot trust absolutely anyone.  She's saying another parent.  I want to know who that other parent is.  You can't trust any other parent.  Except maybe somebody.  Family.  Or somebody you grew up with 30, 40 years.  I'm not trusting no other parent.  I want to know... No, who are you?  I gotta really trust you.  Really, really trust you, because this parent went out, instead of having a B&B, lied, and rented this baby a hotel room.  Just like alcohol, if you go buy somebody alcohol and they crash, you're liable for buying it, because you provided that alcohol to these teenagers, and you're liable for that, whatever happens.  Just like getting a hotel room, she shouldn't have been there.  She wasn't 18.  She ain't but 16 years old.  More than likely, she didn't pay for the room.  She definitely couldn't rent the room.  What was the argument about?  that was so bad that a 16-year-old boy had to kill this 16-year-old girl?  Dating at that age is very dangerous.  I can dig a lot of the culture saying, don't put that boyfriend.  Kids are going to do whatever they want anyway.  But I like not putting that label on whatever y'all doing.  Because now, men, boys are very unstable creatures at that age.  You know, a lot of grown men can't handle heartbreak.  Why was she startled?  Was he not supposed to be in that room?  Was he ticked off, she was twerking in the camera and she didn't want him?  Ladies, Boys, children, people, your exes are watching your social media.  Even if you're not friends, they may have somebody else friend you.  They may make a fake profile and add you.  Or somebody they know may have you as a friend and they're watching.  I did several stories of young children, 20 years old.  This girl was in a relationship with this young boy.  They both was like 19, 20.  Two, three years, they hugged up every picture in Facebook.  Then all of a sudden, something happened.  They broke up at the end of December.  January 5th, ooh, last night was good, blah, blah, blah.  I did this, that, and the other.  The next day, she posted some other dude.  The ex-boyfriend killed me.  He was watching the social media.  Four or five days later, the boyfriend... Parents, you got to watch these teens' social media.  You got to cut that off and let them know, no, I'm watching your social media.  No, no, no.  Bullying.  You got predators that would prey on little babies twerking at 16.  Grown boys, seniors at that high school was peeping shorty and following her.  TikTok like, okay, yeah, she busting.  And I see her at school, right?  Mm-mm.  You know, so boys too.  Bullying is a lot of stuff.  You've got to watch their social media.  Anyway, this is a sad tragedy.  This little baby is way too many guns on the streets.  These children have access to guns.  You can work at McDonald's.  Everybody got two or three, four guns.  You could find guns.  I mean, they recovered 11,000 guns on the city just in Chicago alone.  That's what they recovered off the streets.  11,000 in one year, 2020.  And half that time we were locked down on the lockdown.  Kids are gonna do what kids do.  You can't be too strict and you can't be too lenient.  You gotta find a happy medium, but it's not easy being a parent.  These kids, and I'm not gonna say these kids today, just kids, period, are gonna do what they gonna do.  What can you do?  What can you do?  So, you know, what to say about this is just, I just, it's ridiculous.  This is why, and I said this in my live, that young boys and young girls need good both parents.  Grown men can't handle breakups.  And are unstable.  I know some.  And there's young boys that really can't handle it.  Don't understand it.  And at 16, that's all they know.  They think life is over.  There's suicide rate in teens that are high.  And this type of stuff.  This type of stuff.  Whoever that little boy walked in their room saw her twerking in the camera.  She grabbed it.  Probably.  That's what I'm wondering.  Could have been.  That could have been one of the issues.  Boy, it wasn't supposed to be there.  As soon as the door hit, she knew and looked.  That was at 12.02.  She was gone at 12.27.  25 minutes.  And so the family wants that surveillance.  Who went in?  Who went out?  Where were they at?
