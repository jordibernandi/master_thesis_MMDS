            "text": "Rice Krispie here with James Rannison and Rogue Nation at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia.  Look at this frickin' ominous lookin' place.  What, an oatmeal cookie?  Alright.  Be brave!  What are you doing here, son?  I don't answer questions.  There's got to be an entrance over there.  Say again?  No, straight ahead.  You can see the stop signs are kind of facing us way down there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are they, like, walking around with, like, machine guns?  I thought he had a gun.  I thought he had, like, a rifle.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Look at how they have this guy using a lawnmower to pull that side-by-side quad And it's like bouncing back and forth, ramming into it.  The worst way to tow something.  I have a question, just a question.  Are people allowed to ride the bus barefoot?  No, seriously, a serious question.  I don't know.  Okay, I think so.  If you see a barefoot homeless person or something, you won't kick them off, right?  No, I didn't think so.  Shout out to Eric Brandt.  Eric Brandt is a champion.  All right, Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Here comes another one.  This guy's driving backwards like an idiot.  Yeah.  And he could have just took a right off this stupid driveway.  Probably taking dash cam video.  Right?  Oh crap, we're being detained.  Lights are on.  You did good.  You, not so much.  Turn off those lights.  Turn off those lights.  Alright, we are getting out of here.  Please, sir.  All scams are not a police department.  Badge number 7043.  Okay, this is a consensual conversation.  Let me finish so I know where I'm going.  We're not being detained.  Let me finish.  Okay.  Let me tell you what I'm doing.  All right, keep cutting me off, okay?  I just don't want to get off on the wrong foot.  We're not being detained is consensual conversation, right?  Did I say you're detained?  Well, you have your lights on.  Did I say you're detained?  That's indicative of detainment when you put your lights on.  It's our policy, sir.  Okay.  So did I say you're detained?  So to clarify, we're not being detained.  Is that right?  Okay.  So basically... Can we move forward and just say we're not being detained?  The United States Penitentiary... You know this about it, sir.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  The United States Penitentiary... You can tell.  They call it... They call it... Absolutely.  Have a good day.  Have a good day.  Any relation?  Any relation?  Not that I know of.  The Florida governor?  Probably.  I mean, with a name like this, it's hard to say that we're not related in some sort, maybe.  Right on.  Maybe I'll knock on his door one day and see if we're related to him.  Like a distant cousin.  Do it at Ancestry.com.  I didn't mean to do that.  Cool.  Take care, man.  You too.  Yeah, we don't reveal our sources.  But thank you, guys.  Have a great day and enjoy the rest of it.  I'm going to stand right here.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  So all the crime is solved, huh?  Have a good day, sir.  They are telling me to have a good day.  We're done.  You're trying to dismiss me?  I'm right here, sir.  You're dismissed.  Come on, 10-8.  We're not criminals.  We're exercising our rights, sir.  We're looking for civil rights violations.  Don't commit any, all right?  Just carry on.  10-8.  And actually, what he was saying earlier about turning the lights on, there is a court case.  I believe it's a Supreme Court that says once those are on it, a reasonable person would think that they're being detained.  Exactly.  That's why I wanted to establish that off the bat, but you didn't give me the respect.  So that's why I walked away.  I wanted to start off saying this is a consensual conversation and I'm not being detained and clarify that.  That's it.  But your ego got in the way.  What's your name and badge number again?  I told you the first time I'll tell you.  You did, but I couldn't hear so well.  I'm sorry.  Your name is covered up because you're sloppy.  You're making that uniform look like crap.  Come on, man.  Tighten up.  All these little things are indicative of a discipline problem.  Thanks DeSantis, keep honoring your oath.  Yes sir, you too.  We're trying to let the good ones shine, let the snowflakes melt.  Seatbelt!  Put your seatbelt on!  He's going to go right off the edge here.  He's going to cause an accident.  He's going to go right off the edge, right there.  That's silly.  That's so silly.  Yeah, there's ingress and egress.  And buckle up, please. ",
