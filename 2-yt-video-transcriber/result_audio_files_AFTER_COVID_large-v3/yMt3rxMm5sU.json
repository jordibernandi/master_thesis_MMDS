On Heusgen's last council meeting, China's Deputy UN Ambassador Geng Shuang gave him a humiliating farewell.  He said, out of the bottom of my heart, good riddance, Ambassador Heusgen.  The Chinese ambassador's comment comes after the German UN envoy asked China to release Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.  The two Canadians are currently jailed in China.  Their imprisonment came as retaliation shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou.  China's UN ambassador, Geng Shuang, is a former spokesman for China's foreign ministry.  He was one of Beijing's prominent so-called wolf warrior diplomats.  Now we look to another virus in China.

Australia is the world's leading exporter of iron.  Increased earnings from mining exports have helped to support the Australian economy during the pandemic.  Australia's national broadcaster ABC says the price of iron ore is rising due to higher demand in China.  lower supply from Brazil and trading in financial markets.

Documents obtained by NTD's sister company, The Epoch Times, show socialist ideology and Beijing's narratives are part of the curricula not only for Chinese students, but also for foreign students from Southeast and Central Asia.  It's closely related to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.  Yunnan Mingzhu University in southwestern China's Kunming City is one of the schools offering this program.  The university explained its intention is to train talents for the Belt and Road Initiative operating in five southwestern Asian countries, like Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam.  The Mekong River runs through all these countries, so the project is called Mekong Corporation Project.  In these Mekong project countries, the CCP is promoting the Belt and Road Initiative with great effort.  The initiative is a global CCP project to build infrastructure, mainly in developing countries in Asia and Africa, as well as in some Western countries such as Australia and Italy.  It has placed some countries under massive debt.  This was used by the CCP to put economic pressure on governments so they agree with Beijing's agenda.  Leaked documents show foreign students participating in this Mekong project will study China's policies in political and economic areas.  Classes would include theory and practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and research on the CCP's innovative theory.  Classes about Chinese culture have little to do with traditional Chinese culture, but aim to promote Beijing's narratives on its domestic and foreign policy.  As for the financial aspect, the Mekong Talent Project applied for $1 million from the CCP.  It covers the costs of training 100 university students, 100 government officials, and 3,000 workers from the countries.  Another translator training program was allocated a $760,000 budget for the year 2018.  It covers the costs of training 100 translators from five countries.  Besides, the Yunnan Police College has promoted the Belt and Road Initiative through a police master's degree for foreign police officers from more than 17 countries, such as Afghanistan, Argentina, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam.  China's Ministry of Public Security funds their tuition and living expenses.  Similar programs have also been offered in the universities in northwest China to train students from Central Asian countries that have joined the Belt and Road Initiative.  A university in the region filed an application earlier this year to receive funding.  It wrote, the plans can effectively broaden positive public opinion to support the Belt and Road Initiative in these foreign countries, including eliminating voices of criticism and opposition.
