And in America, it's racism.  I think that they settled on that long ago.  They wrote documents on it and held classes on it and published textbooks on it.  So they figured that the best way to divide America was along racial lines.  And so that has been the one they've used the most.  But back in the early days, they weren't so easy about doing that because they hadn't gained much momentum on it.  And like so many of these tactics, the first time they begin is kind of fresh and strange and people don't pay much attention to it.  It's the repetition and the incessant repetition that gives it any kind of authenticity because people hear it so often.  I think it was Adolf Hitler, wasn't it, that said if you tell a lie often enough and repeat it enough times with enough emphasis, people will gradually just believe it because of the repetition.  So I would say it was racism, and that's the one they still use.  It's a fallback. ",

They're the ones that have utilized it.  The closest you can come to a counterparty to that would be the advertising industry.  I mean, they use the same tactics.

            "text": "Well, I think you touched on it there, Christian.  It's the modern technology.  That's the difference because two things have happened in that transition to modern technology.  One is that the media has changed.  I mean, back in the 60s, of course, there was television and there were radio and there were electronic and that kind of thing and communications.  But the digital world hadn't yet really arrived fully.  And so we didn't have Facebook and we didn't have YouTube and all of those things.  We were communicating with the world through our boob tubes and through our speakers on our radios and that kind of thing.  But never walking around with a little thing in our hand, focusing on our attention or sitting in front of it like we are now talking to each other beautifully over a computer connection.  So that's what really changed.  And of course, it amplified everything.  It sped everything up.  It improved the quality of everything.  The communications quality increased tremendously, which made it more convincing because it's immediate and it has a certain freshness to it.  It seems real because it's online.  It's happening now.  So in the old days, as you say, We had to get this all through something that had to be prepared, and it was somewhat delayed.  Sometimes you could get live television of an event, but that was usually reserved for baseball games and football games.  But when it came to news, it wasn't quite that good.  So now it's not just the printed word or the phrases or the audio side of it or the verbal side of it.  It's the vision that you see, the pictures you see.  And they are very, very compelling, especially when you realize that they too, even though it's spontaneous, they too are orchestrated.  They're created like works of art.  People, I think, subconsciously at least know that it's all, not all, but mostly staged.  But they forget it because they keep seeing it over and over and over again, as you said.  And it's that repetition that is so deadly. ",

            "text": "The WHO are trained members of organizations, and we know them.  They're Antifa's and the Black Lives Matter, and there are others.  Every little community has its own people's this and people's that.  And so they're organizations, and the people in those organizations, I suppose, I'm going to guess, are probably made up of about 50%.  50% ideologues, the kids mostly, the idealistic young high school and college students who really have been influenced heavily by the slogans, you know.  And they're very influential.  I mean, when I was young, I was influenced by slogans, you know, like the typical, the classical Marxist-Leninist slogan, from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.  Didn't that sound great, you know?  and fight against racism and war.  Well, that sounds great.  So, um, yeah, if you don't have a, if you don't have much experience in life and you don't, you haven't met too many, uh, con artists, uh, you can start falling for that stuff really easily.  So about half of these people, I think, are very idealistic and nice kids.  But they really have been caught up in something that's false.  And they don't know it yet.  They will eventually.  And so they're enthusiastic about supporting it.  But the other half are professionals.  And I'm not sure about them.  Maybe some of them still believe in these slogans.  But I think most of them are in it because they see it as a job.  They see it as a pathway to a career, so to speak, to government jobs and government control.  I think they see themselves as part of the bureaucracy that's going to control the world.  And that seems like it's a heady wine to be part of the machinery that's going to control the world.  And so they go to school.  And they learn tactics and strategies.  They study, they have lessons and they read books and they memorize things and they go out and practice.  And they're the professionals.  They're the ones that show up.  They all look alike.  They're all wearing the black uniforms.  They got the hoods, the same boots and everything.  Well, you know, that didn't happen accidentally.  Somebody bought those things or gave them the money and told them how to order them and so forth.  So they got the professionals.  And then, of course, what Stalin used to call the useful idiots.  So that they're the front line.  But now who's behind them?  Well, obviously, they tell us that there are people who identify themselves as the Marxist-Leninists.  I think it's significant that when they describe themselves, they usually put those two words together.  And that's highly significant because I learned years ago when I was studying all this that there's a big difference between a Marxist and a Marxist-Leninist.  The Marxist is just the guy that believes in the ideas of Karl Marx.  He's read Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto.  And he believes it.  He's a gung-ho.  He's a Marxist.  And you find a lot of college professors, for example, teachers who are like that.  But the Marxist-Leninists are the people that go one step further.  They've read the works of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.  And now he says something else.  He says, OK, comrades, you can believe in Marxism all you want to.  But our job is not to convince everybody of Marxism.  But our job is to come to power.  Our job is to seize control of the mechanisms of power. ",

What's behind that?  And this is where it gets murky and really interesting.  And sometimes even our best friends are not aware of that.

No.  Now we have to stop using their words and stop thinking about what are they.  Well, we only have a few minutes left.  My analysis led me to conclude that underneath all these slogans, there's a thing called collectivism.  It's an ideology.  And if you peel off the labels of communism, fascism, Nazism, you know, socialism, all of them, whether you're a liberal or progressive or left-winger, all the words, you come down to a hardcore philosophy of of social and political relationships.  It is called collectivism.  We don't have time for all of it, but the core idea is that the group is more important than the individual and that the individual must be sacrificed if necessary for the greater good of the greater number.  It's all about numbers.  So if you could say you have 51% of the population on your side, you win.  You can take all the chips off the table.  If you get 51%, this thing called democracy, they love that word, that means you can do anything you want.  No question about somebody's rights.  I mean, you got 51%.  The heck with rights, what does that mean?  We won, we won, you know?  So you come to that kind of an ideology.  And now we find that ideology at the corporate level.  Some of the biggest corporations in the world, which we could not call, Marxist-Leninist, but who's financing this Marxist-Leninist movement?  It's the corporations and the wealthiest people in the world, the banks and things like that.  Now, this is where we really get to the core of the matter.  And that's why the deep state in America, which certainly they have their share of Marxist-Leninist, they get along just fine together.  They believe the same thing.  But really, the hardcore direction in the U.S.  is coming from not these Marxist-Leninist groups, but from the tax exempt foundations, And this deep state thing, all these people go around wearing suits and driving around in limousines and flying in jet planes and holding meetings in Davos, Switzerland.  The globalists, now we use another word for them.  Now, they are not Marxist-Leninists, but they are definitely hardcore collectivists.  And this is where the whole thing comes together. ",

How do we know he's a good guy?  Well, because look at the bad guys.  They all hate him, right?  Therefore, he's a good guy.  No, wait a minute.  Look deeper than that.

They have to clear the cobwebs out of there.  system out of their brains and understand, oh, this is trickier than I thought.  It's not just a question of who you're going to vote for.  You're going to be a Republican or a Democrat.  No, no, no.  You lose if that's as deep as you want to go.  So the first thing is awareness, education.

They own the media.  They control the school system, you know.  they own the health system and they're going to try and poke needles in all of us in a few months to dumb us down or make sure the population diminishes or whatever they have in mind.
