And I certainly understand that.  The Confederate monuments.  When I gave a speech in 1865 in Maryland, I said to them then, now that the monster of slavery is dead, let the shadow and the substance go down together and let them sleep forever in a common grave.  That's what I said to them.  And so if these monuments are still standing, then we have not put away those ideas.  Now, we should not, to use a phrase that you all might use, we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  This is the monument that we built.  Thank you, ma'am.  Cue your glass here.  So we should certainly be having a conversation.  That's why this monument was erected, to be a place where we could have conversations and ensure that we understand the history and appreciate our history and at the same time make sure that we're moving on to the future and the promise of the forefathers.  And we're invested in the Constitution.  Many of you, I don't know, how many of you feel like you have divested yourselves of the Constitution? ",
