            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm going to talk a little bit about law right now again.  With everyone staying home and being all freaked out right now, I'm sure a lot of us are getting drunk.  So one, thankfully the liquor stores are deemed essential services, and two, we need to talk about whether or not drunk people can consent to sex.  Why?  Because there's a lot of misinformation out there, and I want to make sure that we're all on the same page, so nobody done gets arrested for something that's perfectly legal.  As many of you know, I work with lawyers on cases of false accusations, and I also do research on case law, both historic and new rulings that are coming out.  So I want to talk about the baseline.  If she's unconscious, don't fuck her.  I think we all pretty much agree on that.  And who wants a starfish anyway?  But the courts actually accept that drunk people are responsible for their choices as long as they can appreciate the nature of the act.  So that means that if the person understands that they're about to engage in intercourse and says, yeah, fuck it.  It doesn't actually matter if they only agreed because they were drunk.  Signs of capacity include things that show cognitive awareness, but they don't include basic human acts like managing to get to the bathroom to puke or to pee.  That a person may not remember the sexual act or events leading up to it, that doesn't mean that they were too drunk to consent.  And this is the problem.  Misinformation is causing a lot of people to be charged, which means having to hire and pay for lawyers, spending years waiting for a court date, all the stress of the nature of the accusation.  That will still happen, just so that they can get to court and then inform the complainant, sorry, you actually did have the capacity to consent, no matter how pissed off you are about it.  People generally don't drink because they're happy.  So the result of things you do when you've drowned your sorrows is likely not going to make you happy either.  But it doesn't make it illegal.  And that's the point.  To stop all these reckless and needless charges from being laid, we need to have lawyers give lectures on university campuses that give students accurate information about their own responsibility for their own behavior while they're drinking.  We need to make sure that police and prosecutors properly advise complainants on capacity to consent and start doing proper investigations again.  More pointedly, we need to stop the advocates who are misinforming people about capacity to consent from spreading that misinformation.  That's one of the many things that I'm working on right now through my non-profit The Lighthouse Project, helping the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted. ",
