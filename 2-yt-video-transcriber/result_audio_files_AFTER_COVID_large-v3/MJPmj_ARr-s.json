And you're really not sure if you're preparing because you're like, I'm not sure if I'm going to be in this debate.  So Mike, even though he was, I'm sure, getting coached and prepared, he was like, I don't know if I'm going to be in this debate.  And so I don't think he was coached hard enough.  Number two, he was clearly instructed to keep his cool no matter what.  But that ended up presenting as being lethargic and uninterested for a big chunk of the debate.  And the third most telling thing is that if I'm his team, you know he's going to get a stop and frisk question, like a gender discrimination or mistreatment question.  So you coach him and you have him give you 60, 75 second answers over and over again until he can do it in his sleep.  And the fact that he did not have those answers at his fingertips lets me know categorically he was not properly prepared. ",

Back when he was considering running, you know, more than 12 months ago, he actually took trial trips to New Hampshire and Iowa to see if he could relate to the people and he concluded that it was not his thing.

And this time you have Bernie... the outsider, the front runner now, poised to run the table.  And the establishment's been looking around for a white knight, and Bloomberg has shown up with all of his money, all of his wealth, all of his TV ads.  And to me, this was a great night for Bernie because Bernie emerges as the front runner.  He's really hard to touch, Bernie.  I mean, I've been on the debate stage with him seven times, and he's just like a stoic messenger.  Like, it doesn't matter what you say to him.

Now, Andrew, you've been giving us the practicality of this.  A little bit of update on what we understand.  The Bernie Sanders campaign posted the best fundraising night of any debate yet, 2.7 million, they say, from 150,000 donations.  It's according to spokesperson Kaska.  The Elizabeth Warren campaign had its best fundraising day ever.  according to a tweet from Caitlin Mitchell, Warren's chief mobilization officer.  More than a million dollars during the debate. ",

I was just sharing an anecdote about how the Bloomberg campaign has just been hoovering up staff from every campaign, including mine, paying way above market rate.  They're almost like a big company that's doing roll-ups or acquisitions, but the acquisitions are actually political staff.  And, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if many of the candidates on the stage tonight were losing staff to Bloomberg because he's offering 150 to 200 percent of what the market rate is essentially at every level.
