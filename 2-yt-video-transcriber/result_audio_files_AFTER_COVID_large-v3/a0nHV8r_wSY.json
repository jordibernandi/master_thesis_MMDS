            "text": "The long awaited rains have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground.  I carve the way to where the wild and rushing river can be found.  And like the rain, I have been carried here to where the river flows.  My heart is racing and my knees are weak as I walk to the edge.  I know there is no turning back.  Once my feet have left the leg and in the rush, I hear a voice telling me it's time to take the leap of faith.  So here I go.  I'm diving in.  I'm going deep.  Get over my head.  I want to leap.  Fall in the rush.  Constantly flow.  Get over my head.  I want to go.  The river's deep, the river's wide, the river's wild, isn't it?  So take your sway, my darling.  My darling.  My darling.  There is a supernatural power in this mighty river's flow.  It can bring the dead to life and it can fill an empty soul and give our heart the only thing worth living and worth dying for.  Yeah.  we will never know the awesome power of the grace of god until we let ourselves get swept away into this holy flood.  so if you'll take my hand we'll close our eyes and count to three and take the leap of faith.  come on let's go.  I'm going deep in all my head.  I want to be Caught in the rough, lost in the flow In all my head.  I want to go The river's deep, the river's wide.  The river's water is alive.  So deep, y'all say I'm diving in.  Yeah, I'm diving in I'm diving in.  Yeah, I'm diving in.  oh Come on, let's go!  I'm dialing in, I'm going deep In over my head.  I wanna be Caught in the run, lost in the flow In over my head.  I wanna go The river's deep, the river's wide.  The river's water is alive.  So sink or swim.  I'm dialing in, I'm dialing in.  I'm going deep In over my head.  I wanna be Caught in the run, lost in the flow In over my head.  I wanna go The river's deep, the river's wide, the river's water is alive.  So sink or swim, I'm diving in.  So sink or swim, I'm diving in.  So sink or swim, I'm diving in.  I'm diving in I'm diving in.  And now it begins to shine And you've found the eyes to see Each little drop The dawn of every day.  Your smiley comes back to me.  And whatever you may say Don't let it stop.  Never fade away.  As we gotta get out in this world together. ",
