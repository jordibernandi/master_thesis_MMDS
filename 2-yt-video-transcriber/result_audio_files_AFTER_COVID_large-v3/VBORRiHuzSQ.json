            "text": "Oh, that would have come out.  My name is Richard and this is If You Only Knew.  Thank you again for joining me.  Today's episode is titled, It is Time to Batten Down the Hatches, which I will explain the meaning of later.  But before we get into the headlines, did you catch the video before the intro?  That was a member of the media before a press conference saying to a colleague, just wait until the Mayfair truck gets here.  Do they know something or are they laughing it off as many others have as a conspiracy?  but what do you think?  let me know in the comments.  for now let's get into the headlines.  the federalist has published an extensive list of hundreds of national monuments defaced and removed since the start of the protests which we know are far from over as we are still seeing portland and other cities in chaos.  after initially demanding that trump removed the federal agents from the city portland is now officially declared a riot.  after the mayor was booed told to resign And given a list of demands, the mayor was also exposed to tear gas resulting from joining the protesters.  Fortunately, the White House has confirmed that the military troops were sent to Portland to quell the rioting.  Later this week, these troops will be sent to Chicago despite Lightfoot's public statements that under no circumstance will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents because that job, well, is clearly taken by Lightfoot.  Mayor Lightfoot also publicly asked citizens to snitch on federal agents while residents are watching in horror as the media continues to pretty much push the narrative that the overwhelming majority of the protests are harmless and peaceful.  Fortunately, Lightfoot has agreed to allow the agents to Chicago.  Interestingly enough, check out this article from Daily Wire.  A video recorded in Chicago revealing how a protester would change clothes mid-protest through the cover of umbrellas and switch roles to arming rioters.  It's thanks to articles like this and video footage shared by patriots that's helping to wake up Americans from the lies of the mainstream media and the Democrat Party.  Just days ago, headlines ran with Pelosi stating that the arrests were being performed by unidentified federal officers, which was quickly addressed and corrected by Mark Morgan of the CBP.  However, in cities like New York, the truth has become very plain for most New Yorkers to see.  Rand Paul's even calling for the impeachment of Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose executive memo resulted in 25% of the deaths from COVID, while the Navy ship Comfort and the Central Park field hospitals remain virtually unused and empty.  Cuomo has admitted that New York made a lot of mistakes, but New York state's problems are really actually multiplying as tax revenues are sharply dropping from residents relocating out of the city, either upstate or to the suburbs.  I think that this is becoming obvious, which is what probably prompted Cuomo to claim that people are fleeing to New York because it's safe.  While Cuomo has made these claims, New York business owners would probably disagree.  Initially, they were navigating heavy rules, which have since changed.  Some bars were selling $1 Cuomo chips in efforts to comply with New York state laws that Cuomo has now reversed.  Now, despite Cuomo's efforts to make it impossible to operate a business, other things have happened.  The New York City Police Department has completely removed and disassembled the Occupy Wall Street mini autonomous zone across from City Hall.  Lists to say this came as a huge relief from the locals, but also as a wake-up call because the people are now seeing the abuses of the states.  They're now seeing the president offer to send assistance, which the governors and mayors are declining, which is infuriating those residents who are also affected by the rioting.  As a result, there's also growing solidarity among conservatives.  Here's the boat parade from last Saturday in support of President Trump in New York.  And just like the fireworks that we saw weeks back in LA, this is the silent majority.  And this is what it's really about.  What's difficult is waking up the people to see how democratic leadership in the media are the true enemy of the people, and also see that BLM is a cover for an agenda that is becoming clearer and clearer for more to see.  This was a protest in New York City that was not branded as BLM, but echoes the same message that's been actually shared in a lot of other BLM speeches I've heard.  Listen to this clip.  we are getting organized for an actual revolution to overthrow this system.  for many americans the light bulb is going on.  to some this is straight out of a playbook from venezuela with the toppling of statues and that this is an attempted abolition of america itself with racism as the veil.  That's becoming more and more clear to Americans as they watch the hypocrisy, the woke mob selectively attack maple syrup.  Just not the New York Times, which is their far left podium.  As you can see, New York Post article, the family that owned the New York Times were slave owners, but this appears to have fallen on the deaf ears of the movement.  New York Times has undergone a good deal of recent scrutiny as they face a new lawsuit by the Liberty University for making up a COVID story for $10 million.  At the same time, The New York Times has also been exposed to published massive errors in a Steele dossier, which was the basis of the Mueller investigation.  On top of all this, the New York Times is doxing Tucker Carlson, or plans to, and also plans to go after Sean Hannity, the two most watched anchors on cable news as of right now, which ratings would demonstrate.  While the activities of the New York Times will fly under the radar of most American liberals, my parents included, who still subscribe and read it cover to cover daily, many have woken up to the fact that China is not our ally.  After a decision to close the embassy in Texas, footage has been recorded to show that there's been mass burnings of documents.  At the same time, Jennifer Yang, who I do recommend following on Twitter, has revealed how the CCP has blocked access to the U.S.  embassy online.  Another China-related story you won't see in the mainstream media is how the CCP is forcing Chinese Christians to renounce their faith and instead worship President Ping or be cut off from welfare.  Now, while this is very disturbing, it's becoming clear to Americans that China doesn't have best interests.  Many have also noticed Pelosi's remark referring to COVID as the Trump virus after months of Trump referring to COVID as the China virus.  Careful, Nancy, since Attorney General Barr in a speech last week made it clear that anyone receiving bribes or funding from the CCP will be investigated and charged if necessary.  Barr in his address illustrated how the CCP has infiltrated universities, the media, big tech, politics, and virtually all public avenues.  The president also shocked people this week when he canceled the large GOP rally for the RNC in Florida and also wore a mask and recommended wearing masks during a recent coronavirus briefing.  Now, this was interesting because we know that mail-in voting has been on the Democratic agenda for some time.  But if masks work, you can go to a restaurant.  If masks work, you can go to the store, buy groceries, and do almost everything in a mask, including voting.  And by the way, we are still seeing more voter fraud reported left and right.  But if you can vote.  There's no need for mail-in voting.  The bottom line is the president just outmaneuvered the D's in mail-in voting and voter ID.  Now, while most Americans are tired of wearing masks in the lockdowns, it has become clear to many that this is not about a virus as one-third of Americans no longer are sold on the public narrative.  Fortunately, the CDC's accounting has been exposed.  The case numbers are being walked back.  More treatments are available.  The bottom line is that there's less fear among Americans overall.  It's not like it was two months ago.  Do you remember that?  And when people are only concentrated with fear and survival, they question less, preventing Americans from waking up, which is really what this is all about, the Great Awakening and Waking Up America.  I titled this, It's Time to Batten Down the Hatches for a Reason, and it's not just the name of another Q post.  As citizen journalists and digital soldiers, we knew about this journey.  We knew that when we undertook this, that what it would involve, we knew that there'd be bans, there'd be censorship, and this was part of the plan.  Jack Dorsey appears before the Senate on Monday.  This QAnon ban could be used against him, and I suspect it will.  This is how Twitter will end up regulated, after admitting that they are censoring any mentions of QAnon, which violates their 230 status, which they are, interestingly enough, state that it's to protect the public from what they consider dangerous content.  I don't know about that.  Unlike false medical studies, like the Lancet or the phony observational study that made the public afraid to take treatments, which we now works, imagine how many lives could have been spared.  Lawsuits are coming.  Expect them.  But going back to batten down the hatches, batten down the hatches was originally a nautical term, meaning makes a ship hatches secure with gratings and tarpaulins in expectation of stormy weather.  And we are there indeed.  This means expect the worst, and as developments occur, we may see even more censorship.  Expect this.  This is their weapon.  Remember that social media was a tool developed by the deep state to communicate with each other.  and that it was overtaken by a movement.  We are using their weapon against them, but it was still their weapon, for now at least.  Until the election, Big Tech will be using all resources desperately to suppress the truth.  So take all the precautions with multiple accounts.  It's about the truth getting out there.  And not only is the truth getting out there, the swamp is being drained slowly for everyone to see.  And once we see the indictments from Durham and other investigations, which there's going to be a lot more, I mean, just this week alone, Ohio House Speaker was arrested in bribery charges.  Former Congressman is now charged with ballot stuffing, bribery, and corruption.  And while Ghislaine Maxwell's currently awaiting trial, the more information is coming out.  People are being exposed, but it's... really more about exposing their agenda so that the people know what they're fighting for and that they're taking back their country.  Look at this article.  Democratic mayor votes down further police budget cuts after vandals defaced her house.  Now, this is great.  Let's have more Democratic leaders.  follow this example.  But mind you, this is The Daily Caller, so don't expect to hear about this on CNN.  With the tyranny of the governors and BLM as their foot soldiers, even with QAnon followers red-pilling the masses, The people are noticing the agenda for themselves, and they are starting to catch on that.  the masks are not about the virus.  It's about control and power, maintaining that power, which they are losing as more is being revealed to the people.  The process, however, is ugly.  To say the least, it's painful.  It's time to batten down the hatches and be ready for whatever comes next.  Look at this last article and how it shows how many Americans are not even expressing their opinions outwardly.  I do believe this is the silent majority, and come November, they'll be silent no more.  more than ever folks i need you to like subscribe and share the video.  my views are dropping as my videos are being suppressed.  yes i will continue to create new content until i am banned but please follow the channel on twitter parlor and even follow me on facebook where you can see the reporting in real time daily.  i do have paypal if you'd like to make a donation to support this work.  but lastly i want to close with these words from mike pompeo about the usa waking up to china's agenda.  Powerful words.  Here is an excerpt from Carly Q. Remember that just two years ago, the left would argue it's Russia.  Now they know it's China, and they're listening.  This is an awakening.  My name is Richard, and this is If You Only Knew. ",

            "text": "Now this isn't about containment.  Don't buy that.  It's about a complex new challenge that we've never faced before.  The USSR was closed off from the free world.  Communist China is already within our borders.  So we can't face this challenge alone.  The United Nations, NATO, the G7 countries, the G20, our combined economic, diplomatic, and military power is surely enough to meet this challenge if we direct it clearly and with great courage.  Maybe it's time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies.  We have the tools.  I know we can do it.  Now we need the will.  To quote scripture, I ask, is our spirit willing, but our flesh weak?  If the free world doesn't change, doesn't change, Communist China will surely change us.  There can't be a return to the past practices because they're comfortable or because they're convenient.  Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.  As I explained in Philadelphia last week, standing, staring at Independence Hall, our nation was founded on the premise that all human beings possess certain rights that are unalienable, and it's our government's job to secure those rights.  It is a simple and powerful truth.  It's meant as a beacon of freedom for people all around the world, including people inside of China.  Indeed, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes.  Now it's up to us to heed his words.  Today, the danger is clear.  And today, the awakening is happening. ",
