            "text": "He's getting aggravated.  Kazoopi is his name now?  I don't want to see that.  How you doing?  Not a problem, sir.  These guys are out here recording everything.  They're kind of acting like superheroes.  Hey, sir.  We're out here with Mr.  Kazuki.  How you doing?  Not a problem, sir.  He informed us.  these two guys are out here recording everything.  They're kind of acting like sovereign citizens.  Won't give us any information or anything like that.  Okay.  Not giving us really any information.  He was wondering what you thought, how we should go about it.  Yeah, they denied it.  Fourth Amendment right, they said.  They're just walking around trying to record everything, saying they're journalists, won't tell me where they're journalists at.  Yeah, I mean, they're recording everything we're doing.  Yeah, I mean, they were actually looking for the sheriff's office.  That's obviously not this place.  I told them where the sheriff's office was if they really wanted to go.  That was about it.  So they were like, all right, thank you, everything.  I said, where are you guys headed?  Since you guys are waiting for a bus.  They wouldn't tell me.  They got all offended, whatever.  Yeah.  Just let them be.  Let them be and keep them out of the facility, right?  Yeah, I mean, they're bored and just walking around looking for trouble.  Yeah.  All right.  So I'll pass that word along.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Sounds good, sir.  All right, sir.  So, basically what Sergeant Bob was saying.  Here's Lieutenant Workout.  Obviously, you don't want him recording in the facility.  They're not in there now.  As long as we leave him alone out here, he should probably just clear up.  Yeah.  If they try to go back in there, deny them.  Besides that fact, he was saying we're probably just making their day.  You know what I mean?  This is what they want.  They want the publicity.  They want to give us IDs.  They want to give us names.  They said they were journalists.  They want to tell me from where.  They slipped and told them.  Then they said they're not from the state.  They slipped and said, oh, we pay taxes here.  We have the right to be in the public area, so on and so forth.  Whatever.  We just want to stop them.  I'm going to let him walk.  I just want to try to get him identified.  I'm going to send you a picture of the rock.  All right, I'm going to send this one out right now.  Yeah, actually, let me send you another one.  There's a younger guy traveling with him.  Maybe it'll make sense to somebody.  Okay.  All right.  All right, the state police are good there.  All right.  It's not free games because, you know, where else are they going to go?  Right.  Right.  Can you say how they got here?  By bus.  One guy said by parachute.  So, they came in the jail, and they were told to leave, right?  Yeah.  They didn't?  I mean, it's enough.  Goddamn.  No, it goes up.  So they're journalists, looking for public records.  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of, we'll go on our own side of caution and not go, because the troopers would have to go hands-on with them on school.  My bigger thing is to try to identify.  So I got, I snuck up on them and took a picture of both of them.  The one young kid put his hand in front of his face.  I'm sending him to AJ now to see if any of the local guys recognize him.  All right, I got to go.  I'll call you back.  So you know if any more of the property is actually down the road here?  It's all going to be next to the school.  It's all government.  It looks like they're going down... Let's pass the white shack here.  That's part of the cemetery.  Then the prosecutor's trailer is in the back though.  You might want to make sure they just don't, not that they want to break into anything with you guys here, but that's where the undercover detectives and all work.  Hey Rob, we're good.  Why don't you go ahead and take her back?  No, we're good, thank you.  Katrina, if you can just write a report, that would be helpful.  All right, I got their pictures.  Hopefully we can identify the white, the younger white kid put his hand in front of the sign.  Alright, why don't you do this, without getting too close to her.  Slow up, not too close, but see if she can identify you.  Alright, see ya.  You see anything?  Uh, I see nothing.  I see nothing at all.  I would definitely stage your steps so that you're squared away.  Actually, you guys have your seat all right.  I would try to keep your hands off them in case they have a virus.  It definitely looks like they'd be tight.  As you know, addicts have less immune.  systems during this time.  Young kid to me look like my.  I don't know.  Let's see.  I have her roll past in the slush.  She said the younger kid has been in our jail before.  She thought he I mean, if you're good with the trespassing, I don't mind charging with the trespassing.  But it's going to escalate.  Then that's what happens.  If not, then this is going to just continue, and it's not a free pass because of the environment, right?  Oh, I do.  I'm not going to be ashamed.  I'm not going to be ashamed.  down there by the uh cat hill that tall grass pick the rock.  you do.  any type of facial on him the older guy?  They might, I don't know how long it would take.  But I don't want to, I don't want to stand around on the side of the road and, like, wait an hour, like, try to, like, just keep around for an hour for somebody to try to identify them.  I'd rather, like, go ahead and take the, move forward and, you know.  They're high sailing.  How many times were we told to leave before we thought I'd hit?  I think there was a problem.  I'm done.  We're hooking up.  They're hooking up.  That's not how it works.  You can take a picture of me and put it up inside your lobby and say this guy's trespassed.  That's how you do that.  That's not what we're doing.  Tell me how the law works.  So now we need to identify.  When didn't we leave?  You want to see on film?  We have it on film.  You can either identify yourself.  This is not a criminal trust.  You can either identify yourself or not identify yourself.  You don't identify yourself.  Are we being detained for a crime right now?  Yes.  What is the crime?  Well, what is the crime?  Give me your ID.  Give me your ID.  I'm under arrest.  I'm under arrest right here.  Hold on, let me turn this off.  You had the opportunity.  You had the opportunity. ",
