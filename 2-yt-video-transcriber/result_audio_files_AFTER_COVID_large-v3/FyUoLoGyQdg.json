            "text": "Throughout church history, there have been generally two distinct interpretations from Scripture regarding salvation.  One is that mankind is morally unable to respond positively to the appeals of God, to be reconciled, and thus an effectual or irresistible work of grace is required for the lost to believe.  This is sometimes referred to as Calvinism, a more theistic form of determinism.  this is in contrast to the more libertarian perspective which teaches that all fallen humanity remains or is graciously made morally able to respond positively or negatively to god's gracious appeals to be reconciled from that fall.  The more deterministic or Calvinistic interpretation of Scripture is first introduced by Augustine, a 5th century philosopher from Africa who converted from Manichaean Gnosticism and did not know Greek or Hebrew.  Though Manichaean Gnostic beliefs are very different from Calvinistic Christians, one commonality is the adherence to deterministic philosophy.  for instance john chrysostom an early church father prior to augustine's conversion wrote in his commentary on john six forty four quote.  the manichaeans spring upon these words saying that nothing lies in our own power.  This demonstrates that the early church fathers saw the interpretation of John 644 and other texts from the more deterministic framework to be more gnostic than Christian.  Dr.  Ken Wilson, an orthopedic hand surgeon, wrote his Oxford thesis on the subject, demonstrating that Augustine was the first to shift teaching in the early church from a traditional view of free will to a non-free free will.
