One thing I love that you talked about in your manifesto about how we have to really view ourself as family, because a lot of people, they may be walking in fear when they hear things, you know, the dynamics of this nation is changing, you know, in colors and dynamics, but it's really important in this season and time that we realize that we're all one.  But what are some of the things that, you know, we need to understand?  that?  why is there this divide?  What are some of the things that divide us and what can we bridge together to make sure that we walk together in unity? ",

            "text": "Well, if I go to today's problems, as opposed to Genesis 11, how God separated the nations because of false unity was being established at the Tower of Babel and only in Christ can we come back together.  But I need to talk about my nine points of empowerment of minorities and Christians.  Listen to them.  Education reform, marriage rebuilding as a social strategy, public policy reform, like criminal justice reform, oversight of minority community engagement, meaning minorities have got to engage, wealth creation, And I want to talk more about that real quickly in a moment.  Entrepreneurship, if we build businesses by Christians, we give people an opportunity to have life, destiny, and a sense of purpose.  Righteousness and justice as moral guidelines.  Most white evangelicals think about righteousness scriptures as how we should run the country, many minorities think about justice issues, the lack of fairness, but the Bible says righteousness and justice are the foundation of God's throne.  Two more, empathy versus retaliation, and then destiny with dignity for all humankind.  That means we're pro-life, we're pro-education, We're pro giving a second chance to people who have made mistakes by going to prison, etc.  And we're protecting the elderly.  So human life across its entire continuum is valuable to the Christians.  So this manifesto gives us thought, intellectual architecture, if you will, and it gives us strategies to that.  we can work together right now.  And I believe the church, if she comes together, we can heal the racial divide.  The problem is Christians are being too influenced by the world.  But the reality is America is going through a healing.  God is sovereignly watching over us.  And he's got this.  And if we'll follow the word, and work together, we'll see the greater glory of God.

I ask you, Lord, to give us boldness, to declare hope, We pray, Lord, that you will anoint us.  You will grace us in this time of challenge.  Let us pick up a prophetic mantle.  The mantle of Martin Luther King Jr.  is now falling on black and white and Hispanic men.  It's falling on black, white, Hispanic, and Asian women.  There are many who the world has never heard of that are going to bring healing in their sphere of influence.  Let us unite around the word of God, the love of God, and the empowerment of the Lord.  Thank you for what you're doing.  And thank you that this election will be a part of your writing the ship And let us pull forward.  lastly with one or we're going to pull forth with prayer and with another or we're going to engage.  We're going to vote.  We're going to love our neighbors and we're going to join together in the body of Christ.  Amen. ",
