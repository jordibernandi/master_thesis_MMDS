            "text": "So, Joe Biden has been accused of sexual assault.  I know, shocker.  Tara Reid worked for Joe Biden in the 90s and she alleges that on top of just groping her inappropriately, like we've seen from Joe all the time, he also pushed her against the wall and touched her under her skirt without her consent.  So I just want to start off this video by saying we should always, always, always be skeptical of any sort of accusation.  It's not up to the court of public opinion to decide the outcome of these things.  I'm a very big fan of due process.  And as we have seen, movements like Me Too have been hit or miss with big misses like Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.  Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of being abusive until audio leaks came out.  No, when you have a closed fist.  You got hit.  I'm sorry I hit you like this.  But I did not punch you.  I did not f***ing deck you.  I f***ing was hitting you.  I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was. ",

But sometimes, Me Too hits it out of the park, like with Harvey Weinstein.  That in jail!  I actually recorded a video of me reading one of Harvey Weinstein's victims' stories.  The first time I saw him fully naked, I thought he was deformed and intersex.  He has an extreme scarring that I didn't know if maybe he was a burn victim, but it didn't make sense.  He does not have testicles, and it appears he has a vagina.  WHAT THE FU-.  You can see why I scrapped that.  Full disclosure, you probably already know my feelings about Joe Biden by now.  Joe Biden, once again, up there looking like vanilla pudding.  Absolutely nothing interesting comes out of that man's mouth.  Joe Biden gets by on Obama nostalgia and fond memories of the Obama times.  He needs to go home.  He needs to retire.  He needs to enjoy his life.  He needs to watch Jeopardy and play crossword puzzles for the rest of his life.  He needs to relax.  He needs to go home.  That should pretty much sum it up.  But this is less about Joe Biden and more about everything surrounding this case.  The incredibly concerning double standard from feminists and Democrats.  And by feminists, I mean... These type.  You know what I mean.  And by Democrats, I mean Democrats.  I'm an independent.  I'm only a Democrat by force.  In order to vote for the candidate I like, my state requires me to brand myself in the name of the donkey.  And how Time's Up, which is basically the Me Too organization that has helped so many women, is refusing to help this woman.  So get ready, because this is quite the ride.  So Joe Biden is in a bit of hot water, but you wouldn't know that by looking, well, anywhere.  Nobody is talking about this.  On the day I am recording this video, it has been four days since these accusations came out.  The biggest platform to talk about this has been Yahoo News.  That's basically like AOL talking about this.  But even Yahoo News winded up moving the article to the sports section.  So the link everybody was sharing, the link that went viral, doesn't work anymore.  And you have to go find it in the sports section.  I love sports ball.  I am a huge sucker for this dry sand effect, so, We are going to talk about it here on this channel. ",

Last April, Tara Reid watched as a familiar conversation around her former boss, Joe Biden, and his relationship with personal space unfolded on the national stage.  Nevada politician Lucy Flores alleged that Biden had inappropriately sniffed her hair and kissed the back of her head.  After she saw an episode of the ABC show The View in which most of the panelists stood up for Biden and attacked Flores as politically motivated, Reid decided that she had no choice but to come forward and support Flores.  The short article brought a wave of attention to her, along with accusations that she was doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ",

Now regardless of your opinion on this case or Me Too in general, I think we can all agree that victims have a right to get help if they were raped or assaulted.  It's not like this came out of nowhere either.  She's been trying to talk about this case since the 90s.  She actually lost her job when she was younger because of this.  Last year when she tried to come out with it, she was doxxed, harassed, and called a Russian asset because she once wrote a blog post about how she liked Russia.  Yeah, put a pin in that because unfortunately it is going to be very relevant.  So the only people who seem to be talking about this are Bernie supporters and right-wing people and that's not a very good look.  It makes it seem like people are just trying to take down Biden for political reasons and also isn't a good look for Democrats in general because like You're supposed to care about this shit.  So I'm going to play the audio of this woman telling her story.  If you guys don't want to hear somebody describe sexual assault or cry, maybe skip to this timestamp down here.  But here we go. ",

Haha, that's hardly disqualifying for a president these days.  Next.  Biden would still have to assault 18 more women to catch up to Trump.  I don't really believe this, but even if it were true, why does it matter when the POTUS has more than 20 allegations against him?  Trump has multiple women accusing him of sexual abuse.  More fake news.  When will you people learn?  We have a narcissistic incompetent racist for president because you believe everything social media bots from Russia tell you to believe.  Just another Russian, Republican, Trump, Putin, Bernie story.  Stop it.  Just stop it.  Leave Joe alone.  Yeah, that's a Republican plant.  Sounds like a Republican bot.  Do not believe.  Stop pushing this BS.  Joe Biden is a kind and decent man.  If he touched Tara, that means Tara also touched Joe.  Oh my god.  And so the 2016 game plan begins by Trump and the Russians.  There's a reason hashtag MeToo didn't go all in.  They had a hard time believing her with her Russian friend.  So a Putin-connected woman is accusing Biden of sexual assault and the story is coming from a Kremlin-friendly publication.  and there are people who actually take this garbage seriously?  I believe women.  I don't believe the Kremlin.  Tara is a Russian asset, idiots.  That's right, the Russian hysteria has gotten so bad that the Democrats are now dismissing a woman's sexual assault story because she once said something nice about Russia.  Oh, it's really important to note that the people who broke this case were also the people who broke the Kavanaugh case.  But now that it's your guy, it's a Kremlin PSYOP.  Believe all women.  Unless she said a nice thing about Russia.  Arrest journalists running the Biden smear.  Blacklist those journalists from the field.  Shut down those outlets running it.  What happened to believing women?  Liar, liar, liar, liar.  So don't believe women?  Not this one.  That's a Bernie supporter.  Nope, I don't.  So that's where the line is.  First of all, she's not even a Bernie supporter, she was a Warren supporter, but now that it's just her assaulter and Bernie, who do you think she's going to support?  Believe all women.  unless it's a Bernie supporter.  For the sake of the argument, say Biden is a rapist.  Trump is also a rapist.  So why not vote for the rapist with the better policies?  First of all, is this elections now?  I would vote for my rapist if it meant getting Trump out of office during this pandemic before our entire country dies.  I do not care.  Hi, Joe Biden is a sexual predator.  Bernie wrote essays.  What's your point?  Do we have to talk about Fifty Shades of Bernie?  We have to talk about Fifty Shades of Bernie.  In the 1970s, Bernie Sanders wrote a rape essay.  It was an essay critical of gender roles, but it had some spicy takes in it.  But I don't see how writing something in the 70s is comparable at all to doing.  Something.  Did Bernie Bros also believe Elizabeth Warren when she came out and said Bernie told her she could never be president?  Nope.  This is why it shouldn't be called believe all women.  It should be called believe all victims, believe all assault survivors, something like that.  Because when you call it believe all women, you get dipshits like this comparing literal assault to just words.  hurt feelings.  For the 200 millionth time, words are not violence.  Putting someone against the wall and putting your fingers in them Violence.  That is the lesson for the libs today.  The best is going through these people's tweets that are like hashtag believe women like from years ago.  This was from this person only a few months ago.  When a man is accused of sexual assault, your first reaction should not be, is she lying?  Instead, it should be, these are very serious allegations of true and we should listen.  And now this person's like, just a reminder that Bernie pals around with women who fantasize about... He wrote about it in 1973.  Just admit you want to take the word of a woman who has a problem with honesty because Bernie.  Bernie, the man who believes women fantasize about not real women, I don't think, but the women of his own fantasies.  I would hope.  A woman couldn't possibly be in her right mind to fantasize such a thing.  This is honestly just innocent at this point, and we're going to move on.  This is from this account in 2017.  Believe the women, this is now.  Bernie bros, getting tired of sheltering in place?  Bored?  You and Susan Sarandon.  decided to cook up a little sexual story.  that happened nearly 30 years ago.  Go f*** yourselves.  I equate the MeToo movement to the abolishing of slavery.  It will take generations to change hearts and minds.  Control over women has been going on for centuries, like slavery.  Women are awake now, and there's no going back.  March forward, ladies.  It is our time.  And this is now.  Proof of the rape or shut the f*** up!  Wow, did you see Trump saying he grabs women by the pussy?  What?  This is an outrage.  Women, women, rise up!  Did you see Biden apparently grabbed a woman by the pussy?  Oh, uh... Well, she did write about Russia a few years ago.  Again, as I'm recording this, no major news outlet has picked up on this.  Yet we had entire segments about how Bernie bros are mean to people online and send emojis. ",
