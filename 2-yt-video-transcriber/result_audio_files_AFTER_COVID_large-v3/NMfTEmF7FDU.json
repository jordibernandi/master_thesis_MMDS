            "text": "Hello everybody, today we are going to be looking at the U.S.  Senate map as of June 3rd, 2020.  Heading into the general election in 2020, the Democrats have 35 seats, to the Republicans, 30.  Those are the seats that are not up for election in this cycle.  So, without further ado, let's get right into things.  Starting out with the safe seats for the Republicans.  These will not be competitive seats for either party, um... No real contest in any of these seats.  As you can see here, that brings the Republicans up to a total of 40... Oh, I almost forgot about Alaska as well.  I will classify Alaska as a safe seat for the Republicans.  So that brings the Republicans up to 41 seats to the Democrats, 35 in terms of safe seats and uncontested seats.  As for the Democrats' safe seats, Oregon... Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Delaware.  So that puts the Republicans and the Democrats at an even 41 to 41 a piece with 18 seats competitive in this Senate election.  So first off, we're going to look at these seats that are likely to go to either party.  So these are seats that aren't necessarily safe and they will be competitive to an extent.  but the opposing party will not really expect to be winning in these seats.  starting out in texas this is a likely seat for the republicans.  incumbent republican senator john corn will in all likelihood win.  Same goes for the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky.  It is likely in Kentucky that he will win re-election, even if he is up against Democratic challenger Amy McGrath.  Obviously, there has been a lot of spending on her campaign throughout, up to her announcement even.  But in all likelihood, this race does go to Mitch McConnell by a considerable margin.  As for the Democrat seat that are likely in their column, Virginia, Democratic incumbent Mark Warner is a popular incumbent in the state of Virginia, and the Republicans have not won a statewide election in the state.  in over 10 years.  I expect that to remain true.  Same goes for Minnesota.  Democratic incumbent Tina Smith is projected to win there comfortably.  Same goes for New Mexico.  Democrat Ben Ray Lujan is projected to win there very handily.  All the polls are in both Ben Ray Lujan and Tina Smith's favor, as well as just the overall trends and political demographics in the states of Minnesota and New Mexico themselves.  Same goes for New Hampshire.  Democrat Jeanne Shaheen is projected to win there comfortably as well.  So these are all the likely states for both parties.  It brings the Democrats up to a lead, a 45 to 43 vote lead in the Senate elections.  So now we're getting into these seats that are a lot more competitive.  What we've seen so far is seats that are in all likelihood with that withstanding some sort of huge wave or some cataclysmic event ahead of the political elections in November.  These are the seats that will go to either party quite comfortably.  So now let's get into the states that are classified as lean for either party.  starting with the republicans in the states of kansas and in the states of iowa.  both of these seats are lean republican republican.  chris kobach the secretary of state in kansas is expected to defeat barbara boiler this november polls are in his favor as are obviously party demographics in kansas.  it is a regularly safe republican state in presidential elections and although Chris Kobach is generally unpopular in the state of Kansas.  I do expect him to pull through because of Donald Trump being on the ticket in the state of Kansas.  Same actually goes for Iowa.  Although many believe this will be a much more competitive race, I personally do not believe so.  Republican incumbent Joni Ernst is not necessarily extremely unpopular, and Iowa is a state that is trending more in the Republicans' favor.  especially in presidential elections where Donald Trump won by over or around 10 points in 2016.  As for the South, in Alabama as well as the Georgia normal election and in South Carolina, All three of these states could be classified as lean for the Republicans.  Typically, I would put South Carolina in the likely column for the Republicans, but recent polling there has suggested that I should classify it as more of a lean state, although I do believe that Lindsey Graham will hold onto his seat in South Carolina.  As for Alabama and for the Georgia non-special election, Doug Jones is obviously the Democratic incumbent in Alabama.  I don't believe he will hold on to that seat as much as the Democrats would hope he would.  I do believe the Republicans have a strong chance of taking that seat back, which will be extremely important in their quest to retain the House.  As well as David Perdue, the Republican incumbent in Georgia, I do believe he will hold on to his seat against, in all likelihood, Democratic challenger John Ossoff.  So those are the lean states for the Republicans.  As for the Democrats, for the lean states, I have classified Arizona as a lean state for the Democrats.  Now this may come as a shock to many if you have not been paying attention to the political sphere over the last few months, but Mark Kelly has a substantial donation fundraising and polling advantage over Martha McSally, who is incredibly unpopular within the state of Arizona and nationwide.  In all likelihood, Mark Kelly will be able to win that state, especially with Arizona's trending more democratic in recent years.  years.  So in all likelihood, Arizona will go to the Democrats.  That will be a flip for them over the Republican incumbent.  Same goes in Colorado.  I do expect it to be a lean Democratic state.  Some could classify it as more of a tilt just because we don't know exactly who the candidate is yet.  But in all likelihood, it will be John Hickenlooper.  And I do believe he is a strong, strong challenger to Cory Gardner, the Republican incumbent, not to mention the fact that Colorado is a more Democratic state than it is a Republican state.  It has gone to the Democrats in recent elections by a comfortable margin, and I do believe John Hickenlooper will win by a lean margin in Colorado.  And the final state that I will classify as lean Democrat is the state of Michigan.  Democratic incumbent Gary James is not necessarily unpopular.  He's not necessarily super popular.  Obviously, the Republican challenger, John James, is a rising star in the republican party and i do believe he has a very bright future in the political sphere but in the state of michigan where i expect joe biden to do very well given his performance in the primary there and the fact that michigan is a typically a democratic state in presidential elections barring or excluding 2016. i do believe john james and the incumbency factor will help him hold on to that seat.  so as you can see it is now down to 48 to 48 in the Senate seats.  So we have four contested seats remaining in Montana, North Carolina, Georgia Special, and Maine.  I do believe these are the four races that will be the tightest contested seats in the 2020 Senate election, starting out in Montana.  Although the Democratic candidate, Steve Bullock, is the former Montana governor there, and he's relatively popular, Not to mention that Montana has a history of electing more Democratic state officials such as senators or governors.  I do believe, however, that the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines, will hold on to the seat, but by a very, very small margin over Steve Bullock.  So do keep in mind that I do believe Montana will be a tilt Republican seat.  It's going to be a lot closer than a lot of people would probably expect out of the state of Montana in a presidential race.  race just because of the strength of the democratic candidate there.  as for the georgia special election it is hard to predict because we don't know who the candidates are going to be.  obviously we have kelly loffler doug collins matt lieberman.  those three seem to be the uh front runners for that seat.  um but we don't really know what is going to happen.  so i'm going to just have to as a tilt Republican seat because, obviously, there is a trend, especially with Joe Biden being on the ticket and his African-American support.  Georgia could be very close in the 2020 presidential election, but it is still a Republican stronghold in many ways, and I do believe that for the u.s senate it will in all likelihood go to the republicans.  but again it's hard to predict and thus i'm classifying it as a tilt for now.  but if the republican candidate uh gets any sort of momentum or steam i do think it it could widen out to more of a lean or possibly even likely margin for the republicans.  as for the state of maine now this is an extremely extremely contested race between democrats sarah gideon and of course republican incumbent susan Collins.  I have remained firm in my belief that this is probably the, I used to believe that this was the closest race in the 2020 Senate.  That was until I saw the polls and the numbers coming out of North Carolina.  I do believe these two states will by far be the, obviously the most highly anticipated and national media will be covering these two Senate seats a lot heading into the election.  But for Maine, I'm actually going to classify it as a tilt Democratic state.  And keep in mind that this is really just a prediction.  Nobody really knows what is going to happen.  But just because of the fundraising numbers, the polling numbers, and Susan Collins' horrendous favorability numbers in Maine.  I do believe that it could certainly go to the Democrats' favor, but I also believe that Susan Collins could certainly hold on to the seat.  It really is 50-50, but for the sake of the video, I'm going to be giving it to the Democrats in Maine.  As for the state of North Carolina, it is just the opposite.  I do believe it's going to be extremely close, but I'm going to have to give it to the Republicans in a tilt margin.  Republican incumbent Tom Tillis is extremely close in the polls with Democrat Cal Cunningham.  It's going to be really tightly contested, and I think it's really going to come down to how the presidential election goes nationwide and especially in the state of North Carolina, because more and more people are seeing it as a toss-up state in the presidential election.  If Joe Biden can bring that state to below, say, 0.5%, I do believe Cal Cunningham could pull out the victory.  Especially, I mean, if Joe Biden is able to pull out the victory in North Carolina, then Cal Cunningham will certainly win this Senate race here.  But saying that, I do believe that it is more of a tilt or lean Republican state in general in terms of presidential elections in years past.  Although the Democrats have a large party registration capacity, edge over the republicans in north carolina i do believe that that race is a tilt republican state as things stand right now.  so as you can see how i have it right now is 51 seats to the republicans 49 to the democrats.  however 41 to 41. that is the uh split on the safe seats uh from left to right.  it's really going to be an extremely interesting election.  not just the presidential election but the Senate election is going to be just as interesting.  Maybe not as highly covered by the media, of course.  I wouldn't expect it to be, but it's going to be extremely interesting for and have major impacts on how the country moves forward into the new decade.  So thank you guys all so much for watching.
