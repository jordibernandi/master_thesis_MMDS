            "text": "Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to a Watchman Newscast Breaking News Edition.  Now, we usually come to you from our Watchman studio every Tuesday and Thursday, but from time to time when important news breaks, we'll just come to you from our phone no matter what day of the week it is.  And we had some major breaking news out of the Middle East just last night, Tuesday, November 24th, and it's part of a story.  that we've been following very closely here on the Watchman Newscast for the past several months, and that is Israel versus the Iranian regime and Hezbollah inside Syria.  Now, just last night, Tuesday, November 24th, Israeli fighter jets struck Iranian targets once again inside Syria, south of Damascus and also in Quneitra, that village along the Israel-Syria border in the Syrian Golan Heights.  Reportedly, at least eight Iranian-backed fighters were killed in these airstrikes last night, and it comes on the heels of a series of Israeli strikes against Iran, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime inside Syria.  But folks, don't get it twisted.  These are, to my mind, defensive strikes.  by the Israel Defense Forces because the Iranian regime and its proxy Hezbollah are attempting to set up a permanent base inside Syria on Israel's doorstep from which they can attack the Jewish state and fulfill their ideological goal of wiping Israel off the map.  That is the goal, so Israel is saying, No way.  We will not allow you to do this, to set up what is an existential threat to our nation on our border.  So folks, what we have, and we saw it again last night, is a collision course.  Israel says, Iran, you must leave Syria and take your radical allies with you.  And Iran says, no.  We're not going anywhere.  We are entrenching ourselves here in Syria.  We are here to stay.  So I think you need to know about this.  You might say, well, once again, Israel strikes Iran inside Syria.  Big deal.  As we've told you here in the newscast, Israel has carried out hundreds, literally hundreds of airstrikes against Iran and Hezbollah and their various radical Shia allies inside Syria over the past few years.  But folks, what happened last night?  And what happened last week there, which we'll review in a minute, is very important because as we've told you here many times on the newscast, the Middle East right now, in particular to the north of Israel, in southern Lebanon and in Syria, those Iran-Hezbollah power bases, It's an absolute powder keg.  And folks, look, anything could spark a major regional war.  Any incident like we saw last night, an airstrike, a thwarted terror attack like we saw last week along that border could spark a larger confrontation.  And that is something you need to know about.  Hey, in terms of last week.  And that's why it's important today.  We wanted to follow up just on our phone here, not in studio as usual.  But again, before the Thanksgiving holiday starts here in the United States, I really thought you'd want an update because it is following up on a thread.  And just last week here in the newscast, you can check our archives here on YouTube while you're there.  be sure to subscribe and click that notification bell so you get alerts every time a new video is posted.  we're bringing you the kinds of cutting edge timely information that you're not hearing in the mainstream media.  did anyone out here hear about this airstrike last night?  israel striking iran inside syria?  call me crazy.  i think that's kind of a big deal.  but last week as i mentioned A similar incident, and we reported it here on the newscast, Israel struck Iranian targets and Assad regime targets, a major series of airstrikes inside Syria in response.  Key word there, ladies and gentlemen, in response, two words, I guess, in response to Iranian-backed fighters planting explosive devices along the Israel-Syria border in the exact spot on the Golan where Israeli forces frequently patrol.  Now, God forbid, if an Israeli soldier stepped on one of these explosive devices, the intent clearly by the Iranian regime was to maim and murder Israeli soldiers.  Israel, rightfully so, responded in tremendous fashion and struck Iranian military assets and bases and as well as the Assad regime, their targets inside Syria.  And that's a key point.  Because just as in Lebanon, where the Lebanese government is essentially hosting Hezbollah, right?  Southern Lebanon is that Hezbollah stronghold.  Israel says to Lebanon, hey, you are culpable as well for whatever happens between Israel and Hezbollah.  Lebanon, the central government in Beirut, you are responsible because you are allowing Hezbollah to entrench itself in southern Israel and in the suburbs outside of Beirut.  Similarly, Israel says to the Iran regime, or I'm sorry, to the Syrian regime, hey, Assad, you have allowed Iran and Hezbollah and these various Iran-backed jihadists to come into Syria, to save your hide, by the way, in the Syrian civil war, and to set up shop on our border, on the Golan Heights.  So Assad, whatever happens, we're holding you responsible as well.  I think that's a very wise policy.  Think back to 9-11, folks.  when the Afghan government, the Taliban, hosted al-Qaeda.  What did the United States say?  Hey, give them up, get them out of your country, or you are also being held responsible.  That's what the U.S.  said to the Taliban, and I think that's a wise and appropriate move.  The tinderbox there continues to spark, I guess you would say, on Israel's northern border with Syria.  And just this morning, in the wake of these airstrikes last night, just this morning, Wednesday, November 25th, Israel dropped leaflets on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, warning the people living there and in particular the Syrian military which is stationed near the Golan Heights warning them that Iran and Hezbollah are attempting to set up a permanent base in that region and that Israel will not allow them.  So what Israel's saying?  and dropping these leaflets?  it's telling Syrian civilians who live along that border hey don't even think of giving these folks safe harbor.  and more importantly it's sending a message to the Syrian military And by extension, the Assad regime, once again, hey guys, if Iran and Hezbollah carry out, God forbid, a terror attack or some kind of missile attack from your territory inside Syria that maims and murders Israelis on our side of the border, You Syria, you Assad regime, you Syrian military will be held accountable.  So it's a very clear message from Israel.  As I said last week and a few people commented here, Iran never gets the memo.  But I said Iran does not seem to be getting the memo because every time they're trying something in that border area between Israel and Syria, Israel is responding with tremendous force.  We could cite example after example over the past several months, over the past few years, really, when this has happened.  I think back, folks, to May 2018, when Israel carried out a series of airstrikes against Iranian assets inside Syria.  I was there the day after the airstrikes.  I was on the Golan Heights interviewing the Israel Defense Forces for our Watchman TV show.  So this has been going on for quite some time, and it's interesting because what it's doing is it's pitting Israel and Iran against each other directly.  Now, for decades, obviously, Iran operated against Israel through proxy, in particular Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.  Now that Iran is in Syria, there's been some direct competition conflict between Israel and Iran, not only through the proxies, but directly.  Israel has directly struck Iran where it hurts.  Iranian assets, killed Iranian military and Revolutionary Guards Corps figures and officials there in Syria.  So things are heating up.  And it's kind of been a slow burn in some respects.  But when something like this happens, we feel the need to give you a breaking news update.  Number one, because, hey, just from a good journalistic sense, we're following the story.  We have to follow up.  If something happens in this area that we're focusing so much here on the newscasts, then we have to update you.  We owe it to our Watchman Newscast viewers.  And number two, I know that the mainstream media will give this scant coverage.  And that's why you're coming to us.  And that's why we're proud and honored to fulfill and serve in this role for you to be Watchman on the wall for such a time as this.  Because as we've said many times here, that great Northern War is coming where a larger conflict is imminent.  Somewhere in the future, we hope it's far off, but I'm not so sure it is, when Israel will have to face off against Iran, Hezbollah and their various radical allies in Syria and also in southern Lebanon.  Kind of a climactic battle, I guess you could say, to Israel's north.  It's a question not of if, but when.  And that's not me saying it, folks.  That's Israeli officials saying it.  saying that.  so every time we have one of these incidents up there to israel's north we want to bring it to you because you never know what the repercussions and the fallout could bring and if it could spark something much bigger.  by the way as we wrap up here on that note real quick We continue to have persistent reports, who knows how credible they are, that perhaps President Trump is considering striking Iran, some kind of strike maybe against Iran's nuclear facilities, maybe some other asset inside Iran.  So pretty interesting.  We don't know how much credence we put in these reports, but that continues to be reported in various outlets.  So we will keep a close eye on that.  You know, clearly, if President Trump only has two months left in office, if, still a big if, There's going to be a Biden presidency.  Obviously, Joe Biden has talked about reentering that Iran nuclear deal, which would empower the Iranian regime.  Once again, I think that would be a disastrous move.  So President Trump, I think, he may be saying, Wow, if I leave office, again, a big if.  Everything's still hashing out here, obviously, with the election in the United States.  But if I am to go, I don't want to leave Iran strong and getting stronger.  Who knows?  So that's something we'll also continue to follow.  We mentioned it on the newscast last week, I believe, too.  I think it was last Thursday's newscast.  You can check out in our archives.  We got a little more in-depth on that, a possible U.S.  strike against Iran.  Who knows what's going to go on there.  Hey, quick note.  Tomorrow, Thursday, November 26th, is Thanksgiving Day here in the United States.  Happy Thanksgiving, first of all, to everyone out there.  But secondly, we will have a brand new Watchmen newscast tomorrow.  Every Tuesday and Thursday, we faithfully keep to that.  So tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day, but it is a Thursday, so we will have a new newscast for you.  We'll be back in studio.  And it's kind of a fun one.  We're talking some heavy stuff this week, obviously.  Iran and Hezbollah and airstrikes and all that stuff.  But tomorrow is something I think will encourage and edify you.  We're talking biblical archaeology in Jerusalem.  I was on the ground not too long ago, and we're going to give you an on-the-ground, up-close look at some amazing archaeological finds in Jerusalem.  that reveal what life was like in Jerusalem some 2,600 years ago during the time of the first temple period, and in particular, at the time that the Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, destroyed the first temple, we have on the ground, firsthand, archaeological proof for those events that are described in your bible so you will not want to miss it tomorrow.  on the newscast i believe we're uh posting it a bit earlier tomorrow thanksgiving day 9 a.m eastern time.  that's thursday november 26th.  be on the lookout for it right here on our youtube channel subscribe and hit the notification bell while you are at it and we will continue to bring you these breaking updates.  folks what happens in the middle east does not stay in the middle east.  this is information you need to know and we will continue to bring it to you on a regular basis right here on the watchman newscast until tomorrow.  happy thanksgiving.  god bless you and remember never hold your peace.
