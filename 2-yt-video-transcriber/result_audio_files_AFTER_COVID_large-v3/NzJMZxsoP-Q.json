            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  My ministry assistants have come to pick me up.  We're gonna be visiting some shut-ins and taking some cheer and pray with people who are elderly and shut in.  I had the opportunity to speak with Brother Todd.  And Brother Todd, you are a blessing.  That brother, you can't talk to him and not be encouraged.  So I just wanted to give a shout out.  Love you, bro.  Brother Todd shared information that I had received And he also shared a scripture, which while it may not apply to this scenario, It has a similar effect.  So, and I will have Allie in a moment read that.  If you have not heard, this is major, prophetically speaking.  Israel has gone into a complete, or going into a complete lockdown through the fall feast.  That is Rosh Hashanah, Yom Teruah, or Feast of Trumpets.  Day of Atonement and Feast of Tabernacles.  And here's what's significant.  This is three days.  This will be three days.  this will happen, occur, at the signing of the Abrahamic Accord between the United Arab Emirates and Yisrael.  Now, this is significant.  We're seeing, remember, we're transitioning from one dispensation to another.  So we're seeing... not that that's the peace deal but these things are leading up to it and you know how significant that is.  but what's significant is there will be no prayers from the western wall.  there will be.  no they're not going to be able to gather and the religious leaders have agreed to this.  this Also, in light of many of the significant well-known rabbis saying they are already meeting with Mashiach, we know it's not the Messiah.  If they're meeting with anyone, it would be the Antichrist because... excuse me, Jesus Christ, Messiah, Yeshua HaMashiach, already came 2,000 years ago and won the victory.  Hallelujah.  He shed his precious blood to pay the debt for our sins once and for all, died, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  The nanosecond you believe on him, you are saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  And so this is really significant.  Now, Brother Tom pointed out that scripture again.  He's not saying and I'm not saying this is that prophecy being fulfilled.  But what we're saying is it is there are things that you see a type or pattern and the morning that's coming.  Go ahead and read Amos 8.3, Allie. ",

But anyway, again, we're not saying that's the fulfillment.  But boy, when Brother Todd shared that with me, it's okay.  I just, I rejoiced.  And we are seeing prophecies jump off the pages of the Bible.  This is huge, brothers and sisters, that they are locking down for the fall feast.  We are seeing things moved at warp speed, and we always want to bring you what's going on in the geopolitical that ties to the prophetic.  Again, we love you all.  God loves you fiercely and passionately.  Before I let these guys say goodbye to you, is there anything you want to add, Allie?  Yeah. ",
