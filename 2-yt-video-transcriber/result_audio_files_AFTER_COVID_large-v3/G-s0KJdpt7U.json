            "text": "man i have a word for you mr president.  forgive my appearance.  i was gonna fix my hair and clean myself up.  i was sitting here crying because i was so nervous but i know this is from god and i'm gonna wait for a couple people to log in and i hope that you guys share this.  i know this is from god.  Forgive me if I get emotional.  I just was crying before I even started this video.  Everyone sees what's going on in the world right now.  And the Lord has given me specific instructions.  And this is not something that I take lightly.  I know people are gonna mock and people are going to make fun, but I'm just gonna obey the Lord.  President Trump, You are living in what the Bible calls perilous times.  And at this point in time, you, the eyes of the world is on you.  And that is the way that God has allowed it to be.  And I'm going to try to refrain myself from doing too much talking.  And I'm just going to show you what God gave me in the scripture for you.  And then I'm going to give you the instructions on how you need to handle this Corona virus thing.  I'm going to read a couple of verses from Isaiah 45.  Now, President Trump, we all know, you know, your past has been there for the world to see.  And I don't know what your relationship is with God.  I don't know if you seek him.  I don't know if you you pray.  But the Bible says that God raises up kings.  He allows.  he has allowed you to be in office at this time.  It's not anything but God that you are where you are because God is the one that raises and tears down kings.  And this is what the Lord told me to tell you.  Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, Isaiah 45, to Cyrus, whose right hand have I hold, and to subdue nations before him.  I will loose the loins of the king to open before him two-leaf gates, and the gates shall not be shut.  I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight.  I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut and sunder the bars of iron, and I will give thee The treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places.  that thou may know is that I, the Lord, which called thee by name, am the God of Israel.  For Jacob, my servant's sake, and Israel, mine elect, I have called thee by name.  I have surnamed thee.  Though thou hast not known me, I am the Lord and there is none else.  There is no God beside me.  I girded thee though thou hast not known me.  that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me.  I am the Lord and there is none else.  I form the light and create darkness.  I make peace and create evil.  I, the Lord, do all these things.  Drop down the heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness.  Let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together.  I, the Lord, have created it.  As you see here, it says that he's God alone and he makes peace and he creates evil.  And he is talking to a man that does not truly know him.  And he's saying, I'm about to use you to accomplish my will.  And this is an Isaiah 45.  And then where the Lord took me was to the book of Ezra.  And I'm just going to read you verses one through five.  Now, when the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord steered up.  the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing.  You are getting ready.  What God wants you to do is to make a proclamation to all the kingdom.  Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia, the Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of earth and he has charged me to build him a house of Jerusalem, which is in Judah.  Who is there among you of all his people?  His God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah.  Now you can have your people read you the rest down to verse five.  But what the Lord showed me.  is in the spirit.  Through this coronavirus, as you've seen, he says, I create evil.  He is humbling the whole world right now.  The whole world is looking for hope.  They're looking for healing.  They're looking for answer.  They're looking for a savior.  And he's saying, there is no one else but me.  And here he used King Cyrus.  He put him in the position and he told the children of Israel to go build the temple.  President Trump.  In verse 5, it says, the priests were steered up.  God has allowed the coronavirus to happen to humble the whole world, to humble these lukewarm preachers, to humble the proud preachers, to humble everybody to realize that we cannot do it without him.  And because of what King Cyrus did, the proclamation that he made, it says the priests were stirred up in their spirit and they said, let us go build the house of the Lord again because the house of the Lord had been destroyed.  Now watch this.  I'm gonna take you one more place in the word of God.  Second Chronicles chapter seven.  This is when King Solomon had just built the temple and it says the glory of God filled the temple.  Verse 13, if I shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and I will.  Heal their land.  President Trump, what God told me to say in this video, whether you watch it directly or somebody shows it to you, you are to go and declare just like you did a national day of prayer because the eyes of the world are watching you.  The eyes of the world, they watch America.  You are to go declare a national day.  of repentance for all of America and us as individuals.  pastors you must do the same.  God is calling for repentance.  there is wickedness in the earth and I've been saying for the last couple years repent and For the kingdom of God is at hand.  There is wickedness in the church.  There is wickedness in the world.  And the Lord told me to tell you, Mr.  President, that people are not going to be happy about it because the spirit of the Antichrist is flowing against you.  They don't want God in government.  they don't want God mentioned in the schools.  the last thing that they would want you to do is to get up on that platform and declare to the whole world because their eyes are on you that we need to repent and every single individual including me we need to repent.  God has allowed this coronavirus and people are mocking and saying it's no big deal.  he's allowed it to humble everybody Even those who don't believe in God, the Bible says.  a fool says in his heart that there is no God.  We have people like Madonna and other celebrities.  They are shook with all the money they have.  They are shook.  I seen this video from Madonna.  She said it's the equalizer.  The coronavirus is the equalizer and it's doing that one thing.  It is humbling those.  who see and hear.  But for those who think, oh, I don't have to pay attention.  I don't have to humble myself.  I don't have to repent.  The Lord is not pleased with what we've done in America.  President Trump, God showed me that you are a wall that is holding back the things to come and it will come, but it doesn't have to come right now.  This will pass but we must repent as a nation.  Every, every nation, every continent, we need to cry out to God and he will heal our land and he will give us another chance.  Because just as, listen to me, pastors, when Solomon built the temple, God's glory filled it, but it was destroyed.  Then King Cyrus came and he sent them.  And it says in verse five, I believe it's in the New Living Translation, that their heart was stirred up, the heart of the priests.  You pastors are going to have to get away from being politically correct and preaching motivational messages.  God is not pleased.  He's not pleased with the pride.  He's not pleased with the lust.  He's not pleased with the agenda that is going on.  And the last thing that I must show you, President Trump, I drove away from my home and the Lord told me to show you this and I'm going to be obedient.  Don't mock, don't ridicule.  Be careful what you guys say.  The Lord told me to come to this park and show you this.  And I was very nervous.  I did not want to do this video, but I have to show you something.  Saints, I would encourage you to begin to just pray a prayer of repentance.  God has allowed you to be locked in your homes and shut down so that we have to put our eyes on God.  Sports has been shut down.  The idols have been cast down.  now he it's like the world is literally begging for the sons of god to stand up.  the real ones not the fake ones not the politically correct ones not the ones that are using jesus for a business to make money.  god is humbling.  he's humbling the whole world.  you see the bible verse i read.  it says he creates the evil and he creates the peace.  president trump what god wanted me to show you is this water fountain right here now.  A couple weeks ago, the Lord told me that as the temperature begins to rise, so will the spiritual activity.  When I come over here and I press this, no water is coming out, right?  Nothing is flowing.  The Lord says if we repent, he will allow his healing waters to begin to flow.  But as long as we keep trying to press this button, looking for a fix and looking for a solution, it's not going to happen.  It is only the living waters of God that can bring life back to this land.  No matter what else you guys try to do, the eyes of the world are on you, Mr.  President, and the Lord wants you to declare to the world to repent.  A national day of repentance.  And you are going to get a lot of backlash because the spirit of the Antichrist and the prince of this air is dominating.  But do this.  And for all of those that are watching this right now, forgive me.  I know I look wild and I look crazy, but repent.  For the kingdom of God is at hand.  And I'm not saying that, oh, doomsday, he's coming tomorrow.  But we are living in the end times.  And the Bible says, when you see these things happening, look to the sky for your redemption draweth nigh.  He's soon to return.  And I will also tell you this.  The Lord told me, I'm getting away from the president.  I want to talk to you guys as an individual.  The Lord told me.  that if we build it in this season he will bless it.  as you are locked in your homes the first thing that you need to do is to repent.  then you need to begin to seek him with your whole heart and he's going to begin to birth something inside of you.  and just like with jonah when he was in the well when he came out of the well he was shut in in the well.  when he came out of the well whole cities were saved.  there's gonna be such a great revival after this coronavirus has went out.  God is going to pour out his spirit like never before because the world is primed.  what has happened with this coronavirus is people are looking for an answer and the Antichrist is building a stage so that he can come in and say look can fix this.  but God has also primed the harvest for when we come out.  just like when Jesus came out of the grave he had all power in his hand.  just like when Joseph came out the prison he got a promotion.  just like when Jonah came out of the well.  okay whole cities were saved.  I preached a message the other day about the four lepers.  They said, shall we sit here and die?  This is not the time to sit here and let your dreams die.  This is not the time to let your joy die.  They said they had to make moves and they went into the enemy's camp and the word of the Lord went forth from the prophet.  And he said at the gates of Samaria, there would be provision.  And when I looked up what Samaria meant, it said watch mountain.  And the Lord told me to tell the people that the gate provision is on the mountain.  and just like with Abraham when he climbed the mountain when we climbed the mountain there was provision with the ram in the bush.  so the gate of your provision okay is found at the mountain.  that's where you access it.  Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand.  He is about to bring his kingdom down to this earth like never before.  humble yourselves Turn away from this religious stuff that we're doing.  that is getting in the way of God and it's just like Joel, too.  He's about to pour out his spirit upon all flesh.  We're gonna see dreams.  We're gonna see visions.  You better not be skeptical.  You better not be religious or you are going to miss it.  what he is about to do is When we come out of this, I love you guys.  Be blessed.  Share this video and be encouraged in Jesus' name.  Do not be afraid for God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.  He's in control.  Coronavirus, all of it, it's in his hand.  It hasn't escaped his hands.  He's not surprised.  As I read at the beginning of this video, he said, I create the evil and I create the peace. ",
