            "text": "A couple of months ago, a federal judge in Washington, D.C.  sentenced nine persons to prison terms of up to ten years for a variety of crimes to which they had pleaded guilty.  Which may not sound unusual on the face of it, except that these nine were among the top leaders of a religion.  The Church of Scientology.  Along came an unknown group calling itself United Churches of Florida looking for a place to settle.  Well, it turned out that United Churches was in fact the Church of Scientology.  And that initial deception infuriated these citizens of Clearwater.  Their former mayor, Gabe Cazares, was bitterly skeptical of the church.  L. Ron Hubbard has stated that Scientology is extremely wealthy, that it has the money to buy cities and even countries.  That destructive cult has to know that sparkling clear water is not for sale.  The mayor continued his attacks, and for his pains, he was placed on the church enemies list.  They set out to smear him with sexual innuendo to ruin him politically.  I read to him from a church memo, culled from documents we acquired in our investigation.  The purpose of this operation is to actually get real documentation into the files of Mexican licensed bureau or bureaus stating that the mayor got married in Mexico to some Mexican gal 25 years ago who is not his wife, so puts the mayor in a position of bigamy.  This can be accomplished either by a bribe or a covert action.  So what you're saying was that they were trying to destroy your character, assassinate your character?  Without question.  Reporter Betty Orsini was doggedly pursuing the story of the church's undercover campaign in Clearwater.  So the St.  Petersburg Times wound up on their enemies list.  Scientologists stole files from the paper's legal offices.  Its reporters and editors were harassed.  Only, says editor Eugene Patterson, only because the St.  Petersburg Times was covering a news story. ",

Among them was Scientology, a church not known for turning the other cheek.  Cynthia Kisser says the church's final assault on Cannes began when hundreds of Scientologists from around the country wrote virtually identical letters asking to become members of Cannes.  Included among them was this model letter with instructions to be put in your own words.  Hearing, she says, the church was out to take control of Cannes, Hisser denied their applications to join.  Kahn was then hit with a barrage of lawsuits by individual Scientologists claiming religious discrimination.  I got hit with 12 suits in one week.  In all, Kahn was hit with more than 50 lawsuits.  Even though most of the suits were eventually dropped or won by Kahn, she says the cost of defending them, nearly $2 million, drove Kahn to the brink of bankruptcy.  Today, Kahn is under new management.  Last year, a member of the church bought Can's name, logo, and hotline number in bankruptcy court for $20,000.  Hello, Cult Awareness Network.  Now when you call looking for information about a cult, chances are the person you're talking to is a Scientologist. ",
