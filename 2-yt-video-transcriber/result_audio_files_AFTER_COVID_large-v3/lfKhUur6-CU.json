This is actually public property.  That's right, which is funded by the taxpayers.  So this is publicly accessible property, am I right?  Until we're done.  Huh?  Well, we was just talking to that officer over there.  He just jumped his vehicle with the squad car and then he just left.  And we were standing over there having a conversation with him.  After I was just inside.  Huh?  I have to leave.  Why?  This is publicly accessible property.  This is funded by the taxpayers.  If the public can come on this property, I can come on this property with a camera and record.  Absolutely.  I had business.  I was inside.  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I left him a voicemail.  So.  Well, I'm not lingering.  I just walked through the public.  Look, look, look at the public.  Look, if the public can park here and walk up to the door, then that means this is publicly accessible property.  You have no signs saying, yes, sir, you do, for public property.  How you doing?  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  What's your first name?  Huh?  What's your name?  My friends call me Spanky Pants.  Spanky, I'm Ron.  Nice to meet you, Ron.  Hey, I got a question.  Sure.  I mean, you guys understand that this is publicly accessible property, right?  The public can come on here, come up to the door, come inside.  Okay.  I'm talking with him.  Why do I have to go?  So if I want to stay right here on publicly accessible property, why not?  Why not?  Why can't I stay?  I was conducting business, ma'am.  I am recording.  Hey, you know what?  Your license plates are recorded.  I didn't touch the sign.  A single door handle.  It's all on video, so.  And you have cameras everywhere, right?  You have halo cameras there, there.  So, I mean.  Okay, so I need your name and your badge number.  Is that why you tell the judge you see it, sir?  Because I'm not doing anything illegal.  I'm not committing a crime.  No, no, no, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  I'm not angry.  Who said I was angry?  You guys are making assumptions.  I need your name and badge number, your name and badge number.  After I get your name and badge number.  Okay, sir, it's not that way.  It is that way because this is public access.  You're being very hostile.  No, I'm not, ma'am.  You're courting and tracking and you're checking door handles.  I didn't touch nobody's door handle, ma'am.  You are making assumptions.  I have it on video.  Everything on video since I walked into this parking lot.  So listen, listen, listen.  No, no.  No, listen, let's calm down and have a conversation.  I tried to help you.  I did.  I just came in there and conducted my business.  And my other business is public photography for publicly accessible property.  Sir, give me your ID because we have a complaint that you were checking a door handle.  No, ma'am.  No, ma'am.  Go look at your video camera and see if I did it, ma'am.  Don't tell me what I need to do.  Lieutenant Pierce, get it right.  Lieutenant Pierce, what's your badge number?  You see it on there.  No, I don't.  What if I'm illiterate and I can't read?  This is what I'm saying, guys.  No, ma'am.  I just had a great conversation with an officer right here.  We had a great conversation.  And we just talked about officers' attitudes.  And look how you guys are approaching me.  Because you're being rude.  I'm not being rude.  It's all on video.  I have not been rude one time.  You guys have been rude.  What's your name and badge number?  Well, because, guys, look, I'm not being hostile.  No, look, the public, I didn't touch nobody's door handle.  Quit making accusations.  So, huh?  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Don't you touch me.  I didn't touch your door handle.  I have it on video.  Look at these clowns, guys.  Now I'm fixing to be a hot dog.  You guys are a bunch of clowns.  You guys are a bunch of clowns.  You guys are a bunch of clowns.  You all are a bunch of clowns.  A bunch of fucking clowns.  Ain't nobody being investigated.  You go do your investigation.  You can kick rocks.  You ain't getting no ID.  Kick rocks.  No, ma'am.  You can kick rocks.  You have no right to get my ID.  Go conduct your investigation, and if you find it that I touched somebody's head, go ahead and shut up. ",

I don't understand why you're doing it.  It's all over the country now.  Right, absolutely it is.  But why?  Why here?  For this reason right here.  You see how all these guys acted?  We don't have these problems.  You see how all these guys acted because I got a camera?  That's why.  That's the problem.  We just had a great conversation with an officer right there, and he didn't mind our cameras.  He had a great conversation with us.  He was super cool.  And then you guys come out here like a bunch of tyrants that think you can boss the public around in public when they're not breaking the law.  Okay, you have no authority over the public until we break the law.  period.  Other than that, you're a public servant.  I didn't touch your door handles.  I got it on video.  I don't care what somebody over here called and said.  You got cameras right there that see me the whole time and I guarantee not a single one of those cameras see me touch a door handle.  So quit making accusations.  And if you think I did, then go look at your cameras and see if I did.  And then if I did, then come out here and then we can talk.  You're going to get people doing exactly what you're doing, right?  Well, I'm not trying to get anything.  I just want to be left alone.  That's what I want, just to be left alone to do what I'm legally allowed to do.  The public is... We'll talk, but you just want to argue with everything.  Well, because there's nothing to discuss.  That's why I understand that aren't quite right upstairs in our country to give them ideas.  That's like blaming gun manufacturers for all the gun violence in America.  You can't do it.  People are going to do what they're going to do.  We're not out here to encourage anybody to break the law, commit a crime, commit acts of violence, or any of that.  We want police accountability and transparency.  We want our law enforcement to know the law and the Constitution. ",
