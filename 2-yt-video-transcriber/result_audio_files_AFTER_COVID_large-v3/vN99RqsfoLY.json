But, you know, I grew up seeing it, so you get that sort of feedback.  And I loved Mike Wallace.  I thought he was the best ever.  He's like, if you ask me who I want to be like, that's who I want to be like, Mike Wallace.  But anyway, Leslie Stahl, when I watched her on the unedited 37 Minutes, my main takeaway was the 60 Minutes.  producers are so much better than we've been giving them credit for.  Like, they took this... woman.  And I'm sorry to rip on her, but who sounded whiny and petulant and immature and biased and unprepared.  And they somehow wind up slicing and dicing it to the point where we have this image of a professional, smooth, polished, tough interviewer.  Um, but she like I can give you 10 examples.  One just off the top of my head is like she's pressing him on why he doesn't make the people who go to the Donald Trump rallies wear masks.  You're very powerful.  Why?  Why don't you tell them?  And, you know, Trump, he never hits it right on the head.  He's just kind of like, oh, I tell him, I tell him.  It's like, why didn't he look at her and say, Leslie, I'm not their daddy.  They understand that masks and social distancing are what is recommended.  I don't run through the crowds and say, and you and you and you.  That is not my job.  They're grownups.  They can make their own.  And just her.  Her whininess on the subject betrayed her bias and hatred for Trump.  Yes.  But it went down the line on every question. ",

Like there's no, right, if you don't hear the bear in the woods or whatever, however the saying goes, there is there there.  And now we've heard it from enough witnesses who were involved in it and the DNI saying this is not Russian disinformation, that the press has run out of excuses to not try to cover it.

You go through the chain of custody to figure out how you got the emails and then understanding that you're not going to get that laptop.  You're not going to get the original source because the FBI has it.  You disclose that to your audience and you say, look, This is what we did to try to satisfy ourselves.  This is a real story.  There is this asterisk because no one's going to be able to see the actual laptop and let the viewers decide whether they think this is credible or not credible.

But for them to say there's no story, especially at this time, my question is, Did Donald Trump do enough?

So it's just.  it's really outrageous that they they should be so openly biased and show absolutely zero interest to actually investigate major facts in a presidential race.  Shame on them.  But I do think this race is in large in large ways between Donald Trump and the media.  And I think.  They've completely declared against him, and it's really hard for him to break through because I think a lot of independents, those are the only persuadables, maybe some working class Democrats are.  They watch CNN thinking this is the news, like this is, I'm getting the news.  They know if they watch MSNBC, they're getting left-wing bias.  But I think there's still a hangover reputation for CNN that it might just be real news instead of MSNBC under different call letters.  And so if I were Trump, if I, you know, if I were advising Trump, I would have said, Mr.  President, before you go out there tonight, you have to assume they don't know anything about this.  People are living their lives.  They're not obsessing about Hunter Biden.  Trust me.  So if you want to make this point, you're going to have to.  you're going to have to sort of forgive the term, dumb it down so that people who aren't steeped in news can get it and can get it easily.  Like, let me tell you, members of the American public, this guy's as corrupt as they come.  He says he had no business dealings with his son, Hunter, who's deeply troubled.  Well, he has.  And now we know because of a laptop that Hunter Biden gave to some repairman and never picked up that Hunter Biden was cutting deals in Ukraine.  He was trying to cut deals in China, some of which looped Joe Biden in as a monetary participant.  some of which looped him in as just the guy who needed to do something so Hunter could get paid while Biden was vice president.  Either way you look at it, it's totally corrupt.  And the media blackout of the story shows you, American people, that it's you and me working against them. ",

I think she managed the two candidates as well as anyone could.  Yeah.  But I do think some of her left wing bias was reflected in the overwhelming number of times she interrupted Trump instead of Biden and in the topic selection.  I mean, why wouldn't we be talking about what's happening in the Middle East or Afghanistan?  And instead, once again, back to Black Lives Matter and race.  I mean, this is like the the left is obsessed.  They are obsessed with pigmentation and racism.  genitalia.  it's like everything is seen through the the lens of like lady parts and pigmentation.  i'm sick of it.  it's like we've covered this now at so many debates.  i can't believe she didn't ask him the you've refused to condemn.  i know i know i know but she got around to you know like you've said this stuff about black lives matter again.  not a question to joe biden about where's his condemnation for antifa which actually is causing riots in the streets right now.  So it is frustrating to me as somebody who's more in the middle, the way the news media approaches \u2013 forget Donald Trump because he's controversial, but just Republicans in general.  But I thought understanding that the bias is baked in, she did about as well as you could expect from somebody who's probably leaning over that way. ",

And she lost the race.  So don't let anyone tell you that just because Joe Biden is pulling ahead, even in the swing States, he's got this thing locked up.  He doesn't.  And I actually think there's even more reason this time around to doubt the polls than the last time, because people have been more shamed than ever to say that they like Donald Trump.  People are getting kicked out of their sororities for saying that they're getting their hands slapped on Twitter.  Their companies are getting, they're getting fired.  If they like a tweet that is controversial about black lives matter, like, Our whole society is cracked down on freedom of opinion, and I think they're more afraid than ever to say how they really feel.
