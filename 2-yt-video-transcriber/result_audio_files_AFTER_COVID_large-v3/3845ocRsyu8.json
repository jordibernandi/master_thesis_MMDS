I feel like they haven't seen that softness.  A friend of mine who's a mom said, do you think black women are so strong with their sons that black men tend to go with another race because they're not getting that support? ",

And we're trying our damnedest, especially for single moms.  to prepare you for a world that will not love you.  So we tend to be hard, but he told his mentor, he said, my mom is always so hard on me.  Like we go to a restaurant and she wants to get on me and attack me.  And sometimes I just want to have fun with my mom.  And it made me, it made me.  I did, but Lisa Rae, it doesn't change, like, all of the stuff that I'm trying to prepare.  And I got a small window.  Like, Garcelle, our kids are the same age.  We don't have a large window for the preparation.  And I know that I'm hard on him, but I just want him to be able to get out there and go, my mom told me this.  Because my son has already told me he likes white girls because they're softer, he says.  Like, there's a little black girl in his school that goes... he says mommy she always moves her neck and she says my name not camellia and he hates when i move my neck.  he's already said i like and so in our being tough on them does it drive them to women of other races.

And also sweet and loving as a mom, but strong.  And that balance sometimes can be tricky.  Sometimes I go to bed and I cry because I'm like, I didn't handle it right.  I could have been softer.  I could have been more compassionate.  And, of course, there are times I go to bed and I go, I did a great job today. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Anyway, you know, I actually listened to that clip to the whole show because I wanted the clip of Lisa Rae talking about her wanting to share eggplant with Jada.  So that originally was the reason that I listened to it.  But, you know, since you were there, you might as well listen to the whole show.  There might be something else that they talk about.  And they were entertaining to see three high status women basically chop it up about, you know, men and aging and stuff like that.  and this particular clip was towards the end because every now and then you know they have a moment of clarity and they brought up that moment of clarity about the strong black women the strong black woman.  and since I was just talking to sister George on the Roger report live shout out to the Roger report I'll put the link in the description where we're actually chopping it up.  we're actually going back and forth with this with black women and black women really not changing or being resistant to change.  And I asked Sister George, do black women really like their men?  Because it doesn't appear so because they're so resistant to change, even though it's clear that black men do not like the behavior that they're displaying.  And lots of times we hear guys talk about it, and you hear some women talk about it, but never high profile women like this, not out loud.  And you just heard three high-profile women, high, you know, two of them 100 octane, Garcelle and Lisa Rae, as high as you can get, bad bitches.  And Sherri Shepherd, who was a high 92.  But it shows you how, no matter how high you go, That attitude is the threat of that attitude is throughout the whole the whole community.  How high you go, how low you go.  You can get them to perform like they're like they're submissive.  But inside that defiance, the defiance that the book, the black film in the United States by Frazier.  where the phrase you talked about the defiance that was in black women way back in during slavery and coming out through emancipation and into Jim Crow and into the modern era never went away.  It's still there.  And they're so resistant to give it up.  And they usually say that this is the kind of women that black black men really desire.  And it's clear.  it's clear that they don't.  Sherry Shepard just came out and said her son likes white women or others.  And he gave a clear reason, the same reason that a 60 year old dude like me would say.  And this kid ain't but like 12 or 13, the exact same thing.  They displayed never negative behavior.  The white woman noticed this.  That's how it came up.  That white women noticed this.  So everybody's telling black women about this behavior, but they are so intent on not giving it up.  Even toward the end of that clip, they're trying to figure out how can they keep this attitude and keep this defiance and perform the kinder, softer thing.  Black women always say that it is the men that control this attitude.  It's the men that control this.  In other words, unless we grab them by the nape of the neck, the scruff of the neck, and mash their face down into it, they will not do it.  And they're going to fight and claw not to do it.  And the black men in the younger generations have given up.  You don't have to change.  And that's what black women are not seeing.  You don't have to change.  You don't have to be anything that you don't want to be.  You ain't got to change for us.  You ain't got to change for nobody.  You don't have to change.  But guess what?  Black men do not have to put up with it.  They don't have to put up with it anymore.  If you want to be the strong, independent, aggressive boss chick that wears the pants, as they said at the very end, that wears the pants, you can be that.  Sherri Shepherd's husband had to leave, even though she was the biggest earner.  But he couldn't take it anymore.  He had to go.  Couldn't pay him to stay.  All three of those women are single.  And two of them were some of the prettiest women on the planet.  They were married, but they couldn't keep a husband.  That should be an indictment on the whole group.  And I'm not saying that black men should give up on them.  That is your individual choice.  But I said in another video, this is who they are.  These are your women.  This is who they are.  You have to accept them as they are or you're going to have to find a new group.  Stop complaining about it.  They're not going to, you know, what I'm saying is it's not that sometimes, you know, I was talking to Sister George.  I think they want to change.  But I don't think they can.  I think the cultural momentum is such that they don't know any better.  Or even when they get a peak that they're doing something wrong, this behavior is so ingrained and so passed down that they simply cannot, cannot, cannot change.  Cannot muster the energy to even think about changing.  And the little bit of change that they're making is way too slow.  You can't even get them to eat healthy and lose weight.  I was just on a Facebook page.  Normally, I don't comment on this kind of stuff, which is probably why I left Facebook in the first place, because women be saying some bullshit.  But they were talking about a young girl in a bikini thirst trapping, right, on Facebook.  That's very common, right?  And they were saying that do not date insecure men.  If they don't allow you to thirst trap on Facebook, then they're insecure and you shouldn't date them.  And I agree, you shouldn't date them.  Because I said it on the Facebook page, it's disrespectful to For a woman that you committed to, to be thirst trapping on Facebook, it's disrespectful because she represents you.  And nobody wants to see the comments about men telling this girl how fat her ass is.  And she's supposed to be your girl.  That makes you look bad.  Now, normally, you would think that a woman that would post up like that would give me all kind of hell and all kind of rhetoric, that kind of stuff.  She simply said we should agree to disagree.  Because what I said, she couldn't refute.  But that shows you the nature of black women.  The defiance is so ingrained in them that they can't change.  And they pass this stuff down to the younger generation.  You heard what the little girl said.  and why her son does not want to date little girls like her mama.  She said, I don't like when you twist your neck.  And a little black girl in my classroom twists her neck the same way and shows the same kind of defiance and smart-ass attitude.  And I weep for the young generation of black girls because they're going to be alone.  And their mamas are setting them up for failure.  They used to set up the boys for failure.  Now they're setting up their daughters for failure.  They set up the boys not to be as successful, and they set up the girls to be perpetually alone.  But anyway, I thought I'd drop this because I hadn't dropped anything in a while, and this one was on my mind.  So I thought I'd take some time and actually put this up because it makes me sad.  It makes me sad.  It makes me sad for myself.  group my class of people the self-destructiveness that we have.  men have their own bullshit.  they have their own ways to self-destruct and by god women do too.  and you would think when your son tells you that you have a negative behavior That is something that they don't like.  And you push them to like other kinds of women because they don't like the behavior that you have.  You refuse to change.  You try to excuse it.  You try to make it something righteous, which is a shame in itself.  But with that, I'm going to jump over here.  This is BGS out.  I'll see you guys on the next one.  Peace. ",
