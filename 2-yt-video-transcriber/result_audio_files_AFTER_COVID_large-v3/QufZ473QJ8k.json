            "text": "of the Republican National Convention, such as it is.  Everything we've seen tonight thus far has been taped.  This will be the first live remarks from the chair of the Republican.  A hundred percent, Sean, and that's the reason I wrote the book.  The party, Ronna Romney-McDaniel.  I'm actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school who happens to be the only\u2014only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican Party.  And unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn't choose me because I'm a woman.  He chose me because I was the best person for the job.  Policies that force jobs to flee our country or allow abortion up until the point of birth are not nice.  Tonight begins a new chapter in the great American story, a story that has inspired the world for generations.  South Carolina.  South Dakota.  Tennessee.  Tennessee.  United States, Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, are excited to nominate the Chinese Communist Party.  These are my friends.  These are the incredible workers that helped us so much with the COVID.  We can call it many different things, from China virus.  I don't want to go through all the names because some people may get insulted, but that's the way it is.  These are great, great people.  You have been incredible, and we want to thank you, and all of the millions of people that you represent.  Thank you all very much.  Great job.  Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  Great job.  Thank you.  So tell me a little about your stories.  How about we'll start with you?  interesting things but it takes a true leader to be able to ignore all that stuff and do what is right and not be offended by all the words being said.  and you really it takes.  at the last minute donald said he'd like to join us so they was in a business suit on.  uh it's a small world ride.  that was something to see.  i take it as a personal insult that people would think i've had a 37 year friendship with the racists.  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer literally started wearing kente cloths around the U.S.  Capitol.  We were so proud of the woman she had become.  But in the hallway on that third floor, the gunman saw Meadow and shot her down the hallway, hitting her four times.  After she was shot and on the floor, she crawled over to another student, a freshman girl, to protect her.  She draped her body over her, and then the scumbag gunman shot my daughter at point-blank range five more times, killing Meadow and the girl she was shielding.  Then the president did what he said he would do.  He took action.  He formed a school safety commission that issued dozens of recommendations to make schools safer.  But I'll bet you never heard about that.  Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.  We come together to imagine a future.  We worked very hard on it, Ambassador O'Brien and others.  And I will tell you, we're very proud of the job we did.  But I'd like to ask maybe Pastor Brunson to say a few words so we can go through and just give us a little history of what happened.  How is life treating you?  We got you back.  You got me back, yeah.  We got you all back, and we have some more that we're working on right now to get back that we better do.  I went and traveled over to the country of Iran.  It turned out it was a major, major trap, and I was apprehended there.  Thank you very much.  Well, thank you, Fred.  Daughters all mine.  Please.  India responded very well to my request, so we appreciate that.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Great stories.  It divides freedom from fear.  It divides the past from the present, from the future.  They swallow the communist poison pill.  Waves in the ocean carrying families clinging to pieces of wood.  Families with children who can't swim.  but willing to risk everything to reach this blessed land.  Fuel desire and improve performance.  Get TestX 180 from Force Factor, the number one fastest-growing men's health brand at Walmart.  That Democrat politicians have personal security to protect them, so why don't they forego their security and replace them with social workers, especially since that's what they want for you and me?  As if pandering were enough to keep us satisfied.  My father wore a turban.  My mother wore a sari.  I was a brown girl in a black-and-white world.  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America, Trump's vision for America is a country where you have an opportunity to work hard and build the life you dream of, with a job you love, with your children being educated in great schools, in a community.  blatantly false things they had to say.  there is our friend Claire McCaskill, who also hails from the great state of Missouri.  Claire, what'd you think?  Still, politicians spun their deceptions and obstructed progress, fanning the flames of lawlessness.  We all know that it is easy to criticize.  It takes a true leader to solve problems.  COVID-19, while others criticize without solutions, President Trump's swift action saved lives.  Before communist China gave us the coronavirus, we were breaking economic records left and right.  It's now fashionable to say that America is racist.  That is a lie.  America is not a racist country.  100%, Sean, and that's the reason I wrote the book.  That is the life.  I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that could afford the best schools and the finest universities.  But a great education cannot be the exclusive right of the rich and powerful.  It must be accessible to all.  And that's why my dad is pro-school choice.  That is the life.  Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread.  Thank you, and God bless America.  And as I laid on that stainless steel cell shackled by my hands and my feet, I heard God utter into my spirit, my son, I honored what you asked me to do.  He said, never forget the promise that you made to me.  And ever since that day, I got up off that floor, and my life went in a 180-degree turn.  Nothing is more amazing than removing the bandages from a person's eyes.  By the end of 2018, we had a new state-of-the-art robotic milking facility that allows our cows to milk themselves three times a day.  Democrats tried to make faith organizations pay for abortion-inducing drugs.  Democrats tried to force adoption agencies to violate their deeply held beliefs.  Democrats pressured schools to allow boys to compete in girls' sports and use girls' locker rooms.  Those are the facts.  Whether you're a baker, a florist, or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar.  Because the radical left's God is government power.  And Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics.  Her goal when founding Planned Parenthood was to eradicate the minority population.  Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen, an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction.  And I'll never forget what the doctor said next.  Beam me up, Scotty.  where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure nothing remains in the mother's wombs, or that we joked and called it the pieces of children room.  I know what it sounds like.  I know what abortion smells like.  Did you know abortion even had a smell?  I learned what was happening to me had a name.  It was called being canceled, as in annulled, as in revoked, as in made void.  Come on, man.  Good evening.  I'm Tiffany Trump.  In closing, I'd like to speak directly to my father.  I miss working alongside you every single day.  And as I think of those giants and their broad shoulders, I also think about Joe Biden.  Mr.  Vice President, look at me.  I am black.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the First Lady of the United States.  Good evening.  It seems like just yesterday that we were at our first convention where my husband accepted the Republican nomination and then became our 43th president.  I have been moved by the way Americans have come together in such an unfamiliar and often frightening situation.  When I think back to a defining moment of Be Best, my mind goes to a trip I took to Africa.  While there, I visited the Cape Coast Castle and learned more about the beginning of a cruel and often deadly journey in the era of the slave trade.  I was horrified when I listened to the guide tell me so many inhumane stories, and I gained new perspectives.  This time in our history, we must never forget so that we can ensure that it never happens again.  I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the color of a person's skin.  President Trump has stood up fearlessly against those who are corrupting the term social justice so as to deny Americans their birthright.  If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything.  That sounds a lot like communist China to me.  You will never cancel.  And it's the cop that gets spit on with a young military wife with two young children, answers the unexpected knock at the door, looks the man in uniform in the eye, and even as her whole world comes crashing down, she stands up straight, she holds back tears, and takes care of her family.  because she must.  Because she must.  President Trump shook my hand and said, wonderful job, mom.  I want my daughter.  to grow up and President Donald J. Trump.  I have seen firsthand many times the president comforting and encouraging a child.  No coincidence that Jesus stood up for what was just and was ultimately crucified because what he said wasn't politically correct or fashionable.  As followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life against the politically correct or fashionable of today.  We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb.  Find us here with our weapon of choice, the rosary.  This is a time of great adversity for our country.  And I know something about adversity.  At 18 years old, I was in a horrific car accident that's left me paralyzed from the waist down.  Be a radical for freedom.  Be a radical for liberty.  And be a radical for our republic, for which I stand.  My name is Chen Guangcheng.  Standing up to tyranny is not easy, I know.  When I spoke out against China's one-child policy and other injustices, I was prosecuted, beaten, sent to prison and put under house arrest by the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP.  In April 2005, 2012, I escaped and was given shelter in the American embassy in Beijing.  I'm forever grateful to the American people for welcoming me and my family to the United States where we are now free.  I've watched President Trump charm the Chancellor of Germany while insisting that Germany pay its NATO obligations.  Well, you see, President Trump also sent an aircraft in the middle of the night to deal with Iran.  Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as President of the United States.  Thank you.  To our God, I'm Wrath.  We pray at your altar of awesomeness.  To our monarch, Thomas Bone.  You are the light that guides our path.  To our lords, Jeffrey Lamb, Stephen, Ninetales Cosmic Fox, Hans Josephen, and Poppy Nelson.  We bow meekly for your pleasure.  To our knights of the round.  And to our many merchants and farmers, you have our undying love.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
