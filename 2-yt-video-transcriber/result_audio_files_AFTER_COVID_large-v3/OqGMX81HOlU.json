            "text": "uh hoja right well enver hoja was the leader of albania.  um and uh what's interesting is that you know i mean he albania had its own following in international communism.  um and the reason for that was so well first of all you have to understand see first of all um so albania is near Yugoslavia.  And originally, Albania, when it was fighting for its independence from the Nazis, Yugoslavia was also fighting for its independence from the Nazis.  And after World War II, originally the Soviet Union was hoping that Albania and Yugoslavia would all become one country.  But Enver Hoxha and the Albanians were very adamant that they were not Slavs and they did not like Tito.  And there's actually a book written by Enver Hoxha.  It's called With Stalin.  And most of it, it's about the four meetings that Enver Hoxha had with Joseph Stalin.  And in all of those meetings, the main focus was him explaining why Albanians are not Slavs, right?  And that the Slavs and the Albanians are not the same, right?  They are different nationalities.  And you'll remember that Yugoslavia was the first country, the first socialist country in history to cut ties with the Soviet Union, right?  Yugoslavia, 1948, Tito cut ties with the Soviets and aligned with the United States, announced that the United States was good.  When the Korean War broke out, Yugoslavia aligned with the United States against China and People's Korea.  So Yugoslavia was the first socialist country to take an opportunistic turn and side with the imperialists.  That's Yugoslavia.  So Albania, longstanding Albania's whole identity is we are not Yugoslavia.  So Albania does the opposite.  Albania, they love Stalin.  They love the Soviet Union.  Okay.  Albania tends to do the opposite of whatever Yugoslavia does.  So then we keep going.  Khrushchev comes into office.  Khrushchev gives his secret speech, denounces Stalin.  All right.  And what else does Khrushchev do?  He goes to Tito and begs Tito to become friends with the Soviet Union again.  Well, Albania, of course, they don't want to be friends with Tito, and they love Stalin, right?  Yugoslavia is anti-Stalin.  They really love Stalin.  China and the USSR have their falling out.  China accuses the USSR of revising Marxism and abandoning the true revolutionary teachings of Lenin and Stalin.  Albania is the only country in the world to 100% side with China, right?  North Korea is neutral.  Cuba is neutral, but Albania, 100%, it's with China.  Albania is the only country in the world that was 100% with China in the Sino-Soviet split.  It was a big deal.  Um, And, you know, Albania, very small country, but they were aligned with China.  And you'll remember that, you know, Khrushchev tried, you know, he cut off diplomatic relations with them.  He tried to overthrow them.  And that Khrushchev was particularly nasty to Albania.  So Albania and China were aligned.  And, The other thing you have to remember about Albania is that Albania, it's a small country, a small nationality, only a few million, but it's always been heavily divided between Christians and Muslims.  Half the country are Christian, half the country are Muslims, and there's been a longstanding violence between them.  So in the 60s, China had the Cultural Revolution, where they're trying to get rid of all the old system, the old ideology, the old teachings, right?  Well, they did the same thing in... Okay, 1999, Kosovo.  They did the same thing in Albania.  And actually, Albania went as far as declaring itself to be the only atheist state in the world.  Now, a lot of people say all the communist countries are atheist states.  Technically, they're not.  The constitutions of all the socialist countries say that they have separation of church and state, right?  The communist party, the ruling party, is atheist, but... you know, USSR, the church was legal, it existed, the government, you know, but, you know, but Albania became the only country in the world to actually declare that they had the religion of atheism, you know, and I think that's fascinating.  Then you have to remember, so starting in the Early in 1969, really, the first major thing was in Angola where, you know, the China was aligning with the CIA against the MPLA.  But then later, you know, with Pinochet and, you know, Nixon visits China and all of that.  So Albania cuts ties with China in 1978.  Albania and China officially had their falling out.  And Verhoeser wrote a book called Imperialism and Revolution, in which he denounced Mao Zedong thought as a counter-revolutionary ideology.  And if you read his criticism of Mao Zedong thought, it's actually very interesting, right?  If you read it, he argues that The military and the youth were the primary leadership in China, not in factory workers.  The communism is about factory workers.  He makes some interesting criticisms.  Regardless, 1978, you know, after the Deng Xiaoping reforms, Albania officially cuts ties with China.  Albania has no allies anywhere in the world.  Right.  They're not friends with China.  They're not friends with any of the other socialist countries.  Albania maintained it was the only communist country or socialist country in the entire world.  All the others were revisionists.  And those years from like 1978 until 1993 were very, very, very hard for Albania economically because of the fact no one would trade with them.  they maintained it was because they were so revolutionary and so pure communist.  But you have to remember, though, that, you know, it's a very poor country and no one would trade with them.  So the 1980s in Albania was pretty awful.  The reason was no one would trade with them, right?  They couldn't trade with Romania or Czechoslovakia or Poland because, no, no, no, they're all fake revisionists.  They wouldn't get a trade with the U.S.  imperialists like the sellout Chinese did.  So they wouldn't trade with anybody.  So they claimed, though, to have pure socialism in Albania.  The other thing is, though, that Albania They did try to be very, very egalitarian.  From what I understand, during the 1980s in Albania, there were only three pay scales, right?  You could get wage number one, wage number two, or wage number three.  That was it, right?  So it was very egalitarian.  You know, they did things like they shared cars, what do they call them, zip cars or something like that, like shared cars.  That comes from Albania, you know?  they, they, they were consistently anti-imperialist.  I'll give them that.  Um, and the writings of Enver Hoxha are worth reading.  I recommend reading the writings of Enver Hoxha, but ultimately, um, you know, Albania, you know, I mean, yeah, it's kind of sad really.  Um, I mean, they were trying to build socialism, but they managed, you know, Cuba, for example, Cuba had criticisms of China, had criticisms of the USSR, but managed to trade with both of them, not just give them all the middle finger and tell them to go F themselves.  And Albania, it couldn't maintain international relationships.  And so it was isolated and cut off.  And eventually, and I think, you know, Enver Hoxha, you know, he died.  There was kind of a fight in the party after he died, and then there was a CIA counter-revolution, and that was the end of that.  And I think that if, you know, if Albania had been able to have a better economy and not be isolated, it would have done better.  So, you know, I think that Enver Hoxha is worth reading.  I really enjoyed reading the history of the Party of Labor of Albania, which is like their official history textbook, because it talks about, you know, at the time, In the 1930s, the Communist Party of Albania was like 20 people.  But by the end of World War II, they took power.  And if you read the history of the Party of Labour of Albania, you learn why that is.  Because they were very smart.  They were one step ahead of the bourgeoisie.  They built the resistance army, right?  And that the capitalist resistance of the Nazis was always trying to catch up with them.  It was very, you know, always tactically one step ahead of the bourgeoisie.  Very brilliant kind of tactical writing.  So there's something you can learn from all of this.  But ultimately, you know, I think that, you know... Albania, you can also see a lot of flaws there too.  So it's worth studying though.  It's worth studying.  Yeah, that's really all I can say about Albania.  You know, I studied it at one point.  I think I wrote some essays about it.  And I, you know, I mean, I've read a lot of Enver Hoxha's writings and he's interesting.  I will say that the Enver Hoxha movement, right?  There were like, in most countries, there would be a party that was like a pro-Albanian party.  And some of those like pro-Albanian parties were wacky.  Um, you know, I, I jokingly, I like to listen to some of the, the music of the Canadian Enver Hoxha followers.  Arise proletarians lead the way.  War is raging every day.  We have no fear of the enemy with our communist party.  I mean, they have like crazy music.  Um, you know, socialist Albania stands as an impregnable victorious fortress of communism.  Genuine Marxists, Leninists of the world, and the only proletarian state.  It's wacky.  Their music is wacky.  I'll just say that, right?  Oh, Albania, red star that burns bright.  The world's illuminated by your light.  Socialism is mankind's destiny.  And we will fight till final victory.  Yeah, it's... Some wacky music, right?  There was a composer in Britain who was an experimental composer, Cornelius Cardew, and he converted to being a Maoist and he rejected all of his... all of his experimental music, Stockhausen experimental music.  And, you know, he wrote this manifesto called Stockhausen Serves Imperialism.  And he became a follower of first of Mao, but then after the China-Albania split, he became a follower of Enver Hoxha.  And he wrote some crazy music.  We're buying Caleb's Hoxha's Music Covers album for Christmas.  Awesome.  But yeah, I mean, it's it's wild.  So, you know, I love Cornelius Cardew's music in kind of an ironic way.  And I've learned a lot by studying Hoxhaism.  But ultimately, you know, yeah, I mean, it's a little bit.  I would say it was kind of ultra left and the Hoxhaist movement kind of became ultra left.  And, you know, it's a little bit. ",
