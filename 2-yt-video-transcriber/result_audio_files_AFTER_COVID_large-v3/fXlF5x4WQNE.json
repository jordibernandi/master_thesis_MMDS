So they've surrounded the group in here.  Calm, calm.  My media.  Were you protesting?  No, I'm not protesting.  She's under arrest? ",

And anybody who was drawn to the fight, to watch the fight, was surrounded, including our team.  But the police obviously knew to let us out because they recognise that we're media.  And if they detain us the same that they detain these people, we'll go straight back to the Supreme Court.  And right now there is that case in front of the Supreme Court for that exact reason.  So with us, they let us move on.  But the people that don't have, you know, Supreme Court abilities, they've just detained them, processed them in a makeshift police station.  without any real evidence that they broke any laws.  It calls into question the entire, the entire policing of today, and in COVID-19 in general.  Are you gonna pay that fine?  I'm not paying that.  They're all being issued a $1,652 fine, no matter what they were doing here.  Surrounded, locked in, as we were, and fine.  Why?  Because today we had one case of coronavirus.  Our 14-day average is 5.5.  If you truly believe that that excuses this kind of overreach of law enforcement, then there's something wrong with you.  He has given me his fine.  He thinks, he doesn't realise.  as a Jew, I am paying this fine.  We'll fight it for you, mate, but we won't pay it.  We're you together.  Yeah, yeah.  And you got your Hungry Jacks at the end.  Yeah, we did, yeah.  So $1,652 each.  Hungry Jacks, $1,652.  Do you think Hungry Jacks should step in and pay this fine?  Absolutely.  Is it a double whopper?  Double whopper.  Double whopper. ",
