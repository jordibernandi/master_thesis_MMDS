Well, you know, really, when you think about it, Jehovah's Witnesses are conditioned to expect change.  In fact, it starts right at the Bible study level.  Witnesses, they will let the Bible study know that the summer convention, we might get something new, some new light.  And so as a Jehovah's Witness, that is a part of the culture.  It's kind of ironic because in many denominations, they often refer to their teachings as being solid as a rock.  Yet witnesses rarely, if ever, refer to our teachings as solid as a rock.  Why?  Because they know at any time they're subject to turn to quicksand and they have to be replaced with something else.  That is a culture.  So witnesses literally are acceptable.  They find it acceptable when changes are made. ",

And those new releases, we were always looking for new light, new information.  What is the slaves bent on this take of world events?  What's happened over here?  We were always looking for something.  And that's the reason why religion.  When you are talking to your loved ones, And there's people, they call themselves PIMO, and they're still in the Kingdom Hall.  They don't want to leave because they realize that family members and stuff is going to stop talking to them.  So they try to stay in.  But when you try to talk sense to your Jehovah's Witness family, it's very difficult for them to wake up, especially the old timers.  Because the old timers ain't going nowhere too soon.  Because they have been conditioned, like JT said, to stay put, to wait on Jehovah because he's going to right these wrongs.  He's going to make it clear down the road.  So it's very difficult to get our loved ones to wake up because of the new light principle.  You know, it's just been so deeply ingrained in them. ",

At the end of the day, the wheels fall off.  It would drop and then new light.  And they use this term that really just defies the mind.  When you think about just a simple example is a teaching of 1914 and the end would come.  I mean, the witnesses were literally teaching people that, you know, the governments are going to be destroyed.  All the nations will fall down.  People will be destroyed because they belong to different churches.  And then, of course, on January the 1st of 1915, the Watchtower basically changed the entire tune.  They went from something that every person could see to, well, see it happen, but it happened invisible.  You can't see it.  And so people never stop to ask some serious questions.  Hold on.  You can't just change from.  everybody in the world is going to know this happened to now saying it's invisible.  Nobody can see it.  And then when you look at the other teachings over the years, the alternative service teaching, the teaching of the.  changing the generation of 1914.  It was not supposed to die.  They've all passed.  We think about the medical issues that the Watchtower tried to dabble in as if they had some medical knowledge.  And then of course, with the passing of time, they revised those things as well.  And the problem is all along the way, they are leaving literally dead bodies and broken minds and broken hopes behind.  So where do Jehovah's Witnesses get this idea of something called new light?  Well, they use the Bible verse from the book of Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 18.  Notice what it says. ",
