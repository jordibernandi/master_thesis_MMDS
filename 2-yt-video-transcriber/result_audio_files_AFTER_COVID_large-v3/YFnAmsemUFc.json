Mom, Christian's everything up at the doctor's office.  What a complete insult to this guy after how much he's helped her.  The reason he looks half-dead during this scene is because this guy has essentially given up his entire life to help her with her weight problem.  But when she screws up her diet, she blames him and calls her mom to tattle on him like a three-year-old.  This 33-year-old woman is Maya, and she's from a show called My 600-lb Life.  Every episode of the show spends a year with a person who weighs at least 600 pounds and follows them around as they attempt to lose weight.  Maya is from Portland, Oregon, and weighs about 690 pounds.  Her boyfriend Christian was very supportive at the start, but Maya's constant nagging, blaming, and yelling quickly turns Christian against her.  During this video, you'll notice that Maya has very little ability to deal with any sort of stress, and instead of confronting her problems and actually dealing with the stress, she yells at other people to make herself feel better.  We'll get to that, but first, a word from this video's sponsor, Sandman. ",

One of the great things that this TLC show highlights is how crippling being 600 plus pounds is.  At the start of the episode, Maya says that even though she barely has the energy, she has to shower every day.  otherwise she will face severe infection from her skin folds.  When you weigh as much as she does, your skin creates creases and folds where sweat can get trapped and form mildew.  This mildew, mixed in with the friction of the skin rubbing against itself, creates infections that Maya could be hospitalized for if she doesn't shower.  During her shower, she can barely stand up for 10 minutes, and when she gets out of the shower, she can't get dressed fully by herself.  She has to ask her boyfriend Christian for help.  Maya's limitations really become exposed when she has to fly from Portland, Oregon to Houston, Texas to meet her weight loss surgeon for the show, Dr.  Now.  This simple four-hour plane flight mixed in with a little walking nearly puts Maya in the hospital. ",

            "text": "I'm not even sure that she's all that conscious about her lying when she does it.  She has been lying about the amount of food she eats since she was a child.  Don't forget that there is a reason people become massively overweight, there is a reason they can't control their eating habits, and there is a reason they use food as a coping mechanism.  Using a drug or food to manage your emotions is not a sign of good health.  Maya's bad health starts with her family.  Her mom and dad divorced when she was only two years old.  Her mom was almost never around when Maya was young, and when her mom was around, Maya didn't like her.  Maya was mostly parented by her grandparents and her aunt.  Her dad remarried, created a new family, and eventually abandoned her for his new family when she was around eight years old.  Both parents were very harsh to her because of her weight, which is really ironic considering that her mom is obese.  Actually, her mom was very obese when Maya was younger.  It's great to watch Maya's mom go on and on about Maya's weight when Maya's mom is about 10 minutes away from a heart attack.  Her dad isn't thin either.  But because she got constant rejection from her parents from overeating, mixed in with the abuse that caused her to overeat in the first place, she feels that she has to lie to everyone about her condition, even to the medical professionals.  Do not do that.  If you have serious medical issues, then you need to be honest with the people who are treating you.  If you lie to them, they can't help you.  Interesting enough, Maya says that she eventually restored her relationship with her mother after her mom had a stroke.  Really?  You mean all of a sudden her mom was nice to her when she found out that she might need Maya to take care of her?  What a coincidence!  None of this, however, is to say that any of this abuse is Maya's fault.  And yes, thanks to attacks on this channel where my words were intentionally misconstrued, I now have to say this very obvious fact in every video so that my views are very clear, which will make it extremely difficult for people to suggest that I would ever do something as disgusting as make fun of someone for being abused as a child, or say that abuse was their fault.  It's not their fault.  However, if they go on to abuse other people, that is their fault.  Anyway, Maya leaves her first doctor's visit and loses 93 pounds in two months.  That's good.  As a side note, the reason her weight loss is so drastic is because she's no longer drinking tons of soda or eating eight cheeseburgers for breakfast.  All of that food and water weighs something, which is why people who weigh 700 pounds can lose massive amounts of weight so quickly.  They aren't so much burning a ton of fat as they are simply excreting all the excess food and water they were eating and drinking.  which means if you are coming down from being that overweight don't expect massive weight loss all the time.  eventually you will get to the point where you are only losing one to two pounds a week.  but don't let that discourage you because that is normal weight loss.  so keep going.  anyway.  back to the story.  when maya flies to houston again after two months to see the doctor she says that the trip wasn't nearly as bad.  now that she is about a hundred pounds lighter Another good thing.  However, in order for the surgery to work and the program to be safe and effective, Dr.  Now says that her and her boyfriend must move to Texas and live there for a year.  This is when everything falls apart.  Throughout this whole journey, Maya has been very abusive towards Christian, and after a few months, he is tired of it.  Maya starts fights with him over the smallest nonsense, like this scene from the first month. ",

The guy who moved from Oregon to Texas and uprooted his entire life even though he didn't want to move so that he could help you lose weight?  but you not losing enough weight for surgery is somehow his fault?  What nice thing have you done for him?  This whole episode is just a montage of Christian being caring and accommodating, while Maya abuses him.  Sure, TLC obviously missed some important fight, but overall the point still stands.  This is the scene where Christian decides that he is not putting up with it anymore, so Maya calls her mom and tells on him like a child.  mom mom mom he's with my life. ",

            "text": "Okay, so basically they're saying that Christian is a hostage.  Both Maya and her mom are trying to make Christian feel bad so that he will take care of Maya while she refuses to get better.  This is a massive waste of his time.  She still lies, she still blames everything on everyone but herself, and she is still abusive.  This is supremely manipulative, and I know that there are a lot of guys out there who are stuck in relationships because their partner is threatening to hurt themselves if they leave.  if that happens call the police because she is a danger to herself.  call her family and talk to a mental health professional.  let those people deal with it.  outside of that you don't owe her anything and appeasing her will only make her worse.  After this scene, Christian leaves, then, to no surprise, Maya quits her weight loss program and makes a bunch of excuses.  Reports from after the show said that she has lost more weight, but if she doesn't get back into treatment, she will just gain it back or she will pick up another addiction to replace it.  Maya has a lot of psychological problems that she needs to fix or she will never be able to correct her physical health.  Instead of being a control freak, which Maya clearly is, she needs to put herself in the care of medical professionals who are smarter than her and she needs to listen to their advice.  She has an addiction and that's what you do when you have an addiction or severe psychological problems.  Give up control and allow professionals to teach you how to make good decisions.  Stop resisting help.  This, by the way, also works in general.  If you are stuck on a problem, find someone who is smarter and more accomplished than you and listen to what they have to say.  Allow those people to teach you.  People who are dumb always think they are the smartest, greatest people in the world, so they never listen to people who are better than them.  That holds them back, even if they are actually intelligent.  No one person is smarter than the hundreds of people you could be looking to for help.  The best thing that you can do is realize that you aren't as smart as you think you are and humble yourself to some advice from someone who knows how to get past your problem.  That's what actually works.  Bring people into your life who are smarter and better than you.  But with that said, I think that's enough for this video.
