My father is, his father was.  The whole family is a Republican family.  Now, it seems to me we're up against a very different kind of a man.  This man scares me.  Now, maybe I'm wrong.  A friend of mine has said to me, listen, just because a man... sounds a little irresponsible during a campaign doesn't mean he's going to act irresponsibly.  You know that theory that the White House makes the man.  I don't buy that.  I can't follow that.  Was he serious when he did put it that way?  Is he serious when he says he wouldn't put it that way?  I just don't get it.  President, to me what he says, I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of The candidate of my party, either they're not Republicans or I'm not, I thought about just not voting in this election, just staying home.  But you can't do that, because that's saying you don't care who wins, and I do care.  I think my party made a bad mistake, and I'm going to have to vote against that mistake on the 3rd of November.
