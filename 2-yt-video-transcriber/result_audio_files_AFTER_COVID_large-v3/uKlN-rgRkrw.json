            "text": "Hello, everybody.  Today, we're going to be looking at the 2020 electoral map between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.  This will be an updated video from the one I did a few weeks ago, which is very much needed because of all the developments around the country, both politically, culturally, socially, and just in general.  I think it's very necessary to update this map because there are a lot of changes with all of the developments around and how it will impact the 2020 election.  So let's get right into it.  As always, let's begin by labeling the safe states for either party, starting out with the Republicans in Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alaska, and Nebraska's two at-large electoral votes, as well as their first and third congressional districts.  So these are all the states that I am comfortable labeling as safe for the Republican Party in the 2020, oh, and Missouri, of course.  So these are the states that I would label as safe for the Republicans In the 2020 election, 105 electoral votes are safe for the Republicans, no matter what happens, really, barring some cataclysmic event.  As for the Democrats in California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico, as well as Illinois and Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Washington,  D.C.,  and New York.  So these are all the states that I am comfortable labeling as safe for the Democratic Party along with Hawaii.  So 187 electoral votes to 105.  That is the split in favor of the Democratic Party when not looking at any competitive states whatsoever.  Now, as for the states that I would label as in the likely column for either party, starting out with the Republicans in Indiana.  I don't expect the state of Indiana to go to the Democrats at all.  I expect that to be a comfortable victory for the Republicans, but not by a margin.  that I would consider safe.  I also do think that if things continue to spiral out of control in this country, barring any of that happening, I do think that Indiana will go in favor of the Republicans.  But if it does, you never know what actually could happen.  Same goes for the state of South Carolina.  I will also label that as likely for the Republican Party.  These are two states that I 99% chance will go to the Republicans in the 2020 presidential election, but I do not feel comfortable labeling as completely safe.  As for the Democratic Party, for their states that I believe are likely in their column, I actually think at this point, Nevada is now shifting from a lean... from what I originally said as lean in Nevada to a likely state for the Democratic Party.  Hillary Clinton won there by a decent margin in 2016, and I expect Joe Biden to be able to perform better than Hillary Clinton, not only nationwide, but especially in states like Nevada, where the Democratic Party has historically done pretty well.  Not to mention a large minority population in the state of Nevada.  that will, with the increase of all these riots going on in the country, will split in favor of Joe Biden in all likelihood.  Same goes for the state of Colorado.  This is a likely state for Joe Biden, a state that went to Hillary Clinton by a larger margin in 2016 than I think many people initially expected.  A lot of people thought Colorado would be much more of a battleground state.  It wasn't.  And we've now seen that Colorado is definitely shifting more in the Democrats' favor.  Another state that I do believe will go likely to the Democrats in the state of Minnesota.  While it may not be shifting in the Democratic favor as much as Nevada and Colorado are, I do believe that Minnesota, especially with these, obviously everything that has gone on in Minnesota in the past few weeks, any chance that Donald Trump had of flipping that state from 2016 in favor of the Republicans is virtually gone, in my opinion.  I don't... Keep in mind, I don't think that Minnesota, Colorado, and Nevada will be quite as large margins of victory for the Democratic Party as Indiana and South Carolina will for the Republicans.  But I do think Nevada and Colorado and Minnesota are... in all likelihood, barring something very changing in the political landscape, in the national landscape, they will go to the Democratic Party.  Now, I do believe that these are all the states... Oh, of course, Virginia I also would label as likely for the Democratic Party.  republicans haven't won a statewide election there in over 10 years.  i don't expect them to win in 2020 in virginia especially given that it is a state moving further and further left on a government scale across the board.  so these are all these states that i would label as likely for either party.  now moving on to the states that i would label as lean starting out with the republicans in iowa and in Ohio.  I would label both of these states as lean in favor of the Republican Party.  Now, Iowa and Ohio are very similar in terms of trajectories politically.  They both went to Barack Obama twice, both in 2008 and 2012. but went to Donald Trump in 2016 by very, very large margins as compared to how they were initially seen as very crucial swing states for either party in presidential elections.  I don't think that is the case anymore.  I don't think Ohio is a crucial state for the Democrats to win if they want to win the White House.  It is... moving further and further out of their path their necessary path for a path to 270. but that doesn't mean it is not.  uh they both these states are not crucial states for the republicans to win in the 2020 election.  if these states are super close that would not be a good sign for the republican party much less for donald Trump.  Now for the states that I would label as likely for the Democrats in the state of Michigan, I would comfortably label this as a lean state for Joe Biden.  I do believe that his showing in the Democratic primary in the in the 2020 Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, with the increase in turnout there for Joe Biden, as well as the general voting trends of the state of Michigan typically does elect Democratic presidents.  I don't believe that is going to change in 2020, although of course it did in 2016.  I do believe that is an outlier in the state of Michigan.  And in the Northeast, in the state of New Hampshire, I do believe that the state of New Hampshire is a lean in favor of the Democrats.  It was one of the closest races in the 2016 election, but it is a state that typically votes for Democratic candidates, and I don't see any polling data or trends indicate that it will flip in the Republicans' favor.  And in the state of Maine, something that I forgot in the likely column, I actually do believe that the two state-at-large electoral votes in the state of Maine will go to the Democrats as well as the first district at a safe margin.  However, the second district is between a tilt and a lean for Donald Trump and the Republicans.  I do believe that I'm actually going to label it as more of a lean in the Republicans' favor at this moment in time.  Now we are down to the final few states that I have identified as all tilt states.  Now, a few of these may come as a surprise, but I will be going through these and giving my explanations as we go along.  Starting out in Arizona, no real surprise here that it is labeled as a tilt for the Democrats, because if you have been paying attention to polling and Just really any of the news coming out of the state of Arizona, literally everything is pointing towards a Joe Biden victory in the state of Arizona.  You see the Senate candidate Mark Kelly holding 10 plus point leads over the Republican incumbent Martha McSally, which just not only spells trouble for Martha McSally herself, of course, but for Donald Trump in the state.  because a heavily unpopular senator in the state of Arizona will really hurt his chances at winning in the state.  Obviously, it is historically a more conservative and Republican state, but has become a lot closer in recent decades.  And everything, and I mean everything, polling data, trends, statewide elections, it's all pointing towards a Joe Biden victory.  Not a good sign for Donald Trump in the state of Arizona.  As for the state of Texas, now here, a lot of people want to say that the state of Texas is either a toss-up or could possibly go to Joe Biden just because of polling data, and that's where I have to sort of draw the line.  Obviously, polling data is our best indicator of what is going to happen in elections.  Obviously, the counterargument to that is in 2016, a lot of polls were very off, and that is entirely true.  However, a lot of people overestimate just how off those polls were.  Most polls had Hillary Clinton up 2% to 3% nationally, and she ended up winning the popular vote by 2% to 3%.  So it is a lot more important to focus on key swing state polls heading into the 2020 election, especially based on polling averages.  Now, one thing that was interesting to note leading up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump was leading in polls in Texas by 11 to 12 points.  That was the RealClearPolitics polling average heading into election day in 2016.  She only lost in the state by about nine points, which goes to show that Hillary Clinton's While maybe overperforming in polls heading into election day, of course, that isn't the case for every single state.  She actually overperformed what her polling was indicating in a lot of states that we expected to go to Donald Trump by a larger margin, such as the states of Texas and in the state of Georgia.  So that is why I am labeling the state of Texas as a tilt Republican, as well as the state of Georgia, as both of these states will be tilt Republican as of right now.  These are states that if we do in fact see vote by mail across the country, could see a huge uptick in statewide turnout.  Texas is very famous for having extremely low turnout, despite having nearly identical voter turnout registration between democrats and republicans.  there is a large latino vote in the state of texas that in most cases has a very low turnout in both midterm and general elections and democrats see this as a huge opportunity for them to if they can get vote by mail ratified.  across the entire country or even in particular states such as texas we could see an extremely, extremely competitive statewide race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.  Same goes for the state of Georgia, whereas things are a little bit more different.  There is a huge African-American support for Joe Biden in the state of Georgia.  And if we see an uptick in turnout off the backs of these riots and the entire Black Lives Matter movement, now this is a big if, if this lasts until election day, there's a large chance that the media cycle starts to overlook what has happened in the early months of this year, and we see a completely different political and news landscape in November.  That is entirely likely.  But as things stand right now, if the election were held today, Georgia would be extremely competitive, as would the state of Texas.  Now, this is not to say that I am biased for either candidate or But if you look at polling data, if you look at political trends, if you look at historical trends, and if you look at where the country is at right now, if the election was held today, these two states would be extremely competitive.  Not saying that they would go to the Democrats, but there is a case to be made that these could be effective toss-ups if the election was held today.  As for the state of Florida, I also think we can label Florida as a tilt Republican state.  While Texas and Georgia may be shifting more to the left, there is an argument to be made that Florida is moving a little bit more to the right.  Now saying that, Florida I don't think is ever really going to be decided by more than one point.  I think there's the very high chance that Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the state of Florida will be separated by less than a point.  Same goes in the state of North Carolina, which I will get to in a second.  Florida is extremely competitive.  Super large Latino vote, older vote, a very conservative older vote.  But that goes to the question of who will perform better among older voters.  Obviously, in 2016, Donald Trump had a big edge over Hillary Clinton among the older vote in Florida and nationwide.  But polls recently have indicated that Joe Biden has narrowed that gap and is sometimes even leading among these older voters, which we saw him do very well in the Democratic primary in the state of Florida, where he won in every single county.  That is something to be mentioned.  However, Donald Trump is strong in the state of Florida, not to mention that it is now listed as his home state.  I don't know how much of an effect that is actually going to have, probably a very minimal effect, but it is something to be mentioned that Donald Trump in all likelihood, will win in the state of Florida again in 2020.  As for the state of Wisconsin, I'm continuing to label this as a tilt in the Republicans' favor because I have not seen enough substantial data for me to flip it in the Democrats' favor from 2016 and in all the polling data and the historical trends heading into 2020.  It's extremely competitive in the polling numbers, but contrary to other states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, I haven't seen as many polls in favor of Joe Biden in the state of Wisconsin, which is very interesting, given that heading into the 2016 election, you probably would have... predicted that Arizona, Pennsylvania, maybe Michigan, but definitely North Carolina would be more in the Republicans' favor than Wisconsin would be.  But it just goes to show you how quickly things can change in the electoral map and in the political or election process.  As for the state of Pennsylvania, I'm between labeling Pennsylvania as a tilt for Joe Biden and a lean for Joe Biden.  However, I'm going to label it as a tilt for now.  Keep in mind that it could effectively be a lean as well.  Given that this is Joe Biden's home state, he is bound to do a lot better than Hillary Clinton did there in 2016.  Not to mention the second point that there are a lot more Democrats registered in the state of Pennsylvania.  With mail-in voting, we could see a big boost for the Democratic Party in the state of Pennsylvania and for Joe Biden.  And thirdly, this is a state where Joe Biden really does well among demographics.  It's really very much his base in the state of Pennsylvania, whereas you probably see more of Donald Trump's base in the states such as Ohio, Iowa, West Virginia, Kentucky, those types of areas.  Anyways, moving on to the state of North Carolina, which I've left as the final state for a reason, because I am flipping it from the Republicans' favor in the last election to the Democrats' favor in this election, just by a tilt margin.  Keep in mind that I do believe North Carolina is a complete toss-up, a complete 50-50 toss-up.  Whoever wins this state will win it by less than 0.5 points.  I can say that is what my honest opinion is at this moment in time.  Polling data is extremely narrow.  And obviously, the Senate election is going to have a huge impact as well between Cal Cunningham and Tom Tillis.  It's going to be really important to look at polls and how Joe Biden and Donald Trump do in comparison to the two Senate candidates in the state of North Carolina, as well as the governor race, which is something to look at as well.  Could the overall popularity of the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, have an impact on the presidential race.  That is something that remains to be seen.  There is also a large African American population in the state of North Carolina.  On the backs of these riots, I also have that probably changing my mind about whether I want to leave it as a pure toss-up or in the tilt favor for the Democrats in the state of North Carolina.  So that is my effective reasoning for that state.  And finally, in North Carolina's second congressional district, I actually forgot to label this earlier, but I do see it as a lean in favor of the Republican Donald Trump.  So as you can see, I now have it at 294 to 244.  The only difference from the video a few weeks ago was North Carolina flipping from tilt Republican to tilt Democrat, as well as a few states across the map moving a little bit more to the left, such as Texas and Georgia, as well as Nevada and Minnesota.  so that is how i have the 25 538 or 270 electoral map.  uh looking right now.  uh based on the uh what is bound to be one of the greatest economic disasters since the great depression and obviously on the back of the protests and riots going on across the country right now which could have a major impact on what happens uh in the 2020 presidential election.  Now saying that, it also could not.  It could have absolutely zero impact whatsoever.  We really don't know.  So I want to stress that this is indeed just a prediction as things stand right now in this country.  So please make sure to like and subscribe.  Check out all the previous videos on this channel.
