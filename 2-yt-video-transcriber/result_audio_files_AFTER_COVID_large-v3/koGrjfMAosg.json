First, what he's trying to say here is that this is an appeal to popularity, just because the vast majority of scientists agree does not make it true.  And here's my response to that.  I agree.  Appeal to popularity is something that normally should be avoided.  Instead of just saying however many people agree as a primary argument, you should instead reason based on the merits of your argument.  This is actually kind of why I don't personally ever use the 97% argument against climate change skeptics.  However, if you do, I actually think it is valid, specifically in the case of science.  Consensus is the huge thing in the scientific method.  That's why we have entire concepts and such dedicated to it, because scientific consensus is different than regular consensus.  Like I said earlier, consensus follows the evidence and peer reviews.  If an idea has been thoroughly investigated and proven, there will naturally be consensus.  That's just how it works.  So when you point out that there's scientific consensus on something, you're basically also saying that there's plenty of evidence to back up the claim.  In other words, it is the leading hypothesis, theory, or fact.  So popularity in science is not the same as popularity from regular people.  It's a distinction that must be made.  That's why when we do science, saying that there is an agreement of an idea is convincing in and of itself. ",

It's funny because when organizations announce things for most other topics, there usually isn't an opposition.  Like, can you imagine if when the WHO came out and said something like, the coronavirus is a new virus that is spreading, and then people come and say, well, did you get a head count on how many of your scientists agreed with that?  How stupid is that?  Of course it's fine for an organization to come out and speak on behalf of their scientists on a scientific fact.  Second of all, it's annoying when climate change skeptics try to attach some political motive to these scientists.  You think Dr.  Bob down the street who got his PhD and done years of research in his field wanted to, for some reason, fabricate data and lie about his field of expertise because of some political idea?  And somehow all the scientists in the world, or at least 97% of them, are all just on board and would love to jump on the idea of spreading a false political message and put their careers and credentials on the line.

I am very, very closely ingrained in the scientific community, and let me tell you, scientists make pennies.  Specifically, when I mean scientists here, I mean the ones that work in academia, which are the ones that mostly publish these climate science papers, by the way.  Biological sciences is one of those career paths that pays so little compared to what you put into it.  Even if you're a PhD, you make so little considering the fact that you put years and years of effort into your degree.  When I have fans who come to me saying that I've inspired them to study biology in college, I sometimes warn them about it.  You don't go into natural sciences expecting to make money.  You go into the natural sciences because you love it, and that's what people need to understand.  Scientists are driven in their field because of passion.

When we're talking about topics that are outside the realms of your brain capacity, an appeal to authority is very much a good substitution.

That would take a hell of a long time.  But yet, you don't mind.  You take the drug anyway.  And ta-da, it works.  But for some reason, when scientists do the exact same thing for climate change, suddenly it's up for debate.  Suddenly it's an appeal to authority. ",

Jeez, you must really be getting desperate.  I don't know much about you or your channel.  I haven't watched the vast majority of your videos, so why don't you tell me some of your credentials?  Have you ever worked in science before?  What did you do in science?  Have you ever been credited in a published scientific paper?  Have you ever worked with other scientists?  Worked with data?  Done analyses?  Designed procedures and protocols?  I'm not trying to poison the well here, but it just doesn't sit right when you make these videos spreading it to tens of thousands of people and not even have any experience in science in general.  Of course, if you do, feel free to make that fact public.  I'll be waiting. ",
