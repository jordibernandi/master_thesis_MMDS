            "text": "hey guys welcome back to my channel.  thank you guys all for coming back and if this is your first time here you're welcome as well.  my name is virtue grace.  have you subscribed?  no ahead thank you guys.  so um following the video uploaded the other day about the tech innovations you know sweeping across the continent of which we are all excited about a lot of you gave me information about other similar projects that are being implemented across the continent and Many of you particularly called my attention to some innovations in Ghana, Nigeria, and those are the things I want to talk about and share with you guys today.  You know what?  I'm so excited, and I love the energy with which we are all, you know, involving ourselves in telling the African story, sharing our wings with the world, because you know what?  We can only do that ourselves.  Nobody's going to tell our stories for us.  We have to tell our stories by ourselves.  Remember what Chinua Achebe said, that until the lion begins to tell his story, the story of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.  So we have to tell our own story ourselves, okay?  From the perspective of Africa, by Africans, you know, to promote Africa.  so what am i saying in essence?  this week nigeria unveiled a prototype ventilator.  this prototype was developed or produced by the national national agency for science and engineering infrastructure.  This is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology.  And in the wake of the pandemic, the agency came together, you know, assembled a team.  And I think in the space of under seven days thereabouts, they came up with this prototype ventilator, which, of course, is going to undergo some, you know, scrutiny and, you know, modification and all of that in order to secure the approval of the government.  and then, of course, they'll go ahead to produce a mass.

I am very glad on behalf of the Minister, Dr.  Ogone Aomu, to congratulate Nasemi for the manufacture of this prototype ventilators, which understand the .  This has, in no small way, improved Nigeria's capacity to contain this virus that is flagging every nation. ",

            "text": "We are going to interface with relevant agencies, So time has finally come for us to start being self-reliant.  We do not have to wait for people to come and give us all those whites, you know, white savior mentality.  We are gradually shifting away from it.  Guys, I'm excited.  Really, I am.  And I'm so happy with the response that countries in Africa are beginning to take in the wake of this pandemic.  we're beginning to look inwards.  like i've always said it did stop there.  guys going to ghana i also discovered or like you guys shared with me i went to search and i discovered that actually somebody in ghana also came up with a prototype so he produced a prototype ventilator.  can you see how responsive we are as africans?  But for a long time now, we've allowed these potentials in us to life follow because we've always believed more in Europeans, we've always believed more in foreign support from somewhere.  It seems to me like we didn't know we had these potentials in us.  until adversity has hit us.  and i think they always say adversity is the true test of character.  so this adversity covid 19 has tested our character and in the wake of this harsh global reality we are beginning to look inwards and you know get innovative and manifest our potentials and our new technical ingenuity Very soon, the way I see, Africa will not need to import anything from anywhere.  I see that and I believe it and I will keep saying it.  We have all it takes.  Innovation, civilization, whatever you call it, began in Africa.  Forget all the lies.  they've told us over the years that technical innovation, scientific discoveries and all of that started from somewhere.  It's a lie.  All of this started in Africa.  back in Egypt.  Chem it.  Name it.  So we are taking back our rightful position.  And the exciting thing about this is the fact that we are all coming up with these prototypes and all these technical innovations using locally sourced materials.  So we are not going somewhere to go and import spare parts or bring stuff out.  We are looking around us.  This only reaffirms the fact that there are a lot of resources lying fallow around us.  Diverse resources abound on the continent of Africa.  If we can just look, you know, more critically, look more we are going to discover and harness these diverse resources that are bound on the continent.  I mean, we are looking inwards, utilizing locally available materials to come up with prototype ventilators, ventilators that are scarce.  Now, even developed worlds are looking for ventilators, you know, but we are now looking inwards and developing what materials you know is specific and um would i say useful for us within our context.  in africa we are taking into consideration our specific needs.  i shared with you the other day how the kenyans produced a prototype ventilator that can use Car batteries.  And that's taking into consideration the power challenge that we have on the continent.  So now we are becoming more responsive, taking into consideration our specific needs on the continent and developing local solutions to meet our needs.  I mean, that is what it's all about.  That is how technological advancement starts.  That's how industrial revolution starts.  And I see, very soon I see an Africa that is industrialized.  Have I also mentioned that in addition to the prototype ventilator that Nigeria has developed and unveiled to the public, Nigeria also developed some you know, safety tunnels.  So in the bid to curb the spread of the virus in public places, they've developed this tunnel which is going to, you know, self-disinfect individuals as you go into public places or go into specific organizations, into offices and, you know, all of those places that people congregate in large numbers.

We are not only producing prototype ventilators, which are going to, of course, scale up production in large numbers on approvals, but then we're also producing face masks.  I also shared that story with you in my previous video, so a lot of you reminded me of the fact that other countries are doing it.  And someone told me, Cross River State, Nigeria has produced um face mask in large numbers.  you didn't mention it and guys i checked honestly.  that must have been an oversight on my on my part.  i checked and cross river state nigeria has a huge garment factory which has now been converted into mass production of face masks.

And also you're supposed to use it daily, wash it every night, have it ready in the morning and put it back on.  So that's what we're doing here.  We're working on the masks around the clock.

We fondly call him our digital governor because he doesn't take chances.  He doesn't slack.  I've lived in Cross River State for about two years, so I know what I'm saying.  He's not hearsay.  He's a very responsive governor and very much in tune with, you know, current trends and all of that.  So thank you, Your Excellency Governor Ben Nayadeh, for these initiatives.  giving face masks free of charge.  Guys, and this is, for me, this is huge because like I mentioned in the previous video, when this COVID-19 hit Nigeria, face masks were in short supply.  People could not even see face masks to buy.  The ones that were even available were so pricey that a lot of people could not afford them.  So in addition to Cross River State mass producing and distributing these face masks to people you know, residents of Cross River State, I got the information that in Aba as well, face masks have been produced in large quantities, you know, and they are available in the market for people to buy.  You know, safety is very, very important.  We can only play our part in this type to contain the spread and to help flatten the curve.  Government is doing so much, but there's also a part for us to play as citizens of our different countries.  So, I love the fact that even individuals are not left out in the efforts to respond to this pandemic.  Individuals are also taking initiatives now to supplement the government's efforts in providing protective gears and to help prevent the spread of this pandemic across the continent and in our specific countries.  So thank you guys.  Like I always say, opportunities are bound for us now to utilize.  For those of you who have been looking to do business in Africa for a long time, the time is now.  think no further procrastinate no more.  start making plans as soon as the global travel restrictions are lifted.  make your way home.  come back mama.  africa is waiting for you to welcome you with open arms.  okay so that's pretty much what i want to share with you guys in this video today.  um do you have any stories you want to share with me so i can amplify?  you know drop a comment for me.  send me an email.  my email is in the description box down below.  send me an email with you know video clips or pictures of those amazing stories you want me to amplify on this platform.  let the world see that africa is not sitting and waiting for a savior to come and help her.  we are taking responsibility and doing things to meet our needs.  okay so share your stories and if you've not subscribed what are you waiting for?  click the subscribe button and the bell beside it so you get notified each time i upload new videos.  thank you so much guys for watching.  i will see you in my next video bye.
