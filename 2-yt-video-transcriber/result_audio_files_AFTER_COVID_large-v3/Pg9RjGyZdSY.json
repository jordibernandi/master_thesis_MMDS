Well, I have a bunch of grandkids, I have a bunch of kids, and a bunch of grandkids, and I have a handful of great grandkids, and this is our most recent one.  And it's a little girl.  And she's a little sweetheart.  And this is what it's all about.  So we need to protect these precious little things.  This is so important.  And they're so innocent and so helpless.  She's missing her mommy now.  Her grandmother's taking the picture.  My daughter's taking her picture.  So I'll let her go back over there to her.  Can you say bye?  Can you say bye?  Plus I'm talking a little loud.  See you later.  Say bye. ",
