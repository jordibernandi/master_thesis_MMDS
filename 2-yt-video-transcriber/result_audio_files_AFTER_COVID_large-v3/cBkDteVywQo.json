            "text": "There are many problems in this country.  Recent events have brought a spotlight to the issue of police brutality.  Of course, the political pundits and organizations will take certain aspects where there are definite issues like race and focus on that, rather than the real issue at hand, which is freedom.  America is a police state, not a free state.  In the wake of recent events, we've also heard calls to defund or abolish the police.  As an anarchist, I don't like the concentration of power and authority that government represents.  I believe in self-governance and would absolutely support abolishing the police if it means giving the money stolen from people against their will and used to fund law enforcement back to the people it was stolen from.  If they want to voluntarily part with their property in exchange for some sense of security, that's fine.  As long as their security force doesn't trample on or restrict my freedoms like these heavily armed blue line enforcement gangs of the state do, we won't have any problem.  Because as an anarchist, I also follow the non-aggression principle.  If I haven't hurt anyone else, damaged or stolen anyone else's property, or defrauded anyone else, no one should be using force against me.  These order followers of the state don't follow the non-aggression principle.  Simply put, they follow orders during the enforcement of state policy.  Their mere presence is an intimidation factor.  It escalates the situation.  They are armed with multiple instruments of force and torture, some lethal and some non.  This is to coerce us into compliance even before any interaction starts.  Then once the scene is established, they're trained to treat each and every one of us as a threat.  Or at least we can be deemed as one at any time for officer safety reasons.  You'll see what I mean soon.  Watch as I'm just there to document the scene.  I only spoke initially to thank the officers for not continuing to put their weight on the man after he was in handcuffs.  And then I was simply trying to get the name of an officer whose name tag was covered by his hands.  The rest of the names I was getting by just walking around the scene as many other people were doing.  I guess my camera poses a threat.  I don't know what else separated me from the rest of the onlookers.  Remember to upvote, share, subscribe, and leave me a comment about what you see here.  Oh, let's see that again.

That's why people like walking back and forth.  If you've got to go around, go out the gate and then through the other door, please.  It can help us keep things pretty simple.  Thank you.  Interesting.  So they're going to get him help by charging him with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.  Charge him, fine him, probably won't keep him in jail, but that's how they're going to help him.  Interesting. ",

            "text": "Not on my point of abolishing the police.  What happened here is the police were literally just down the street handling another issue that had just been resolved.  As officers were leaving the area, they noticed this disturbance and backup was called in.  The man they arrested had thrown a garbage can out of the shelter and in the street.  A shelter worker had gone and gathered up the can of trash, but this man wasn't done with his frustration.  He also threw an umbrella that may or may not have been his.  He was clearly destroying or attempting to destroy the property of others.  This is a real crime, one most people say is the reason we need cops.  In this case, which is a best case scenario for needing cops, they just so happen to be in the area and where they're fast and able to prevent this man from damaging any more property.  Most of the time, it takes them longer to respond, which results in more damage of property or whatever actual crime is actually being committed.  and in reality, what the cops do is already happening.  This shelter has some security-like personnel.  They cleaned up the trash in the street, and without cops around when someone is destroying or damaging property, According to the non-aggression principle, this is a case where force can ethically be used to stop said crime.  That doesn't always mean it's necessary though.  Let's think about this same instance without cops.  My guess is the security and community within the shelter would have used words to de-escalate the tension this man was experiencing, and not in a threatening manner with weapons strapped to their body, possibly causing him to talk rather than further damage and destroy any property.  Maybe even get this man the help he actually needs.  Of course, in this situation, force is justified, but it should only be a last resort after other options have been exhausted.  This is also not how order followers operate.  If you didn't hear him, Officer Plunkett, who used his massive body to force this man into compliance, told the man if he just would have followed commands, they could have had the conversation without the use of force.  Interesting.  Show up, intimidating the people with a massive show of force, then issue commands as a de-escalation technique.  When commands or orders aren't complied with, it's hands-on with overwhelming force.  And then some extortion and threats of confinement to a cage thrown in for good measure.  Because remember, these heroes are there to help this man with his problems.  Now you tell me, which sounds better, with or without blue line enforcement thugs? ",

They're just telling you you can't be videotaping the shelter.  Well, I can.  I'm not interfering.  Is that a threat?  I haven't interfered with anything.  You guys all confronted me.  I was just getting names.  You want to threaten me with violence?  You think that's ethical?  That's cool.  Pretty much what you just did there.  You're all amped up.  Yeah, but when you're in public, you have no expectation of privacy.  Yeah.  Are you staying at the shelter?  I don't answer questions.  Answered your questions.  It seems a little hypocritical.  Yeah, your job is to threaten violence.  People throw us in cages when there's no victim to any crime.  That's your job.  It's an unethical job.  I'm not going to help you in your investigation to find a crime against me.  No thanks.  Nice try, though.  I said I don't answer questions.  You can keep asking.  It's not going to happen.  I'm trying to be friendly.  You ruined that when I was walking down the sidewalk and he had his back turned and everyone else was walking by him with nothing.  But apparently when a guy with a camera walks by, it's a threat.  So you ruined the whole friendly thing when you did that.  Nice try, though.  I'm going to make sure nobody walks up behind my partner.  Do I have a gun?  What makes you think I have a gun?  When you're looking at a guy with a camera walking by, just asking you your name prior to doing that, what makes you think I have a gun and that I'm a threat?  Other than the fact that you guys are trained to think we're all a threat to you.  And that's why we're in the situation we're in in this country.  I do not consent to anything.  If you feel like for your safety, a hero needs to violate my freedom and my personal sanctity.  to make you feel safe, I do not consent to any searches, but if you feel safe, go ahead and put your hands on me.  If it makes you feel more safe when you're out in public, when you're the one strapped with guns.  Go ahead, put your hands on me.  Pat me down, you can see.  I didn't say it wasn't an open carry state.  He's more than welcome to carry guns, just like the rest of us are.  Like how you guys think that using my name when you guys had one of your other cohorts from a different agency punch me in the face for doing the same thing, not interfering.  Then that's how you get my name by... I really have no idea who you are.  Well, I'm trying to tell you something, but I guess you don't want to hear it.  You're like talking to a brick wall, bro.  You don't want to hear anything I have to say.  I don't want to answer your questions is what I said.  There's a big distinction between talking and answering questions.  If you want to take your badge off, your guns off, and be one of the people, I'd love to talk with you and answer some questions.  But as long as you're wearing that and you interrogate... We are the people.  Okay.  That's why we're having these protests every weekend, because you guys are the people?  Think about what you say before you say it, dude.  How many of these incidents you're protesting, which were agreed?  David Novak was shot a year and a half ago in the back by you guys while he was going into his house.  Yes, I've studied it.  I've read the reports.  I know.  Which one is that?  You guys didn't invent... David Novak.  Officer Rankin shot him.  Officer Rankin also told another guy he had warrants, and he didn't have warrants.  He broke the guy's window, tased him, all this stuff.  Turned out the warrants weren't for him.  So, yes, this is happening in our town.  Do I need to go back to the dog that one of your boys let in a car?  Yes, you guys are using excessive force on a regular basis.  If you want me to keep going, I will.  in your opinion but in a lot of other people's opinion that's excessive force.  but guess what the thing is i don't get to say i don't support the amount of force you guys use and withdraw my monetary support.  what happens is you guys keep coming and taking monetary money from me to support you guys doing what you're doing.  i don't have a choice in it.  so yes we come out and we say stop and you guys go.  does it happen in your town?  and yes it is happening in our town.  so that's why we're out.  so i every the seventh of every month we go and do it And we hold signs out there saying you guys are being unjust.  The courts are supposed to decide, not you guys.  A lot of abandonment here. ",
