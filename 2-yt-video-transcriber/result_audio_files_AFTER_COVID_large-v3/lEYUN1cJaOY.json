            "text": "So now, Another string of robberies in Chicago and the southwest suburbs.  These incidents have happened in Summit, Illinois, Chicago, Palos Heights, Oak Forest.  These idiots are robbing restaurants, jumping through the drive-thru.  You cannot make this up.  The thing that hurts the worst and was traumatizing to me is that every time I watch the news, go to WorldStarHipHop, I see the usual suspects.  Let me tell y'all something.  As soon as I do get enough money to move away from these idiots, I'm gone.  I'm gone.  I don't blame people for running from us.  Honestly.  Soon as I get enough, I'm gone.  If y'all follow me, I'm moving again.  I'm getting my daughter as far as I can.  And that's sad to say that I got to take my daughter and get as far from my own community as I can get.  Every time I turn on the TV, I see more ignorant ish that tops more ignorant ish.  I thought I topped it yesterday.  I was wrong.  We had to get to the bottom.  The police are saying they cannot solve it alone.  They need the community's help.  And we gotta get rid of that code of silence.  We are letting these young ignorant idiots traumatize our women, children.  rob and kill innocent babies and we stand around and we cry and complain and beg other people from outside our community to do something, but we won't stand up and do something for our own community.  These idiots are facing 20 years in jail for a couple hundred dollars.  Group economics.  We must shop at the businesses in our community to give some of these morons jobs in our community.  so they ain't got to come out and shoot, kill each other and rob for pennies.  We got to find out where is the chop shop?  Where are they selling these cars?  All right.  Let me bring y'all something.  All these innocent babies on this page.  None of them.  None of them.  Over 30 years old.  25.  Okay, 47.  22.  29.  32.  30.  The fact that we ain't outraged is crazy.  23.  17.  42.  17.  26.  19.  35.  28.  Why I say group economics?  Anywhere where there's poverty, there's violence, people.  There is a direct correlation, people.  Some of these carjackings happened over here.  One major incident was over here.  Once people fight back, then it becomes... something else.  a lot of people fight back and it turns into a homicide or murder.  this is one of the suspect cars there.  that's one of the suspect cars there.  the police cannot do it alone.  we must help them out of the garage.
