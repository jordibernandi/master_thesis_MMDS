But I recently covered him in the first episode on my part of the Cycles of Fascism series, a series I've been collaborating with Godless Cranium on.  Not gonna introduce anything major right now, since we've obviously got the intro and everything to take care of first.  So, without further ado... Thank you.  Alrighty, as per usual, everybody, let's get into fan art, and then we'll get right into the video proper.  First of all, we have a This Is Very H by Logan the Wolf, which is of course featuring a Rule 63 Cerys, because there just isn't another kind anymore.  Not that that's a bad thing.  I've adjusted.  Then we have me hammering myself due to BGR from Resentful Cleric.  And finally, we have Rule 63 Cerys in what I assume is Wither Skelly's avatar, doing a punchkin to a pumpkin and eye of fear.  And with all that out of the way, let's get some context for today's video.  The guy we're looking at today is Rick Wiles, who, like I said at the beginning, I've covered earlier on my channel.  Links will be in the description.  Back in 2014, Rick Wiles decided to say that the Ebola virus outbreak was because people weren't worshiping God correctly.  This is not something new for him, but let's take a look at what he's saying now. ",

            "text": "Alright, so for those who don't know, he's talking about the coronavirus.  If you've been living under a rock, you might not have heard of it, but if you haven't been, let's take a look at what the coronavirus actually is.  Coronavirus are an extremely common cause of colds and other upper respiratory infections.  These viruses normally are zoonoses, which means they infect certain animals and spread from one animal to another.  But there is one strand of coronavirus that can spread to humans, particularly if certain mutations have occurred, and in this case, they have.  Chinese health authorities who've been reporting to the World Health Organization have been saying that a group of viral pneumonia have been popping up as of December of last year.  Most of the people who've been ill have been in contact with seafood and animals that have been in the market of Wuhan, a large city in eastern China.  However, while the initial strand of the virus mutates so that it can hop from an animal to a person, that strand can hop from person to person just as easily.  Currently, we have no antivirals for this particular strand of coronavirus, so the only treatment you can really do is support.  As of the time of my research, we've had two cases of coronavirus in the United States thus far.  We don't necessarily know the particulars of how it spreads quite yet.  In animals, it spreads through droplets containing large particles that typically can only be suspended in the air for about three or six feet before dissipating completely.  So basically, the proximity of an incredibly powerful sneeze.  By comparison, something like measles or chickenpox spreads through smaller droplets that can go much further distances before dissipating.  so that while we know that, yes, it can be spread airborne, we don't think that it can be spread quite as badly as the measles.  As for the symptoms you might have once you actually contract it, fever, shortness of breath, possibly nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, though there are many cases of people recovering after just a few days.  But there are some people, especially the young, elderly, or people who are immunocompromised, tend to succumb to it and develop bronchitis or pneumonia.  So all in all, it's pretty nasty, but there's still a whole lot of loose ends that we don't quite know about.  This is still very new.  Anywho, the reason that I give that information now is because that's what Rick's talking about.  So now that you know what the virus is, where it's from, and how it spreads, let's see what Rick's take is. ",

            "text": "Alright, so if you remove the hyperbole, he's basically saying that people in China are not virtuous, and thus that is where the plague began.  He's also linking it to communism, of all things.  But if he knew even a little bit about China's economy, you'd know that it's not actually a communist economy.  It's a hybrid one.  While, yes, the political party who dominates the nation is supposed to be a communist party, China itself is not a communist country.  It has a hybrid economy with a mix of communist and capitalist notions, just like how we have a mixed economy, though we certainly favor capitalism more.  As for the forced abortions bit, he tries to claim this as a form of Christian persecution, when in reality, the forced abortions were due to China's one-child policy, where the nation itself started to become so overcrowded and populated that they enacted a one-child policy to try to decrease their population.  This policy ended in 2015, but it was in place for about 35 years.  Now, please keep that in mind.  That means that five years ago, this policy ceased.  But Rick Wiles wants to make the case that that policy, and things that stemmed from it, such as forced abortions, are responsible for the coronavirus now.  But there's a five-year gap.  And then he wants to say that this is God's punishment.  So wait, God waited five years to punish somebody in this life, this is nothing to do with hell or anything like that, and we're supposed to believe that this punishment is because of persecution of Christians via forced abortions that weren't even targeted at Christians.  So there's two things I can gather from this.  The first is that Rick Wiles is obviously a fear-mongering idiot.  The second and possibly more important thing I can gather from this is that Rick seems to believe that God is so inaccurate with his punishments that he'll bring them five years late to the party, a party that's been going on for 35 years.

Then again, it's not entirely out of line with what you see in the Old Testament, where God slaughtered innocent people because the Pharaoh hardened his heart.  Uh, sorry, because God hardened the Pharaoh's heart.  God had to punish the Pharaoh by punishing other people.  Hold on, I'm starting to notice something.  God doesn't actually know how to teach anybody a lesson through the biblical narrative.  He punishes other people for an individual's actions, but that individual's actions were influenced by the hardening of their heart that God himself did on purpose.  If we were to apply that logic to here, though, wouldn't that mean that God influenced the Chinese government to perform thousands of abortions?  And then as punishment for that, God is now bringing them a virus several years late after they fixed the problem?  I mean, if we're to make this as consistent with biblical narrative as possible, that's about what we'd get.  A government influenced by God, enacting policies that God apparently doesn't want, And then instead of that government being punished, it's the people who have to suffer.  Innocent lives that didn't do anything wrong.  Right. ",

They're usually rebelling because they themselves have been persecuted by Christians who hide behind their Bible as a method to be a bigot.  For instance, people who are gay and have no choice in the matter because, again, you don't choose your attraction, who get kicked out of their house or beat by their parents for being gay and the Good Book told them they shouldn't be that.  Children who were beat into submission when they weren't obeying just right enough, because Christians like those to be found in the NIFB, took the phrase, spare the rod, spoil the child, to its logical conclusion.  No, Rick, it's not innocence that people are rebelling against.  You're not innocent.  As demonstrated in the previous video I did on you, you're an anti-Semite of all things, and you're a borderline fashy.  Innocent is not the word I would use to describe you or the people who you're bedfellows with, like Jim Baker, even if he does sell thousands of pounds of mac and cheese every day. ",

            "text": "Okay, let's address this point by point.  Let's start with the transgendering little kids thing.  While there are some extreme examples you can point to, specifically the John Money situation, where a botched circumcision led to an ill-informed surgery that ultimately culminated in a person's suicide, outside of extreme examples like that, children aren't being, quote, transgendered, unquote.  In fact, the process of actually doing anything that would require them to transition doesn't begin until well later on in their lives, when they've had plenty of time to decide if that's what they want to do, and they're old enough to make an informed decision.  The stuff we do up until that point are things like puberty blockers that buy about five years of time for the individual.  Therapy to let them live life as another gender temporarily to determine whether or not they actually fit better there than in the one they were assigned at birth.  But actual transitioning of a child?  That's not a thing that happens except in, again, the most extreme of cases, like the John Money example I gave earlier.  But this is what people like Rick have to do to make their point.  They have to fearmonger, they have to make you terrified of your neighbors.  He wants to sell you his brand of Christianity and, I think, ultimately a form of ultra-nationalistic fascism, because he has to make you scared of the Muslim, of the Jew, of your neighbor, of everybody around you who could possibly be a godless heathen.  And now he gets to add on to the narrative that you might even contract an actual virus because of the godlessness of your peers.  This kind of predatory fear-mongering is absolutely disgusting. ",

            "text": "Okay, so, per the Christian narrative, if I were to take a very charitable view of what you're saying, it would be that at risk of death, which would lead to hell.  if you're unsaved, it's best to go ahead and hedge your bets on God, take Pascal's wager, and get right with God so that you can make your way into the pearly gates when you ultimately die.  And that death might be from the virus that you think God is spreading everywhere.  Okay, that's... Not what I think his point is, though.  With a statement like that, I think that, quite literally, he thinks that if people get right with God, then suddenly, the plague itself will have no more reason to sweep across the nation.  But given that we understand how the disease works, to an extent, the mechanics of how it was formed, where it originated from and how it spreads, trying to claim that there's a supernatural origin to this thing is absolutely bogus.  If we can understand, on a physical level, everything to do with this virus, then supernatural origin need not apply.  Again, bear in mind, this is a virus that was already existing in other animal species to begin with.  It just happened to mutate, and now it's spreading.  And you know why the mutation allows it to spread?  Because that's how evolution works.  But that's another thing that Rick Wiles probably doesn't believe in.  even though it literally led to a virus that he's currently talking about on his show. ",

So mocking, attacking, or anything like that would mean that he gets to then play up the threat of the Angel of Death.  If we try to stay consistent within that frame of logic, this means that anybody mocking Rick is now being given a death threat.  Granted, the death threat is basically saying that a super, super violent ghosty ghost is going to kill you with a very naturalistic plague, but I think my points still stand.  This is like the whole is hell a threat thing.  At the end of the day, this is a threat.  Mock Rick Wiles?  The angel of death could be upon you.  It's literally a death threat, in case you mock him.  But because it's worded in such a way that it relies on his religion and supernatural forces, it can't legally be taken as a death threat.  It's also not aimed at any one person in particular, just aimed at a vague group of people who might potentially, hypothetically, be mocking him. ",

Discipline is there so that you can have an attitude correction in future.  But if you're dead, then the attitude correction need not apply.  You literally don't exist anymore.  You don't have an attitude to be corrected.  And if you try to extrapolate from this further and get to the point where you're in Hell, well, again, if Hellfire is eternal, then there's no actual attitude adjustment happening there either.  There is no point from there where you can actually take your lessons and learn them.  You're just in fire.  Forever.  Burning.  But what's the takeaway with all of this?  Well, I can definitely say that it takes an incredibly well-adjusted and well-meaning person to threaten anybody mocking them with death, but word it in such a way where they can't personally be accountable.  I also think that a little bit of basic biology would go a long way in helping Rick Wiles understand why the way he views plagues and viruses makes absolutely no sense.  We can also come to another conclusion.  That is that it's really strange that a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful, and thus could enact plagues in any way he wished, would decide to use such an inaccurate, late-to-the-party, and ham-fisted mechanism to dole out his petty punishments.  It's like when people like Rick say that hurricanes are coming to destroy cities because people are having gay sex there, but people who are completely straight end up being the majority of those harmed.  Who was actually being punished in that scenario?  Because for the most part, it wasn't the gay couples.  But anyways, what takeaways do you guys have?
