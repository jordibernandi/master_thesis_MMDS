So as I said, he's going to be the greatest president since Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt.  He may fall a little short of Abe Lincoln, but he's going to be the greatest guy.  And anything goes wrong, it's going to be Trump's fault.  All right.  Now, he's got a problem with his son because his son is being investigated by the Justice Department, took $15 million.  Did he pay tax on it?  I don't know.  If he didn't, it's going to be trouble.  So he got all this money because his father was vice president at the time.  And isn't that about that?  No doubt about it.  All right, Hunter Biden got more than $10 million because his father was vice president.  Period.  Okay, so Joe and Jill Biden go on the Colbert program, which is just rank propaganda.  It's not a humor program.  It's not an interview program.  It's just left-wing propaganda.  That's all it is.  That's all Colbert has always been.  Roll tape. ",

Hello, anybody?  It is what it is.  What it is is a mess.  And if by some miracle, and this isn't hard, Hunter Biden's tax returns don't show $10 million, Hunter Biden's going to jail.  And if his father got any of that money, well, I'm not even going to speculate, is what it is.  So Mr.  Biden is defending his son.  Now, I put myself in that shoes.

He's not going to appoint a counsel to investigate election fraud either.  Here's what he says, quote, I'm sure there was fraud.  This is the attorney general saying to the American people, I'm sure there was fraud.  But I was commenting to the extent, another extent, to which we had looked at suggestions or allegation of Hispanic or Braves fraud that could affect the outcome of the election.  And I stand by the statement that there wasn't.  All right, but you haven't completed, Mr.  Barr, with all due respect.  And he leaves on Thursday.  You haven't completed the investigation.  You haven't done forensics on the voting machines in question.  You haven't done analytics on the mail-in voting.  So how do you know?  See, this is what I mean.  We are living in a corrupt country.  The country is corrupt.  And that's because we have a corrupt media that looks the other way.  unless you're a Republican or you're a conservative.  Now, when you have no watchdog, no one looking, you're going to commit crimes.  That's what's happening in Chicago and in New York.  These are violent crimes because there's nobody to stop you.  Defund the police.  Now here, and I really hate to say this, I think William Barr cares more about being accepted by the establishment in Washington going forward than he does getting to the bottom of this stuff.
