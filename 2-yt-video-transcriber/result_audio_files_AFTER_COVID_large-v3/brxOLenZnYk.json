            "text": "Papa, what was your latest dream?  Well, my son is asking me what's my latest dream.  I told this to him and I thought it's worth telling to everybody.  Joel chapter 2 verse 28 says that in the last days, God will pour out his spirit.  Old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions.  So I'm middle-aged.  I guess I get to see a bit of both.  Recently, God gave me a very vivid dream where I was supposed to introduce Jesus to a synagogue full of Jews.  And I really racked my brain.  I thought, how do I introduce Jesus.  And these words came out of my mouth.  I said to the Jews in that synagogue, here is a man who needs no introduction.  And then Jesus walked into the synagogue.  He was very unimpressive.  He was actually shorter than me.  I remember that in the dream.  I know that he can appear in different forms, but he definitely looked like Jesus.  Everybody knew that that was Jesus.  He was the Messiah.  And in the room, they said, I don't believe it.  And so to help them know for sure, they know it was Jesus, but maybe they don't know who he is.  He's the Messiah.  And I said, our creator has visited us.  And in that room of Jews, somebody said, it's impossible.  And so Jesus began to introduce himself and share who he is from the scriptures to the Jews.  And whatever he said, he convinced them.  I really wish I could have heard, but it was like the moment he spoke to the synagogue, I couldn't hear it.  And whatever he said, he convinced them and they all repented and believed.  And I believe that this dream is a sign of at least two things.  Number one, Jesus is visiting the Jews.  The time is near.  The end is near.  And God is reaching out to the Jews and showing them, revealing to them who the Messiah is.  Truly, the King of Jerusalem, the Son of David, the Lord from on high, born in Bethlehem, betrayed by his close friend, fulfilling all these prophecies in the Bible.  And number two, I think it was a great encouragement to me because this year we're not doing an Israel tour and yet our hearts are for Israel.  We pray for Israel and God is assuring us that we are introducing Jesus to many Jewish people.  They are watching us and they're paying attention on Discover Church.  Online, they're paying attention on YouTube.  So praise God.  So whenever you think of us and you support us, you know that you're supporting not only the mission in Australia, in America, in Asia, but we also have a heart to reach the Jews.  So I'm so glad that I could share that dream with you.  I hope that encourages you.  I hope that blesses you.  And whatever's happening in your life, never forget, keep looking up. ",
