I can't feel nothin'.  but this chain that binds me Lost track of how far I've gone How far I've gone, how high I've climbed.  On my back's a sixty-pound stone On the shoulder half mile in line.  Come on up for the risin'.  Come on up and lay your hands in mine.  Come on up for the risin'.  Come on up for the risin'.  I left the house this mornin'.  Bells were ringing, felt the air.  I swear at the cross I'm not calling.  Home is a fire.  I can run downhill.  Come on up for the rising.  Come on up and lay your hands in mine.  Come on up for the rising.  come on la la la la.  We love you.  Your spirit's above and behind me.  Your face is on black eyes, birth and bride.  May the precious blood find me.  For as I stand before your fiery light.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I see Mary in the garden.  We have to let them know who we are, what we stand for.  We choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and yes, unity over division.  It's time for us to lift our heads up, open our hearts, and remember who we are.  We are the United States of America.  And I mean this.  There's not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.
