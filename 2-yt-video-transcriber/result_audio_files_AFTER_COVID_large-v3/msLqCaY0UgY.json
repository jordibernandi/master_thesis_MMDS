And they said, I just want to make sure it's right.  It's that individuals before a certain age are given mercy on the things that they had done.  And is there any scripture that relates back to this idea?  And is there an age estimate of when that ends? ",

You're not going to go to jail for life if you jaywalk, unless you're in California and you're a Christian.  Sorry.  But... Where were we?

And he says, the people who had greater knowledge and did evil will be beaten with many blows.  the people who had lesser knowledge and did evil would be beat will be beaten with fewer blows.  and he says to whom much is given much will be required.  that's one of the scariest verses in the entire Bible because in America we've been given so much.  Especially right now, you can plumb the depths of all sorts of different Bible versions, Bible translations, Bible commentaries, books, commentary, all sorts of things.  to know who God is, unlike any other time in history to whom much is given, much will be required.  In fact, think about this, ladies and gentlemen.  Do you know that we have more access to God's revelation than the apostle Paul had?  Paul probably died before he saw some of the New Testament.  He probably didn't see the book of Revelation.  He probably didn't see the book of Hebrews unless he wrote it.  He probably didn't see certain books in the New Testament written later.  We have more information about God than the Apostle Paul.  To whom much is given, much will be required.  That's only fair, right?  Get ready.  Get ready.  Start using what you know to build God's kingdom. ",
