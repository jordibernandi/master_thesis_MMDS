            "text": "Hello Blacksit family, it's Juliette.  I hope you're well.  Blacksit family, Blacksit family, Blacksit family today.  Wow, have I got news for you.  Why am I sitting here on my bed doing this broadcast?  I was supposed to be giving you an insight into my home, the one that we've been building, but guess what?  my husband Adrian left me.  I'm serious.  he said it took me far long to get ready by the time I've come out and I'm looking around for Adrian.  there's no Adrian now.  yesterday we went to go and get some bits and pieces for the house and on the way back we had a mechanical fault on the car.  so Adrian's gone with my car and one of the things I want to talk about is transport.  so the car is getting fixed by mechanics.  but I do have a driver and I do recommend when you come here in Gambia it's a really good idea when you first come here to have a designated driver who drives you around.  so I do have my own independent driver and yes I do drive also.  but sometimes when I have a lot of locations to go to over a short space of time and I don't know all the back roads I do have a designated driver who drives me around and his name is Peter Gomez and he's a lovely man anyway.  so Adrian's gone with my driver to the house so unfortunately I wasn't able to give you that all-time insight special tour.  I'm really sorry really really sorry if And it didn't take me that long to get ready.  It really didn't.  It didn't.  You know, I know they say it takes women ages and ages and ages.  But to be honest with you, it didn't take me that long.  So Adrian, you could have waited for me.  That's all I've got to say.  But anyway, I want to talk about transport because people have asked me, how do you get around in the Gambia?  Now, how you get around depends on where you live.  If you live in Banjore, Then you have Gambian transport services which are like the long green buses that resemble those like half double decker buses that you get all around the world and they go to different locations and destinations.  Now when you live out in the provinces or you live out on the coast like here, you also have mini buses and you have taxis and you have Joe rides and you have other tuk tuks as well.  So that's how most people get by.  So you have two different types of taxis.  You have your green taxi and you have your yellow and green taxi.  Now the Green Taxi is a tourist taxi that you find mainly in tourist areas around Kaloli, Kottu, Bijalo and Senegambia and areas mainly and Bakatu, Cape Point.  Areas that are high in concentration with tourism, Fajara, those areas.  And I do suggest you get a map and you kind of have a look around the coast.  Gambia is very beautiful and it has a really long beautiful sandy coast and lovely beaches.  And I am going to show you a bit more of that.  But while I'm sulking about being left behind, I thought I was talking about transport and I realized I haven't shared with you about transport yet.  So I thought I'd just do a little one-to-one because my husband's left me.  Anyway, so, yeah, the cost now.  Now, if you get in a yellow and green taxi, which usually runs along one main road, so say, for example, I'm going from Carabao Avenue all the way down to the junction at Culloden Highway, which is where Palma Rima is, say I'm going there, for example, or I'm going to Senegambia, Then it's like all the way in that one car.  But you share that car with others.  Other people might jump in going in the same direction as you.  They literally bib bib and you get in those yellow and green ones.  And those ones cost about 8 dollars.  So it's quite cheap.  Also it's the same in a minivan.  So if you're like, for example, going to Tipagaras or you're going to Saraconda Market, then you would get two of those buses, eight Dalasi bus, depending on when you're leaving from or one bus, depending on how close you are to Saraconda.  And that's also eight Dalasis.  So it works out for the pound.  I think it's 65 dollars to the pound and I think it's 50 to loss $50.  note 50.  Yeah, it's 50 dollars to the dollar.  So let me get that right.  I think it's 50 dollars to the dollar So I'm not sure about the current rate.  So that's how much that would cost.  now if you get a private taxi example to take you locally within like i'd say like a two mile radius you're talking about 50 glasses.  if you go further than that in a normal taxi like a green taxi or even a yellow and green taxi which is out up for just your own personal higher yeah you go outside of that area range and you're paying about 100 glasses.  The further out you get, the more you pay for a taxi.  So I just wanted to share that with you.  Also, there are the bigger buses that take you further out to places like Basset.  Or if you want to go to Senegal, you can take the C bus or you can take a bus which leaves from Tepigaras at 7am but you have to book your ticket in advance.  and that costs like 1,500 dollars to get to Senegal.  so the good thing about living in Africa is that you can travel around the continent excuse me sorry dry throat and so you can travel around the continent and see various countries.  and the good thing about living in Gambia is that it's friendly People are smiling and it's affordable.  It is affordable.  And I really wanted to show you my house today and so I'm a little bit disappointed.  But yeah, you can get that and also you can hire a car.  so I want to talk a little bit about car hire as well and some black sit subscribers actually do car hire here.  so you can get a really really good deal and You can get a really really good deal from some black sit car hire firms and that are involved with black sit as well, so it's worthwhile doing that.  if you heard a bit about banging in the background it's because One of our neighbours are actually building like an outhouse.  So they're just doing that at the moment.  So they've just started work.  And so you've got that.  The car hire.  Now it depends on what car you hire.  Some cars you pay like depending on how long you're going to hire the car from.  And so you buy like a package.  And so and it depends on the car.  So like four wheel drives different to a basic car and a luxury or prestige car is completely different to, you know, an old jalopy that you can hire to drive around in.  so and remember that the roads here you can go off road and on road and here you have good roads and you also have roads which are very bumpy and very rocky aren't fully developed yet but you have both roads now.  for like where i live the roads are pretty good and remember that gambia is also sandy.  i hope that didn't come through on the video.  that sounds but yeah it's like almost living on a beach.  so you have a lot of sandy areas as well.  so if you are going to ship a car over when you come to live try and make it like a four-wheel drive.  or yeah try and preferably make it a four-wheel drive.  so someone also asked me about shipping cars and vehicles and how much they cost.  we shipped over vehicles when we came here and the vehicles that we shipped over was a four-wheel drive truck and um two mini buses and a um.  uh trying to remember yeah a four-wheel drive a two mini buses uh a um and a convertible car and something i can't remember.  but anyway you'll come back to me.  it's time to say that a year ago like every year ago that we did this that people would think I'd remember.  I don't know why I forgot one of the vehicles but anyway basically and in order to do that you have to pay your taxes you have to pay for to put a container on the other side and then you also have to pay for the container when he gets here.  so there are various aspects of shipping.  I'm going to go into in more detail with you on another video.  this is very important that you understand all the levels of costs and charges that there are and some of them have been increased.  so there are incremental changes that have gone on even since I've shipped.  so I need to find them out so I can get back to you.  another aspect of of having you can buy a car here also but the higher of a typical car which is what I was on before I got distracted talking about shipping.  the higher of a typical car per.  they could be anything from 500 to lassie up to 1500 um or 2500 depending on the luxury car.  so i just wanted to talk a little bit about transport today.  so i hope i've not bored you.  so you've heard about your your your local mini buses yeah which have to sort of jump in and uh they stop they have little apprentice who are like their conductors.  and then you have your taxis.  just to give you a quick recap the green ones And the yellow and green ones.  And you have a lot of Mercedes here.  Most taxis are Mercedes simply because they're seen as reliable cars.  And they're hard wearing.  And especially the older models.  So it's nice.  It reminds me of actually like sometimes some, I see certain cars that remind me of being in Havana.  But in Cuba.  So you have that aspect of those transports.  You also can hire your own driver which also is very reasonable because it's like having your own personal taxi and so you pay for the fuel and the driver.  rather than hiring the car.  so it works out to be quite reasonable and I get really good rates.  so I can't talk for everybody else.  but you know my driver Peter Gomez is also available to other people as well just like I don't use them every day.  so yeah this is what I wanted to tell you.  and also to hire a car you're looking at anything from 500 and I see a day for jalopy all the way up to maybe 2,500 for a very high or 4,000 even for a high-end like range brand new range and some of them come with drivers also.  So, and then some cards.  you can just hire over a period of time, like, and it works out like $10,000 to last you for the week.  So, I'm not good with doing all the conversions, but like I said, it's about $1 is $50.  No.  In dollars, yeah, it converts to $50 for $1 and for pounds it's $65 for \u00a31.  So you can do your conversions, do your maths.  So yeah, it was just a quick video really.  So wish you a happy day and enjoy your day.  And also the coming Saturday and Sunday, I hope you enjoy your days.  And as Shanice would say, you're earth strong, or you're earth weak, you're daily strong.  And rather than saying weak.  And yeah, so I wanted to remind you about the Cyrilion trip.  I will be putting marketing out in the next coming few days.  So if you really, really are interested, you need to let me know.
