It's not full of air like the football is, in which the air is actively counteracting the fall of the football.  The mass has to be considered then because you have to measure the forces against each other, which is dependent on the mass.  Now, if you kept playing that video, you would see that they did another experiment, this time dropping a car and a tire.  They landed at the same time, surprise surprise.  But because the tire is much heavier, it has a greater force than what the football had, so it could counter any opposing forces to a greater degree.  Therefore, its acceleration did not significantly reduce.  I didn't show the clip here because the clip is from some show and I'd rather not risk a copyright strike.  Now, air is something we very much have to consider when conducting these experiments.  As we can see, it can skew results.  However, if you drop objects in a vacuum, they will always, without a doubt, land at the same time.  Here's a video showing just that.
