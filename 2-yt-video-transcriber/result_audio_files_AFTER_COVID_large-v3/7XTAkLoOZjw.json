            "text": "Hi everyone, Saint Mane here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Daniel.  He didn't send me a specific topic.  So what I'd like to do is go through a Reddit post called, I can feel it in the air, women are done, which I put a link to in the description.  It was created by someone named Teddy and he follows the same mistake in his reason and rationality that myself and so many others before me and after me made.  We naively thought that if we went our own way, and so did many other men out there, that other men would see this trend and also walk away from women.  And it would therefore lead to women suffering.  But someone named American Jedi below that post says this, and I quote, \"'Nope.  Sorry, but this just isn't the case.  Plenty of men still want to date, want to marry, and have families.  I just look around in public and see even the fattest women with a man in tow.  And women who aren't fat have their choice of many  men.'.  Nothing is going to change anytime  soon.\".  That's definitely the case.  If you look through something like Tinder, and let's say the top 40 to 50% of the best-looking women never actually get back to you.  If they are done and their world is folding like a cheap suitcase, then they would take whatever attention they could get.  Even if women are done with us, they would still be using our tax dollars to support them.  which is what many of the ones in unionized government jobs are doing.  I'll get to my thoughts about women being far from done as well as share some of my personal stories about this in a moment.  But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, the MGTOW Book Collection.  Tim Patton has written five MGTOW books.  MGTOW is Forever is the latest and is a great introduction to MGTOW.  If you've been injured on the job and need help, disabled and unable to work is for you.  MGTOW Building Wealth and Power helps you empower your finances.  Masculinity is.  our future is about how the world sees masculinity as toxic and what it means to be a man.  Finally, MGTOW Why I Cheat.  When a woman named Marcia read this book, she wanted to scream out loud, why is MGTOW a real thing?  Thanks for pushing her buttons, Tim.  All five books can be found at the sponsor link down below.  Anyways, now back to the video.  About a year and a half ago after first going my own way, I thought the way that Teddy did.  That women were done.  But I changed my mind after I was filming an event for a female client.  I was taking pictures and video for her.  I think that night I took about 500 photos and shot at least an hour or two worth of video.  Everything went smooth on my end even though she yelled at the caterers and her husband.  Her husband was a very successful guy with a massive tool and dye business.  And yet there he was moping around with a woman that treated him like dog poop.  He could have done so much better, but he was stuck under her spell.  This wasn't his first wife either.  I went home and thought my job is done without any incidents.  The next day I sent her the photos and videos.  She was happy with the video, but she was pissed off about the photos.  Because out of all the 500 photos I took, 15 of them were actually of the help.  The idea is to show everyone that I'm thorough when I work and that I can take pictures of everything and everyone I see.  but she was pissed and started treating me like her husband.  It's after that encounter that I realized that if women like her can meet a man in their lives, then so can most women.  We're talking about a woman in her 60s with a man in his 70s.  The older guys I find are far more tolerant of the emotional punishment that women dish out.  Maybe they don't let it get to them so much.  Maybe they just hide their broken souls better.  After that, I realized that women are never done, and even if there are horrible human beings to be around, they'll still keep going, and they'll be dating to get attention, and there are always thirsty old guys out there wearing thirsty to pants.  I'd say that the only women that are truly done are in their 70s and above because many of the men in their age bracket are down under the ground.  As for the comment by American Jedi about how even the fattest and nastiest women have their pick of men these days, yes, it's true.  What about all the grotesque gals that you don't see out in public strolling around because they're home alone?  I would wager that the women that you're seeing wandering around in their society are invisible to most men.  The reason American Jedi probably noticed these women was because they were with a man to begin with.  I've found that even the women that are threes and fours looks wise or middle-aged, but that have higher intelligence and a pleasant personality that aren't like the typical Nagasaurus can still get men that are much more attractive and younger than they are.  I found that for us men to attract younger, hotter women, we have to have a lot of C&C, cash and charisma.  But for women past 40, if they want to attract a man in his late 20s, for example, if they have a mind of a man to go along with their middle-aged menopausal body, then they can still attract the most attractive of men.  even if they're single mothers.  A good example of this is Karen Strawn.  I know she hasn't put out any YouTube content for a long time now, so for those of you who've never heard of her before, I put a link to one of her videos in the description.  She's a single mother of three that attracted a much younger and more successful man.  I know a woman in her 40s, one of the smartest women I met, and she found herself and married a perfect specimen that was in his late 20s, with money and muscles.  It was her mind that he was attracted to.  Women with low sexual marketplace value with regards to higher age and lower looks can find men with much higher sexual marketplace value in their late 20s and early 30s, simply by behaving themselves and providing peaceful and thoughtful company for a man, instead of non-stop nagging, yelling, and political correctness.  You see, besides guys thinking that guys only fall for women for their looks, a lot of the time it can also be because of intelligence or even money.  After I went my own way and went back to dating, I didn't even bother worrying about looks so much.  Instead, I prioritized women who had good careers and made money.  I was still hoping to have kids at that point.  So I wanted someone financially successful that also wanted children because that would make both our lives easier.  So when guys out there in the manosphere say that women are wasting their time getting careers, I don't think that they would believe that there are guys such as myself that actually found myself more attracted to successful women.  Of course, I wouldn't be attracted to such women in my 20s.  It only happened once I reached my mid-30s.  So maybe that's the mating strategy of the average 30-something woman these days.  Build up her career while getting banged up the rear in her younger years and then trying to find a beta male provider that wants kids.  that does a cost-benefit analysis and figures out that he would be better off marrying a woman with resources to make both their lives supposedly easier.  But he's not thinking about the potential of her dumping him.  He's not imagining that his marriage parachute won't open when he jumps from the plane.  I think one of the bad things about men going their own way is there appears to be cognitive dissonance and confusion when it comes to the question, are women done or not?  For some women, they are done, but not for others.  I don't think it's such a black and white question or issue.  Some women in their late 30s that are unattractive and unpleasant to be around certainly are done, but not all women.  The problem is that many men feel through this issue instead of reasoning through it.  Look at the title of this Reddit post.  I can feel women are done.  But it looks as though many men don't reason properly when discerning whether or not a woman is quote-unquote done.  But for the majority of women, no matter what they do, there's usually a bunk in there to boink their bountiful bottom, even if her body is taken on the round shape of a barrel.  Most men are weak when it comes to sex, meaning that most women will never be done.  I've met some women that look like fairy tale witches, and even they were still getting attention.  Those are women in their 30s and 40s.  They'll never have any children and never get married.  Yet there's a smorgasbord of men that want to smash them, lining up behind their piney.  If women are done, how do you explain that?  But in a way they are done because many of the times I've spoken to them, they often complain to me that the men they're attracting are either disenchanted with women entirely because they went through a bad divorce or that they're simply losers.  That there are no so-called successful normal men out there for them.  So many of these women settle for a long string of first dates that go nowhere.  But from the standpoint of attention, they aren't done because the attention keeps flowing as long as they want it to.  What I couldn't figure out, though, is why the men that have gone through the bad divorces and are disenchanted with women are still dating.  They need to find MGTOW and go monk mode because they're still wasting their money and giving desperate thoughts some much-needed hope.  As I've mentioned earlier, some women have waited two or more decades for the right men after they passed 40.  Other women see situations like that and they think that they'll turn their lives around too someday.  Why do you think that so many women pursue men whose wives are about to die?  They want to strike while the striking is good, before some other woman steals a high-quality man from the arms of his dying wife.  Many women keep a mental list of men that they want to steal from other women.  Once those women are about to take a dirt nap, that's when they spring their cooch trap.  It's a different type of red snapper, but it's. ",
