            "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.  Red alert issued for super floods in China.  Historical upstream levels.  Three gorges dam threatened.  Highest level since 1940.  Small creeks turning into raging valley floods.  And all eyes are upon these reports suddenly of 2008 compared to 2018.  Some bend in the dam perhaps.  It still continues 2020 with the same images, although it's been stated by the Chinese government.  it's a pixelation rendering problem, but I can't believe.  after three years, it's still like that in Google Earth.  The dam's been working overtime to push water out, bringing the levels down to 145 meters.  When it is that low, you start to see that causeway connecting the island.  I took this screen grab from Google Earth this morning.  It was photographed June 6th, which does validate that they are going to low water.  It is the worst floods in 70 years.  Government says once in a millennium, thousand year flood.  They even have the water at 175 meters.  But looking back over the last month of the massive floods, mud flows, turbidity, In full inundation of the reservoir, yet when I look at Google Earth, the water's nice and clean.  It seems the gorge has kind of been spliced in right there where I added the yellow arrows.  Let's take a look at the happenings at the Three Gorges Reservoir.  What will the U.S.  dollar look like once we tally up all the debt accumulated in this never-ending money printing fest by the Fed and all the central banks globally?  Did you know it took nearly eight years for the markets to recover after the 2008 housing bubble crash?  And with Bank of America, Citigroup, central banks, and almost all investors seeing gold soaring, forecasting $2,000 and then $3,000 an ounce for gold, respectively, do you have eight years to wait for the next recovery?

Headlines abound, super floods in China, red alert.  Been following this because the destruction of the crops.  Highest flood level since 1940.  It's starting clear out west in Chongqing all the way down to the sea in Shanghai.  Now to give you an indication of how intense the floods are here, what you're looking at is usually a stream that's 10, 12 feet wide maximum.  and look at the ferocity in the amount of water coming down.  It's been like this for days, if not a full week now.  Some of the largest floods ever recorded in certain areas, extreme levels, even the oldest generations, like we have never seen anything like this.  And everywhere you look, high historical river flooding levels, and we're going upstream.  That'll take you to the very end up there near Chongqing, Upper Reaches is what they call this, or the Three Gorges Dam.  Some of the water levels in the cities are coming up to the second and third floors in buildings after these rivers bust their banks and seems like the heavens have rung out.  I would quantify this as an atmospheric compression event over a continental scale.  Exactly what is expected in a grand solar minimum.  And the headlines even in China, flood alerts at the Three Gorges Dam.  Now what they're looking at here is 148 rivers that are exceeding into the ultra uber flood levels.  And even for the first time in recorded history in Chongqing, at the headwaters of this, they're having a red warning for significant flooding.  That is a gigantic river.  Now the original engineers that were taking a look at this project were talking about this exact event here.  If there was a super flood further up, would it be able to be contained by the dam itself?  Yes.  but the dam's going to have to open floodgates to complete open and then downstream is going to flood everything all the way to Shanghai.  Now it might not be a tsunami of a dam break, but there sure is going to be significant flooding to the point where crops are going to be lost on a massive scale.  So far what they're looking at is the largest flooding since 1949 and a serious challenge for the world's largest dam.  The dam itself is one thing and then the downstream flooding because they need to keep the floodgates open is a difference.  We're gonna term these A and B. We're gonna look over here at A. first at the dam itself, structurally significant.  They've been trying to push as much water out of there as they could since the beginning of June.  So the full level around 145 meters and it can go all the way up to 175 and it'll overtop at 185.  So they're looking at a good 40 meters or about 120 feet before that thing overtops, plus the amount of flow through.  they can put there in the cubic meters per second, something like 50,000 cubic meters per second to offset the rains coming in.  We saw this at Oroville as well.  Eventually there was a ratio that was reaching it over top.  This one, not sure exactly, but you can see from the images early this month, the water's significantly lower in anticipation of these floods.  And the headlines here from these articles, the water level at Three Gorges Reservoir dropped to contain the partial seasonal flooding that they get every single year.  But this year is exceptional.  Now I want to point out a few things as we look at the diagrams here.  This causeway that connects the island from the dam.  Now remember, this island is inside the reservoir.  So when the water gets low, 145, 155, 160 meters, this causeway is still visible.  So it's a good indication to see what the water level is as you're looking at sky photos because through the years, a lot of people have taken Google images and you can see the direction of the water flow.  Right in the center, that water's flowing downstream where the white is, that's the direction of flow.  Always know that the island's in the reservoir and on the other side of the wall, that is the river heading downstream.  So you can see the flow pretty clearly there.  I took these photos this morning right off of Google Earth, and the last time Google Earth had photographed this area was June 6th.  So matching up with what the Chinese media was reporting about going to low water at 145 meters, this matches up because you can clearly see the causeway there.  It has to be at low water.  This is a June 6th image here, but what I'm noticing is the coloration of the water doesn't really match with what was with the massive flooding so far through the first part of the year.  There's been an enormous throughput, but the color does not match.  All this is stemming from this previous story talking about the actual structural stability of the Three Gorges Dam itself.  So left side 2008, right side 2018.  You can see some bends and wobbles in there, some settling if you will.  Running through a couple of images, 2008 straight as an arrow.  Remember the water is going to be flowing out and you can see that island clearly on the left side again.  That's inside the reservoir.  And then we're coming right, or you can see where the hook is, where the containment happens.  2018, you can start to see some bending and shifting.  Now, the Chinese government was saying that this was because of a rendering issue from Google Earth that it made it unstable.  And the algorithm or whatever that produced the photos produced this effect.  2018, that's fine.  Then they put them together and this made the media rounds and it's back again.  Pretty wobbly.  Looks like some structural instability there.  But then 2019, this is off UK media.  And I said, all right, well, let me look here and see if I could find a 2020 image.  And sure enough, Google Earth still showing the same.  Now I'm wondering if it's a rendering issue, how did it take three years for Google Earth to fix or not fix this?  And why does it continue to show up with even more bending inside what is considered the world's largest structure here for a dam?  So I was thinking, all right, well, if there is some bending in there and if those images are truly what they're showing, there should be definitely difficulties in the power plants.  Some of those generators should not be working.  The shafts would be wrong.  There'd be some outflow difficulties, something plugged up.  If they're getting that much bend in there, definitely would have some problem with the power plants running.  I even had an assistant of mine help me in Taiwan to look for power plant replacements, outages.  Nothing was reported in the Chinese media, although very difficult to get information.  Do you think the government would actually tell people that they had to replace the power plant generators already, hydro generators?  I don't know if they would, and we couldn't find anything about this.  So that's a point there to look at.  And then continuing on with the red alert, now you can see where the river's pouring over into the streets already, and this is heading downriver from Chongqing.  And what I mean by the coloration of the water is, since the beginning of the month, that same time that they were trying to go to super low water around June 8th, well, the June 11th reports here, I mean, they had massive mudslides, massive rains, millions of people affected by incredible flooding, incredible floods.  These would be their own record floods in their own right, what just happened here.  So all this incredibly muddy water is pouring into the same tributaries that are coming down to the reservoir.  And then another report here, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, million people or so displaced along with the other couple million, and this is a significant flood here.  Heavy rains since June 2nd.  Now keep that in mind.  And as we look at the Yangtze River Basin map here, Three Gorges Dam Reservoir, we see the exact same.  Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, Sichuan, that's heading upriver to Chongqing.  Same areas matching on the map, obviously.  So the inflows are gonna be incredibly dirty in there.  And then add on top of this, the plum rain, quote unquote.  It's an addition to the monsoon coming in on the regular yearly cycle here, adding another two to four inches, which is incredibly heavy.  And chasing down the media reports, even at that time, they were pushing 70% above the average on the flows because they were trying to get that water out.  So they were discharging 2,000 cubic meters per second over the averages.  So generally, they're pushing at 5,800, and then they were pushing at 7,800 to try to get that water downstream.  That's why there were so many floods downstream was because they were setting such heavy volumes, and then downstream containment couldn't handle either.  They had to onsen the water.  So the dam's there, but when it gets really heavy floods and they need to let the water go, it just creates more floods further down.  And you can see the maximum rate here.  They're pushing somewhere at high water in July, 30,000 cubic meters per second through that.  So it's not a thing of the dam's gonna back up.  They can still push 30,000 cubic meters per second through.  Now what's the inflow from these biblical floods and this atmospheric compression event?  And if a dam breaks upstream, then what happens?  Can it be contained?  And if something happens at the dam, could they still get the water to exit through?  I mean, that's part A. But here's another thing off this Google image that I snapped this morning.  that was taken on June 6th.  There'd been floods.  There should be a lot of turbidity in the water.  If this was truly the image taken, that will not be green, especially over to the right going downstream.  They talked about how much silt there was that they had to remove just even out of the Sichuan area and everywhere down the stream.  They keep talking about how much silt needed to be removed, how much turbidity there was, clogging everything.  And then we have a green water image here.  So I don't know if the photo has been replaced, but I put the two yellow arrows because it looks like something was spliced right in there.  Color of the water does not match the reports on this image here.  But what does match is being able to see this causeway down at low water.  So we know we're at least this low here before any kind of overtopping.  Now, that's an enormous amount to fill.  You've got to realize that lake is 300 miles long.  And you're going to have to fill it 80 feet plus for 300 miles before it will overtop the dam.  So that's not really the problem that people are looking at.  Maybe it's the structural stability in those images that we saw that it's not exactly straight.  Now, the Three Gorges Dam, I'll agree here.  I don't think it's at a risk of a collapse due to the water pushing behind an overtop.  Because they said they built it to once in a millennium, but then they pulled that back and said once in 100 years.  So they can go to 175 meters from the 145 that they're currently at.  So remember, if you've got 30 meters, that's three feet per meter.  So we're looking at about 100 feet.  I was being conservative with 80, but you're going to get a little extra in there.  So they did do some testing last year.  They filled it all the way up to 175 meters, full capacity.  And you can see that island in the causeway completely disappeared there on the left.  So that's your marker to see what the water height is.  And again, we're looking at this image here.  At a different direction, you're looking down into the reservoir.  Then you can see the spillway and where the hydroelectric generators are.  And behind that, again, you got the island, completely disappeared causeway.  There's no road there, completely underwater.  So if you're gonna look at images in the future through Chinese media or when media comes out to tell you how high the water is, use that causeway as a guide to be able to let you show how high the water is.  But here it is at full capacity.  Now, they've been letting everything through as fast as they can to try to prevent this from overtopping.  Now, what's happening downstream is something entirely different.  They're getting the most massive floods they've had in the last 70 years because that much water needs to be sent through at that time.  And what I mean by sending the water downstream is this, the scrutiny over the flaws in the way that water is released and is flooding, ravaging the country further down.  I linked everything below.  But this is what happens when they let so much water through.  Further down, the containment can't hold all that water that's being put through because you've got to realize 30,000 cubic meters per second or even 20,000 or 10,000 cubic meters per second, but something downstream is designed at full load for 5,000 cubic meters per second, you're going to get a lot of floods.  So great that they have the huge dam up there to create the electricity, but in terms of flood control, that's a no-go.  It's not.  actually makes it worse further downstream.  And that's the whole point of this.  So when we're looking at the comparison of 2008 to 19, is it truly structurally unsound?  Because the images I show here, it even shows a little bit of bend there on the left side, although that's bent into the reservoir, which would be structurally more, you know, against the water versus the water pushing out that edge.  And you can see it's low water.  So all the information's below.  And if you have any ideas, put them below in the description box.  We can compare some notes moving forward.  And the reason I'm able to spend some time to do research like this is because every time you support the channel by purchasing long-term food storage through MyPatriotSupply, either the two-week grab-and-go food crate or the four-week food supply, that's a way to support the channel.  so I can continue to pay my bills.  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time. ",
