            "text": "So there's some new reporting that dropped on Trump's fake populism.  Wisconsin residents are furious over losing homes for Trump supported Foxconn factory that was never built.  Never built.  Never built.  So in 2017, Scott Walker and Trump announced that Foxconn would be building a $10 billion factory in a place called Mount Pleasant.  And this was with the help of over $4.5 billion in state subsidies.  And... The idea is you have this $10 billion factory, giant facility, and I think Trump or somebody said it was going to be like the eighth wonder of the world, and they were going to hire 13,000 workers to make LCD displays, really make the U.S.  a manufacturing hub in a very important way that would have revitalized communities.  So what ended up happening?  The plans imploded.  The factory is actually, quote, 20 times smaller than a warehouse.  And they hired a total of 281 people.  13,000 was the number they were supposed to hire.  They hired 281 people.  That's so bad that they needed to hire at least 520 people to get the first subsidy of $3 billion.  They didn't even hit that number.  They claimed, well, we've hired 550.  But then when the state looked into it, they only hired 281.  So I guess they were lying to try to get that money.  And then the whole thing fell apart.  People were paid to move from their homes for this factory, to accommodate this factory.  And some of them were stiffed and didn't get paid, and some of the relocation places were a disaster with flooded basements and mold and all types of stuff.  So people were forced out of their homes, many of them got screwed, and nothing came of this anyway.  You know, this reminds me of the Carrier Factory story.  Remember that?  How Trump made this big deal.  I'm going to save the Carrier Factory.  We're going to keep the jobs here.  And what they did is they gave them giant subsidies.  They gave them corporate welfare and said, well, basically, we'll pay you to stay here.  Now, what happened was over the course of the next year or two, slowly but surely, Carrier started outsourcing the jobs anyway.  So they hosed the taxpayers and And then they outsource the jobs anyway.  And Trump had his little photo op at the beginning, acting like he's a populist and he's saving these jobs.  And then as soon as he went back to the White House, the plans were already in motion where the workers got screwed.  And they've done profiles on these workers who were like, I feel like I've been totally had.  They duped us.  They weren't helping us.  Factory outsourced the jobs anyway and screwed the taxpayers.  So they got, they double screwed everybody.  It would have been one thing if they outsourced and then they didn't also hose the taxpayers, but they hosed the taxpayers and then they outsourced anyway.  So it was a fraud.  The whole carrier thing was a fraud.  This is another thing that's just a fraud.  This is fake populism.  And this is the stuff that, in my opinion, the media should be covering the most.  It was originally The Guardian that reported on this.  But this is what should be covered nonstop on CNN.  This is what should be covered nonstop on MSNBC.  Because this is the truth, and this is substantive.  This is way more important and way bigger than any shitty offhand Trump tweet.  And this is something that actually would make many in his base rethink and not follow him.  If you show that this is real, that this is true, that they actually were dead wrong.  They said 13,000 workers.  It was 281.  Well, guess what?  Even some of his most hardcore supporters would be like, that's not right.  So this is the stuff you focus on because this is the stuff that lands.  And this is the stuff that's really devastating.  Fake populist through and through.  He's a corrupt corporatist just like the rest of them.  And in some ways, he's even worse because he gave you that false hope.  And then he screws you anyway. ",
