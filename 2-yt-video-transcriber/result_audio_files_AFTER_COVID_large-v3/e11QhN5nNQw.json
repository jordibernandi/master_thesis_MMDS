            "text": "Chinese investors are bearing the brunt of the backlash against the Chinese Communist Party's belligerence and the latest signs are coming from Malaysia.  Chinese investors in the Southeast Asian nation are now preparing for a disappointing return from their overseas business expedition.  Thousands of Chinese middle-class investors are selling off their properties in Malaysia.  To many Chinese individuals, their Malaysian properties were their second home.  But the changing circumstances are forcing them to make a difficult choice.  In Australia too, Chinese investors are no longer the biggest foreign investors amid a plunge in property purchases, according to government data.  The coronavirus outbreak-induced travel restrictions, military tensions in the South China Sea and a rising anti-China sentiment in the country have created a hostile business atmosphere for Chinese nationals in Malaysia.  According to South China Morning Post, many Chinese individuals have opted to sell their homes remotely in Malaysia, rather wait and watch when they will be allowed to return.  The changing circumstances in Kuala Lumpur have come as a bolt from the blue for Chinese investors and real estate developers who have invested in the Southeast Asian nation.  Malaysia has been a top destination for many affluent Chinese investors since 2002.  Kuala Lumpur had then launched Malaysia, my second home program, which offered long-term visas of 10 years to foreign investors.  China had made the most out of this opportunity.  And Johor, the southernmost Malaysian state located close to Singapore, became the hotspot of Chinese real estate investments.  First, a number of Chinese investors started making Malaysia their second home And then Chinese real estate developers also found a budding market to capitalize upon.  South China Morning Post has, for example, reported that Guangdong-based developer Country Garden claims to have invested around 20 billion Malaysian ringgit, which is equivalent to 4.83 billion US dollars in the Southeast Asian nation.  However, things have gone downhill for Chinese investors in the Southeast Asian nation over the recent past.  It all started with the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.  Malaysia does have a history of anti-China sentiment and the pandemic proved to be the final straw.  In February, more than 400,000 Malaysians reportedly signed an online petition demanding a ban on Chinese travelers while urging the government to save our family and our children.  And then the Malaysian government itself suspended the Malaysia My Second Home program in consonance with Malaysia's policy of restricting the entry of foreign travelers amid the ongoing pandemic.  Travel restrictions and anti-China sentiment in Malaysia is forcing many Chinese nationals who are considering a second home in Malaysia to reassess their plans.  Yet thousands of Chinese investors already having properties in Malaysia find themselves in a conundrum.  Chinese nationals who returned from Malaysia amidst the pandemic or those who were already residing in China while owning properties in Malaysia now stare at a bleak future.  They don't know when they will be able to visit Malaysia again as neither the Malaysian citizens nor the Malaysian government seems to be very keen on letting Chinese travelers enter Malaysia.  And the business sentiment is always going to remain hostile for Chinese investors in Malaysia.  Firstly, there's a rising aversion against China within Malaysia.  And secondly, Kuala Lumpur also might not be too keen to attract Chinese businesses given how paper dragon frequently bullies Malaysia in the South China Sea.  Chinese individuals are therefore selling their Malaysian properties remotely, incurring steep losses.  And then for the Chinese investors living within Malaysia also, the sentiment isn't very encouraging.  They had purchased high-value properties in Malaysia built by Chinese firms using mostly Chinese workers.  But now, these properties are recording a sharp price decline.  While the supply of such Malaysian homes has shot up, there is no real rise in demand leading to extremely low prices.  Patricia Lee, A Chinese investor owning a tree house in Johor said it's quite depressing when you see social media posts on WeChat trying to sell a 48-square-meter apartment for only about 600,000 yuan, which is $88,640.  I spent more than 1 million yuan for the same type of unit in 2016.  As such, the big Chinese real estate developers who had invested heavily in Malaysia could now be facing major catastrophe.  The fresh inventories that they might have built for affluent Chinese families would become deadwood in absence of any consumer demand.  At the end of the day, Malaysia might just be the tip of the iceberg.  China is actually facing similar hostility across the world.  As more and more countries adopt an anti-China approach, Chinese individuals will find it hard to retain their overseas properties in absence of any deep business interests beyond China's borders.  Sell and run might become the new norm for overseas Chinese investors.  The downfall of the Chinese Communist Party is here, and China's overseas real estate market seems to be the latest victim. ",
