            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome as you come in.  No, this isn't the live stream.  I'm recording this because I think it's important enough that it be put up without too many interferences.  I'm Roy Potter and I was out on a walk today and was asking God for some direction.  Some of you might laugh about that.  That's something I do quite often.  I'm not saying I'm always getting the best answers.  Ones I want to hear.  I was expecting something quite different today when this came to me.  And so I'm going to tell you what it is that came to my mind.  I've talked about it before.  I did a video bringing out the similarities between our chromosomes and the Hebrew language, and some other things.  And I'm not going to get into a whole lot of detail on that today, just to tell you that Adam had an X and a Y chromosome, and Eve had XX chromosomes.  And we know that Adam's rib was what made Eve.  So Eve came out of Adam and got two of his X's.  Do you understand what I'm telling you?  And I did a video on this once before.  Well, you've heard me say a lot about how important women are.  That women need to be protected, not because they're helpless, but because they're important.  So this is what I was asking God today.  I was asking Him, can you lead me, guide me?  Tell me what it is that we need to do?  When Adam was created, however you want to look at that, he was created in a perfect state.  And I won't go into a whole lot of detail about what that perfect state was, but his DNA was perfect.  Where did Eve come from?  according to the scriptures?  From Adam's rib, which is an allegory, meaning that she received his DNA.  So if God created Adam perfect, with perfect DNA, and he was called a son of God, that's in the New Testament.  Adam was a son of God.  And then if Eve was created from Adam, she had perfect DNA as well.  This is an important understanding for women today, what their role is and why their motherhood is so important.  In the New Testament, it says that a woman shall be saved in childbearing.  That doesn't mean that she'll just survive it.  It means that because she risked her life and shed her blood to bring in a new life to the world, that she has committed an atonement of sorts.  And how is this?  In the Garden of Eden, there was a fall.  Remember, Adam didn't fall prior to the deception of Eve, the beguilement of Eve.  As a matter of fact, Adam didn't really fall at all.  And this isn't a congratulations to the males.  But I want you to understand the story.  And I've never gone this far before.  Adam was perfect.  Eve was taken from Adam.  However you want to look at that, the point is that she had perfect DNA.  But the serpent came into the garden and beguiled her and placed his imperfect seed in her.  She didn't become the imperfect seed, but she carried an imperfect seed.  Her perfect seed, her egg, her chromosomes were perfect, mingled with the fallen DNA chromosomes of the serpent.  Are you seeing the picture here?  I was asked the other day what it is about Genesis 3 where there's a secret there that says that the serpent and his seed have to tell you what they're going to do before they do it because they're under a curse.  And the secret is in this.  What have you done?  God says to Satan.  He says, I've, you know, did this and that.  God said, well, okay, you're cursed.  And you shall have power to bruise the heel of the seed of the woman, but he shall have power to crush thy head.  What is that saying?  A lot of people think that that means only Jesus.  Well, Jesus was certainly a product of that in the perfect generations, as far as they could be obtained at the point in time where he was born.  And there are a lot of philosophical and religious viewpoints on what happened there.  But I'm going to tell you this.  What God was telling Eve was, and telling the serpent, was that the perfect DNA that was in Eve, even though it was combined with the imperfect DNA of the serpent, that her DNA that came from Adam would overcome the bad DNA from the serpent.  In other words, ladies and gentlemen, women carry... I mean, since then, there's been a lot of corruption in our DNA.  And it's what brought about death, the corruption of the DNA.  Do you see the importance of the woman and why I've said about her what I have, how important it is for her, for them as women, to remain women and to be grateful and thankful and have awe of God for what He has allowed them to be?  So although Jesus is the example, And we could argue from now until the end of the world about if that scripture was talking just about Jesus or something much greater even than that because Jesus formed it from the beginning anyway.  A hidden secret.  A little further explanation.  Whether you want to look at it this way or not, again, it's not saying that men are perfect because of this or that women should be slaves to men or anything like that.  The serpent beguiled Eve, placed an imperfect seed inside of her, and then she bore posterity from that union.  that had both Adam's seed and the serpent's seed combined, because she came from Adam originally, right?  When she came to Adam and told him the story, and I'm using allegory here, he partook of the apple as well, so to speak.  He wasn't deceived according to the New Testament.  He chose to go with Eve.  And we can pontificate, cogitate about why he made that decision.  But the important thing here is that the fall did not include Adam's DNA being corrupted.  And in fact, neither was Eve's DNA corrupted.  But the posterity.  And we could call him Cain, if you want to go there.  Cain had a combination of perfect seed and imperfect seed.  Perfect chromosomes and imperfect chromosomes.  Perfect DNA, imperfect DNA.  After that, of course, we know the story.  Adam and Eve then did have children.  And down through the ages, they held the keys.  Even down until Noah, who the scriptures say were perfect in his generations.  I hope you understand what I'm telling you here.  We'll talk about Jesus some other time, how he comes up to this.  But there is no question that that scripture in Genesis 3 isn't talking merely about Jesus.  Just a thought for this weekend.  Out here for now.  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to go a little bit further here.  I don't want to get in too deep to this.  It would really be good if you study some of this on your own.  And I'm sorry about the wind, it is a little windy here, so hopefully you can hear me.  But we'll cover just another couple of details on this for your sake and mine.  A lot of people will say, well now wait a minute Roy, the scripture says that Then the day they eat thereof, they shall surely die.  And remember, Eve brought the fruit to Adam and he ate some too, right?  So what was that that actually happened?  Well, you got to look to Leviticus.  In Leviticus, it talks about a law.  And the law is that if a woman is beguiled and commits adultery, that her husband is to put her away and not touch her again.  What did Adam do?  See, the law of heaven is always active.  It's how we react to it here, what we do here.  And the law of heaven that Adam was under hadn't changed.  So basically what he did was by taking Eve back to him, he violated that law.  But that didn't change the DNA that was in him any more than Eve's DNA was changed.  This was a, what I would call a willingness to take Eve's sin upon himself.  Very much in the similitude of what Jesus did, taking our sins upon himself.  Jesus said, and this is going to be very hard for some people to understand, and don't read into it more than I'm saying.  Jesus said, I have done nothing more than I've seen my Father do.  And for the Christians who believe the church is His bride, and He took their sins upon Himself, then does that mean that in a similitude of that, since Adam was a son of God as well, that He took Eve's sin upon Himself?  And therefore, the fall took place.  Yet, their DNA was so perfect, as I said earlier, that that DNA was carried down to Noah's time.  Because he was perfect in his generations.  So, why did all those patriarchs die then?  Well, to answer that question, I want to ask you a question.  I want you to find the verse where it says, Eve died.  Go try to find that, where it says, Eve died.  You will find a scripture in Genesis that Adam died, he lived 930 years, and then he died.  And you can make the argument, because it says that God created Adam, male and female, male and female, created he, them, that Adam was Adam and Eve together.  So you could say that the record would show that Adam and Eve both died when they were 930 years old together.  Now there are some legends, some oral traditions and things that say that basically Eve died six days later.  Well, that's not out of the Torah.  That's some conjecture and some interpolation.  But it is possible that Adam and Eve left what would then be considered the mortal sphere together at 930 years.  That's a mystery, and I won't take it any deeper than that.  But go find where it says that Eve died.  You won't find it.  So something more is going on here.  and it's very special very very special because it has to do with sacrifice real sacrifice and a willingness to lay down your life for your fellow man.  and Adam exemplified that from the very beginning and by doing that he could lay claim to Eve And Eve is the mother of all living.  Just something more to think about.  Not really a whole lot of answers.  But I wanted you to get the picture that Adam did partake of the fruit in the way that I explained because he took Eve back to him and then agreed to die.  to be cast out of the garden because he violated that law I spoke of.  But he wanted to keep Eve with him.  It is the love story of the ages, if you really understand it.  You women are special, and you should be treated as such.  Shouldn't be bitchy.  Shouldn't cause problems with your emotions in your different monthly situations.  You really should remain faithful.  just as the men should.  i won't go any further than that but uh as as i've already mentioned a woman shall be saved in childbearing and then jesus comes in where for the rest of us adam and eve are taken care of.  you might not understand that this Because in Adam all died, so in Christ are all made alive.  And I won't go into that mystery other than to say that depending upon the intents of your heart, Jesus' sacrifice takes care of the rest of it.  Okay, that's all for now.  Maybe we'll get into some other details later. ",
