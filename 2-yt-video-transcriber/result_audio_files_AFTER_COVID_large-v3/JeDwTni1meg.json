            "text": "So a week ago I released a reaction video of me reacting to a Mormon reacting to the South Park episode about Mormonism.  I only reacted to the first half because it was pretty long, so I figured I'd do part two.  These parts can be watched in any order.  They're completely independent from each other.  So if you haven't seen part one, then don't sweat it.  Give it a watch after this one if you're interested.  Okay, with all that being said, let's get into it.  The last one was laying the groundwork for the belief system.  This chick got into whether or not the South Park episode was quote-unquote correct about a lot of stuff.  For the most part, I think she agreed that the episode was correct about most things.  In reality, it was spot-on about basically everything.  South Park is famous for addressing cults like this.  They hit Scientology too, and guess what?  The Scientologists felt like they unfairly represented it, just like the Mormons did.  because they didn't put the church's framing on it.  They provided factual information from an outsider's perspective.  These groups only exist because of information control.  If the members knew the real factual information about their history, what South Park provided here, and it wasn't dishonestly spun in a positive way, then the group wouldn't even exist.  That goes for the Mormon Church, Scientology, which as I said was covered by South Park, Jehovah's Witnesses, and basically any other cult out there.  They only survive because of information control, narrative building.  People would see right through it otherwise.  In this clip, South Park is through laying the groundwork for the religion, which everybody can pretty much agree on, and they're ready to start talking about the stuff that the group doesn't want talked about.  We'll get to hear the real story of the origins of the Mormon Church and get the church's narrative on it from this chick afterward.  So in the last clip, Joseph Smith talked about how he was visited by an angel, Moroni.  And the angel told him he buried some golden plates in the ground, which is basically a New Testament of Jesus Christ.  And what do you know, it just so happened to be right near where Joseph Smith lived.  What are the chances?  Crazy.  With all that being said, let's continue the story. ",

Well, they were the most amazing things I had ever gazed upon.  Well, so where are they?  Where are what?  The gold plates and the seer stones. ",

Other people saw them.  In the Book of Mormon, in the first like two pages of the introduction, there's the testimony of the three witnesses and testimony of the eight witnesses.  So a total of 11 people actually saw the golden plates and they wrote down their testimony to prove that like, yeah, we actually saw these things, they really exist, and here's our names to go with it.  So more than just Joseph Smith saw the golden plates. ",

She's probably had a lifetime of people telling her this story in that positive light, so it doesn't sound ridiculous to her at all.  She's just sitting here nodding her head like, yep, that's pretty accurate.  We're all sitting here listening to it, thinking how outrageous and embarrassing it is for anybody to believe something like this.  So her explanation for why nobody was allowed to see the plates is, people did see the plates, like eight people.  What she's ignoring is the fact that there was a massive, giant controversy at the time.  People refused to believe him, that the plates were real.  It seemed like a grift.  If this is all true, then just show us the fucking plates.  Seriously.  What's the big deal?  So he got some of his cousins and friends to sign a piece of paper that said, yep, I saw them.  They're completely and totally 100% legit.  I swear.  I'm sorry, that's just not good enough for me.  It shouldn't be good enough for anybody.  This controversy shouldn't have existed at all.  Photography existed around that time.  The earliest existing photograph was 1826.  This was happening in the 1820s.  People could paint at least.  The fact that this was a controversy at all is pushing my eyebrows all the way to the back of my head.  So that's her explanation.  Joseph Smith got some of his friends and family members to tell people that they got to see them.  But if that's not a good enough explanation for you... ",

So yeah, there was a reason he didn't just show them to everybody.  Also, the Urim and Thummim or the seer stones that they're talking about in this were also mentioned in the Bible.  They just aren't mentioned like what exactly they're for.  But if you go back to the sons of Aaron, yeah, it talks about them in the Bible as well. ",

Doesn't mean he has to tell anybody where he stores them at night.  The fact that nobody had ever seen them was a massively controversial thing at the time.  Not now, then.  So why didn't he just bring them out to the public, show everybody, and then put them back in hiding if people were trying to take them?  I'm sorry, this just isn't a valid explanation for me.  At all.  And it shouldn't be for you either.  As far as the seer stones being mentioned in the Bible goes, so what?  I have my doubts that the Bible ever mentioned the seer stones, but even if it did, how does that prove anything at all?  Let's just take small logical steps through this.  We know Joseph Smith had a copy of the Bible.  Hypothetically, let's say the Bible specifically mentions a stone by name.  If those two premises are true, then we can conclude that Joseph Smith used the names he saw in the Bible to add credibility to his story.  I'm not connecting the dots on this.  Let's continue. ",

            "text": "FYI, that's part of behavior control.  You'll find most cults have very mild-mannered, artificially happy, and for lack of a better term, tame members.  That's called a cult personality.  They program it in with a system of rewards and punishments.  Jehovah's Witnesses do it, Mormons do it, Heaven's Gate did it, People's Temple did it.  It's one of the factors that defines a cult in the first place.  Replacing somebody's authentic identity with a cult identity.  The fact that they change your personality to be more submissive should not be a reason for you to join any group.  If what they're saying is untrue or inaccurate, then that should automatically disqualify them as a group you'd consider joining.  There are plenty of groups out there who will program a cult personality into you.  It doesn't have to be the Mormon Church.  The rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?  Yeah.  See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.  Barton went home to his wife, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, and showed her pages from the Book of Mormon, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  And so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat and read to me what the golden plate said.  I wrote it all down, and we're going to publish it into a book.  Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?  Lucy Harris, smart, smart, smart.  Smart, smart, smart, smart, smart.  Why would he make it up?  Martin Harris, dum-da-dum.  All right, here.  I'm going to hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of Golden Plates, then he'll be able to do it again.  But if Joseph Smith is making you all up, then the new translations will be different from these.  Okay, fine.  I bet he'll have no problem.  Lucy Harris, smart, smart, smart.  Martin Harris, dum-da-dum.  So the whole premise here is that this guy, Martin Harris, was writing what Joseph Smith told him to, claiming he was writing the Book of Mormon.  Keep in mind, Martin Harris never saw the golden plates either.  This actually was very smart.  If he really was reading from a book, he should be able to translate the pages.  no problem, right?  And it should be an exact match.  Shouldn't differ at all, even by a single word.  Let's hear the Mormon explanation for the problem. ",

He asked three different times, and an all-knowing, all-seeing God, of course realizing that the pages would be lost, changed his mind.  After being pestered about it for the third time and said, sure, you can take these pages and show them to people.

And Joseph had received a vision that actually the pages had been stolen by some really bad people.  Once again, they were trying to steal the place and things like that.
