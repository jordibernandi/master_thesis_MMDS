I always wear a mask in my car because my grandfather fought in World War II and I'm trying to be just as brave.  And now anytime I'm in my car, I also wear a condom because I don't want to get STDs either.  And it works on the same medical premise.  I think it takes a courageous individual to boldly wear a mask while they're in their car by themselves.  It's a pretty rare trait.  We're like the Navy Seals of the roadways.  We're pretty elite.  That's why you don't see very many of us.  But you do see some of us.  Wearing my mask while I'm by myself in my car basically says, I might have COVID.  And if I do, I don't want to catch it for myself.  Because when I'm in my car, I'm within six feet of myself.  So technically, I'm breaking social distancing rules and I don't feel good about that.  I got my degree in being under a trance from the state is deceiving me university.  If there's one thing I love about airplanes, it's breathing the recycled air.  And my commitment to wearing my mask in my car gives me the same recycled air purification while I'm in my car.  It's innovative and cleansing.  It's like we're basically in flying cars now.  When people see me drive by in my mask, I know what they're thinking.  Thank you for your service to our country.  And you know what, people?  You're welcome.  They're definitely also thinking he's an inspiration.  That's a powerful virtue signal.  And he's probably really well versed on the latest virus knowledge.  When I get out of my car, I put on a mask over my mask because I don't want my mask to get infected while it's protecting me.  Do I take my mask off at home?  No, I'm not suicidal.  I also walk with crutches just to take weight off my knees to help prevent me from getting a knee injury.  I think it actually strengthens my legs and character.  You can be one of the first to get your hand chakras on two new awakened shirt designs, the Stay Weird and the Tupac Chopra.  If you're like me and think normalcy is one of the worst diseases to infect humanity, then the new Stay Weird design will remind you and the world around you to be your unapologetic weird self.  The Tupac Chopra is one of my all-time favorite concepts.  It's fun and it always lets people know that your guru is better than their guru.  Awaken shirts are never factory farmed and are always gluten-free, hormone-free, GMO-free, grass-fed, vegan-friendly, keto-friendly, paleo-fluid, gender-neutral, bathroom-friendly, and all-inclusive.  New research shows Awaken shirts increase your IQ, nobility, and athletic ability by 333%.  That last statement hasn't been scientifically validated.  In fact, nothing I've ever said has been scientifically validated, including this statement.  Does that mean this might be valid?
