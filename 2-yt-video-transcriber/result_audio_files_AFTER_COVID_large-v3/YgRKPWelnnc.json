            "text": "George, great pleasure to be with you, perhaps not under these circumstances, but thank you very much for having me back to talk on the show again.  Welcome.  It's been a febrile week, there's no other way to describe it.  When first we talked two weeks ago, I don't think I could have imagined that we would have found ourselves in this position so soon.  But the developments this week have been rapid and each morning has brought new news, much of which has been frankly unbelievable in some respects.  Obviously, Dr.  Theodoros Gabriels announced that this was now a world pandemic.  And I think by any standards, you'd have to support that conclusion.  This is a world pandemic and a very serious now health risk to the populations around the world, not least in the UK.  I think to understand exactly what's happening, we have to go back again to the virus and have a look at the new data that's emerging.  Because both medically, politically and economically, the situation has taken quite a considerable change.  A ton of events has occurred, most definitely.  If we look at China, we know that the overall death rate for the virus fell from 3.4 to 0.7 due to the incredible health measures they put in place.  And we talked before about some of the most important ones were very widespread testing for the virus.  So they actually knew accurately who had it.  That's the first piece of information which is so essential for mounting a correct response.  And there's been real persistent attempts by government announcements and by media programs to play down that as if it's not important.  It absolutely is important.  And we know China developed the ability, we know they sequenced the gene, they shared that information, they developed the ability to test 1.8 million people every week.  It's a massive number of people.  By contrast, the UK is testing 2,000. and has plans to extend this to 10,000, but that hasn't happened on any single day.  We know that in fact only 30,000 people have been tested in total out of our 68 million population.  So it's a very small rate of testing, less than 400 per million of the population.  So we don't have an accurate picture of who actually has the disease.  In China, with their measures, the death rate fell, we know, or the case mortality rate, But the mortality fell from 3.4 to 0.7, largely because of all the intensive care measures they put in place, the hospitalizations of those needing oxygen, the rapid care and prolonged ventilation of those who needed that care.  For the first time, we had some reference to the fact that this would be a problem amongst our own population from that Hong Kong, but a woefully inadequate response, in my opinion.  What's really worrying is what's happening now.  in Italy.  Actually, China has quite a mature population.  Their population, their life expectancy is very similar to that in our own country.  Slightly less, but it's improved massively over the last 50 years.  And of course, China has a huge background in combating major population pandemics.  China just a hundred years ago, even before the Second World War, would have been referred to as the sick man of Asia, contemptuously by countries such as our own, partly because of feudalism, partly because of the exploitation that went on of the Chinese at the hands of foreign powers.  But now China's surged ahead and its life expectancy has doubled within a generation, within two generations.  Our own population pyramid is similar to Italy's.  Italy has been absolutely overwhelmed by this pandemic.  We know that they've got probably 30,000 cases.  We know that there have been 1,800 deaths.  And if you look at the death rate that they've experienced, They're publishing figures today which shows over 7%, 7.3%.  And if we reproduce those kind of figures in just the size of our population we have, you know, Matt Hancock, Boris Johnson, Boris Johnson really scared me when I first saw that interview he gave with Philip Schofield, where he suggested that in discussions in COBRA and in the Cabinet, the strategy of the government would be simply to take it on the chin and let this thing run through the population.  Matt Hancock said that about 80% of the population would be infected.  80% of our population is infected.  That's 55 million people.  If of those we get between 0.7 and 7%, there's a huge range of people dying, that's going to be well over half a million.  It may be run into many millions, maybe 4 million, if we experience the kind of death rate that are being experienced by Italy.  Of course, all of that information is hard to pin down and quantify.  It's rapidly changing.  And the fact that woefully inadequate testing and therefore insufficient data to actually make an analysis leads to these very wide margins of error.  But by any standards, we have to say that the development has been quite startling this week. ",

I mean, since that very widely criticized interview in which he seemed to say, he later denied that that's what he meant, but people can watch the interview.  It's hard to avoid the conclusion, the Malthusian conclusion.  that, well, you know, this will leave us leaner and fitter and you'll only die if you're old, you'll only die if you've got an underlying health condition.  Well, there's a lot of old people and a lot of people with underlying health conditions and they're somebody's brother, sister, somebody's mother or father.  There was an insouciance about that interview that I found deeply troubling and it began to shape my own responses.  But since then, it's like he's disappeared.  I hope he's hard at work, but maybe he's hard at drink, I don't know. ",

            "text": "It's deeply worrying, George.  You referred to Thomas Malthus, who was considered one of the fathers of population science, who was a reverend of the Victorian era, who came up with a theory, essentially, that the poverty... and starvation seen amongst the working class in Victorian England, the Dickensian kind of poverty that Dickens described, hence coining the phrase Dickensian, was essentially the fault of the poor themselves for being feckless, for being poor, for being untalented, for having too many children.  This was what he said about the British working class.  And that was taken to heart by the British wealthy class, the capitalist class, Victorian imperial class, who took that on as one of their major theories.  And I was still taught that theory in secondary school in geography classes, you know, the Malthusian population growth, where the population would die off at a certain point.  They took that theory to the colonies.  I mean, the British presided over famines of tens of millions in India and again wheeled out the same theory that it wasn't the job of the wealthy in Britain to pay for the lives of the poor in India.  wasn't their job to pay for the privilege of being the colonial rulers.  It was the job of the Indians to pay them for being the colonial rulers.  But they don't really have a difference in attitude towards their, you know, at that time, their own working class and a working class elsewhere.  This is a very stark and quite ugly theory, which they still talk about and discuss at the World Economic Forum of overpopulation.  And because that theory is still taught to us, many people still believe it.  And when this is going on, you can hear it as an undercurrent in the debate that the world is overpopulated.  I absolutely disagree with that theory.  It's a theory that justifies the wealthy feeling that their wealth, which is ill-gotten in many cases, is not their job.  to use that to pay for the sick and the poor and the needy.  What will that mean if they carry on with that kind of thinking right now?  I mean, the people we know are vulnerable to the disease are diabetics.  We have four million of them.  The elderly population, George, the average, you know, the median age of the British population is 40 and a half years old.  I mean, half the population are over 40.  So the numbers who are elderly in that high-risk bracket are tens of millions of people in our country.  And these are people who are thought as being relatively mature in life, who got relatively wealthy, therefore relatively conservative in their political outlook, who tend to vote in greater numbers for a conservative government.  I don't want to say that Labour have made some startling difference or are coming out with a startling different policy, but it's a genuine concern that this kind of thinking is colouring the response to this virus.  The talk of herd immunity, which is really the stock phrase that we're told with scientific opinion, this is not scientific opinion.  What does herd immunity mean?  I mean, vaccination was obviously started by Edward Jenner.  We're talking about a 220-year-old technology, Edward Jenner, coined the term vaccination because vaccine comes from cows, so smallpox.  People didn't get smallpox when they'd been exposed to cowpox.  And he noticed milkmaids didn't get smallpox.  And he postulated that there might be a cross immunity between the two diseases.  And he went on to show that was the case.  And so we know that there are ways of stimulating the immune system by showing them a foreign agent that looks like the infective agent you want their immune system to fight.  And that's what we're talking about.  We're talking about the development of a vaccine.  We know that won't be around now.  But then beyond that, the question arises, how much of the population do you have to immunize before that immunization becomes effective in the general population?  And it depends exactly how effective the organism you want to fight is.  So, you know, chickenpox is a certain amount.  The flu would be a certain other amount.  But certainly, probably 70 or 80 percent of the population need to be immunized Because that means that the virus has left the child passing from person to person and finding a place to nurture and infect within the population.  But that's talking about vaccination.  When you give someone a vaccine, you're not giving them an active disease.  You're giving them something to help them mount a response to the disease.  But here we've conflated this term, which is a term about immunization, with actually just letting the disease, the primary disease itself, run rampant among the population.  And it really concerns me.  I know in my colleagues, I have the greatest of respect for many of my colleagues working in the NHS, nurses, doctors, the frontline staff, they will always do their best for the limited resources that they have.  But I can tell you now, whilst I have tremendous, I often operate on patients who are absolutely critically sick and have to go to the intensive care unit.  I can tell you that our intensive care stock in this country is pretty much always at maximal capacity, just as is our general stock of hospital beds.  Places are, you know, contingency.  plans are being made to try and expand the availability.  And that means turning theatres such as this one into an intensive care room and using our ventilator machine, We have another one in the antechamber, in the anaesthetic room of many theatres.  And of course, there are a few extra ones lying around unused in ITUs.  Bringing all of those online, we wouldn't come anywhere near the numbers that are necessary if we truly are going to let this COVID-19 disease run rampant through the population.  And it shows every sign, every sign.  that that is the intended policy.  So while my colleagues are doing their absolute best to formulate emergency plans to put on hold emergency surgery, Wales said they won't have any more elective surgery that would take up those beds.  And increasingly, as those cases rise within our country, going to have to be taking more and more of those decisions.  that in itself has knock-on effects and shows an under capacity within the system and it shows that our nhs started resources not just for 10 years.  i mean a labor party put forward a very good um statement but they indicated that this underfunding and unresourcing is a novel phenomenon.  I'm afraid it's not, George.  It's a systematic policy that is fattening the NHS for privatisation.  And I'm afraid that the precarious state in general we've reached in terms of overall capacity with a massive increase in capacity potentially caused by this crisis.  I must join in saying it is a crisis.  It is not just overhyped, it's a very worrying situation, will leave us in a desperate situation.  And we've already seen in Italy very difficult decisions.  We've got no criticism of the medical staff who work with the resources they've got.  But of having patients present, many patients who need the same care, limited care, ventilatory care, and they're having to make very difficult triage decisions.  And it will be the old and infirm who are thought less likely to recover, who will not get care and will not survive if we don't take some very drastic and radical action.  And yes, I think we should be increasing our bed stock.  I think that if that means requisitioning private beds, I think that should absolutely be looked at and be done.  Of course, we can do it if there's a political will.  We need to increase our ventilated capacity and very, very quickly.  And of course, we definitely need to carry on and demand.  Patients must absolutely demand the right to be tested.  I agree with self-isolation.  Patients who are fit enough should stay at home.  Still, a large number of people will get the disease and be fine.  Some will be asymptomatic, maybe only 10%, but they will.  Many will have a mild disease, probably much more than half the people who contract will have a mild disease and recover and get immunity.  But large numbers will need more intensive treatment, and large numbers will present.  And if we test, we will know who is self-isolating.  We've got a chance of limiting the spread.  And it's not too late for that.  I think Theodore Gabriel Jesus himself made that point.  Declaring this a pandemic does not mean we cannot act, and it doesn't change the actions we should take.  We need to diagnose, we need to test, we need to treat, we need to expand our capacity.  And I think that's incredibly, incredibly important and it must become a demand.  I'm not normally an advocate of writing to your MP, but if you were going to write to your MP about one thing, it would be to demand those measures, demand testing, demand an increase in capacity, demand an increase in ventilatory care, demand the requisitioning of further spaces to care for people who will be infected, because we don't know the true numbers.  And already there may be as many as 10,000 or more people suffering from COVID-19.  I heard some of your show earlier on, and I was startled, but perhaps not totally surprised to hear of the case in Milton Keynes of a lady who was diagnosed post-mortem.  And perhaps if I can just say what I've been going on for a long time, perhaps I can say one more thing that I found very interesting is to see that in the United States, to see the absolute numbers of cases who are going undiagnosed to the extent that there may be more cases in the United States than actually there were in China.  While China has still totally got a lid on this now, has totally controlled it.  And it was even suggested by the Chinese foreign minister that actually the initial spread may have been from the United States to China, and that they may have brought it in during the military games, which were staged in Wuhan.

            "text": "It's a very difficult question.  My children are going to school.  I've heard stories of the COVID-19 disease being diagnosed in schools.  and the schools not being shut down.  I mean, if appropriate action is being taken at a national level, of course, we should all follow it.  But you do not feel, you know, just simply saying, my advice is science, do nothing, and using nudge theory and really, you know, behavioral scientists.  I know that the Tories are very into behavioral science at the moment.  I think they've applied it quite cleverly.  to game their election polling.  But this is not a game.  This is not an election.  Elections are not a trivial matter, but this is far more serious and far more important than manipulating people's behavior.  People will follow advice if they have trust in the advice that's being given.  As a health professional, I feel a tremendous responsibility not to panic-monger, not to stir up trouble.  But it seems to me that the measures being taken at a governmental level are woefully inadequate.  My colleagues, I know, are drawing up contingency plans to do the very, very best with what they have.  But we don't have to look very far to Italy to see that.  If we don't also increase our capacity, what we have won't be enough, and that will lead inevitably to a problem.  And it's at that point, it's the ability to plan service.  that used to be an inherent part of the NHS.  Part of the process of privatising the NHS had been to take away our ability to plan, and actually the whole process of kicking out funding to groups of primary care trusts, to groups of GPs who themselves can't plan, and their gradual merging of those finances held by primary care trusts, both with management consultancy firms, who are doing the planning, and on the other hand, increasingly with the health insurance industry, are actually taking control away from the health professionals and into a class of managers who have a dual purpose, a dual purpose.  One, yes, to provide the NHS with current framework, but their constant purpose is to introduce the US-style system in our country.  And you only have to look at the United States now to see how woefully inadequate it is in actually dealing with the health needs of their population. ",
