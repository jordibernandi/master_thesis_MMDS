            "text": "canon hinnant was an innocent little boy with a full life ahead of him until some piece of garbage walked up to him put a gun in the back of his head and shot him.  what kind of psychopath would do that to someone let alone an innocent child and for what?  just because you felt like it?  or was it for black lives matter to get revenge for all the slights that y'all feel like you've had?  Well, I just have one thing to say to you.  Fuck you.  Fuck Black Lives Matter.  Fuck your liberal ways of looking at life.  And fuck Darius Sessions.  If you have to put a color in front of Lives Matter, you're racist, period.  Prison is getting out of this way too easy for this thug.  They need a new kind of punishment for people like this.  All I have to say for you Black Lives Matter people still out there protesting, not caring about this poor little boy, thinking that you're still being treated unfairly and that cops don't like us and all this, fuck your bullshit.  Yeah, maybe at one point you were unfairly treated by a cop.  I've had it done to me.  But at least he didn't put a gun in the back of our head and blow it off.  But that's what this guy did to this little six-year-old boy or five-year-old.  Don't even try to compare it to George Floyd or any of the other thugs who got killed because that was their own doing.  This is a boy, an innocent kid outside playing on a bike.  You got some thug who comes up there and says, oh yeah, I'll just, yeah, he'll work.  Oh man.  And what is Black Lives Matter doing about this?  Nothing.  Nothing.  And then you have some other thug who's on Facebook praising the execution of Cannon.  Are you fucking kidding me?  And what is Black Lives Matter doing about that guy sitting there and praising the dude who shot Cannon saying, yeah, it's time for revenge.  So let me just put this very simply for all y'all.  leave children out of it.  if you got a problem with me or any of the other proud americans come up and say to our face but you won't do it because i'll show you i will show you what america is about.  so let me draw a line in the proverbial sand here because i am tired of seeing y'all destroy america And now, kill innocent children.  To those who support Black Lives Matter or even say it, you're nothing to me.  I don't look at you as an American.  And I don't care what color you are.  I have some really good black buddies that I'd die for.  But they sure aren't bitching and complaining about all the stuff Black Lives Matter's doing and taking on a victim mindset.  No, they're strong motherfuckers.  Black Lives Matter are terrorists.  and they're ignorant thugs.  There is no other way to say it.  You sit and try to destroy America, sit all day and whine about issues that are mostly made up, and then do nothing.  And then one of the people that you're saying his life matters shot some kid.  So the next time you show up at a Black Lives Matter rally because a cop arrested you for blocking a freeway and you feel like you need to just go out there and whine about it, think about if it was your kid who got shot.  You wanted to see a pissed off American patriot?  Well, you got one right here and 90% of America is behind me.  Thank you. ",
