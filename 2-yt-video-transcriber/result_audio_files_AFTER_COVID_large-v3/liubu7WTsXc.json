            "text": "welcome back.  everyone got some big stories today.  so first off there are concerns over a possible break in Three Gorges Dam and these concerns are being heightened by another dam that recently broke which the Chinese Communist Party had a direct hand in.  and also the Chinese Communist Party is hinting at a prisoner exchange for the Huawei CFO in Canada.  now folks before we get started if you haven't already please don't forget to like and subscribe again really need your help supporting this channel.  First off, some breaking news from Hong Kong.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced on Twitter, quote, President Donald Trump promised to punish the CCP officials responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong's freedoms.  Today we're taking action to do just that.  We've announced visa restrictions on CCP officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights.  now this is an example of the United States moving forward with an additional measure to hold these Chinese Communist Party officials individually accountable for human rights abuses.  in other words this is not just sanctions on the CCP.  this is going after individual Chinese officials who are responsible for abusive policies and this also follows a new measure that was passed in the United States where the United States were putting sanctions on individuals in China and elsewhere who have been involved in the persecution of Muslim Uyghurs and so the United States on two different fronts now is going after Chinese Communist Party officials on an individual level and so recently on May 1st 2020 a dam wall collapsed at the Sardabo Reservoir in the region of Serdario in Uzbekistan.  This happened after five days of storms in just three years after its construction had been finished under a $23 million contract with China.  Over 111,000 people were evacuated, six people died, and 35,000 hectares of land were affected by the floods.  The Uzbek government is launching an investigation into the dam and reports are already saying it was a quote disaster waiting to happen.  Now the case has symbolic significance in China where it's facing floods from its heaviest rainfall in over 70 years and where a flood alert was just raised near the Three Gorges Dam.  This is amid reports that structural flaws in the dam could cause a disaster And that story behind the broken dam in Uzbekistan ties not to just shoddy construction practices and possible issues with finances, but also includes two of the Chinese Communist Party's controversial programs for external expansion.  These are the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the AIIB, and the One Belt, One Road Initiative, the OBOR.  now officially the Chinese authorities claim the programs are not connected but evidence shows that the AIIB is either a direct part of or is closely affiliated with the OBOR.  China News is reporting that quote.  recently the Central Asian media have reported on the One Belt One Road international cooperation high-level video conference paying close attention to President Xi Jinping's written speech.  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and other four country ministers participated in the Belt and Road International Cooperation high-level video conference held on the 18th.  Now it continues stating, quote, Uzbekistan's foreign minister Kemalov said that the meeting plays an important role in coordinating countries to effectively solve economic and social problems and in the context of the epidemic, this current coronavirus we're all facing.  He particularly emphasized the importance of developing and improving cross-border transportation infrastructure, and also called for the digital economy, digital medicine, and e-commerce to be the key directions for the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative.  Now, part of the AIIB are what are called panda bonds.  These are from the Chinese Communist Party.  It's state-run news outlet Xinhua reported this, quote, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, again, the AIIB, announced on the 11th, issuing the first panda bond of Renminbao 3 billion.  and the Chinese interbank bond market.  The term of the bond issuance is three years and the coupon is 2.4%.  Now defying all possibilities, it also reports, approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the risk weight of the bonds issued by the Asian Investment Bank in China is zero.  And for those of you who understand finance, that is comedically ridiculous.  There'd be zero risk with them.  Now it continues, noting that Jin Lee Kun, president and chairman of the board of directors of the AIIB, said, quote, the funds raised from the initial panda bond will be used to support members to respond to the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in the short term.  In the long run, it will help the AIIB to invest in sustainable infrastructure.  Now, this case raises additional concerns, not just over the integrity of the CCP's construction projects, and especially with dams, as it relates to concerns around the Three Gorges Dam currently, but also around potential misinformation and ill practices and some of its core programs for global expansion.  They're saying programs are not connected, which are very likely connected.  We're seeing these programs getting used as part of the virus response by the CCP, and we're seeing that in their response to it, they may be going into countries, taking advantage of them, which is one of the big concerns right now, getting infrastructure projects, getting other projects, and building them very much like that dam in Uzbekistan.  This has been an ongoing concern among many countries where the Chinese Communist Party has been bringing its One Belt, One Road initiative.  For example, in Sri Lanka, there was a political analysis a few years ago saying that if they allow the Communist Party in China to continue doing what it's doing, they're going to find themselves vassal states of the Chinese regime.  And again, it relates to one of the big concerns in China, that there have been issues of embezzlement when it comes to construction.  There have been issues of, say, funds that were supposed to go towards construction going into the pockets of corrupt officials.  This is one of the concerns right now in Uzbekistan.  And when it comes to building projects, especially the Three Gorges Dam, and there have been notes about problems with this in the past, people are concerned about what they call tofu buildings.  We saw this, for example, in Chongqing during the earthquakes, that buildings were so weak, you could crush the bricks between your fingers.  So again, one of the big concerns in China right now, and also one of the big concerns spreading in other countries.  Now moving on to some other stories.  The Chinese Communist Party is hinting at a prisoner exchange for the Huawei CFO.  Canada's Global News reported this, quote, China says Korvig Spavor may be freed if Canada ends Meng Wanzhou's case.  Now, Korvig and Spavor were these Canadian citizens currently being held in China under what a lot of people believe are trumped up charges.  Meng Wanzhou is the CFO of Huawei and also the daughter of its founder, who was facing charges and extradition to the United States for some of the alleged crimes that Huawei has been involved in.  Now, a couple of quotes in this article.  China has explicitly tied the fate of two detained Canadians to the release of Meng Wanzhou, joining the growing calls for Ottawa to intervene in the Huawei executives extradition.  In a media briefing Wednesday, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for China's foreign ministry, cited comments made by Michael Corbyn's wife to CBC and Reuters, saying Canada's justice minister has the power to end Meng's extradition to the United States at any point.  He says, quote, such options are within the rule of law and could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Canadians, referring to Korvig and Michael Spavor, who have now been detained for over 550 days.  a bit of analysis on this.  This is a glorified hostage exchange.  These two individuals in Canada are being, they were arrested and a lot of people believe charged under false pretenses.  They're being accused of being Canadian spies.  They are facing the death sentence.  The CCP is telling Canada right now that we will very likely execute these two individuals who we arrested on what you believe are trumped up charges, unless you do a prisoner exchange for this Meng Wanzhou, who is facing possibly very serious charges in the United States.  Again, this is ISIS tier stuff.  This is the kind of stuff you see with terrorist organizations.  Now moving on, Beijing residents are reporting a strange phenomena.  This was during this year's Dragon Boat Festival.  Hailstones that fell on June 25th resembled the CCP virus.  Many people posted images of the hail online and some joked by calling it the new Corona hail.  Some commented the same phenomenon took place in Hubei just prior to the virus outbreak there.  And this is significant there because Beijing is now facing a similar virus outbreak.  Now, in addition to this, hailstones of this shape aren't technically unheard of.  You do see them sometimes, but the rarity and the timing and also the frequency of this phenomenon in some places is being seen as significant.  a similar phenomena was also seen with hail in Mexico recently where the Daily Mail reported that locals saw it as quote a sign from God.  now moving on to some news.  in the United States vandals are turning their sights on the destruction of statues of Jesus and other religious symbols.  now after weeks of violent protests some now call for toppling of Jesus statues.  Epoch Times reports this as statues of historical American figures including those of former presidents are being forcibly torn down.  across the nation Black Lives Matter activists are now beginning to target Christianity And political activist Sean King, who is an open supporter of Black Lives Matter, recently said this, quote, Yes, I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down.  They're a form of white supremacy.  In addition to this, this is from a Black Lives Matter organizer, quote, If U.S.  doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system.  Now, moving into the 2020 elections, this raises a big question, which is, what are some of the most religious voting bases in the United States?  How will this affect, for example, the Latino vote, which is predominantly pretty religious?  How will this affect the black church voters?  Well, also very religious.  Again, it does appear that very extreme individuals are acting out and very likely could fracture the voting base of the Democrats based on things like this.  And already the Democrats are trying to distance themselves from issues like this.  We'll have to see how this plays out.  And again, we'll be covering it as it develops.  Now, moving on to Seattle.  Businesses are filing lawsuits against the Seattle government for letting this Chas site destroy them.  The Epoch Times is reporting this, quote, 15 businesses and individuals filed a class action lawsuit against the city of Seattle.  over how officials handled the so-called autonomous zone that sprang up earlier this month, leading to chaos and mayhem on city streets.  And so there's a big question on this.  First off, how will this spread?  We now see that in different parts of the United States, there have been riots.  There have been, say, arsons.  People have lost their businesses.  There have been large-scale robberies of many privately owned businesses.  People have had their businesses burned to the ground.  And they've been told by local governments, you know, basically just lay down and take it.  And they've been told essentially in a lot of areas by the local governments that this is an act of peaceful protest.  The local governments do not seem interested in protecting these businesses from vandals, from arson, and from other crimes.  Will they also file lawsuits?  If the lawsuit in Seattle goes through, if it's a success, what does it mean for Chicago?  What does it mean for Portland?  What does it mean for DC?  What does it mean for New York?  Where many people have also lost their businesses and where the local governments have actually supported a lot of these actions being taken against the businesses.  Again, we'd love to see what the spillover effect of this is.  It also raises the question of the social contract.  What is the basic purpose of government?  And if government is no longer playing that basic role of protecting people's, say, property, protecting people's individual rights, what does that mean in terms of these local governments that are no longer holding up those values?  Now moving on a post from Twitter, one of the individuals who was shot in this CHAZ site wants to sue the local police for not responding fast enough.  We'll play a video of this now.  Yo, I was shot in Seattle at Chaz on Friday.  The cops left me out there to die.  I need help with somebody in the legal or media to get my story told and get it out there.  I got shot five times.  I need you guys' help. ",
