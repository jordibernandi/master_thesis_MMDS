            "text": "Folks, we are leaving California, and honestly, it's pretty heartbreaking for me.  I grew up here.  I was born in Burbank, California at St.  Joe's.  I went to school at Edison Elementary, and I went to middle school at Walter Reed.  My family moved to North Hollywood when I was 11, and I've lived within like a mile and a half radius ever since.  My kids were all born here, and now I am taking off, and we at The Daily Wire are taking our 75 jobs with us.  Here are five reasons I'm taking my family and my company and leaving the most beautiful state in the country.  Number one, quality of life.  So when my family moved to North Hollywood, it was a safe, clean suburb.  Yes, LA always had a serious litter and homeless problem, but those problems were pretty much relegated to downtown or specific areas of the city.  And then it was the task of the city, you would think, to clean up those areas.  Instead, they decided to allow all those problems to explode into nearly every incorporated area of LA.  In 2019... there were nearly 60,000 homeless people living in L.A.  County.  In 2011, there were less than 40,000.  So we've increased by 50% in less than 10 years.  These are people, many of whom are mentally ill or drug addicted.  But thanks to local regulations and legal consent decrees, the police have been told they are literally not allowed to move them to dry out facilities or do anything with the trash that now strews every sidewalk and underpass and overpass and embankment in  L.A.,  every single one.  Every freeway underpass is now a tent city.  In fact, they've been building porta-potties and like hand-washing stations in these tent cities under the freeway underpasses.  Nearly every public space has become a repository of open waste and needles and trash.  The most beautiful areas of LA have become wrecks.  It's one thing to pay exorbitant taxes.  It's another thing to pay exorbitant taxes to watch your city degrade into a hellhole.  I mean, here's just a few stories from the last few weeks.  So my wife and I decide that we're going to take our kids down to Santa Monica, right?  One of the most beautiful areas in America.  And I'm old enough to remember when it was a beautiful, clean area.  No longer.  We take them down to a park.  My kids are playing.  They wander up a hill a little bit.  And my daughter, who's six, comes running down to me and she says, Daddy, there's a homeless man and he is doing something to his arm.  What was he doing to his arm?  Well, he had a needle.  I'll let you guess.  That same trip, we are walking along the boardwalk and there's just a homeless man, no shirt, screaming at a bunch of people eating at a restaurant.  just screaming at them.  And nobody in sight doing anything about the harassment.  And this is how it is over in Venice, on Venice Beach, Santa Monica.  It's been really, really bad over there.  Outside my house, I live in a fairly nice area.  I mean, I've seen a homeless person face down outside my home.  I mean, it's terrible.  It's terrible, not for us.  It's terrible for this guy.  How is that sympathy for the guy?  He is lying face down in the gutter.  And my children have seen people peeing on walls.  My kids have seen open needles.  Last month alone, And I'm just going to talk about what's happened to our company.  Our head of social media was threatened with a crossbow by a homeless man.  I mean, I don't know how that happens, a crossbow.  Is he a refugee from 1392?  A homeless person tried to bash in the front windows of our office.  Just last week, we had a homeless person going through our trash.  Again, none of this is lack of sympathy for the homeless.  It's about having a policy that protects taxpaying citizens, their quality of life, making sure they can be safe, and make sure that people who need care can actually get the care they need.  But California doesn't do any of that.  Okay, two, taxes.  Yes, tax rates matter, you idiots.  California's top marginal income tax rate is now 13.3%, which is already one of the highest in the nation.  The legislature is actively discussing raising it to 16.8%.  which on top of federal taxation means that if you're in the top tax bracket, you're paying 54% of your income to the federal and state government.  California has historically low property taxes because of Prop 13, but the legislature is now seeking to remove all the Prop 13 restrictions, raising them first on commercial properties and then presumably later on residential properties.  California's legislature has been considering a wealth tax.  which taxes you based on non-liquid assets, which means you could be paying more in tax than you actually have in yearly income, and they want to have that wealth tax trail you for 10 years after you leave the state.  This is not counting the 1% disability insurance payments of taxable wages, the statewide 7.25% sales tax, the 50 cent gas tax per gallon, and a myriad of other local taxes that drain your wallet, all for the privilege of living in a state that can't keep the streets clean or the parks safe.  Three, crime.  Crime in LA has been skyrocketing.  Well, shockingly, when you decide to basically release the streets to people who commit crime, crime has been going badly.  The police have been told to back off of crime.  In late July, LAPD chief Michael Moore said the city had seen a 14% increase in homicide.  For years, the state of California... has pursued catch and release crime fighting, declassifying certain crimes as crimes, devolving responsibility to counties and cities.  They called it prison realignment to avoid culpability at the state level, basically releasing people who should be in jail onto the streets.  It's been going on for years at the local level, too.  In fact... Local law enforcement has basically been incentivized to lie about their own crime rates.  In 2014, the LAPD reported they'd misclassified over 1,200 violent crimes as minor offenses.  And then they say, hey, look, we lowered the crime rate.  Magic.  It was not a giant surprise when the LAPD was ordered to let the city burn in Black Lives Matter riots that shut down L.A.  County.
