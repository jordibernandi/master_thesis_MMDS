Once again, this was, this one has actually just dropped 11 hours ago as I'm doing this video.  So you have a sister out there in New York in the Manhattan area.  Now she wrote on her Instagram is a from 6 15 to 7 31 PM.  This woman Svetlana Flom, it said bothered her and felt the need to approach her and call the cops multiple times.  He said, she was too alarmed.  I was sitting comfortably in my own neighborhood.  He said, she says the first call was because she thought I was smoking in public.  He said, but by the third call it was because I was threatening her and her children.  while giving my description, she exaggerated her story and made it seem like I was the aggressor.  Okay.  And she says that this African American woman is attacking me and my children.  He said she had tears that were off and on.  She said things like she's pulling the black card and said they wanted me to walk to the boys with her.  Some of the police, he said, I probably could have just walked away.  He said, I probably should have kept my mouth shut.  Right?  He said, nah, he said, I couldn't understand.  He said, why she was so mad.  Okay, so I want to show you the clip.  of this Russian Karen calling the police, leaving her.  You will see how the system will show.  She left a whole kids to come mess with her.

            "text": "So as you can see, black people are still dealing with this issue here in America.  A black person sitting there where they live, minding their own business.  And here come this Karen, the actual Russian Karen as an immigrant.  Maybe we need to look at her papers because she needs to be deported too.  That's how I feel about it.  Right?  Go back to where you come from to Russia.  But she has a husband.  Her husband saw what she was doing and you saw the video.  He like, he got out of there like, man, I, you can, you can do your Karen thing on your own.  I ain't got nothing to do with that.  He, he left her left everywhere.  She, she know where he went cause he know good and well that my face not about to be on no news because of you.  He said, listen, I'm even married to you with shoe.  I see you back to Russia.  You give me some problems.  He said, forget this.  I mean the man was smart.  He left.  This is the thing.  We're seeing over and over and over these incidents happen.  But to be honest with you, this has always been the case.  You just seen it in real time now because of the camera phone and the internet.  That's our thing.  And this is a good thing.  This is good for us to catch their racism and white supremacy in real time and show the world.  Cause see, we're so connected.  Now the whole world is seeing these videos.  See people throughout the world that watch our channel.  This is, the life of black America.  Okay.  This country tried to come to many of you guys' countries and say what you should be doing, how your government should be treating your people, or you guys aren't as sophisticated, you guys don't have a first world status, you guys are this or that.  But how is it that black people came to sit down?  I mean, you think you're so much better, and yet you guys need to start telling them that.  When they show up to your country and tell you about what you're doing, America has no right to tell anyone about human rights.  They don't have not a leg to stand on on that.  Black people are harassed.  Black people are bothered, not just by the police.  You can say the police is one thing.  This is what happens when we are just doing our own thing.  That's why I said the best thing for black people to do is socially distance.  Trust me, a long social distance, a 1000 year social distance at minimum from people like spit Lana there.  Because when we can't sit down and just enjoy the weather and here you come trying to call in the death squads to try to harm and kill black people.  Talk about the police.  They look at the, um, 911, the police, their personal hotline to put harm or maybe kill black people.  That's why they do it for.  You heard the line.  She's calling me the B word.  She's threatening me.  They want me to do anything exactly like the other one.  Like, did you not watch the other one a week ago and now you're doing it?  I'm telling you when they see us just mind our own business, birdwatching or jogging or whatever.  They view us as their natural enemy and I based that off of the way they treat us.  You only treat an enemy like that.  Try to find anything you could do to hurt and harm that person.  You treat enemies that way.  So when you hear people like me say things about connecting with the continent or why black Americans can't have two passports.  Jewish people got two passports.  They got one to Israel and they have one to the United States.  Why black Americans can't have two passports to whatever African nation they want to be in, right?  And they can have one here.  It's their choice where they want to go.  They could stay here if they would like to in Babylon and that's a choice or they can be in the African continent and do whatever they want to do.  I want African Americans to have two passports at minimum.  It's your choice where you go or stay or do so much time on a continent.  Do so much time here.  I mean it's your choice.  You have a right to.  Yes, our ancestors have been here hundreds of years.  Yes, our ancestors definitely made America for what it is.  It wouldn't be in America without black people.  African people, let's call it what it is.  It would not be.  So yes, we have a right here.  I've never said we didn't have a right here.  I'm just saying dealing with that kind of issue and problem, we need to social distance sometime and having another passport that has a citizenship attached to it gives us the right at any time to get on a plane and not deal with no visas or nothing and go to an African country and socially distance from people like her if we so chose to.  at the end of the day.  All of us should have two passports and trust me in this decade, even when I go to the continent, I'm going to be on them about, okay, you guys say we need to come back.  No problem.  But you got to put some skin in the game.  You got to have a path to citizenship, permanent residency at minimum, but definitely citizenship.  That's the conversation because we are, we passed the coming back home deal.  Now we get it.  Now it's time to actually solidify it.  So, When people say they wanna go back to the continent, they wanna get away from that.  Listen, in the continent, you can hardly see some of them in certain places unless you go to a resort area.  You're minding your business.  You're eating your food, doing whatever.  That's the issue.  what's wrong with this country.  If you can't sit down somewhere, and yes, I saw that area where she was at, but based off her Instagram is more so in a Manhattan area.  So it's, she says sister stays in a nice area basically.  And you know, when, when a brother or sister, you know, makes decent money, they stay in a nice area or they fly first class on an airplane where everything nice, they, they get, they got to be investigating like, wait a minute, let me go find out what's going on.  Either it's innocent conversation like, Oh, well what do you do for a living?  Don't you even, I will never tell you what I do for a living.  I'm tell you, I paint rocks.  And I sell it to people that does to tell them brothers and sisters, they have actually what you do for a living.  Are they being curious?  Let's say I get rocks off the side of the road and I paint them and I sell them on eBay.  I sell them on Etsy.  I sell rocks.  you know, rocks off the street.  You know, I paint them.  pretty colors, you know, maybe some blues, some reds, some blacks, some greens, you know, I sell them in a set, just, just, just rocks and say, man, I make a killing off of that.  That's why I'm up here to tell them, tell them things like that.  Don't tell these people what you do for a living.  Don't doubt.  Don't tell them anything.  It's a day business.  What you do for a living, none of your business.  They always want to pocket watch what we're doing and then harassing us at the same time.  That's that old colonizer that's in them.  But yeah, this Karen situation, ladies and gentlemen, this is, this is why we need a break.  That's why I said the best social distancing that we can practice is on the continent of Africa.  So yes, I advocate, want to make sure I put this out here because I told one guy as of June the 1st, you come here with that, that, that conversation in the middle of certain conversation we're having about the continent telling me we don't need to be over there.  We need to be here.  I'm gonna block you and delete you and tell you why.  No one say you got to go anywhere.  Nobody told you to go anywhere.  Okay.  Nobody told you.  I believe we need two passports, American passport and a passport from an African nation or maybe a few nations.  We should have that.  We should.  Okay.  Anything outside of that, you're not even trying to expand our options.  All these different groups got multiple passports to multiple nations and we only got one and we stuck and we can't even move around.  That's why we deal with the police like we deal with.  What if we had that ability to say, you know what?  I'm sick of this.  I'm gonna go over here with six months just cause I want to.  And you gotta set up over there for six months.  You know what I'm saying?  Or you got an apartment, you got a home, you got whatever.  You come back if you want to.  You know, you come back, visit family, friends, a few months if you like to.  Or you can stay the rest of the year.  Whatever you want to do, you can do that.  But at least I want my people to have an option to not always think like.  this is all I have.  So forget anyone thinking that this is your only option.  That's silly and that's why we're in the condition that we're in.  But leave me a comment if you don't think about the situation with this Russian Karen and how she's harassing this sister.  But yeah, people definitely, need to make her famous for sure.  Her name is Svetlana Flom.  That's her name.  S-V-I-T-L-A-N-A-F-L-O-M.  That's her name.  So let's, let's go ahead and make her famous too. ",
