            "text": "What's going on, guys?  Auditing America.  We're in Jacksonville, Florida.  We're doing a First Amendment audit.  Shout outs to Oath Reaper.  He's out here with us today.  See if they respect our rights.  I'm not telling you to get back up.  We have enough distance, right?  We're good.  So focus on him.  He's got a weapon.  Focus on him.  I'm not impeding your investigation.  I'm far enough.  This guy's got a puppy in his bag.  .  .  .  .  .  .  So listen, this officer is bringing us some of the people, okay?  So I've got him.  Okay, so, so, that's what we're doing.  She was here, because we documented her investigation.  We gave her a front pass, and we wanted to know where she's been.  That's all.  I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now they're harassing the homeless.  I don't answer questions.  I'm not interfering.  Specifically, how am I interfering?  I'm not speaking.  I'm just recording.  I'm not interfering.  This guy just accused me of a crime.  Oh, yeah.  And you're home.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Once you get out of here, there's no way to get back up at all.  If I want to eat, what do you want me to do?  Go rob a store?  Yeah, I want you to go rob a store.  Because then the court can survive without your court law.  That's what it's all about.  You're going to jail today.  You're going to get out tomorrow because it's a little bit charged.  You're still going to get that $1,000 off.  They don't need to move their life.  You can't get a job.  I can't go get a minimum wage job.  I can't go to work.  So it was on yet?  It was on yet?  No.  Nice dog!  So what's the script so far?  Looks like they're harassing the homeless.  I figured as much.  He already accused me of a crime.  He said I'm interfering with an investigation.  I've done nothing wrong.  Why don't you tell our viewers your channel so that they can go over there right now and subscribe?  I've got two.  I've got Solar Events, Yahoo, or not Yahoo, YouTube.  And that's my established one.  I just started off the Oath Reaper.  That's the Oath.  Reaper, R-E-A-P-E-R.  Same thing, YouTube.  Cool.  Guys, make sure you go over there.  Oak Reaper.  We'll leave the link in the description and a pinned comment so that you can go find him.  This officer over here just accused me of a crime.  As soon as he's done with the investigation, we're going to request his name and badge number.  And... And we're going to see why he accused me of a crime.  Look how y'all are reacting.  I'm not going up and asking each person in this park, hey man, can you give me money?  Can you give me money?  No, I'm standing there.  If they want to do the kindness of their heart and give me money because I am in a situation.  He has the right to stand here all day and and freely protest or exercise his First Amendment.  Yeah, as long as he isn't impeding it.  Back up Loganville.  Ma'am, can I have your name and batch number, please?  It's Officer R. L. Borchardt, B-O-R-C-H-A-R-D-T, 77812.  Very professional, very professional.  And you, sir?  Can I have your name and batch number?  It's Kinder, K-I-N-D-E-R, 68972.  Thank you very much.  Hey, man.  Be about your day, bro.  You don't have to discuss your day.  I don't want to interfere, but you seem like you have done nothing wrong.  Why don't you go have a beer on my name?  Here you go.  I appreciate it.  I don't drink, but yeah.  Can we get an interview here after this?  Can you tell us what happened?  Can you tell us what happened?  I take care, all right?  You do the same, brother.  Thank you.  Be safe out there.  Stay professional.  Honor your oath.  I know you're old, guys.  Were they harassing you, ma'am?  Listen, I was walking away, okay?  I was walking away because another girl wanted to come in and do it.  And I was like, you know what?  I'm going further up so you can have it.  I don't care.  I went to walk away and she pulled up like she was something bad out of hell.  You know, female cops, they got to prove something.  Yeah.  And she decided... Because I didn't want to come back and talk to you.  Did you ask why you were being detained?  Yeah.  I'm being detained because she felt that she needed to put me in handcuffs and talk to me.  Maybe I was a threat.  We're going to figure this out.  Officer.  Officer.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to get a quick question.  Can you tell us why she was detained?  Um, no, no.  It's public records, right?  She was not detained.  She better be suspected of a crime.  Now I'm talking to you, public servant.  You guys are tyrants.  You had no reason to arrest that woman.  She was handcuffed.  Let me handcuff you.  Let's handcuff you.  Let's tie you up.  Let's tie you up.  You did nothing wrong.  What?  They say you guys are panhandling or something?  They didn't even see a sign.  They didn't give them a sign.  Nothing.  They didn't see a sign.  They were doing a straight harassment.  They saw me talking to another girl.  Straight harassment.  Did they demand ID from both of you?  No.  They never got your ID?  Oh, they violated your rights, my friend.  You were illegally detained because you've done nothing wrong.  Standing right over there.  And he just seen me walking away and he pulled up on me.  And he said, it doesn't.  I said, what do you say?  He said, I said, you're a panhandler.  He said, no.  I said, I was not.  I was over there.  What do you mean?  I was over there.  He's like, well, it doesn't matter what you say.  It's what I say.  I'm the cops.  You're still going to jail tonight, and you're still going to have $300 court costs. ",
