This is the main hall.  You see our big mastodon over there.  And, oh, look, we have... the Star of Bethlehem left over from our Christmas program.  And of course, there's nobody here because the Christian Museum and the Arc in Canada are closed to the public during this coronavirus situation.  Pray we can open soon.  And so we are going to have an encounter with some aquatic creatures.  And all the boys and girls should know what that means.  So not terrestrial, right?  But aquatic creatures.  Yes.

They are also found in Canada as well as the United States.  So if you go to a pond you might see some of these.  And then finally we have in here Texas map turtles.

So because they are aquatic-dwelling animals and spend a lot of their time in the water, they need these webs to help them swim, whereas a tortoise has more of a stump-like foot.  It doesn't have webs like the turtle does.  Obviously, the biggest difference is turtles tend to live in the water where tortoises live on the land.  That is the main difference between these guys.  But also these webbed feet are also another big difference between turtles and tortoises.  So all four species of turtle that we have here in this aquarium here at the museum are all members of the same kind.  They're members of the same created kind.  It is called the pond turtle kind.  And there's about 50 different species within that kind. ",

So crickets, other small insects, even small fish, worms, things like that.  As turtles mature, they then start eating more plant material, so leaves, things like that is what they will eat.

She's been doing it the longest, so she comes right over and gets it.  And so I said, she's a yellow-bellied slider.  So these guys are found through quite a bit of the United States.  Another fun thing about most of the animals in this tank are all native to the United States as well.  So we have a lot of native species in here.  Let's see if we can get the guard to come over.  The guard are really cool because they kind of will stalk their food.  Bernice is showing off.  See if we can get some of the gar to come over.  So if you notice, the gar are kind of swimming close to the top right now.  So if you see a gar out in a lake or river, they'll kind of swim close to the top.  They kind of look a little bit like a tree branch.  So that's how they will actually basically stalk their food.  They'll kind of float around the top and kind of look for insects or small fish to eat.  Oh, we had one of our cooters came over too.  He's going to get some food as well.  So today they're getting a diet.  They're getting there for their diet.  They're getting some little shrimp. ",

And you can't come to the Creation Museum or the ARC right now, but we can come to you.  And that's what we do here.  So there we are.  Hey, check out our Kids Answers website if you're interested.  It's a wonderful website.  There's a lot to do on it.  Go to the answersingenesis.org website or just do a search for Kids Answers and Answers in Genesis and you'll be able to get to our Kids website.  We have lots of great things there.  And if any of you there want to help us as we deal with this situation where we have no income coming in from tickets to the Creation Museum and the Ark.  We have to look after all these animals, our staff and others, and a lot have had to make sacrifices and so on.  But you can go to the AnswersInGenesis.org donate page to help us.  Well, with that, thanks Leanne, thanks Matt.  We'll see you for another one. ",
