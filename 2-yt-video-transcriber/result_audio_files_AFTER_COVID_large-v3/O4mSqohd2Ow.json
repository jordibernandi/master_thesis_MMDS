            "text": "Well, I think it's important to note that usually when people use that term, they can mean it in a lot of different ways.  Now, at its core, I would take it that the notion of wokeness refers to having a sense of awareness of one's ethnic heritage and dignity, as well as maybe some of the past or present obstacles in society that would militate against those kinds of things.  I think it kind of flows out of the African-American context particularly.  But, you know, you might see, you know, expressions of it amongst Africans of the diaspora more broadly.  Right.  Now, granted, that term has kind of grown in different directions now.  You know, it means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  So you might have some who would take it to include things like intersectionality, or maybe they'll couple it with CRT and some of these other ideas.  Or you might have some that would apply the term woke to mean like a white person who is empathetic or involved in working against oppression or something like that, or, again, empathetic to the African-American plight or something along those lines.  But then you have people like myself who might use the term woke to refer to just the biblical reality that in addition to us having this ethnic heritage and dignity.  Also, we have this identity in Christ that we're aware of and have awakened to.  And essentially the struggles that are encountered in the world, there's got to be a biblically based response to those struggles.  So we're going to stand against injustice or stand against racism from the vantage point of being a believer and applying the biblical ethic.  And so we're going to use the term woke to refer to that set of ideals that derive from scripture.  And so, again, people are going to use the term woke in a number of different ways.  And I think for that reason, it's really important that if you encounter somebody who's using that term to maybe ask some clarifying questions to understand what do they mean when they use the term woke so that we don't kind of make assumptions and straw man one another and then not really get anywhere in conversations that could otherwise be helpful.
