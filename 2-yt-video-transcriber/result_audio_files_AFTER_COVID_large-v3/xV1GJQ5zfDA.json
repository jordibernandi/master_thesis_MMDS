People are out here pushing baby carriages.  They can be out here on any manner of things.  It says, including exercise.  It doesn't say it's only exercise, including exercise.  I mean, I'll just tell you what it's written.  I'm not making this up on myself.  I brought it with me because I think I'm in compliance with it.  I mean, I'm not willfully in rebellion.  I think I'm in compliance with all of it.  It says including exercise, so I could exercise if I wanted.  I could walk my dog.  There's all kinds of things I could do.  Yeah, my activity is different.  I'm doing a pro-life activity.  I'm speaking out for the unborn today.  It's different than jumping jacks and getting out, but it's an activity still.  And any rational person would say, yeah, it is an activity.  You may not like it.  You may not agree with it.  But it is an activity.  And I am maintaining six feet.  I am maintaining social distancing.  I think we don't have to agree to that.  I don't got a crowd with me.  So, yeah, I think I'm in compliance with it.  My lawyer said I'm in compliance with it.  If you guys want to bring your sergeant, that's fine.  Morning.  Morning.  All right.  I'm not going to shake your hand. ",
