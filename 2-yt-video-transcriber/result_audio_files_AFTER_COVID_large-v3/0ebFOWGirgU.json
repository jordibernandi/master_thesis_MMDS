            "text": "This is an incredible story that I doubt we would ever see in the United States, because you can just imagine the right-wing outcry if a place of worship lost its tax-exempt status, even if they deserved it, and even if they were warned it could happen, and even if they had every opportunity to avoid that punishment.  But it's true.  The Jehovah's Witnesses are in danger of losing their status as a charity, as a non-profit, as a tax-exempt religious institution in Australia, because they refuse to play their part in addressing allegations of child abuse.  Here's the backstory.  In 2013, the Australian government set up the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to look into this very serious issue.  That federal response allowed investigators to call on witnesses and put forth recommendations on how to prevent these problems from occurring in the future.  Instead of responding to abuse one lawsuit at a time, like we often see in the United States, this was trying to handle everything at once.  And it had an effect.  Rabbis were implicated alongside Catholic priests.  Secular organizations were not immune from wrongdoing.  There were Boy Scout-like groups and athletic organizations and schools implicated in this abuse.  a final report was finally issued in 2017, meaning the Commission had several years to seriously investigate everything they could about this problem.  I should also say that this Commission and the six people who were on it had the support of political rivals in the country.  Imagine elected Democrats and Republicans in the U.S.  saying they want to address a serious issue and they all agree on the people who should handle it.  Seems very unlikely.  And yet that's how seriously the Australian government took this commission.  After the final report came out, Prime Minister Scott Morrison even issued a formal apology to victims of abuse as a way to say it would never again be tolerated.  I want to play you some of it only because it's not often you hear statements like this from national leaders.  Or maybe because it just feels like it's been a long time since I've heard a national leader say the word sorry.  Politically, I'm not really aligned with this guy or his party, but let me just have this for a couple of minutes. ",

Why weren't the children of our nation loved, nurtured and protected?  Why was their trust betrayed?  Why did those who know cover it up?  Why were the cries of children and parents ignored?  Why was our system of justice blind to injustice?  Why has it taken so long to act?  Why were other things more important than this, the care of innocent children?  Why didn't we believe?  Today we dare to ask these questions and finally acknowledge and confront the lost screams of our children.  Mr Speaker, today as a nation we confront our failure to listen, to believe and to provide justice.  And again today we say sorry.  To the children we failed, sorry.  To the parents whose trust was betrayed and who have struggled to pick up the pieces, sorry.  To the whistleblowers who we did not listen to, sorry.  To the spouses, partners, wives, husbands, children who have dealt with the consequences of the abuse, cover-ups and obstruction, sorry.  To generations past and present, sorry. ",

            "text": "Now, I want to make clear that Morrison didn't do this for no reason.  That apology was actually one of the recommendations made by the Commission.  It was symbolic, sure, but it was important, because it meant acknowledging the problem was real and traumatizing for so many people.  Not just the victims, either.  But the Commission also made tangible, non-symbolic suggestions, too.  One of them came to be known as the National Redress Scheme.  And this was a formal way to literally pay back victims of child sex abuse for all they had suffered, up to $150,000, minus anything they may have received up until that point, and also give them access to free counseling.  It's not a perfect system by any means.  I don't think anything could be.  But the idea behind it was that victims could fill out a form explaining what they went through.  Very detailed and very hard to fake.  Officials would calculate what that trauma was worth and victims would receive a check.  Now you could see how this could backfire spectacularly, even outside any possible fraud attempts.  Among the many criticisms was that the redress scheme pushed a hierarchy of abuse, as if you could put trauma on some kind of spreadsheet or matrix and assign a dollar amount to it.  Penetration, for example, was deemed more damaging than any other kind of physical abuse.  You wouldn't even be eligible for $150,000 unless you were penetrated.  Emotional abuse wasn't considered equal to physical abuse.  As one website put it, the redress scheme calculates payments based on the severity of the act, not the severity of the impact.  Like I said, it is imperfect.  But the alternative is letting people try to seek justice on their own, through the courts.  Which doesn't always work, and takes a long time and effectively shuts out people who don't have access to adequate legal representation.  My point is, I'm not necessarily defending this plan.  I'm just saying that is what they settled on.  Here's the thing, though.  In order to receive any payment, the guilty organizations had to agree to be part of the National Redress Scheme system.  Now, if you're the Catholic Church, why would you do that?  The simple answer is, first, if you say no, it looks really bad.  The Australian government already said groups refusing to participate would effectively be named and shamed.  Those groups would also have to deal with possible lawsuits on their own in the future, which could be way more expensive.  And they could lose a lot of government benefits, including their status as a non-profit group.  Meaning it could be really hard to take in donations later on if they don't participate.  That's the grip the government has on these groups.  But by participating, not only could these institutions maintain their status as a charity, they could give a finite amount of money into the system and send a clear message that they take this issue seriously.  Like the Catholic Church has a bad reputation.  Participating in this program, believe it or not, is a way to improve their image.  I should say the Catholic Church as a whole chose not to participate.  But they left the decision up to individual dioceses and many of them did participate on their own.  Okay, that's the backstory.  Here's what's happening now.  Back in July, six organizations who were name-checked during the Commission's investigation were publicly announced.  shamed as not joining the redress program.  One of them quickly signed up after that announcement.  But we're talking about groups that were responsible for cases of child sex abuse.  And by refusing to take part in the redress scheme, their victims' applications for money could not be processed.  They were hurting these victims a second time.  One of those groups, the most prominent one on the list, was the Jehovah's Witnesses.  And I'm not kidding about them being prominent on this list.  The Commission said they had reason to believe there were 1,800 children who were victims of abuse and about 1,000 perpetrators.  That's just within the Jehovah's Witnesses.  That's why, in 2016, the Royal Commission said the witnesses did not adequately protect children from child sex abuse based on stories they were hearing.  In fact, they said the witnesses relied on outdated policies and practices to respond to allegations.  Here is an example of that.  The Witnesses have something called the Two-Witness Rule, which says your account of abuse is only taken seriously by Church elders if another person witnessed it.  Even though the only other person around may have been the abuser himself, who is not going to testify, which means the victims are just screwed.  Furthermore, those religious leaders accused of child sexual abuse were not disciplined in any significant way.  And in some cases, they remained within the organization, able to strike again.  The point is, the witnesses deserved to be called out.  And they should have said yes to participating.  But they did not.  Why not?  Well, because the Jehovah's Witnesses argued they did not have the institutional settings needed to be part of the National Redress Scheme.  Whatever that's supposed to mean.  They also said they handle these issues internally.  Which, it's pretty clear they don't.  For what it's worth, Jehovah's Witnesses usually oppose all kinds of interactions with governments.  They don't vote.  They don't run for office.  They don't say the Pledge.  They don't enlist in the military.  So it's not surprising they wouldn't want to be a part of this.  but it's not like they ever rejected those tax benefits either.  So for them to say they're not participating in the redress program is about as comforting as the Catholic Church saying they'll handle all abuse cases on their own.  Like, if you were trustworthy in the first place, we wouldn't be in this mess.  I just want to say again that individual Catholic dioceses joined the redress program because even they knew it was preferable to dealing with a non-stop flurry of lawsuits.  But not the Witnesses.  They believe they are above all this.  And now they may finally pay a price for it.  The Australian government says it is now drafting legislation that would make good on their threats to revoke the tax-exempt status of those non-participating organizations.  That includes the Witnesses.  Social Services Minister Ann Rustin issued a tweet this week explaining how the government would soon have power to deregister a charity that did not take reasonable steps to participate in the redress scheme.  If that bill passes and the Witnesses lose their charity status, their cash flow would die out quickly.  A lot of people give money to religious institutions because they get a tax break for it.  Take away the tax break and they will find better uses for their money.  The Australian government can't stop freedom of religion, but they can hit those religious institutions where it hurts.  In their wallets.  It's not too late, though.  The Witnesses have until the end of this year to say yes to participating in the redress scheme.  But that window for the Witnesses to maintain their nonprofit status and give their victims some closure is quickly closing.  If the Witnesses don't want to make amends, then the organization itself will struggle to exist in the country for much longer.  If that's what happens, they can't say they didn't deserve it. ",
