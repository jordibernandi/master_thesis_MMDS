As legend has it, Torme and co-writer Bob Wells were trying to cool themselves down by thinking cold, cold winter thoughts.  The King Cole Trio recorded the song, and a Christmas classic was born.  At the very same moment in time, the American chestnut tree was being decimated by an invisible pathogen, the chestnut blight. ",

So what you're looking at here are 2,000 research trees on a one acre plot on my farm in central Elgin, just a little bit north of Port Stanley off of Lake Erie.  We're testing here the resistance to the blight.  It's like any invasive that has entered the emerald ash borer, Dutch elm disease, all accidentally introduced here.  We try to keep them out because Our trees here just don't have the immunity. ",

Here, one in every four hardwoods would have been an American chestnut. ",

It would grow to 35 meters in height, so they would stick well above the canopy of the rest of the forest.  and at the base the tree could be anywhere from two and a half to three meters in diameter.  It was used for everything and it became known as the cradle to grave tree.  So your cradle, every piece of furniture you'd use in your life would be made of chestnut and finally your coffin would also be made of chestnut.  Approximately the year 1876 An American entrepreneur opened the first mail-order tree nursery in New Jersey, and he imported 12 Chinese chestnuts from Japan and sold them to wealthy clientele on the eastern seaboard of the United States.  And from those 12 infected trees, the blight was spread along the entire eastern seaboard, approximately 50 miles a year. ",

The tree was declared functionally extinct.  It's hard to calculate the magnitude of this loss, but you can find the importance of the American chestnut tree reflected in the pop culture of the time.  There's a reason why there's a chestnut street in nearly every town in Canada and the United States.  There were songs written about chestnuts.  It was even used as a verb to go chestnutting.  The American chestnut tree is special because it produced nuts every single year, unlike many other nut trees.  That meant 20 million pounds of chestnuts.  That's a lot of food. ",

So the blight is a fungus, a fungal disease that reproduces with spores.  The spores enter the tree through a wound and slowly the fungus spreads around the tree girdling it and the tree is effectively dead within a year.  Now the ones that show the best resistance, they are then entered into our breeding program where we cross them with our other best trees that show resistance and we get another generation.  This year we planted 250 of our third generation back crosses.  So we're trying to maintain our Canadian American chestnut. ",

The blight never kills the root collar.  So if a tree can regenerate and send up new branches fast enough, it can survive.  With only a few thousand chestnuts left in the wild, every new tree is significant.  And often, these discoveries are made by regular people just out for a walk. ",
