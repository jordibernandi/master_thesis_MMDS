Glad we all survived the last two videos that I did.  Today's video is going to be a rant Definitely just going to be popping off at the mouth.  Hopefully you guys can handle that.  I'm sure you can.  Oh, but before we jump right into this just like ridiculous video, I actually have two new merch items on my merch store, which didn't really feel appropriate to promote on my last two videos.  I have the Make It Make Sense shirt, which is super cute.  I love it.  Zombie Blair, Make It Make Sense.  And I have the Uncancellable shirt, which does in fact make you immune.  to cancel culture.  if you are wearing it.  if anyone's trying to cancel you just wear the shirt and you're good.  you guys can click the link below to get those two items and if you do definitely send me a picture because i love seeing you guys in my merch and i love reposting you guys in my merch.  but on to the video.  so the topic of today's video.  i was actually made aware by rose of dawn.  i'll link her video about it in the description.  it's this op-ed tied.
