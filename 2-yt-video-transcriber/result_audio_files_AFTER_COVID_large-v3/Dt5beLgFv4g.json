            "text": "My hot take is that Texas will go blue in 2020.  So Texas has not voted for a Democrat on the presidential level since 1976 with Jimmy Carter.  And recently, pundits and some Democratic Party activists have speculated that Texas is getting ripe to flip towards Democrats again.  Now, part of the reason that people speculate that Texas could be turning blue is because of its demographics.  It's a majority minority state.  So the state is about 40% white, about 40% Hispanic, 13% black, and 5% Asian.  You would think looking at those numbers that the state was already democratic.  But here's the deal.  The electorate in Texas is majority white.  About 55% of the electorate, in fact.  The Texas electorate is majority white in large part because Latinos only make up about a quarter of voters, even though they're about 40% of the population.  That's because some Latinos aren't citizens, some may be too young to actually vote, and turnout in general amongst Latinos is lower in Texas than amongst those who do turn out.  about a third reliably vote for Republicans.  So Texas is a very diverse state, but it still hasn't voted for Democrats in recent history.  And while the state is becoming less white over time, those kinds of demographic changes don't happen overnight.  So why will Texas flip blue in 2020?  And why has it already become significantly more blue since 2012?  The answer largely comes down to college-educated white voters.  So if you look at 2012, Mitt Romney won Texas by 16 points.  In 2016, Trump won Texas by only 9 points.  And then if you look at the 2018 midterm with Ted Cruz versus Beto O'Rourke, Ted Cruz only won Texas by 2 and 1 half points.  If you dig into the exit polls and cross tabs, you see that a lot of the movement is among college educated white voters.  So that nine point to two and a half point margin change from 2016 to 2018, One of the biggest reasons that happened is because in 2016, college educated white voters in Texas voted for Trump by 30 points.  In 2018, they only voted for Cruz by 10 points.  That actually makes a big difference.  And you can narrow in on where those changes are happening geographically in Texas.  It's around Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth primarily.  Texas may be a southern state.  It may be a pretty Republican state.  But it's also highly urbanized.  It has some of the fastest growing and largest cities in the country.  And those suburban voters, as we've heard time and time again since 2018, simply do not like President Trump.  In fact, if you look at the changes from 2012 to 2016, Six of the 15 districts in the country that had the largest swings from Romney to Clinton are in Texas.  Now, the Democratic Party and Democratic activists in Texas say they're working hard to boost Latino turnout so that they can improve their odds in the state.  Now, they've worked at that a lot over the past several elections, and it hasn't seemed to change turnout all that much.  So where does that leave us today in mid-September of 2020?  According to our polling averages, Trump leads Biden by only one point.  Now, our model expects that the race is going to shift a little bit in Trump's direction between now and Election Day.  So I wouldn't be surprised if Trump did a little bit better in that polling average in Texas before the race is over.  But we've also seen that in recent elections in Texas, polls have underestimated Democrats' performance by two to three points.  So while famously polls have underestimated Republicans' performance in the upper Midwest, they're actually underestimating Democrats in Texas.  So if in the polling average, Trump is leading by about two points and Democrats managed to overperform their expectations in the polls, we could see that at last Democrats flip Texas blue in 2020.

            "text": "It would behoove me to not contradict our forecast, which give Biden about a 30% chance of winning Texas.  So I won't break from that.  I don't want to get fired.  I will say that there's a 30% chance that this hot take turns out to be right.  On our grading scale, I would say that it makes sense, right?  I wouldn't be shocked on election day or in the days after election day, after all the votes are counted, if Biden ends up winning.  It's clear where the preferences of Texans and the demographics in general are headed there.  This would in some ways be the logical conclusion of the trends we've been seeing for the past decade or so.  Given what I've said, of course, Trump still has a 70% chance of winning Texas according to our odds.  And we really shouldn't be surprised if that happens either.  In fact, it's the expected outcome.  Now, if we look at the 2018 results, where Beto O'Rourke did actually really well for a Democrat, only losing by two and a half points, he did really, really well amongst college-educated white voters.  He also turned out a lot of Texans.  in a place where turnout isn't all that high.  So you could argue that no Democrat should expect to do better than Beto O'Rourke in 2020.  It was only two years ago, and he still lost by two and a half points.  So at the end of the day, we'll see.  But what we can say is that this presidential race in Texas in 2020 will be the closest race we've seen in Texas in two decades.
