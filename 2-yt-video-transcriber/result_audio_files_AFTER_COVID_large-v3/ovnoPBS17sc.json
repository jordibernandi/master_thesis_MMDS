            "text": "yo what it do.  youtube.  drop down tv once again.  once again i tell you black people.  y'all tell you i love my black people to death yo but sometime y'all seem to amaze me.  i've never seen so much hatred goes to go towards one individual.  i mean why y'all hate that dude so much man?  i'm just asking a simple question.  i mean and what's crazy more people love him than hate him.  but where does the hate come from?  I mean, ain't nobody making y'all watch these videos?  that is due to the point that y'all feel some kind of way about.  Yo, this shit's stupid to me.  I don't understand it.  Yo, don't nobody make y'all watch these videos.  I mean, and this is what killed me with black people.  And this goes out to people I know too.  Y'all motherfuckers has been screaming, we need a change, we need a change.  Everybody, everybody, man, y'all know where I'm going with this.  But at the end of the day, Tom, we get somebody that's going to finally stand up and be a strong voice and not sit behind a screen and tell you what they know you want to hear.  We finally get somebody that's out here in the field, out here in the streets.  See, this is the thing.  Y'all sit and say this dude don't go to neighborhoods, right?  I mean, he don't live in your neighborhood.  I mean, to a certain degree, y'all have to learn how to protect your own neighborhood.  You understand what I'm saying?  He don't make it that hard.  But he's not Peter Pan.  He's not going to swing in your neighborhood when shit get tight and be the superhero that a lot of y'all think this dude is.  The only thing he's doing is trying to get you to wake up and understand that it is okay for you to protect your own neighborhood and do the right thing.  Y'all act like it's a problem doing the right thing because you have been brainwashed so much that y'all feel it's okay.  That we live the way we live.  And it's understandable.  It's just like being in prison.  You become institutionalized.  And a lot of black people in America, we're institutionalized to what's going on in America.  But come on, just because you are institutionalized to the situation don't make the situation right.  I mean, y'all got to stop the hate with this guy, yo.  Y'all not going to make me stop uploading these videos.  It's because I feel what this brother is saying.  I just wish a lot more of y'all would.  I mean, a lot of people is on it, but it's a lot of still people out here that sleep like hell.  It's like y'all take night quell after night quell after night quell, and y'all never wake up out of this dream y'all in.  But at some point in time, you have to wake up.  If not, you're going to get left behind.  And then people feel some kind of way when people are always writing a comment section where everybody ain't going to make it.  Everybody can't go.  And then you see people talking about what you mean we can't make it.  See, I'm missing a whole, like, man.  You got to understand something.  A lot of y'all probably won't make it.  Because a lot of y'all are still asleep.  So just in case shit do pop off and hit the fan, if you're unprotected and unaware of the situation that makes you sleep and you're not going to make it, it's not like everybody's going to get on this one big-ass plane and leave America and y'all get left behind, per se.  I mean, a lot of y'all just don't get it on so many levels.  I mean, I wish I did.  Because as you see, man, shit ain't getting no better for black people out here.  Shit ain't really getting no better.  It's just getting worse.  And if you sleep, you're going to get left behind.  It's sad to say.  I mean, and that's crazy.  We got to stop.  And then people talking about, y'all talking about my kids being bad.  I mean, there's a lot of bad kids out here.  And I see these in comment sections too when people, I mean, the comment section be funny to me.  I mean, that's why I read comments.  Not all of them.  But I read other people's comments onto other people's videos.  I'm not going to say more than I read my own comments because I do read my own.  But other people's comments blow me on other people's videos.  It's because it seems like a lot of people don't understand, man.  It was a certain flock of people that did raise fucked up kids out here and it's showing right now.  I mean, you can blame it on the drug epidemic or whatever the case may have been in the late 80s and early 90s.  But it's a breed of kids that's going on out right here, yo, that just don't seem to get it.  So that, I mean, and it's sad because that is our generation.  But it seemed like the murder rate amongst them is extremely high.  The murder rate when I was coming up on Black on Black Crime wasn't as high as it is now.  It's like black kids kill shit for fun now.  I mean, I just want people to understand when shit do start at home.  You got to fix home.  This dude, I mean, this not fucking around coalition is not there to clean up your home.  It is there to clean up what's outside your home and outside your neighborhood.  And that's police brutality and, I mean, the beatings of regular citizens on the streets from police and hanging of racist white people.  That's what he stands for.  He's not no neighborhood goon that's just going to swing out a tree and lock up every thug in the neighborhood.  That's your job.  That starts in your house and in your community.  But a lot of people get that shit twisted.  I mean, so I promote this dude.  Y'all not going to stop me from putting up videos on this dude.  I got friends that sit and tell me why you put up so many videos on this guy.  Because a lot of y'all need to hear this dude, yo.  It's surprising to me that y'all didn't find him on y'all own.  Y'all sit around and watch Tekashi 6ix9ine and T.I.  want to be for 50 Cent.  I mean, at some point in time, we got to be beyond that.  I mean, this world is bigger than Tekashi and T.I.  and 50 Cent.  I mean, there's more going on out here in this world than just what your small mind puts into your YouTube channel to see.  For America is burning down around us and a lot of y'all don't even see it.  America is under pressure right now and a lot of y'all don't even see it.  You will see it when it's too late, but I want y'all to wake up before it's too late.  So I'm going to continue to push these videos.  I don't care how much negative feedback I get under these videos.  Who cares?  That's the problem with black people now.  You quick to down shit.  Stop trying to down shit all the time.  Do your homework on shit before you down it.  Don't come at me reading a couple of chapters of a book and then come to me like you done read the whole book when you don't have no idea what the fuck going on.  I mean, just because you read a couple of chapters, you don't know the movement.  I mean, y'all need to get on, just get on board, man.  I'm trying to pull this shit together from the outside looking in, from the inside looking out.  It's because I'm in these streets too.  This YouTube channel ain't the only thing I do.  I'm in these streets.  I want to give a shout out to the people that's been donating to my channel.  I see you.  I appreciate y'all at a time like this because I know times is hard.  But I do want to give y'all a special shout out, y'all.  And it's drop down.  Y'all keep focused, man.  Stay strong. ",
