            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  This is a sound the alarm moment.  I will be doing a news update.  The news updates, the prophetic news reports are on Patreon.  You can check out my Patreon.  You don't have to.  This is so significant.  That I needed to share this.  A shout out to Brother Keegan and Sister Ashley.  Who are our Prophecy Reporters.  We love you and appreciate you.  And this one really stood out.  Now this I reported on prior.  But today the urgency of this report.  And it's not just confirmed with me.  Brother Keegan was feeling the same thing.  Rabbi Shalom Arush.  breaks silence.  this is what he said on August 23rd.  Messiah is coming this year.  now remember this is the Rosh Hashanah.  Yom Teruah Feast of Trumpets is celebrating the new year for the Jewish people.  so as God established it this is what he says.  There have been 5,000, well, this was in Breaking Israeli News, 5,780 holidays of Rosh Hashanah since the creation of the world.  Now, I don't agree with that, but I've done a video on how the Bible does not contradict that, but how it actually speaks to that.  But I will say since the time of Adam forward and creation as we know it.  You can look back on former videos for what I'm talking about.  Nevertheless, this report says there have been 5,780 holidays of Rosh Hashanah since the creation of the world.  But if a prominent, remember a prominent rabbi's prediction proves true in just a few short weeks, this would be September 18th, Rabbi, in just a few short weeks, 5,781 will be a special Rosh Hashanah.  Rabbi Shalom Arush, an Israeli Breslov Rabbi and founder of the Huchel Chesed Institution.  made an entirely uncharacteristic announcement.  On September 18th, this is what he's saying, Jews will be celebrating the last new year without the Messiah.  Quote, I am going to tell you with certainty that Hashem, God, the name, they will not say God, they refer, it's out of reverence and respect, the name, Hashem.  God, literally the name, will help us meet together after Rosh Hashanah.  I'm going to say that again.  This prominent rabbi, quote, I am going to tell you with certainty that Hashem will help us meet together after Rosh Hashanah.  Rabbi Arush said in an interview last week, and remember, well, what I am telling you, that this Rosh Hashanah will be the last rosh.  one without mashiach which is messiah and it could very well be that on this rosh hashanah the messiah will be revealed.  the rabbi emphasized that he has never made such a statement before and he's been prominent and he has been teaching for over 40 years and has never said that.  now that's not the word of god But that is a prominent rabbi, and they are watching and waiting for Mashiach.  They will be duped.  Who they'll be believing is Mashiach at first is the Antichrist.  Which means, if his prediction was correct, we, the body of Christ, the bride of Christ, will be called away.  Like 1 Thessalonians 4, 16 and 18, and 1 Corinthians 15 says, uh, 50 to 53 tells us hallelujah in the twinkling of an eye.  Well, brothers and sisters, that was so significant.  I wanted to share that on all my social media platforms.  Now I'm going to say this again.  We, we report as watchmen.  I'm not calling myself that I'm watchmen are reporting.  Um, If you believe that I'm that, that's great.  If not, that's fine too.  I don't care about the titles.  It's not about that.  We're part of the body of Christ.  But we are exciting as we are seeing things happen in these final moments of the end of days.  Well, God bless you guys.  I want to give you a blessing before I let you go.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  May his countenance be lifted on you and his shalom, his peace, perfect, whole, complete, nothing lacking, nothing missing, be yours in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Jesus Messiah.  I pray and I bless you.  Shalom, shalom, shalom aleichem, and have an awesome rest of your day. ",
