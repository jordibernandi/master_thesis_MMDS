            "text": "So I'm putting this video together in a bit more of a hurry than my last ones and I don't even own a decent camera yet so I apologize if this one's a bit more stripped back.  But in light of everything that's happening right now and given that I've gained a few more subscribers than I expected to in the last few weeks, thank you so much for that by the way, I thought I would offer some thoughts on what's been going on.  As most of you know, on the 25th of May, a black man named George Floyd was arrested by the police.  While he was in handcuffs, the police officer named Derek Chauvin pushed his knee into Floyd's neck and kept it there for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, while three of his colleagues stood and watched.  Floyd was heard repeatedly begging for his mother and saying the words, please, please, please, before losing consciousness.  An hour later, he was pronounced dead.  His crime?  Buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note.  This is a modern-day lynching.  Chauvin, as it turns out, was no stranger to misconduct.  He already had 18 complaints filed against him, most of which were closed with no discipline.  two of which were open firing at suspects.  The entire incident was caught on camera, but nonetheless, four days went by before Chauvin was arrested, and in those four days, protests and riots erupted across the country.  My first reason for wanting to talk about this was that I saw far too many people close to me, generally well-meaning people, insisting that we obviously condemn Floyd's death, but then compulsively throw in a kind of, by the way, we should also condemn the rioters.  Now, I can concede that rioting as an act in itself is a bad decision, and it's undeniable that they result in a lot of innocent people getting hurt.  But there is a difference between saying rioting should happen and that rioting inevitably will happen.  Rioting is not a political strategy.  People don't meet up at a protest and say, okay, we've assessed the situation and right now it's in our best interests to riot.  Rioting is an outburst.  It's an outcome of long-standing injustices, inequalities, and tensions that have been completely unaddressed by conventional methods.  And we all know this because riots are predictable.  In the winter of 2011, I remember my sociology lecturer telling me that the austerity policies of the Tory and Liberal government in the UK were going to lead to urban riots.  He said they wouldn't happen right away because the UK is quite cold in the winter, but that they would occur by the end of the year.  In the August of that year, riots broke out in London.  Incidentally, they broke out shortly after a young black man named Mark Duggan was shot dead by the police.  And I know some people like to say that the social sciences are invalid, but the police certainly don't, because it turns out, they often predict riots too.  Riots are not just a random collection of bad decisions.  They are a sociological outcome of conditions that we ultimately have some kind of control over.  We don't need to have systemic racism.  The police don't need to keep officers with a history of unreasonable force out on the street.  Societies and the people in charge have a say over whether the conditions that lead to riots should exist.  If these conditions are allowed to exist, then we do not have a say over whether or not there should be riots.  there will be riots, and whether or not you agree with the morality of the rioters' decisions is irrelevant.  So if you condemn Floyd's death but then feel compelled to speak against the rioters in the same breath, you are downplaying the former, because the latter is useless.  Whether or not an earlier arrest on Chauvin in particular would have prevented the riots, I don't know.  But it seems that the police have had no interest in reflecting on their actions as they engage in some of the worst acts of police brutality most of us have ever seen.  And the point I really want to make here is people in power despise protesters.  They can just about handle things like elections with ridiculous voting systems, media campaigns, voter suppression and all that.  But protesting is volatile.  It's a large number of people spontaneously coming together over a shared discontent and sometimes even realising that ultimately they are many and the people they oppose are few.  The limits that people in power will go to to stop people from protesting is pretty extreme.  For example, if you take a look at a picture of Paris, you'll probably notice that there are a lot of very wide boulevards running along and across the city.  Paris wasn't always like that.  It used to be made up of a maze of narrow and winding cobbled streets that you would normally associate with a medieval European town.  The reconstruction of Paris was commissioned by Louis Bonaparte in the 1850s, and the boulevards were built with the explicit intent of making it easier for the National Guard to move through the city to quell urban protesters.  In the 1940s, the housing projects in America saw a mass movement of people out of the city and into the suburbs.  Places like Manhattan shifted from being places of residence to places of tourism and consumption.  With people living further apart, protest became less spontaneous, and people's right to assembly in public space became increasingly meaningless.  Even something as simple as mortgages were massively subsidized by the state, and the policymakers of that time openly boasted about how debt-encumbered homeowners don't go on strike.  The very cities that we live in, and very integral aspects of our daily lives, are designed to stop us from protesting.  But nonetheless, people sometimes just protest anyway, and often they do it peacefully, and it makes the police look quite bad to stop them if they aren't doing anything wrong.  But history gives us no shortage of stories about police provocateurs joining protests and instigating the violence themselves.  I follow a lot of left and right-wing people on Twitter, and there are quite a lot of videos coming out right now that seem to be evidence for just one thing or another.  There are videos that look a lot like police provocateurs, like this guy nonchalantly smashing windows and threatening people for asking what he's doing.  There are videos that look a lot like young anarchists who just want to break things.  And there's even a good bit of evidence that fascists and white supremacists are instigating violence because they know it'll get blamed on BLM or Antifa.  But amongst that and the endless footage of cops attacking people who are unambiguously posing no threat, there are also some moments of extreme humanity and solidarity that really remind you of something.  The real horror is not the riots.  It's the system that produced them.  As I was writing this, I saw that Trump wants to make Antifa a terrorist organization.  Whether or not he has the power to do this, I'm not too sure, but Antifa is currently trending on Twitter with almost 2 million posts, and I'm just wondering why?  Because I looked through these videos and pretty much all of them are just people in face masks doing bad things.  Now, I get that face masks are largely associated with Antifa, but I'm sure most people know that they're not exclusive to them, not least of all in the middle of a pandemic.  This is really all it takes.  Because everyone is currently wearing face masks, everyone, in Trump's eyes at least, looks a bit like Antifa.  And I'm sure some of the people in these two million posts are Antifa, but can anyone prove they are?  Does this person know he's looking at Antifa and not just some random people?  Does Jason here have any reason to believe this girl struggling to break a window with a plank is Antifa?  Maybe I'm dancing around the point here, so I might as well just say, when Trump says Antifa, he means everyone who doesn't agree with him.  If your idea of protest is wearing a MAGA hat and marching en masse with AR-15s, that's probably fine.  Anything else is Antifa, and therefore terrorism, apparently.  It's fucking ridiculous.  I might as well make a side note here and point out that in a previous video I spoke about how anti-fascists were instrumental in curbing the rise of fascism in the 1930s, and their tactics were very similar to what they do today.  Now, at least one European country successfully made the argument that the real danger was coming from the left.  And that country was Germany.  If the people protesting are lucky enough to get out of this without a bunch of them being killed, it's likely a lot of them will be sent to jail.  After the London riots, the government's response was to make an example out of the people who were arrested.  The police gave themselves an arbitrary target of 3,000 convictions, and the sentences given were deliberately random and excessive.  One person was jailed for two years for driving looters around in her car, and a student spent six months in jail for stealing a case of water.  I am saying all this from a very sheltered corner of the world where nothing ever happens, but if you are involved in the protest right now, if it wasn't for what you guys do, I would have given up on the world a very long time ago.  Take care of yourselves, and I wish you all the best.  Right, bye. ",
