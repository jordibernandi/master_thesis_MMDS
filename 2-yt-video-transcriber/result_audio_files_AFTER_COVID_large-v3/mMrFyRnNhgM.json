We watched little Jebby's family arrive and deplane first, shipping these kids to them.  This powerful voice inside told me something has to change.  I commend you for fighting this fight.  I showed you a glimpse of some foreshadowed events.  We're in a ritual.  Good to see you.  You don't say that.  We watched the exact moment where the general earned George's trust by simply mentioning the word member.  If you want a ride, just come.  Get in.  Mr.  President, I was told to ask you about the member you were with yesterday. ",

After this grandson's explosive statement, we witnessed an explosive conversation on the stairs.  So now let's take a moment to watch some of these conversations on the stairs before we head in and watch all the politicians.  And now we'll pick up where we left off.  This general is hitting all the right marks to earn the trust of the Bush family.  As the soul releases, it blesses the honor of Spock.  That general's got a twinkle in his eye and Laura is looking very concerned about that camera. ",

And then just moving for funerals, weddings, and the family reunion.  Who is George winking to?  They'll see all the changes and everything.  All him and his dad's friends.  They look like a nice bunch.  In the last proof, you'll recall this conversation on the stairs, which was prompted by the general alerting George to notify his family not to be seen with a certain person.  He took things further when he did this with George.  Was it enough to pass Laura's test of trust?  As the Bush families perched high upon the top step of the Capitol building, they looked down upon the military beneath them.  Laura Bush looks pleased.  Is over not safe?  Normally the arms go down when the casket passes.  Laura's arm went down.  Let's pan these grieving faces.  At least one person looks happy.  Last episode at the Rotunda, we were focused on the outside when the Bush family was arriving.  On the inside, politicians were streaming in to the ritual circle.  behind these stiffs we see a woman looking puzzled from the aerial shot.  you see that there's not very many politicians in there yet but there's enough to have raised a question for her and you'll see her here talking to this man.  what it sounds like is somebody else except over there has passed away.  yes ma'am look at her reaction.  He's faking it!  I know it.  Nope, they ought not even be playing this shit.  Bullock could hear you.  He's not even in it!  These people are so stupid!  I said to someone, who's in the box?  George Bush Sr.  has gone missing.  Now watch how clever our girl is. ",

He seems to feel her focus, but as soon as he looks up, watch her roll her focus right off him.  Let's watch again.  You're surrounded by the Church of Satan.  So let's set the scene up.  This scene is pretty funny.  This guy is standing in here when these people walk in.  And then this usher back here must know this guy's spiel because as soon as the guy says it, this is what the usher does.  You're surrounded by the Church of Satan.  Okay, thank you.  And then I'll show you everybody's reaction to the guy.  It's crazy.  You're surrounded by the church of Satan.  We'll go down the line of reaction.  This guy tries to move over, but he bumps into his friend.  The creeper closes the gap.  And then he has to explain to his friend what the guy has said.  You're surrounded by the church of Satan.  He has to say it.  I told you that we're surrounded by the Satan.  He's listening to us.  He's listening.  This just pisses off our god.  Bollock!  Likely a high-ranking military officer, our girl is still in the back watching and listening.  They all know.  We're reporting it.  Oh my god.  Elena, come up front so I can go with you.  It's the easiest starting place.  Tsk, tsk.  Such a fuss to come up front and be on camera.  They set this up for his legacy.  Never mind if he's dead.  True, but it defies the Bush's use and boosts his ego.  So they'll write a perfect legacy to boost it up with.  Let's add to his legacy this.  President Bush's religion.  It was a phallic religion.  He continued to pray for individuals.  He'll pray for the gods.  There's one person that is not amused.  Keeping such secrets dark from the public, how do they all do it?  Who's this friendly duo?  Oh, it's Kevin McCarthy with Nancy Pelosi.  I didn't know they were besties.  Remember this guy.  You're going to see him again in an upcoming episode.  As the swamp slimes in, you'll recognize a lot of these faces because they stick around forever and they never, ever leave.  Now listen to this audio feed that accidentally gets picked up and what this guy says.  Yeah, absolutely. ",
