I immigrated from West Africa, Liberia.  Been here for over 25 years.  Always dreamed about opening my own bar and restaurant.  That's something that I have dreamed about.  So my wife and I worked so hard, saved up to have our dream come true.  It was a blessing that we could finally get to see that.  But due to the rioting that happened in the city, our bar was burned down and we had to start over.  But there's a silver lining through the whole story that the word came together.  Everybody was a lot of support.  There was a lot of prayer.  There was a lot of donation.  Now we're in a better position to rebuild.  So we're just grateful and blessed for the opportunity to start over. ",
