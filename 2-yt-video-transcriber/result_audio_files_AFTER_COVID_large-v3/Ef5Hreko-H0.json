            "text": "And then, in 1979, the Iranian revolution showed dramatically that America's policy of backing dictators did not work.  The Iranian people rose up and toppled the Shah of Iran.  The Shah had one of the largest military forces in the world, given to him by the Americans.  But it proved helpless in the face of the new Islamist ideology of Ayatollah Khomeini.  Many in the West saw Khomeini as the resurgence of a dark, almost medieval force.  But this was wrong.  The Iranian revolution was yet again driven by Western ideas of political freedom.  Behind it lay the ideas of a young Iranian teacher called Ali Shariati.  Shariati is an extraordinary historical figure, because he single-handedly fused the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and Frantz Fanon with Shia Islam to produce a completely new revolutionary ideology.  And it was this ideology that lay behind Ayatollah Khomeini's radical vision of political Islam.  Like so many revolutionaries, Shariati had studied in Paris in the early 60s.  And he had become fascinated by Sartre's ideas of true freedom and Fanon's theories of how to use armed struggle to achieve it.  Shariati translated both Fanon and Sartre into Farsi.  What he added to their theories was the idea that Shia Islam could be used to give meaning and purpose to the armed struggle and the utopia it would achieve.  This was a radically new interpretation.  Since the 7th century, Shia Islam had been an apolitical and passive force.  Its leaders, the Ayatollahs, told the people that they must not involve themselves in political struggle.  They should wait patiently and endure all hardships until the coming of the true Imam.  But Shariati had turned Shia Islam into a revolutionary political force that yet again offered to liberate people and transform them in the here and now.  It was these ideas that Ayatollah Khomeini had taken up and used to overwhelm America's ally.  And in the slogans shouted on the streets in Tehran, what you hear are the Western ideas of positive liberty and the theories of France Fanon. ",
