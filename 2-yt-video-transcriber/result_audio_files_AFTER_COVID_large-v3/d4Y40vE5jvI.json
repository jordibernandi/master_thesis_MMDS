            "text": "What is the solution to the Koran epidemic?  This question is asked by the entire public.  We are the people of the Tanakh, and here in the Temple, the Tanakh is a light for our feet.  We are telling what the Tanakh tells us.  People donated half a shekel to the Temple building, first to the mosque, then to the Temple, for years and years.  The Torah says, and there will be no Negev in the Children of Israel.  That is to say, it stops the plague.  There is the well-known story with Aaron, when Korah attacked Aaron the priest and tried to take him down from the altar and divide him against what was happening in the mosque.  The plague came.  What does Aaron do?  He takes the rod, cuts the rod, and stands between the dead and the living, and the plague stops.  As if we had the United Arab Emirates on the side of the Palestinians in a war.  The Arab Emirates came to the Palestinian side, it was in Beit Dagon, and there an incident took place where the plague came to the Palestinians.  So much so that they were forced to take the Arab Emirates and return the United Arab Emirates to the people of Israel because the plague killed many of them.  What happened in the past?  Aaron came to the people of Israel, to the Temple of the Sun, and the people of the Temple of the Sun accept him, but do not accept him with honor.  And not only that, our sages say, why didn't you worry about bringing Aaron back?  Why did you wait for the Holy One, may He be blessed, to bring the plague to them?  That's why the plague came again, on the people of the Temple of the Sun, and 50,000 were killed in the plague.  We mentioned four earthquakes in the Tanakh that are related to the Temple.  What the Chinese did during the days of King David, the earthquake came to the people of Israel.  70,000 people of Israel died in the earthquake.  Why?  The Chazan explains.  The people of Israel delayed in the construction of the Temple.  There was a mosque, but they did not go to Jerusalem to build the gate of the meeting place in Jerusalem.  Therefore, until David built the altar, as we see here, with a crown on it, only then was the plague stopped in this place.  And the last plague that everyone talked about in the Tanakh.  In the Tanakh it is said that the future will come.  All the nations will rise to Jerusalem, especially on the holiday of Sukkot, they will rise and bow before Hashem in Jerusalem.  A nation that will not rise to Jerusalem will face a disaster.  And he says, HaKadosh Baruch Hu is waiting for the whole world, for the Jews, and for the whole world, to come together before Hashem in Jerusalem.  And why?  Out of love for every creation.  And we promise that this day will come when we will all do more for the sake of the building of the Temple, that we will build it in the name of Rabbi Amenu, Amenu Amin. ",
