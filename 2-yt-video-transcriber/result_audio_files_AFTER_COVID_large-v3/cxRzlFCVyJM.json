You know, if you're talking about a president, if you're talking about an elected official, if you're talking about policy, well, that's politics.  If you're talking about what's going on in the streets of the United States of America, then that's real life and that's real life issues.  And we would and somebody like myself, along with various others, would challenge the notion that that's politics invading the sport.  It's not politics. ",

            "text": "All right, let me challenge you.  Number one, Colin Kaepernick has become a political guy.  If you looked at his 4th of July message just a couple of months ago, it was virulently anti-American.  Yes, that's true.  horrible country.  so he's apolitical right.  number two on the field this year there will be decals on helmets and most of the decals will say things that are sympathetic to social justice.  so that's during the game that i'm getting a political message on the helmet now.  i wouldn't mind it if you have Black Lives Matter on one side and respect the police on the other side.  A little bit of balance.  But you can't have that because of the peer pressure in the National Football League where 70 percent of the players are African-American.  And a guy like Drew Brees, a white guy, says, you know what, I'm not going to kneel because I've got a legacy, a military legacy, and I respect the flag.  And he's almost drummed out of the league.

            "text": "Well, first of all, let me say a couple of things.  Number one, you and I don't disagree.  I love that argument about balance.  I am not somebody that's averse to that.  I'm not opposed to that by any stretch of the imagination.  If you sat on one side and you had Black Lives Matter, but you also had on the other side, you know, respect our law enforcement officials and things of that nature.  I don't have.  an aversion to that whatsoever.  That's number one.  So there's no resistance here in that regard.  What I would tell you about Drew Brees, who is a good man and a phenomenal football player and has been very charitable and philanthropic in many, many ways to benefit various disenfranchised communities throughout this country.  There is no question that some of the uproar that was aimed in his direction was a bit excessive.  But as somebody who has spoken to Drew Brees, as somebody that knows him a little bit, Let me give you this insight.  When he responded, understand what the problem was.  His problem was there was an issue that took place.  And then when he was asked about the national anthem, when Colin Kaepernick originally took a knee, I'm not talking about his comments this past summer that you highlighted and accurately so.  I'm talking about the sole act of taking the knee.  He specifically explained I'm not being disrespectful to the flag.  I'm not being unpatriotic.  I actually consulted with military folks to make sure that I wasn't coming across as disrespectful.  I wanted to do something to bring attention to racial oppression and racial inequality that's going on in this nation.  And so when he took that position, anybody that speaks about it and then goes the route of patriotism, Your sense, the sense is you're echoing what the president did by basically hijacking the narrative and turning it into something that it was not.  It was never about being unpatriotic.  It was never about questioning one's patriotism.  It was about bringing attention and highlighting patriotism.  racial strife that the African-American community feels in this country.  There's a difference. ",

That, that, if you are going to stand for the national anthem, there are going to be players that don't like you.  And that are going to be, you know, there was a problem with New Orleans because the management felt that they would have a divided locker room.  And that there would be strife and you can't win if the team hates each other.  And that's what the genesis of that situation was. ",
