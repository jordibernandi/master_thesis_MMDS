You could use the words like lessened or relieved, assuage.  That's a good one, makes you sound smart.  But also, shut the up.  You are full of .  First of all, it doesn't matter whether or not reparations would alleviate racial inequality.  If a debt is owed, it is owed.  And it is definitely owed.  Aren't you like the Game of Thrones dork who's like, a Lannister always pays his debts unless it won't alleviate racial inequality.  Second of all, your proclamation that this is not a money problem is completely ahistorical, very big surprise.  We've actually tested this theory with white people.  We subsidized the purchase of homes for white people.  We provided free education for white people.  We literally gave away 10% of all land in this country to white people.  And so we actually know that literally giving free stuff to people increases their wealth, improves their lives and the lives of their descendants, which is frankly a pretty obvious concept.

            "text": "Ben, that's the exact wrong solution to the biggest problem plaguing black communities.  In fact, that's the exact cause of the biggest problem plaguing black communities.  For a little context, the US has less than 5% of the world's population, but 20% of the world's incarcerated people.  In 2003, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that black men have a one in three chance of going to federal or state prison in their lifetimes.  Right now, black people are 12.7% of the population, but 38.2% of the prison population.  And also, right now, nearly 40% of the US prison population, 576,000 people, are behind bars with no compelling public safety reason.  And so if your main concern is public safety and making sure communities have male role models, the worst possible solution you would come up with is to load the place with police.  Because studies have shown that when large numbers of parent-aged adults, especially men, cycle through stays in prison and jail at very high rates, communities are negatively affected in myriad ways, including damage to social networks, social relationships, and long-term life chances.  These effects impair children, family functioning, mental and physical health, labor markets, and economic and political infrastructures.  So what's really going on here, Ben?  I think it might be worthwhile to examine one of the rare discussions Ben recently had with a person that has very different views from Ben, and with a bit more policy and historical literacy than Joe Rogan.  A few months ago, Ben sat down with Ezra Klein, And he wasn't able to slip through his lies about the viability and efficacy of specific policies because he knew those arguments would get shut down.  And so he finally had to admit what was really going on. ",

Why is it that if you are the head of a household, African-American household, and you have a job, full-time job, you're going to have a lower net wealth on average than the head of a white household who is unemployed?  Or similarly, if you're head of an African-American household, you have a college degree.  You're likely to have a lower net worth than a white household headed by somebody who dropped out of high school.  That is speaking to something that has happened historically, right?  No question.

It is maybe a little ironic that the person whose catchphrase is, facts don't care about your feelings, embodies the exact opposite phenomenon.  Because if you believe that a government that does anything beyond protecting individual rights is illegitimate, that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the government, which is supposed to be responsible for, you know, we the people, to do pretty much anything at all.  It certainly doesn't allow for it to do anything meaningful about addressing racial inequality, which he has even admitted is at least in some measure due to historic injustice.
