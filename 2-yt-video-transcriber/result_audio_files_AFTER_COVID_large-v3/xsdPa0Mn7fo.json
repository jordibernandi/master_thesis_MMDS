            "text": "Good morning everyone, Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here today to begin our 40 days and 40 nights with Jesus.  So this is our first day with Jesus, number one.  I will be posting this video on the 8th of September at 9 a.m So I am doing them a day ahead so that you have a pretty regular time for posting.  And I'll try and do the evening postings at 9 p.m.  thereabouts.  So let's see what Jesus has to say to us today.  You are blessed beings indeed.  I am that one that you know as Jesus and we are very pleased that you are with us here today.  The messages that we are speaking over the next 40 days and 40 nights are for you.  They are for the humans on this planet Earth at this time that are going through a magnificent evolution.  Your minds are expanding, your hearts are opening, and your planet is changing.  So we are going to begin with the basics of your experience here on this planet.  This planet is a place of separation.  You have been taught throughout your histories that God is love and God has created this planet.  If God had created this planet it would not look the way it does.  When you look at nature you see that everything depends on something else dying for its sustenance.  Now we tell you to go out in nature as a beneficent treatment, let us say for your modern Western neuroses.  and it is indeed that.  But it is not because it is divine in that sense.  This separation focused experience is proven to you by the multiplicity of organisms, the unlimited number of leaves on trees and particles of sands on beaches and your individual bodies keep proving to you because you keep referring to them.  They keep proving to you that you're alone.  They keep proving to you that you're vulnerable.  They keep proving to you that you die.  You're an eternal spiritual being.  You never die.  When you raise your frequency enough, you will no longer need to pass away in the way that you witness now.  And as you're going through this evolutionary cycle with your planet, she is leading the way.  And that is why you have to go with her.  You have to go with her or you have to leave.  Those are your two choices.  So in this day one, we want to bring this point to you that there is no point in resisting this evolutionary journey or you will have to leave.  Those are the two choices.  Now this to some of you who are driven by the ego mind will, you will feel as a threat.  It is not a threat.  If you have to leave this increasingly wise and loving place, then you will be reborn into a place that matches and so you will seem to come back to a three-dimensional earth and you will continue on in your learning.  What we are encouraging all of you to do is to step on the train of freedom with us and and move with Gaia, with Earth, with your solar system into this magnificent new era.  But what this requires is us telling you the truth.  For those of you that have been Course in Miracles students, you understand this truth, that this world is a place of separation and what you are witnessing now in your society is a desperate attempt to increase.
