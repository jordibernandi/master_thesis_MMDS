            "text": "Welcome to Hivemind.  This is the speaker.  Today I want to talk about a man called Eric Marquez, also known as the kingpin of child porn.  Let's get into it.  The child pornography industry is more prevalent than most of us can even fathom.  In the case of Eric Marquez, who ran a hosting service for numerous dark web child pornography and exploitation sites, an FBI investigation revealed that the hosting service has more than 8.5 million photographs and videos of material involving the exploitation of children.  8.5 million.  I know professional photographers that do photography for a living.  They save nearly every photo they take.  And some of them have told me that they've counted that they've got about 3 million on their computers and on their drives.  So just try to get a little bit of a comprehension of what that is.  It's unbelievable.  in the worst way.  U.S.  Attorney Robert K. Herr remarked, this is an outrageous case where one individual facilitated the abuse of more than a million new child victims and attempted to keep the abuse hidden on the dark web.  An FBI agent on the case has dubbed Marquez as the largest facilitator of child pornography on the planet.  A 2016 National Child Exploitation Threat Assessment report that the child pornography industry has exploded with the increased globalization of the market, sophistication of encrypted techniques, and the ability to evade detection using dark web networks.  In just one example cited by the National Child Exploitation Threat Assessment, the FBI investigated a single website on the dark web which had approximately 200,000 registered users.  Not only is the production and distribution of these images perpetuating the demand for new material, the report states, but the 2016 National Strategy Survey shows that offenders also have increased their demand for more depraved, egregious content.  Eric Marquez's Freedom Hosting Service was a massive hub for this depraved and egregious child abuse material.  As a Jewish citizen born in New York to a Brazilian father and Irish mother who are divorced, Marquez lived with his mother and sister in Ireland since childhood.  Marquez later worked and lived in his father's Dublin home for years.  Prior to a police raid and his apprehension from the residents in 2013, neighbours described Marquez as a recluse who spent most of his days in solitude on his computer.  The amended criminal complaint against Marquez alleges that between July 24th, 2008 and July 29th, 2013, the facilitator conspired to advertise and to distribute child pornography and aided and embedded the advertising and distribution of child pornography by allegedly operating a free anonymous web hosting service located on the dark web, an area of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software such as Torque.  allowing users and website operators to remain anonymous and untraceable.  Around the same time that Marquez began facilitating child pornography sites, the National Centre of Missing and Exploited Children reported that child pornography files submitted between 2005 and 2009 for the purposes of identifying children increased by 432%.  Marquesas Freedom Hosting harbored more than 500 servers in Europe and provided anonymity to sites like Pedo Empire, Love Zone, and Lolita City.  In 2011, a group identifying as anonymous carried out a mission they described as Operation Darknet, in which they briefly took down 40 sites allegedly trading in child abuse images.  Lolita City was among one of these sites, targeted by Anonymous.  The group then published the identities of 1,500 site users.  One member of the Anonymous group is alleged to have been an FBI informant.  The FBI then led a probe in 2012 and 2013, targeting two particular websites hosted by Freedom Hosting.  One site provided categories listed on the homepage as girls, all, and boys, ranging in ages from 0 to 2 to 15 to 17.  Documents reveal the FBI discovered thousands of images and videos depicting bondage, bestiality, torture, and violent sexual abuse of children as young as infants.  Of the 1.4 million files on this single site hosted by Freedom Hosting, 1 million of which were reviewed by agents, nearly all contained child sexual abuse images.  Marquez attempted to shield Freedom Hosting from liability by a warning on the homepage that stated, we do not give permission for upload of any illegal files.  If you choose to do so anyway, we are not responsible for your actions.  However, FBI documents note that in reality, the anonymous hosting site has full control over all of the website hosting on their service.  The FBI documents go on to report that though, The anonymous hosting service did not necessarily create or maintain any of the sites hosted.  Freedom Hosting could do whatever they wanted with the sites they host, as they inherently have full access to the database behind the sites.  Investigators allege that Marquez not only knew of the child pornography content on the site hosted by his service, but that he had control over at least one of the sites.  From the FBI probe, investigators identified an IP address associated with the anonymous hosting service, as well as two targeted websites under scrutiny.  Agents then traced the location of the server to France, and in working with the French police, discovered the server was registered under Marquez, with the billing address listed in Las Vegas.  Investigators then discovered the account held by Marquez at the private mailing facility in Las Vegas listed a forwarding address in Dublin, Ireland.  FBI then contacted the Irish State Police who confirmed Marquez lived at the residence.  On July 29, 2013, the Irish State Police raided Marquez's home, apprehended the suspect and confiscated his computer.  Then a few days later, Freedom Hosting website went down, and several child abuse sites were reportedly infected with JavaScript exploits, making it possible to identify site users and their IP addresses.  Marquez remained in custody in Ireland while fighting extradition to the United States for six years.  He was finally extradited in March of 2019.  Authorities seized approximately 155,000 from Marquez, who admitted that his business was very successful during his expedition hearing.  And in February of 2020, Marquez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to advertise child abuse images.  He faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison with a maximum of 30 years possible.  Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of 15 to 21 years in prison as part of a plea agreement, though the US District Judge is not bound by these parameters.  No further details of the plea agreement have been reported just as yet, though there is speculation as to whether cooperation with authorities regarding the identities of child abuse site owners and other users may be part of the plea deal.  Marquez reportedly warned users of Freedom Hosting.  If my identity is compromised and I am questioned, forced to cooperate to identify you, I will do it to ensure my freedom.  That concludes this report.  For more information on this report, check the links in this description.  Look out for more reports like this.
