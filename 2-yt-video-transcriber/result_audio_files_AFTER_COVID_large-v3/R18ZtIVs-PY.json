            "text": "That was nice of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you for watching.  Do you have a driver's license?  Do you have a driver's license?  Do you drive?  Yeah, Robbie's a good speaker.  8308, are you still on the 3?  8308?  Alright.  Hold on, man.  Thank you.  41-30, 41-62, 3203 NW on a disturbance.  There's a female screaming in the area.  I don't see anything.  Stop talking to the police.  I'm going somewhere where y'all can fucking hide.  What the fuck is that for?  You're more than welcome to film all you want.  I don't need your instructions, brother.  I'm going to tell you right now, okay?  Yeah.  You're more than welcome to film all you want, but you're not going to keep walking around us.  Yeah, well, y'all went ahead.  So take a spot.  Turn your fucking light off.  Listen to me.  Get away from me.  All right.  Get away from me.  Am I okay where I'm standing?  Take a spot and stay.  I don't want you walking around.  But if y'all go behind your car and hide, I'm going to come over and film.  What's it got for you?  Absolutely it is, sir.  So you can go back to your car.  Get away from me.  And stay right there.  I'm going to tell you right now.  I'm going to keep you all on my camera.  Really?  Can you turn your light off?  You gotta be a jackass.  Why?  Why?  340.  Stupid.  4340, go ahead.  The 342's not doing anything.  Can you never come over here with a computer on the phone?  Can you head over with 340?  I like this one.  Put it right.  There you go.  Just like that.  Look, now you can't shine it at me because he has to shine it at his partner.  Hey, I need your name and badge numbers, officers.  I just need your name and badge number.  Fuck off, motherfucker.  That's right.  Thank you, sir.  Unit 76291.  Get out your ticket book.  Get out your ticket book.  It's an arrestable offense, sir.  Come here.  It's an arrestable offense, cussing or disorderly conduct in public.  Do you know how many times you guys have paid me for disorderly conduct?  Sir, do you want your name?  I got it, I got it.  Come on.  We don't want to leave your car here, so you can go ahead and put your car as well.  That little Lexus.  No, we don't feel safe because I don't want somebody to steal it.  It's okay.  Unfortunately, we can't leave it just for somebody else.  It's registered to you, yes, sir?  Yes?  Is it registered to me?  Uh-huh.  No.  It's illegally parked.  Yeah, it's illegally parked.  So we can all play games, dude.  Okay?  I know.  It's all on camera, man.  It's all good.  It didn't have to be that way.  I just wanted to film you guys.  No, but you offended the public.  That's what happened.  It is.  You cannot offend the public.  Language, yes, that's a disorderly conduct language.  He was offended.  You have a victim that is offended.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, Jack, there's a person there, man.  Somebody's going to break in and steal that.  No, it's good, man.  Somebody's going to pick it up.  Who's somebody?  The person that's filming right now.  I can't do that.  I can't just release it to anybody.  Come on, man.  If you know how this all works and you know our policies, right?  Aren't you the one that studies our policies?  You should know, Jack.  There's a person that's filming me right now.  Right, I get that.  I've already seen your videos.  And they'll take care of the car.  No, but you understand our policy there, yes?  We can't just pass it off to anybody, right?  Look, man.  So it's either, hey, it's either we gave his ID, and we might get it off to him, or we're just going to vote.  It's either or.  I'm trying to help you out.  I'm trying to work with you, okay?  I'm the owner of the car, and I'm telling you.  You just said it's not registered to you, yes?  I'm in possession of it, right?  I own it.  So, therefore, if you would like for somebody else to come.  Hey, Angle, we checked that area, westbound, down the Harry Warriors box, and all along Redmond, and we don't see anybody out there walking around or trying to hide out or anything.  I'm trying to get you out of doubt.  Yeah, I can give, we can call.  Oops.  You see my phone?  Where's your phone?  Did you see it?  Oh, you know what, it's up here.  How do you turn this thing off?  Oh, do you have my scanner?  Do you want to turn it off?  Yes, sir.  It interferes with our radios.  That's fine.  There's a button on the bottom left-hand side.  Right here, sir?  Yeah, down at the very bottom.  It's like a power button.  Okay, right here.  And if you hold it down, it'll shut off.  I think this one.  Yep, I think I did.  Okay, cool.  Did my partner shut your camera off?  I don't want to be wasting any battery.  Yeah, it's off.  Okay.  Okay.  Nice camera.  Man, you know, all I wanted to do was film, and I got in the car, and I just wanted to get to the other side to keep everybody on video.  I wasn't going to say nothing to you guys.  Nothing.  At all.  I've been filming you guys all night long, and no problems.  And, you know, I mean, I don't know.  It wasn't you.  It was him who kept that spotlight right in my face, and that's going to make somebody mad.  It's uncomfortable.  They don't want to name the badge numbers, and I won't give it, so, you know, you get cussed at.  What's the big deal?  I'm really not out here to cause you guys problems.  There it is.  Mr.  Miller?  Yes, sir?  I'm going to turn your camera completely off, okay? ",
