            "text": "Good afternoon and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon conference call with Trusts Unlimited.  This is Jim George speaking.  I'm the non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited.  I'd like to thank all of you for taking time to listen to this call, particularly those of you calling in for the first time and those that will be listening to the replay over the next 24 to 48 hours.  I'd also like to wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a happy new year as we begin to approach 2021.  If you're anything like most of the people I associate with, we are pretty much done with 2020 and we can't wait for the new year.  Today's call is going to be a little different as I get into it.  I've been thinking about this for the last 24 hours.  There's a lot going on on a lot of different levels, politically, financially, globally.  economically, and what I've decided to do is spend today talking about the things that are going to be relevant for those of us that have currencies and those of us, frankly, that have children and grandchildren and are concerned about the direction of this country and, frankly, the globe.  I also think you should have a pen and paper handy because I'm going to give you some information that I think you ought to investigate on your own.  But let's go ahead and talk a little bit about the situation as it exists in Iraq.  I'll dispense with our usual disclaimer.  The window for the reinstitution of the dinar has been expanded.  While I still believe that January is a plausible and possible date, for the reinstitution of the dinar.  I'm going to have to expand it to include the first quarter of 2021, and I'm going to explain that here today.  The potential postponement of the reinstitution is based on a couple of things.  First, the formal education program for the Iraqi nationals has not been kicked off.  and the project to complete the zeros has not been completed.  Now both of those can be resolved tomorrow, but they should have been resolved by December 1st.  So that's one of the reasons why we're looking at potential postponement for the re-institution.  Now the CBI and the IMF are working together on a strategy to proceed with a re-institution.  And what they've done initially is to devalue the dinar against the U.S.  dollar because we must remember that the dinar is still pegged to the U.S.  dollar.  Now, their objective is multifaceted.  First, they want to limit, if not stop entirely, the currency auction theft.  Second, they want to bring in line the auction price and the street value of the dinar to within that 2% spread that the IMF and all of the international organizations like the UN and the BIS want.  Third, by devaluing the currency against the dollar, it will speed up the collection of the remaining 3-0 provisional dollars that are still floating around in Iraq.  And lastly, this is the setup for re-pegging the dinar to the IMF basket of currencies.  Now, the IMF plan is, of course, with the assistance of the Central Bank of Iraq, to first devalue the dinar against the U.S.  dollar, to then stop all of the auction theft, to collect the remaining zeros, to then reinstitute the dinar in-country, repaid it to the basket of IMF basket of currencies and then to refloat the repaid dinar onto the Forex.  And this probably will not be able to be done within the next 30 days, although it is possible.  If you've been listening to our calls for any length of time, I don't Gil DeLily et  al.,  I tell you straight what I believe based on the information at hand, and that's all we can do.  But the IMF is working with the Central Bank of Iraq, which is a very good sign that they want to get this done.  It just doesn't seem likely, although it's possible that it will get done over the next 30 days.  Now, I'm not going to get into the program we've put in place.  I didn't do it last week.  I'm not going to do it this week.  but I'm going to refer all of our newer callers and those listening to the replay to our call of December 16th, which has all of the information you need with regard to our plan and how you can proceed if you wish to get our initial no obligation package.  Now, as I said earlier in the call that I hope you have a pen and paper handy.  I'm going to give you some information.  There is an individual who I've been fortunate enough to deal with from time to time over the decades, very informative person, and I'm going to suggest that you listen to a very recent call that she made.  Now, the call or the interview, rather, is germane to what we're doing because it has to do with currencies and It also has to do with the current political situation, and frankly, some of the things that she has to say are disturbing.  One of the things that I was going to get into on this call, or at least I thought about, was explaining in detail the constitutional process for the election of the next president, whether it be Joe Biden or whether it be the re-election of Donald Trump.  In my personal opinion, Donald Trump will be re-elected.  I decided not to get into the weeds on how that would be the case.  But I think if you listen to the individual that I'm going to suggest you listen to, you'll get some of that information.  The name of this individual is Catherine with a C, Austin Fitz, F-I-T-T-S.  If you Google her name and her interview called Planet Lockdown, A lot of the information that's germane to what we're doing is included in that interview.  She has also written a book.  I believe it's titled The New Currency, having to do with a single digital worldwide currency.  Now, one of the reasons... that the IMF wants to peg the IQD to the basket of currencies is because that dovetails with what they're trying to accomplish.  That is to bring all of these currencies into the IMF and place it on the Forex, which then makes it easier for those currencies to be transformed into a single digital worldwide currency.  In my opinion, That's not necessarily a good thing, and if you listen to the interview, you'll understand why.  Now, because we're moving to a single digitized world currency, it's important that you get your affairs in order, not only because of the potential reinstitution of the Iraqi dinar, but in a global sense for the protection of your wealth.  The United States remains the only major superpower that has a constitution naming the American citizen and our inalienable rights as sovereign.  Included in their rights, of course, is the Second Amendment, which is our ability to protect ourselves, not just from personal assault, from an invasion of our home, but from our inalienable rights domestically and in terms of foreign interventions.  Also inclusive is the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which has to do with our privacy, with our personal papers.  It also provides our right to contract, and your package of irrevocable trusts is a contract.  So not only will it protect your privacy and your assets from civil litigation domestically, but it will also help cloak your transactions in a global sense.  And as I've said on many of our calls, you need to reposition assets after you've acquired this new wealth.  You need to move to tangible assets and away from currencies where, of course, the global community will have much more control of what's actually going on.  So those of you that have not as yet gotten your affairs in order may not have your trust package in place.  I strongly suggest you contact us, trustsunlimitedllc.com.  Get our initial no-obligation package.  It has a lot of information about us, about Trusts Unlimited, about the revaluation of these currencies.  I also strongly recommend that you go to YouTube and listen to Catherine Austin Fitz's interview entitled Planet Lockdown because all of this works great.  in the same direction, and the program we've put in place is not only gonna help you domestically, but it's gonna assist you as we move to this global digital currency environment.  And again, those of you that are not familiar with our work, I strongly suggest you listen to our call from December 16th, which includes not only our review of the situation in Iraq, but the program we've put in place to assist you both pre and post-RV, and it also has a rather informative Q&A recorded there as well.  So that's what we have to say for today.  We're closing out mercifully 2020.  We're moving to 2021.  If you review all of the information and listen to the interviews that I've suggested here, I think it provides you with the information you will need as we go into the new year.  And again, I want to wish all of you a happy new year, and let's hope that if not in January in the first quarter, we see the reinstitution of the dinar, we do our exchange, we place those currencies in our protected trust, and we move assets to tangible assets in order to avoid the volatility of the financial markets and the move to these digital currencies.  So have a great new year, and I look very much forward to speaking with you next week in the new year.  Bye-bye, everyone, and thanks for listening. ",
