In states like Arizona or seen in Texas.  16 states I think now are have a two week are starting to increase.  we don't.  fortunately we're not seeing deaths, deaths tend to be a lagging indicator.  However, there's also reason to believe that like the people who are getting it are less likely to die.  So that is, that is a i guess you could say a positive but we still don't know the long-term implications of getting this as a 20 year old or a 30 year old.  i mean you go into the hospital.  yeah you may be dealing with this for the rest of your life.  that said oh god well that said let's take a look at donald trump.  there's this question of testing because the other day when he was in oklahoma he said specifically and he said this before I told him to slow down the testing because all you get with testing is an awareness of how many people have it.  Here he is.  I don't know if this is what they were hoping to happen when he goes on this like a mediatory did, but here he is with a reporter from Scripps TV. ",
