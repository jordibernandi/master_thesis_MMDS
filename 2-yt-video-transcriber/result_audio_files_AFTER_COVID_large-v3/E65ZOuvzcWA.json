Sorry, Jordan, you won't follow, but maybe there are other people who will.  This is the equation that tells us the total energy of an object as it approaches the speed of light.  When v equals c, notice what happens under the root sign.  We get a division by zero.  This means that if we approach the speed of light from below to reach it, we will need infinite energy.  Obviously, that's impossible.  But what if we just declare that v is greater than c just to see what happens?  Well, then we get a negative number under the root sign.  We get an imaginary number.  the object would have imaginary energy.  What the hell does that even mean?  We could get around it by saying that its mass becomes imaginary.  But again, what the hell would that mean?  Imaginary mass?  What is that?  Either way, yes, it will result in physics being different on the other side of the light speed barrier.  One thing we find, for example, is that energy will decrease with increasing speed, and will go to infinity as you slow down to the speed of light.  So it would take infinite energy to breach the light speed barrier from the other side as well. ",

That image is an example of something that already exists within us.  Try the same experiment with someone who's been living in a completely different culture, isolated from us, and you'd probably get a completely different image.  The people who claim they saw aliens in the late 1950s didn't see this image.  Because it hadn't been popularized by Hollywood yet.  They saw big lizards and clunking robots.  They saw what Hollywood fed them.  In our culture, we all have similar ideas of what aliens look like, what demons look like, what gods look like, and so on.  That's why this isn't strange.  People having similar experiences while high does not mean that your high-as-a-kite consciousness leaves your body and travels to alien worlds faster than light.
