Let me get a brother.  Give a brother a hand.  That's my brother.  Yeah.  This brother used to call and ask for the tapes and the information.  The brothers would sit up and listen and learn about the information going on in a worldwide situation.  And when the brother started going out, he was the minister of information.  It was his role to articulate the impressions that the group was making on the youth.  And when brother went out and started talking very clearly about the diamond people in Switzerland, brother, tell me about being banned in Switzerland.  And then the group members said, brother, you've got to tone down.  Brother, you've got to tone down.  Brother, you've got to tone down.  You gotta shut the fuck up so we can get paid.  when we step down One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  These motherfuckers in lost state minds.  Earth bleeds and mothers crying.  Needless brothers dying.  They need genetic survival.  Murder they justifying.  A maniacal pattern denying.  Psychogenetic compliance.  Further the genders and white supremacist alliance.  We throw a fist in defiance.  They yell at my land triumph.  They seek ancestral guidance.  And here I'm speaking the silence.  Ain't no retreating for defenders alike.  I wield the flame in my left hand, the sword in my right.  All for a forceful response to this material plight.  And be empowered with wisdom, cause this spirit's a fight.  This ain't no campfire song, there be no damage control.  Ain't.  come to love you to sleep, we're here igniting your soul.  You better rise up, be brown, so let the silence abound.  Strain through, blood at the root, and blood on the ground.  So shut them down.  Who killin' blacks in the neighborhood?  What you blowin' past?  You're some one still blind at the dump.  O for your soul, farmer at the pole.  Can't say your ass wasn't worn and told.  Speakin' truth to power, toppled ivory tower.  Wreckin' pits, burnin' all water towers, they cower.  Lioness sat in mech, here to seek and devour.  Dressed in the color of blood, I'm here to balance the power.  I like Jordans, but wait a minute.  The hood is farther, yo, so put some knowledge in it.  Black bodies for soul, reparations are all payin' now.  Or else we got to shut them down.  So shut them down.  You see what I'm saying? ",
