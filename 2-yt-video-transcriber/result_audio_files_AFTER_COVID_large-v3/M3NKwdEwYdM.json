We'll start with the affidavits.  In Michigan, a poll watcher signed an affidavit saying they witnessed, quote, several thousand ballots inputted illegally.  Every ballot was being fraudulently and manually entered as having been born on January 1st, 1900.  When I asked about the impossibility, I was told instruction came down from Wayne County.  Another poll watcher in Detroit signed a separate affidavit saying at 4.30 a.m.  the day after the election, tens of thousands of ballots were delivered from out of state.  Quote, unlike the other ballots, these boxes were brought in from the rear of the room.  I specifically noticed every ballot I observed was cast for Joe Biden.  Another sworn affidavit from GOP poll watcher and former assistant attorney general in Michigan, Zachary Larson, alleges poll workers were processing ballots from voters who did not appear on the poll book, meaning they were either illegal votes altogether or unregistered, also illegal.  Another sworn affidavit from a Detroit elections worker says, quote, I was instructed by my supervisor to adjust the mailing date of these absentee ballot packages to be dated earlier than they were actually sent.  The supervisor was making announcements for all workers to engage in this practice.  A lawsuit brought about against Wayne County election officials by the Great Lakes Justice Center alleges the aforementioned items, as well as allegations that election workers coached voters to vote for Joe Biden and Democrats, that election workers used false information to process ballots and registering new voters as having a birth date of January 1st, 1900, and that election officials refused to record challenges to their processes and remove challengers from the site if they politely voiced a challenge.

Wisconsin Statute 6.86 provides that an absentee ballot must be signed by a witness who is also required to list his or her address.  If a witness address is not listed, the ballot is considered invalid and must be returned to the voter to have the witness correct.  Instead, multiple sources told WISN Radio, municipal clerks and vote counters across the state simply filled out witness signatures themselves.  Furthermore, quote, anticipating a legal challenge to this seemingly highly unlawful advice, the Wisconsin Election Commission instructed clerks to write these witness addresses in red pen so that they would be easy to find during a recount or audit of the vote.

The night before the presidential election in Georgia, a software update was uploaded to Dominion's machines.  The update, whatever it was, caused a glitch in Morgan and Spalding counties that temporarily prevented voters from casting machine ballots.  Marsha Ridley, election supervisor at Spalding County Board of Election, told Politico.  the company, quote, uploaded something last night which is not normal and it caused a glitch.  That is something that they don't ever do.  I've never seen them update anything the day before the election, end quote.  Something similar happened in Gwinnett County around the same time, affecting at least 80,000 mailed absentee ballots. ",
