            "text": "hey guys welcome back to my channel.  thank you so much for coming back and if you're coming by for the first time you're welcome.  this is virtue grace.  have you subscribed?  no okay go ahead.  thank you guys.  an interesting and exciting story coming from kenya.  guys COVID-19 is not going to leave us the same.  I know it.  I believe it.  And I see it.  This pandemic is not leaving us the same on this continent.  Africans, we are going to be forever changed.  Change is already happening in a way that is unprecedented.  And I'm so excited, guys.  I'm excited.  The potentials in us that we align follow are being challenged.  I mean, we are beginning to manifest change.  who we truly are remember civilization and everything that we see today are scientific innovations or advancement and all of that actually began from africa way back then in egypt and you know other parts of africa.  so guys we are taking back our rightful position.  i mean it's so exciting.  Because of this pandemic, so many things have been happening.  Innovations, you know, countries are now beginning to take steps to begin manufacturing.  Because, of course, we all know that borders are being shut down.  Flights are going in and out of countries.  No international, you know, travels.  And... countries are pressed for choices now dwindling resources.  people have to prioritize their citizens and their needs first.  so i mean we just have to look inwards.  we do not have a choice but to look inwards now and i'm so grateful and excited that africa is not taking you know the backstage.  africa countries are looking inwards guys.  this group of students in kenya 16 students in kenya from the faculties of engineering, pharmacy, medicine, and nursing came together under the tutelage of their deans.  There's a deans of the different faculties.  And under seven days, they produced a prototype ventilator.  Guys, these same ventilators that people are coming to donate to us in Africa because there's a need for them.  These amazing brothers and sisters in Kenya, under the tutelage of their deans, God bless them, have come up with a prototype ventilator.  I mean, under seven days, guys.  Under seven days.  See, these things are happening at such a speed that it's actually surprising and impressive at the same time.  Who would have thought that, you know, we would take such initiatives?  before this pandemic to begin, you know, to think about manufacturing things such as this on the continent.  You know how much we have been dependent on foreign economies, you know, importing and just damaging our own economies.  But now we are looking inwards.  And the good thing is that this prototype was produced using locally sourced materials.  They didn't have to go anywhere to buy any materials to import anything.  No, locally sourced, guys.  How cool is that?  And the team has said at a price of 500,000 Kenya shillings, which is approximately 5,000 US dollars, they can produce up to 50 of these ventilators in a week.  Guys, in a week.  So this prototype ventilator was exhibited.  It was presented to the Kenyan authorities and the Minister for Industrialization and the Vice Chancellor of the university.  Did I mention it guys that these students are from Kenyatta University in Kenya?  So at the exhibition, the Vice Chancellor was there and the Minister for Industrialization was there.  I mean, all that is left now is just for the certification and the approval from government and then they can go ahead and start producing, guys.  And according to the report, as of now, there are about 259 functional units of ventilators in the country.  But we all know that this pandemic is ravaging.  But thank goodness that the spread on the continent is not as rapid or not as geometric as it has been in other parts of the world.  So far, our resources and our expertise are doing well in containing the spread of the pandemic, but there's need for us to have equipment on standby.  So about 259 of these ventilators are functional in the country, but by 140 are being used right now, so there's need for more.  Guys, while I didn't stop there, another two member team of Kenyans came together and produced a prototype of a ventilator again.  And you know the good thing or the cool thing about this one they produced is the fact that it can be used in any part of the country because it uses car battery. ",

            "text": "My name is Paul Kariuki Kamau.  My friend and I have assembled the first prototype ventilator made from an amber bag.  As you can see here, it is operated by a DC battery, 12 volts, and a wiper motor.  As you can see here, it's made by Karioki Kamau and Samuel Cairo.  You can find us on Facebook.  You can find Samuel Cairo.  You can find me in the name of Karioki Kamau Karioki.  Now our ventilator is operated by these switches.  This is a relay.  These are the switches to operate the motor.  This is a wiper motor.  Very strong, very durable and runs for a very long time without burning.  It can run for months or even a year continuously.  So this is the battery that is operating the ventilator.  Well, so inside here we have the bag.  Here, this is the bag.  Inside there, there is a piston and a crankshaft that will press the bag.  We have made a plunger that will press the bag and make it produce the air that is needed.  On this side we have the other side of the bag.  This is the reservoir.  It has its own compartment.  Now I will operate it to show how it is working.  That is the first switch.  The battery current is low so it won't operate with the first pull.  But there is the second pull.  that is what will operate the the wiper motor.  as you can see inside here there is a piston going down and pressing the bag down below.  this is the inside light that is used to illuminate the bag as you can see here.  on this side you can see through this.  through this window you can see the how the motor is operating.  the piston is pushing a plunger which is pressing the back and producing air.  on this side the volume of air is stable and the motor can be regulated.  you can increase speed as you wish.  these are three speed motor you can increase.  you can also put a timer which you can an intermittent timer so that you can have a delay period between breath.  We are trying to mimic the human lungs, but it's here to be approved by a medical technician or other doctor.  So we are just dealing with the mechanical, but we invite the doctors to approve it.  first locally assembled ventilator in Kenya.  Today is 31st March, April 2nd 2020.  We have finished building the first locally assembled ventilator.  as you can see it is assembled with locally available materials so after it is approved we'll be able to produce more.  but now we want to be producing them this way.  we will be making them with using 3d printing the materials and all that is mass produced.  So, in fighting this virus, coronavirus, COVID-19, we have to be inventive because currently the world is facing a shortage of ventilators.  And before we get overwhelmed by this virus, we must make ventilators.  So, this is the first locally assembled ventilator made by Mau Kayu to Kamau and Samuel Kairo in Vika, Kenya.  Thank you.  Through our concept, it shows that something that is in theory can actually work practically.  And once that thing is working practically, you can now include it and leverage your technology.  As you know, one of the things that is causing a lot of death is when someone is attacked by a new virus.  From a virus, some people are developing very severe symptoms.  That's why the virus is called Severe Arthritis Respiratory Syndrome.  So you can't breathe.  And because you can't breathe, you need oxygen.  are ventilators.  Ventilators that are off the shelf are very expensive, costing $30,000, $50,000 or the equivalent of 3 million shillings to 5 million shillings.  Low-end, 3 million, high-end, 5 million.  Now, I contacted my friend, to come up with something we call Super Content. ",

But before we make something en masse, we have to make one small item, one small sample, and make a lot of mistakes on that small sample, so that we don't duplicate our mistakes with thousands of copies.  We also needed to know exactly how we can be able to source the parts.  This ventilator has very many parts that need to be assembled.  Some of them are good.  Some of the prices of some of these parts are going up, and other parts now are going up in cost.  So we cannot use this route.  make this ventilator.  We have to go hyper.  We have to use 3D printing.  With 3D printing, we will be able to produce something that is of one standard, and that is going to be approved by the government and the Ministry of Health, such that we can be able to run and produce ventilators a hundred per day, a thousand per day, as needed.  Because we now understand the mechanism.  So as we launch this product, this is a prototype.  This is not supposed to be used in a live scenario.  It's supposed to show that it's working mechanics.  We are now going to go high-tech and we produce working copies.  To do this, we need to print them in 3D.  And we're not going to use cardboard or glasses or plastic shooting or... The improvisation that you can see here we have done.  We have done a lot of improvisation because we wanted to use locally available materials such that we get off the ground.  We don't want to be stuck in a library tower where we are not doing anything because we don't have an expensive 3D printer that costs millions of shillings.  So with this prototype I think we can now go higher because we have already understood the concept.  And this thing will be able to help save Kenyans' lives.  That's all for now. ",

Those of you who have been looking to do business in Africa for a long time now, this is the opportunity for you to grab.  What are you waiting for?
