            "text": "Hey everyone.  I'm sure that most of you are probably familiar with the children's folk tale, The Emperor's New Clothes.  But for the few of you that have never heard about this story before, I'll just offer a brief summary because I think that it perfectly encapsulates the deceitful situation that America seems to be collectively indulging in at the moment.  Two swindlers arrive at the capital city of an emperor who spends lavishly on clothing at the expense of state matters.  Posing as weavers, they offer to supply him with magnificent clothes that are invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent.  The emperor hires them and they set up looms and go to work.  A succession of officials and then the emperor himself visit them to check their progress.  Each sees that the looms are empty, but pretends otherwise to avoid being thought a fool.  Finally, the weavers report that the emperor's suit is finished.  They mime dressing him and he sets off in a procession before the whole city.  The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all.  The people then realize that everyone has been fooled.  Although startled, the emperor continues the procession, walking more proudly than ever.  The reason that this story perfectly encapsulates the current state of America is because millions of Americans seem to recognize that the narrative that the left is peddling is false, that it's riddled with colossal lies.  However, despite the fact that these lies are inflicting indescribable damage on our country, many of us are choosing to keep silent or even to publicly agree with the lies out of fear of societal backlash, shaming, and cancel culture.  The coronavirus is a deadly global threat, we're told.  People aren't allowed to open their businesses in order to pay their rent and to put food on the table for themselves and their families.  They can't attend the funerals or weddings of their loved ones.  and they can't visit their sick loved ones in the hospital either.  But meanwhile, Black Lives Matter and Antifa are given free reign to take to the streets by the thousands. ",
