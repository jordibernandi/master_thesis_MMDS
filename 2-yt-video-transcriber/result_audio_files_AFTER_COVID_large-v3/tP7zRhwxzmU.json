Welcome to Let's Break It Down, where we go behind the scenes at the White House to reveal how presidential events are planned, choreographed, and executed to prevent things from going terribly wrong.  I'm Alyssa Mastromonaco, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Barack Obama.  Joining me today, my buddy, my pal, Dan Pfeiffer, former senior advisor to President Barack Obama for Strategy and Communications.  My first guest of 2021.  My heart is full.  My outline is long.  Inaugurations.  They are known for their pomp, their circumstance, their nerd glamour, often with memorable performances.  So outside my favorite part, the logistics of Inauguration Day, it represents the peaceful transition of power between the outgoing administration and the incoming.  For most people, people before this, the most contested election in memory was Bush v. Gore. ",

Lots of folks... may not know St.  John's, it is the place that Donald Trump held the Bible upside down outside of over the summer.  Then the president heads over to the White House for coffee with the Joint Congressional Committee.  It's kind of boring, but they take a very sort of historic photo that you would always recognize with the first family at the North Portico.  At 1130  a.m.,  the vice president is sworn in.  At 1201  p.m.,  the president is sworn in and delivers his address, also at 1201  p.m.,  The the vans and the moving vans are coming in and out of the White House, moving the former first family out and the new first family in and the staff, very important staff like me, start getting sworn in.  After the speech, the newly sworn in president heads into the Capitol to do a signing ceremony.  These are the official cabinet nomination certificates.  Then they go into the inaugural lunch where Barack Obama sat with members of Congress and ate some sort of revolutionary war pudding that none of us could understand the ingredients of.

And the counsel's office was saying that Roberts had stumbled over the oath of office, and it was possible that Obama's legitimacy as president could be challenged because he had not actually taken the correct oath of office.  So John Roberts had to come back over to the White House and we had to do another swearing in.  This was like a belt and suspenders approach to presidential legitimacy.  It was also the first super annoying White House controversy I was involved in because we let we didn't let the reporters in to watch it.  I think we just let some photographers in or we released a photo of it.  And we had barely been there for 24 hours at this point and the White House press corps was already ripped shit at us.  And in fairness, this was probably an error in judgment on our part because we were young and dumb and new and dealing with a constitutional crisis before we located all the available bathrooms in the building.

And I just like went for broke and was like, can we please have Kelly Clarkson sing for?  And POTUS was like, sure, she's great.  And I was like, oh my god.  And then fast forward to the party we will not speak about that night that we actually went to.  Kelly Clarkson was there.  She killed it on the mall.  She did so great at the inauguration.
