            "text": "What's up, Black and White Sports fans?  John Matrix here, and I am back with another video.  All right, folks, we're going back to the world of the NFL.  We all know that the NFL was super duper woke in week one, not NBA level woke, but yet they were still woke.  And this video is really a follow up video to the video I put up about Alejandro Villanueva, who plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Now, the Steelers, in case you don't remember, they had a team vote and they were going to put the names of people that were victims of police brutality or systemic racism.  And actually, they just voted on one person.  And that kid's name was Antoine Rose  Jr.,  who was gunned down by the Pittsburgh police in 2018.  And if you want to see that full video, I'll link it to the cards right now.  And you can actually check out the full video because I actually go into more details about that case.  But however, one thing about Antoine Rose, I will say.  he was involved in a drive by shooting.  He resisted arrest and the cops gunned him down.  OK, now Alejandro Villanueva did not want to have the name of Antoine Rose Jr.  on the back of his helmet.  And now we're finding out that the Pittsburgh Steelers, at least coach Mike Tomlin, knew about this and he respected Villanueva's decision on it.  He was perfectly okay with it.  Roethlisberger said that he didn't know about it, but he was still backing Villanueva's stance on it.  So the team itself really didn't have a problem with Alejandro Villanueva making his choice.  However, though, the mother of Antoine Rose Jr.  absolutely slammed Alejandro Villanueva.  Her name is Michelle Kinney.  OK, so apparently, I guess that the Steelers actually went to her and told them about their decision and a vote and everything.  And she was thinking that across the board, all the players were actually going to put her son's name on the back of their helmet.  And we know that that is not the case.  All the players did except for one, and that is Alejandro Villanueva.  Now, I don't know if the vote was 50-50, 75-25.  I have no idea.  The point is that Antoine Roses  Jr.'s  name was selected.  So I'm assuming that the Steelers actually went to his mother and said, we're going to honor your son and have his name on the back of our helmets.  Now, we know now that Antoine Rose Jr.  was a criminal.  And he was gunned down because he resisted arrest.  He was involved in a drive-by shooting.  He may or may not have actually shot the person in the drive-by shooting, but police found residue on his hands of a gun.  So it seems like he actually did fire a shot.  There's conflicting stories on that, but no matter what, he was actually involved in that, okay?  But Michelle Kinney, this is what she actually had to say about Alejandro Villanueva, and she didn't even use his name, but we know that she actually meant Alejandro Villanueva.  Now, she said this, quote, Let me be very, very clear.  The Pittsburgh Steelers took a team vote.  Obviously, one person didn't like the results, so they chose to do something different.  I have nothing against vets and absolutely appreciate everything they have done and continue to do for us.  But this one person showed us exactly who he is, and obviously he didn't approve of how the vote turned out.  In my opinion, that's for his coach, team, and organization to address, not me.  While he was so busy being negative, what it actually did now force more people to engage in this conversation.  I'm going to use this negative press and negativity to motivate me to hold the Pittsburgh Steelers even more accountable.  Yes, I believe in second chances, but as we all know, I believe in putting in the work, and that's how I base my collaborations.  they came to me as a team organization and I don't care how good of an individual you are.  If you are not a team player, then maybe you are playing for the wrong team.  Close quote.  That is the words of Michelle Kenny.  Obviously she's not a fan of what Alejandro Villanueva decided to do.  And I'm, I don't agree with her on this.  I really, really don't agree with her on this.  Just because the Steelers had a vote, I don't think that any player should be pressured to put the name of somebody on the back of their helmets if they don't support him.  Now, we don't know if Alejandro Villanueva actually believes that the death of Antoine Rose Jr.  was justified or not.  I'm assuming that he doesn't believe that Antoine Rose Jr.  was a stand-up guy.  I'm pretty sure that he probably did his research on this before making a decision.  Now, the name that he did put on his helmet was an Army person.  Actually, he was in the Army.  He was not a veteran.  I was about to say veteran.  But he died in combat.  He died for the country.  He wasn't involved in criminal activity.  Antoine Rose Jr.  was involved in criminal activity.  There's a difference.  If I was Villanueva, I wouldn't have put the name of Antoine Rose Jr.  on my helmet either.  I would much rather put a veteran, somebody that wasn't engaged in criminal activity.  Okay.  Antoine Rose Jr.  was not a victim of systemic racism.  He wanted to engage in criminal activity, and he got taken out.  So let's not try to change the truth about the situation here, okay?  His mother, I get that she lost her son.  So she has an emotional attachment to this.  But if she was to think logically, her son should not have been involved in a drive-by shooting.  He was 100% wrong, and the cop that shot him actually got off.  He's not going to jail or anything like that.  But for her to actually slam Alejandro Villanueva like this, I think it's also completely disrespectful.  But I'm also going to blame the NFL because they opened up the can of worms for this.  They allowed all of this to happen, okay?  They have to know that not all players would be on the same page with the NFL when it came to wokeness, okay?  Now, with other teams, you know, they got the choice to wear a name on the back of the helmet or a different name or no name.  But the Steelers said, we're all going to put the name of this individual on the back of our helmets.  Big mistake right there because not everybody is going to be on board with that.  If you want your players to put the name of somebody that they believe was a victim of systemic racism or police brutality, let that be an individual choice.  Don't make it across the board and say, hey.  You got to put this on the back of your helmet whether you believe it or not.  I don't think that's a good idea.  Not at all.  Now, I don't like seeing any of this stuff going on in the NFL anyway, all the wokeness, because the ratings are getting destroyed.  When we watch the game, we just want to watch the game.  But you know what?  They want to bring enlightenment to the victims of police brutality.  Okay?  So... I guess they're kind of doing a good job on that because if you do the research on the people that they have on the back of their helmets, a lot of these people, probably most of all of them, were not stand up citizens.  I didn't even know who Antoine Rose Jr.  was until yesterday.  When I found out about the name on the decal, I did some research on it, and what do you know?  He was a criminal.  He engaged in criminal activity.  So the NFL, they're trying to raise awareness about victims of police brutality.  They're going at it the wrong way because most all these people that were killed, it was justified killings, okay?  Let's just call it what it is.  But what do you guys think of Antoine Rose's junior's mother, Michelle Kinney, and her take on slamming Alejandro Villanueva for his choice to cover up the name of her son?  I don't like what she said.  I don't like the response to what she said.  You know, just because, you know, he plays for the Steelers.  Doesn't mean that he has to believe in everything that they voted for.  He can make his own decision.  You know, she's talking about being a team player.  I'm pretty sure, at least I hope anyway, that she told her son that he should not be engaging in drive-by shooting.  But he did it anyway.  And now he lost his life.  But that's just my thoughts on this.  What do you guys think of this, black and white sports fans?  Alejandro Villanueva being slammed by the mother of Antoine Rose Jr.  Let us know what you think about all this in the comments.
