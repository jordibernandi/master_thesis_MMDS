            "text": "Okay, guys, this is a special Live in Israel.  And I hope you can hear me, because it was like a lot of wind last time we tried to have this conversation about Zion in 1099.  So what's happening here now, you can see why we named this, or did we name it, Pelay?  1099.  This is part two of 1099.  And you can see the last group.  Come on back here.  The last group.  artifacts that were found here.  You see what it says?  Early Arabic.  So this is where it's happening.  So let's start on and try to understand where we're at.  This is Mount Zion, and it tells you here, the fortress from the time of the kingdom of Judah.  But it starts here, what is called the Iron Age.  Now let's go to the scriptures here, so you can get a little bit, let's go through it.  In Daniels here, it makes mention of the kingdoms.  So now here, it talks about the Iron Age, and that connects you to the Babylonian Empire, in the area of the Iron Age.  You see, so now here, then it goes off into where it says the Persian Empire.  Then the Hellenistic, they call it here, or Greek Empire.  Then we have the Roman Empire.  And then when we get to the point where it talks about the Byzantine, early Arab, it talks about the feet, the toes.  Now in this area of the toast, it says the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.  So in that area of what happens, that's where the history goes off into.  Now get a little closer here, Black.  That's where the history goes off into 1099, where it talks about how Hadrian here had started talking about the Roman emperor.  He wanted to, he renamed Jerusalem Elea Capitulona.  You see, so that's where the renaming came in at.  And how they wanted to, it says, the Jews recaptured Jerusalem in 132.  And out of Rome, the emperor Hadrian drove them out three years later.  Hadrian tried to end all, here they have Jewish hope, of regaining Jerusalem.  He renamed the city Elea Capitulona.  You know what I'm saying?  So this was a part of his plan.  He said he'd prohibit Jews from visiting and living in the city.  You see what I'm saying?  So this is where he, this is his whole thing.  So his whole concept.  here, and I went through this before in videos, where he tried to, it says the Holy Rite, it talks about how the Jews wanted to return to Mount Zion.  And here it says, but the 200-year ban against the Jews from visiting the city was enforced.  So for 200 years, they didn't have no Hebrews, no Jews able to come to this place.  So they wiped out the memory.  But what ends up happening then, it says here, that by the year 200, the ban, okay, it says by the year 200, by the ban, okay, by 200, the Jews from Virginia City no longer was enforced.  During the 300, Emperor Constantine the Great made Christianity illegal, the Roman Empire.  He rebuilt the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and gave the city its old name.  So that's when Constantine came and gave Bethel It's old name.  So that's where, so they banned people from coming to Zion.  They changed the name of the city.  And then they gave Constantine his old name.  You follow me?  Then they gave, Constantine gave that Jerusalem.  which was Jerusalem, and was Melchizedek Jerusalem.  So what ends up happening here, then?  this is where you get to what they call the Muslim time, where the Muslims came in and they took the city.  So now it said during the 1600s.  So when the Muslims came in, now we have a documentation here that we rarely see, but let's go back here.  This is Jerusalem when the Romans came in.  You see what I'm saying?  So this is when he destroyed the city.  and then the, and change it to Eleocapitalona.  And then right here, well it, Masada.  There's a secret route from the gate of Zion.  This is the gate of Zion here.  And that would take you right down here.  And you would go right down to Masada.  And everybody would know about what happened at Masada and how the Romans eventually destroyed them.  You see what I'm saying?  This is the route here.  This is the route that came up from the sea.  And then this is the route here that takes you down to Masada.  So that's giving you a reference to give you an understanding.  This is the safer gate or the silver gate that they was originally attacking.  This is the main point of where they attacked with the Romans.  And then, but then they had another army coming up toward the sea.  And as they had this army attacking here, they had this army attacking here.  Then the army that escaped down to Masada went out this way.  down to Masada.  but let's get better.  but then let's get back to this point of after it was destroyed.  what ended up happening was that what ended up happening.  Hadrian changed the name of the city and then here you have the Shumanim account and they make the statement here the high priest.  he said Elia was a village near Jerusalem You know, which was left after the destruction of the city.  You see, so they identified, of course, they said it was a village near Jerusalem.  You see, so in going back to this map here, all of this here that was destroyed, this here is Zion right here.  And they considered this Zion where we stand right here was a village here or area in Jerusalem.  Mount Zion, you see, so on the side of the north.  So this is the account about Eliyahu.  after Constantine had came back and changed that name to Jerusalem, Amorite Jerusalem, which is still named to today.  The Shumanim had identified the actual Jerusalem as surviving the destruction.  And as you can see here, they tell you that from the Romans that came here, That it survived the destruction.  This is the part here.  This is the time period of the, again, that the human beings were speaking of.  You see.  So now let's get a little bit more understanding.  of who built, who buried Zion.  So then what ended up happening here, we had the Arabs, again, it got here, this other account, talk about Hadrian ordered the exploration of the circumcised area of Capitoline, and talk about how Constantine 200 years later came and renamed that city Christian Jerusalem.  But then here it goes off into the fall of Jerusalem, to the Muslims.  So, from the time that the Christians, the Romans, they took over.  This is when the Prophet Muhammad, after he had died, his servants came in and they... You see what I'm saying?  And here is a Muslim account.  This is a Muslim account.  The agreement that was made between the Arabs and the Christians of how not to... again to remain in this scene.  You see?  So this is the second account.  They wasn't referring to here in Arabic.  They wasn't referring to the place they called Jerusalem.  Here they said Aliyah.  So they're referring to right here to where we're standing at right now.  You see?  So none of that, so all of that took place.  Like this chart here.  All of that took place until we get to the point of what they call the first Crusade, 1099.  Crusaders came to Jerusalem and established the Latin Kingdom.  So that's where that 1099, come on over here, Clyde, and you can see here the what?  1099, you see.  So that's the last thing that was, last time this city was seen before the Christians and the Arabs came together.  And buried the city.  Now this is the actual account.  Here.  Saying what happened at that time.  And this is the thing that we was.  This is the information we was given.  Before.  I hope everybody can hear it.  And understand it.  Okay, so the moon actually disappeared from the sky.  So a lot of the people that sit back and ask me about Hoshua, what about that Mount Zion?  It's God's show.  When they buried this place, there was earthquakes as they were burying it.  For the years that they were here, they buried it.  It says here, these nine years as they buried the city, the real Mount Zion, volcano eruptions occurred around the world, releasing towers of clouds of ash traveled worldwide.  And that ash, according to the scientists, that occurred in 1109 to 1110. that the moon and the sky had disappeared.  So the Mosai showed his anger to the whole world.  And most people didn't understand, the scientists and all the people in the world, they didn't understand what the Edomites had done when they actually came here and buried the city.  The Edomites came together.  Under what is called the Secret Combination.  And they came together and they actually buried the city of Mount Zion.  This is a map here.  Let's show you here.  Let's show you a little bit more.  This is a map here of the place they call Jerusalem.  And this is the map for, it's 1250 right here.  It's a 1250 map and it got Jerusalem the center of the earth.  Here go another map here now.  with Elea Capitulona in 1532.  And you see Elea.  So they were still calling this place Elea while they was calling that place Jerusalem.  And you can see this place here is surrounded by mountains according to the scripture.  And you can see Masada is right there.  You see, which is Masada is right down at the bottom of this hill.  You see, but this here is, look, this here is how they had the whole place buried.  They had buried the whole place.  The archeologists didn't come and find Zion or dig it up.  It had all the most high uncovered Zion.  The most high uncovered Zion.  The hill that they buried it under, that every year the water would deteriorate, the water from the rain, Uncovered Mount Zion.  You see, and so then these are the last, so this is the archaeological record.  How they found Hebrew artifacts here, Aramaic artifacts, that was the Babylonian.  Then you have the Greek, the Arabic, and the last thing that they found here, as we showed you, was in 1099.  And this is the Arabic artifacts that they have here, identified as the house of Allah.  You see, so now at this point, what happened?  What happened?  You see, who buried the city?  You see, and what happened, it was the secret combination.  It was the secret combination.  What happened is that the people, these people here, and they identified who did it.  This is the name.  Read the name out loud for them for life.  Hugo is the master of the Templar Order.  You see, they call him Hugo.  And he's the master of the Templar Order.  And so what happened was, is that, is that, so the, so the, the Masons of the Order of the Assassins, And this is the apps that came together.  And they called them the Templars.  Now look at the final years of the.  what?  The Assassins.  This was the Assassins.  You see what it says there?  1099.  And they talk about what?  The Assassins.  The Order of the Assassins.  You see that?  and they helped to bury this city.  And let's get specific when we start talking about these assassins.  So you again, let's zoom ahead over here and show you a map of Mount Zion.  Let's try to give you guys an understanding, because all this is to give you an understanding, 1099, of who buried the house of the Most High.  And it was these so-called Templars that came together with the Arabic assassins, and they were in agreement with each other to bury Zion, to keep Zion from the world, and nobody want to mess with it.  Okay, yeah.  Okay, so see here.  You can see a map here where we at.  We at Zion.  And this here is Mount Moriah, which is right over there, the Valley of Becca.  So what's happening here, so it's a place of difference between the temple.  Because the Moshe, I say he's going to return unto Zion.  And upon Mount Zion, that's where he's going to rule from.  So why would, why these Masons, these Templars, these assassins?  Okay, but like, so what's happening is that, so we are shown here how the, how the, how the, how the, how the, uh, Sonic Order, and they use these symbols here.  These are all the symbols.  And in the black community, here, which was supposed to represent this order of assassins in America, among our people.  Here you have the two wings, or the two-headed serpent here, and you can see you have four presidents.  that was a part of this, and this is supposed to be all the eastern wing, you know, Tunis, you know, some say Ararat, Islam, you see this is supposed to be the western wing, so these represented the two groups of the leaderships.  now, at this time, that represented the two factions.  You see, so that title is dealing with the Mason order.  And we have that among our people and been up for years.  So now I think it's interesting that as I'm talking about reparations, that we have a Grand Master.  Jay steps up.  And goes down to Georgia to deal with the clan.  You see.  And everybody's trying to understand where did he come from.  Well, he's identified himself as a part of the order of what the Bible called the secret combination.  And that's that secret combination that the scripture goes off into.  That the scripture goes off into.  Oh.  find a reference to the combination.  And when they first started, you see.  So keep it, be there to seepa. ",
