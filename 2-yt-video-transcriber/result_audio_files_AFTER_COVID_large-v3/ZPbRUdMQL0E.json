A country that you think about so little that you didn't even notice that that's not Uruguay.  This is Uruguay.  Nebraska.  A state you think about so little.  you didn't even realize that's not Nebraska.  This is Nebraska.  Come on, it's your country.  That's not okay.  Bolivia.  country you think about so little, you haven't even realized that's not Bolivia, this is Bolivia.  Actually, actually, that's still not Bolivia, this is Bolivia.  Or is it?  Or is it?  This game is never not going to be fun.  Venezuela.  A country you think about so little, you didn't even realize that's not Venezuela.  This is Venezuela.  Actually, that's not Venezuela either.  This is Venezuela.  Except it isn't, because Venezuela was the first one all along.  But the fact you didn't notice is the point.  To Guatemala.  A country you think about so little, we're just going to leave up a map of Central America and make you look up which one it is.  Crack a book.  I'm not here to spoon-feed you.  watch Guatemala.  Panama.  A country you think about so little, you don't realize that's not Panama, that's the outline of a Scotty dog.  This is Panama.  Azerbaijan.  A country you think about so little, you didn't even realize that not only is that not Azerbaijan, it's not even a landmass, it's the Caspian Sea.  This is Azerbaijan.  I don't know when I'm gonna get tired of this game, but it's definitely not now.  That's our show.  Thanks for watching.  See you next week.  Goodnight. ",
