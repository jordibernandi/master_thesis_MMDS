I looked at this as a huge opportunity to talk about the wounds and culture of disrespect between Black men and Black women.  And I want everyone to know that I invited Snoop to the table, and I also invited Gayle King to the table.  Gayle King has an open invite for whenever she wants to come.  First of all, this is great because, you know, you and I have been around for a long time.  And along the way, I've had a bit of a complicated relationship, you know, with you from afar.  You can understand that.  But there's two times in your career where I really... I just had to cheer for you. ",

For example... him saying that we watch kobe grow into this.  you know upstanding man father and things of that nature.  i talk about that on my patreon account.  things are not what it seems but i'm not going there right now.  um however but in terms of um the other part that i can't air in here because it'd be a very long video um where he said that he had to go back to saying you know bees and hoes because be to be blunt because it was making him money, even though he made a whole gospel album and no one even bought it.  So he had to go back to that because they, that's what they're used to.  So he basically was saying that he's trying to learn how to separate that from himself.  How can you separate that?  Can you separate from your job to, um, who you are as a person?  Do you have to be what your job is?  Are you that person or you're something else?  And when I thought of that, there are a lot of celebrities who put up the stigma of being a strong and upholding individual and in their lyrics and things of that nature, but they're not like that in real life and vice versa.  And I thought that was a really bell thing.  A lot of bells went off.  I'm like, yeah, he he got a point.  You can see his journey like.  he's not what he's he used to be.  But he that's what people identify him as.  And sometimes you can get lost in that little stigma that people identify you as when you're not that person anymore.  And when you try to be your true self, they're not trying to see it.  You can see it with Kanye West.  He's.  changing but people are used to him being the old Kanye not the Kanye that went through his relapse and realization and mental breakdown and things of that nature.  the old Kanye but he's not that anymore.  so it works for certain people and it doesn't work for other people.  but that's what I got out of.  in terms of the Kobe Bryant situation um well I agree with him.  I mean there is a way to say it.  um with the girl thing.  in terms of jada pickett saying that she felt like he was attacking her as a black woman and things of that nature i didn't quite understand what she was saying.  i slightly understood what she was saying.  and um i think it's different from gail you know being able to ask that question and getting crucified on social media and black men being attacked.  i said that already they are but in terms of their rape case with kobe if gail was attacked just by asking about it imagine if this victim and it has been proven that you know she was a victim she was not lying.  they have dna evidence and everything all that but but it's very difficult to get invited.

So, although there are several reports saying, and, um, I should have added this with the last, uh, take, but I did this really late and I was very tired.  So I kind of just rambled, you know, along there.  Sorry if I offended anyone, because I know this is a very, very sensitive subject when it comes to Kobe Bryant.  You can't say... certain things and they review every single video that comes out well depending on the channel.  some channels are so neutral they don't even bother reviewing anymore.  but anyway i am going to say this is what i wanted to say although there has been reports of um her she may have not wanted it.  she may not wanted it but um it seemed that it may have been consensual.  she say it wasn't consensual but there were other DNAs that were found in her underwear.  I never found that one initially came out at that time.  when I Reviewed it at that time because I was around at that time when I initially looked at the report I didn't see other DNA.  they were found in her underwear.  Those were reports that came out later.  I do know Kobe wanted to get a lie detector test, but his lawyer told him not to and I'm not sure why.  It was like, I don't think a lie detector test would be good.  So he didn't take the lie detector test, but she never said that she was consensual with the thing.  But other people are saying, reports are saying that she had other partners and apparently... five or six.  The number goes up and down.  One moment I heard it was another person's DNA, just one other person.  And then I read in part it was three.  And then another part it was five.  So I don't really know.  But people are saying it was consensual.  She asked for that particular way of they were doing, you know.  So I guess the marks on her neck and the bruises on her body was given.  She wanted it that way, I guess.  I didn't even know a woman did that until I spoke to my sister.  I like kink, but I don't like it like that.  But different strokes with different folks.  So I apologize if I offended anyone, if it was consensual and she complied with it.  He did not force anything upon her.  I don't really know.  The reports are inconclusive.  And right now it's up in the air and that was in the past.  And we should not bring it up anymore.  And I can understand the man is dead and gone.  May he rest in peace, him and his daughter.  My condolences.  That's what I got in this situation.  This is a really good interview.  I see that Snoop Dogg has grown.  But you can never tell these days.  I mean, I have followed his social media and I have followed him as well.  We don't know what's real.  We don't know what's fake.  But the only thing we can do is just pay attention and keep our eyes open and don't fall for the foolery.  Good luck to you all.  And don't forget to subscribe, like, and share.
