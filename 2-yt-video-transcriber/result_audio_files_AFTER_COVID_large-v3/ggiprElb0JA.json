If black Americans are not insulted by the fact that Joe Biden, who has been hiding in his basement, you know, for the entire year, made an appearance and came up because he was going to do an interview with Cardi B. Do we have nothing better to offer?  It is demeaning.  It is pandering.  It is ridiculous, okay?  And she asked pointedly ridiculous questions.  I want lower taxes, but I want universal health care for all.  She had no idea what she was doing, and yet both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden made the time to sit with her because they believe black people are stupid. ",

It's very enlightening.  Cardi B then responded with this follow-up, and I swear this is not a joke.  This is the actual video.  She has since deleted it, but I saw it with my own eyes.  This was it.

If the Democrats realized how much entertainment they've been providing us over the last four years, they would probably stay off social media.  But thankfully, they don't get that.  they are the joke.  Like this person who posted a picture of a display that they came across inside a Hobby Lobby, where obviously a Trump supporter rearranged the decorative letters that they sell to spell out USA Vote Trump.  The picture caused Democrats to tweet about it so much that Boycott Hobby Lobby began trending and now made headlines across the country.  Democrats are always getting upset at what they see on Twitter, but nothing works better than getting retweeted by President Trump, like he did to me, again.  Apparently he liked my analysis of the ongoing Black Lives Matter madness, this time over in Pittsburgh, and it included my mockery of their imaginary racism.  In other news, President Trump has started up his long-awaited rallies again, and the liberal media is upset about it.  The Hill reported that Trump and his supporters gathered without masks in North Carolina despite a request from the local GOP and included this photo of him stepping on the stage where you can see that every single person is wearing a mask except for maybe one.  He pointed out that the Democrat Party and the liberal media industrial complex have no problem with the Black Lives Matter protesters violating social distancing policies and not wearing masks because they're just peaceful protesters.  So he has decided to designate all of his campaign rallies peaceful protests.  So we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests.  It is a peaceful protest, sir, and so is wearing my new Dare to Re-elect Trump shirt.  Or if that's not your style, pick up an America First shirt, a Trump is building the wall shirt, or any of my awesome designs.  All available in a t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, and a whole bunch of different colors as well.  So head on over to MarkDyce.com or click the link in the description below and check them out.
