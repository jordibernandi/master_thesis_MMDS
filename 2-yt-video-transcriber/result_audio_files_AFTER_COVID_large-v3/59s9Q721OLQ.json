            "text": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Breidhop and this is my grandmother Annabelle Jardy.  Here today we have the SinoHeart blood pressure monitor, electronic blood pressure monitor.  We're going to check this out today and we're going to compare it with another blood pressure monitor and see if the results are similar.  Not all blood pressure monitors are the same, so you're not going to see usually exactly the same, but we'll see how this goes.  Now, checking your blood pressure can be a lot more important than your doctors and other people say it is.  If you really want to know, talk to somebody who's been experienced in a first responder or EMT for many, many years and ask them what it means and how important it is to check your blood pressure.  Because when someone sees someone going through something in real time, their understanding of blood pressure and how it affects you can be different than a doctor's understanding.  Now, what's really cool with this... is that it comes with four AA batteries, at least that's what it says.  So we're going to see if that's true.  If not, I'll find some of my own and we will try this out.  All right, so to install our batteries, we're just going to open the back cover like this and we will insert all four batteries.  When your blood pressure's off, even a little bit, it can affect your mood, your health, all kinds of things in dramatic ways, especially if you're older.  All right, so it's got this diagram on here that shows that one end goes towards the elbow and the other goes towards your shoulder.  So that makes it pretty easy.  All right, so take an arm, stick it in here.  I might have to loosen it up a little more.  And I like to go right over the shirt.  And the reason is because otherwise we've got to take the shirt off every single time we check blood pressure.  And I find that this works just fine as long as there's only one shirt on.  Get it tight enough.  And then what you're supposed to do is make sure that this part where the cord is goes right over the artery, so on the inside of the arm there.  and it's crooked, so we gotta make sure it's square.  Wanna try to make sure it's square here.  Now, I will notice that this blood pressure cuff is a little bit smaller, but that is actually good, because my grandma's got a smaller arm, so that works really well.  So we go ahead and hit start on here, and we'll let you see it.  I don't know if this has a light built into it or anything like that, but here it goes.  It says to press zero and do not talk until the measurement is complete.  Well, I'm talking.  I guess the person that's getting tested shouldn't talk.  We'll see.  So, here we go.  Now, I can see already that the numbers on this screen are big, they're clear, they're easy to read.  It's got some sort of a sound thing going on. ",

                "name": "Speaker 0"
            }
        },
        {
            "start_time": "00:03:12,680",
            "end_time": "00:03:23,640",
            "text": "130 millimeters of mercury.  Diastolic pressure was 53 millimeters of mercury. ",
            "speaker": {
                "name": "Speaker 1"
            }
        },
        {
            "start_time": "00:03:29,620",
            "end_time": "00:03:32,140",
            "text": "So we're measuring by mercury, apparently.  Mercury is standard.  I didn't know that.  So 130 over 53 for her is a little bit high.  Usually, you know, 120 over 53 works.  And so the doctor told us that the thing to do if you want to lower blood pressure is drink more water.  And it works every time.  So now we're going to do that.  We want to make sure the test is the same on our current blood pressure.  I also love that you can hear it like that.  That's really cool.  Okay, so for settings in here, we can set one or two users, which is what you expect from a blood pressure machine.  You can set the date and the time.  So now we're going to try this Vive Precision blood pressure machine, much bigger.  And it has a lit screen, but it doesn't talk like the other one.  And I think the displays, as far as I can tell, the numbers are about the same size on the screens.  So this one's just harder to carry around.  But we're going to go ahead and give this one a try and see if it matches the other one.  And grandma's being so good for us today.  She's being so patient with me here.  Look at that.  All right, let's turn this on and see what it says.  Okay, so this one is saying pretty much the same thing.  It's saying 132 over 61, so it's reading a little higher.  And, of course, the screen's lit up.  It's easier to see.  But that light does use power.  Okay, it's a bigger screen.  The light uses power.  And this one only uses AAA batteries, four AAA batteries.  So your battery time in this one probably is not going to last near as long as this one has a smaller screen, no backlight, and of course you can hear it tells you what to do.  So that's pretty cool.  As far as this one, the only things I could think of to improve on it would be that this thing maybe seats just a little more firmly in there so you don't have to worry about it so much.  But if you're not moving while you're checking your blood pressure, that's not going to be a problem.  It is really easy to remove and insert, whereas this one is much harder to insert.  But it's great to include the instructions, and that it has a port for running it off of power.  I really like this one.  If I had to take one of these two in the car with me, I think I'd want to take this one, because I can hear what it's saying, and it's smaller, it's more compact, it's going to fit easier.  Now, as far as which one of these is heavier, this one... versus this one, I think they're about the same, even though this one's bigger.  So, and again, I think that the display size, I'll go ahead and hit memory on each one of these.  This is what it was when we did it just a minute ago.  I just changed the memory on this one.  There it is, and you can see side by side that the text on the screen is about the same size between the two of these.  So again, this one's going to be smaller, easier to carry around, and the text on the screen is fine to read.  I mean, it's as far as the same size, and you can hear it as well.  So even if you can't see it, maybe you don't have your glasses on or whatever, you can still hear it.  So, that's great.  If you had your doctor on the phone or in some sort of a conference meeting or whatever and they're doing you over the phone, the doctor could hear what this thing is saying as well.  if the doctor cares about your blood pressure.  Some doctors think that blood pressure is a very minimal thing.  I will tell you really quick that if you have low blood pressure, it can cause problems.  If you have high blood pressure, it can cause problems.  If your blood pressure is low, some people use salt or magnesium to raise it.  Salt seems to raise it quickly.  Magnesium seems to take some time.  The biggest problem is once you raise blood pressure, it's harder to bring it back down by getting stuff out of your system by drinking water.  It seems like a little bit low is easier than a little bit high.  Throughout the day, a lot of people, their blood pressure continues to rise throughout the day.  That means in the morning, if it's just a little bit low, you might want to leave it alone.  And then throughout the day, as it gets higher, then you might want to drink more water.  Of course, you want to drink water in the morning anyway.  But you might want to drink more water, more tea, things that don't have salt in it, and hopefully no caffeine, you know, decaffeinated.  And then hopefully that'll flatten that out.  you know to the end of the day and then you go to bed and of course you might have all kinds of medications and pills that also affect your blood pressure and how much you retain water and that's the reason salt raises blood pressure is because it helps you retain water whereas when you're drinking water it flushes out the salt and that lowers blood pressure.  I'm not sure why magnesium raises blood pressure.  I know that your heart needs magnesium and your muscles need magnesium in order to work.  somebody told me.  they said just to be careful with magnesium.  they said people die and have heart attacks from taking magnesium.  you take magnesium to raise blood pressure.  that's great but over time as it builds up in the body your blood pressure can just go higher and higher and higher and so like with grandma here what I got to do with magnesium.  I got to pay attention to all their supplements all their pills and see if they contain any magnesium to begin with and that will depend upon how much I can give her because if her blood pressure starts getting high or in the morning or whatever, and in the evening, then I'm not giving her any additional salt or anything like that, then I got to cut back on that magnesium.  And like I said, these are important things to know.  I really don't want to step on anybody's toes, but I want to explain to you if you're watching this video, just so you know, you know, when you go into a hospital, they don't give you everything you need sometimes.  They don't give you your stomach medicine that keeps you from throwing up.  They say, oh, well, your throat will just clean it up, you know.  I've heard that before.  Or, you know, for example, they won't let you have your supplements.  They won't let you have what you need.  So you're going to be cranky.  You're going to have problems and, you know, you're not going to be healthy.  And it seems like the goal of the hospital's policies and nursing homes and things like that is just to keep you alive without liability.  So they're giving you things that they're going to be liable for.  But nothing more than that.  And so your life, I mean, your life can be cut back dramatically in a hospital from the stress, being in a confined space, being in a small room where you can't leave.  And if you do, they're going to stick you with a needle.  It's, you know, going to put you out.  It's a scary experience.  Okay.  It can stress you out, it can cause all kinds of medical problems.  There's nobody there to make sure you eat your food, that you eat your meals.  When you're living with somebody else, you cook better for yourself, you cook better for them.  When you're on your own, you might neglect yourself and you're not going to make yourself eat.  The thing is that if you're in a hospital, they bring you your food, it doesn't mean that the person that's getting the food is going to eat the food and they only have a certain amount of time and they have to take it away.  So, you know, proper nutrition, sleep is good at home.  It's really good at home.  It's good to stay at home.  You just, you need to watch out.  You got to be careful.  I think, you know, the most time you can spend out of a hospital, the better.  When I go into a doctor's office or hospital and have them test me to find out what's going on, they say everything's perfect.  Your body, everything is perfect.  You're not deficient in anything.  So, yeah.  you know, drink water.  But thanks so much for watching the video.  May God bless you, your family, your business, and all God has for you to do. ",
