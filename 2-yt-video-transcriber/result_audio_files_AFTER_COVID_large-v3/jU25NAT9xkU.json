He said Forbes magazine was out to get him because Forbes magazine said about a week ago that Donald Trump was not a billionaire.  but it was only worth $500 million.

She said she will not be going to the opening of the new Taj Mahal.  Donald Trump said he thought That would be unnecessary publicity.  He said that at a nationally televised news conference.  he called earlier today to announce that.  Don't worry about Jennifer Flowers.  She got a new job.  She got fired, you know.
