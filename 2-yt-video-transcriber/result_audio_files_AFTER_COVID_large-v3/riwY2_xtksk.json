The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is extremely grateful that you and your household has decided to participate in our trial.  Halloween is our favorite holiday.  There are so many little lab rats running around.  We are excited to present children with the greatest Halloween candy of all.  Survival.  That's right.  We've got the juice, baby.  We've worked long and hard several weeks on this experimental vaccine, and we are super excited about it.  Now you're saying maybe the children get a little nervous.  Kids don't like needles.  Well, that's true.  Just like there are tricks to get children to eat their vegetables, there are tricks to get them to be responsible citizens.  I'm going to show you one right now.  So look at this.  It's a bowl of candy.  Is it?  Or is it the end of COVID?  That's right, kids.  Just put your little paws in there and grab all you can.  Bill and Melinda are so excited about the future that they couldn't be here today.  They're in an undisclosed location preparing to go to space.  But they have left you in good hands.  Here at the Gates Foundation, we realize that some of you are so excited about the future, we're going to have to put you in restraints.  But we'll do that for you. ",
