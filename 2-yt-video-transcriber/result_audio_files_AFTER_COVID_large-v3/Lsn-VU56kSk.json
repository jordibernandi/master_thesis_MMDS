The standard of beauty always revolved around being white.  And in order to survive in this society, from my eyes, It looked like black women, a few, were trying to embrace that narrative, to see what it's like to be a woman, if you will.  But I didn't know, so I wanted to ask the question.  And the only way I can get that question answered was to ask them. ",

For me to better understand diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, I have to start somewhere.  Even with all that I think that I know, I realize that there's so much more that I do not know.  As an emergent technologist, when we talk about extending reality, it's critically important for us.  If we're going to extend reality, then we must bring reality with it.  And so to do that, we need to do more listening and to have a better understanding of exactly where we've been where we are and where we might be headed. ",
