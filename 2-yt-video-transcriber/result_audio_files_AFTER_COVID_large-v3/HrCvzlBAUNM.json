            "text": "Let's start with Book One, The Early Years.  And I'm going to read certain sections here, partly because this is a book that is a book of confessions, confession of sin, confession of faith, confession of praise for God, but it's also meant to be read by other people.  He is confessing before God and this book is in the second person directed to God, but it's also something that he intends other Christians to read.  So it is a confession that is meant to be a public confession heard by other Christians.  You are great, Lord, and highly to be praised.  Great is your power, and your wisdom is immeasurable.  Here he's quoting the Psalms.  Man, a little piece of your creation, desires to praise you, a human being bearing his mortality with him, carrying with him the witness of his sin and the witness that you resist the proud.  Nevertheless, to praise you is the desire of man, a little piece of your creation.  You stir man to take pleasure in praising you, because you've made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.  There are several things that I think are important in that very first paragraph.  Notice it starts out with praise.  You are great, Lord, and greatly to be praised.  That is in the second person, directly addressing God, quoting from the Psalms.  And we get man, a little piece of your creation.  Humanity is itself only a small part of creation.  He is not putting himself or mankind in general at the center of the universe here.  He's saying, look, we're just a small part.  We are just a tiny part.  In Aristotle, the whole idea is that the earth is the center of everything.  Everything revolves around the earth and everything revolves around us.  Indeed, a model of what it is to be a human being, for Aristotle, is something like a sphere rotating on its axis, something that is both fully actual and fully potential at the same time.  That would be an ideal of substance.  God is the highest one of those.  But what's at the very center of the entire universe God creates?  Us and the earth we live on.  That is not Augustine's conception.  Instead, we're a little chunk of creation.  God is immeasurably greater than we are.  Now we carry with us the witness of sin.  And so our sinful character is also front and center here.  Augustine is someone who thinks that we are inherently sinful creatures.  We are not creatures who can be perfected.  That sin is not something that can be removed.  He does not think, with Socrates for example, that education, that knowledge, are the solution to our problems of sin, of weakness of will, of giving in to temptation.  Nor does he think that the solution is to somehow empower reason.  Indeed, he thinks that he has done that, he has devoted himself to study, but on the other hand, that there are plenty of people, plenty of Christians who he recognizes as more devout, more dedicated, a better Christian than he is.  And so Plato's solution won't do either.  Aristotle putting human happiness at the center of things, saying our final end is happiness?  Nonsense.  In fact, he deals with that in the very next section here.  To praise you is the desire of man.  What is our highest good?  What is that ultimate final aim?  That which is always to be sought for its own sake and never for the sake of something else?  It's not human happiness.  It's not the good for man.  No, it is desire of us to praise god to praise you.  he's saying you stir man to take pleasure in praising you.  worshiping god is something that is to be desired for its own sake and not merely for the sake of something else not as a way of earning your way into heaven not because it's good for something because it is something valuable in itself.  You have made us for yourself.  Insofar as we are creatures of God, our ultimate aim is dependent on God.  We can't think of ourselves as apart from the purposes of God.  Think about something simple that's a human artifact, like a pencil.  You can't think about what a pencil is for without reference to its maker.  People make pencils because they're instruments that we can use for writing.  And similarly, God has created us.  You can't understand our purpose apart from God.  And so even if you start from Aristotle's starting point and say, well, some things are desired for the sake of something else and we are to be judged good according to our ability to fulfill our function.  What is our function?  Well, It's rational activity that makes us different.  Augustine would say that's absurd.  That's not what's crucial to us.  What is crucial, think about any other instrument.  To understand what it's for, what its function is, you have to think about who made it and why.  And so similarly here, you have to think who made us and why.  So the answer to the human function, and therefore the ultimate answer to the nature of virtue, if we adopt that Aristotelian starting point, is that we were crafted by God.  We were crafted by God for a purpose, and that purpose includes praising God, worshipping God.  Indeed, our heart is restless until it rests in you.  We cannot be fulfilled.  We cannot fulfill our function except insofar as we seek God.  We've got to seek God.  We've got to praise God.  We've got to worship God.  God is at the very center of our being.  There is, as a Christian song puts it, a God-shaped hole in all of us.  But that leaves out, in a sense, the dynamic aspect.  We fulfill our function by seeking God.  God is the being that made us.  Our function depends on God.  We are for praising God, glorifying God, worshipping God.  And we are restless.  We will not be fulfilled.  We cannot attain even what Aristotle considers happiness apart from God.  Our hearts are restless until they rest in God.  Let's go on to the second paragraph.  Grant me, Lord, to know and. ",
