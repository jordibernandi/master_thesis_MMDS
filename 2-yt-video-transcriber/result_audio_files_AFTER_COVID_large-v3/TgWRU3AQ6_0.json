            "text": "For two weeks YouTube has been blocking and censoring our videos in connection with the video Collateral Murder, which was published by Wikileaks ten years ago.  These videos were published by Wikileaks on the tenth anniversary of the Collateral Murder and contained interviews with award-winning journalists like Jon Pilger and Kristian Raphsen, excerpts from the Collateral Murder video and even statements by victims.  Today we have published a translated version of this video, which was also blocked by YouTube, as soon as the video had exceeded 1,000 calls in two hours.  We upload the video on Vimeo and ask all viewers to share this link not only in all social media, Facebook, Twitter,  etc.,  but also to download it from the WeTransfer links, which we have uploaded in the description of this video, and upload it to YouTube.  Let us strive for one million views.  What is really funny about YouTube is the fact that they do not block videos from the big media, which are published regularly when it comes to the alleged war crimes of states like Russia, Syria and so on.  To give an example, just type in chemical attacks Assad in YouTube and you will find countless videos that were not blocked by YouTube.  That's why we should do everything now to reach a wider audience with these videos.  Thank you for your support. ",
