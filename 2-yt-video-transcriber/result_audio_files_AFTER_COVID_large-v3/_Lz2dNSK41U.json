            "text": "Hello everyone welcome to a new sex toy review and today's product is the Brooke the naughty girl.  4.4 pound TPE perfect female booty adult dolls torso by Tantally.  As you can see this is kind of like a very small torso.  Now it has a lot of detail.  Like a lot of times these TP torsos are very skim on the details.  You can see muscle definition in the abs.  If you see the vagina and the butt, it has a lot of detail.  There's even coloration.  I'm really impressed with the detail work.  Obviously the size is a problem.  Now it has little legs and this is so.  you could stand it up like that.  So it's, you know, it's like, I mean, it's kind of hard to tell from this angle, but it lays flat on the little leg, the leg flats, or you can lay it like this, or you can lay it like this for missionary, it's for whatever.  Now this is 4.4 pounds.  You know, it's small, like you could one hand this.  This is going to be a big turn off for a lot of people because it's smaller than even Celestina who is like Barbie doll skinny.  She's not so skinny that I could like put my fingers around her waist like this.  However, the reason why I got the body pillow Celestina was because I wanted to see, I knew that the images were going to be scaled down, and if this matched more of a body pillow image, and so it would be more appropriate for a body pillow.  But I just want to talk about the product itself before we get into that.  So, you know, this is actually professional premium grade TPE.  You know, the skin, the flesh, it all feels real.  Everything has nice, good weight to it, a good, like, natural feeling to it.  It comes with an absorbing rod.  So these absorbing rods, in case you don't know, now, another thing, there's no removable vagina.  The vagina in this toy is not removable, so this is like a fixed vagina toy.  So, one of the problems with these types of toys, unlike a pocket poster that you could turn inside out, you can't turn these inside out because, I mean, you just, you can't.  There's no way to turn this inside out.  So how do you make sure you get the inside clean?  Well, you rinse it out, and then use an absorbing rod, and you stick it in the hole, and you just let it sit there for a few minutes, and then when you pull it out, it's soaked up all the moisture.  Now, in other news, the butthole and the vagina hole are not connected.  So I've reviewed some other toys in the past where if you go back far enough, the butthole and the vagina hole connect in the back or they go all the way through.  Either of those actually aid tremendously with cleaning.  If the holes are connected, you can just put like a pressure washer in one hole, spray everything out the other hole.  If they go all the way through, you could just run water through one hole and it'll clean out through the other hole.  Because these do not go all the way through and they do not connect, you're going to have to clean the hole, whatever hole you come in individually, and then use an absorbing rod or some type of microfiber rag or some type of sponge or whatever you normally use.  But that's how this works.  Now this is all the way in, so if you want to know how deep this goes, you can see the absorbing rod poking out the end.  So the hole, the channel, goes all the way to the end.  So it's got enough room.  It's not too tight.  Now let me see if you can see inside.  So let's just open that up.  You can see the texture is very natural.  It has a realistic texture.  It's also colored.  Now a lot of dolls, the inside of the vagina, they don't bother coloring it to make it look real.  But they actually went the extra mile and they colored the inside so that it actually looks real.  So it's got a realistic texture, realistic color.  Now obviously the butthole doesn't have a realistic color.  Otherwise it would be brown.  Can I even open the butthole?  Butthole does not wanna open, all right.  The butthole has a realistic texture too, so if you don't know the difference between a butthole and a vagina, the vagina has more bumps, Whereas the butthole has more like kind of rings.  Not quite, yeah, it has like rings.  So going down the tube.  But they're both realistically textured.  So if you like anal, if you like vaginal sex, it's going to feel real.  Everything feels real.  And for the price point of about $66, it's a pretty good deal.  The downside, of course, not just the fact that it's hard to clean because even dolls, if you get the fixed vagina, they have the same problems as this, is they're a little bit harder to clean because you can't pull everything out.  It's the size.  Okay, so this is the Celestina body pillow.  I talked about this in a recent video.  So we're just gonna move this over to the appropriate part.  It may be a little hard to see.  Let me see if I can zoom out a little bit more.  Sorry, this is very odd, very awkward for me to record at this strange angle.  Okay, we got the... We got everything going on.  Alright, now what we're going to do is we're going to put the doll onto the image.  Alright.  So it's still a little bit on the skinny side, but actually Celestina's very skinny.  This actually looks somewhat appropriate.  The toy isn't realistically proportioned to like a normal human girl or woman.  However, because these body pillows, like this body pillow right now is 54 inches long by 20 inches wide.  And so, you know, Celestina's kind of scaled down to fit on the body pillow.  And because she scaled down, if you want a toy that's appropriate to a body pillow image, this one actually is appropriate.  So it seems counterintuitive, but like if you had a realistic ass, you know an ass that was actually like, you know, normal size, it would be too big.  It wouldn't look right on this image because it is scaled down.  So the good news is if you have a body pillow waifu, these sorts of toys are great.  And unlike a full-size doll like Celestina, you can kind of keep the box that it comes in and just put it away when you're done with it.  It's a lot easier to store or hide than it is like a full-size, you know, life-size doll.  And a body pillow, you just throw another body pillowcase over it and disguise it as a normal body pillow.  So if you live with your parents or have roommates, this might be a better option for you.  And although these smaller toys look a little weird by themselves, when you combine them with the body pillow, they look appropriate.  And the other thing is, like, I know I hate talking about this because it's such bullcrap, but, you know, people are being arrested for so-called childlike dolls based solely on size.  They're not taking into account whether it's a scaled-down adult or whether it truly looks like a child.  They just see small, and they arrest you.  These sorts of toys... You can't, there's no determinate age for a toy like this.  You know, just like you can't determine the age of a dildo, you can't determine the age of a disembodied ass.  So if you are a little bit worried about getting arrested for some bull crap, then this is sort of the toy you might want to look into if you can't get a full size doll because of price or weight concerns.  The toy itself is $65 or $65.99.  I do have a 10% off coupon code if you're interested.  The body pillow, which I talked about the other day, is about $50.  The pillowcase was about $25.  It's a custom job.  I got the art from a fan and uploaded it to this website.  They gave me the body pillow for $25.  The actual pillow inside the pillowcase was $25 from Walmart.  And the toy was $65.  So we're talking about, in total, between the body pillow, the pillowcase, and the toy, the Tantalee Brooke the Naughty Girl, we're looking at about $115.  That's a far cry from $2,000, which is how much Celestina costs.  So if you've got a body pillow waifu, this is a good toy.  If you're not into the body pillows, if you prefer a full-size doll, then obviously this is unnecessary, to say the least.  But before you drop $2,000 on a doll, if you already have a body pillow waifu, get a toy like this to see if you like it before you upgrade to a full doll.  If you don't like it, you're only out $66 as opposed to $2,000.  So it's a good buy.  Again, I really like the detail.  Everything looks top notch.  It's just the smaller size.  But the smaller size is actually appropriate if you have a body pillow waifu.  So that's about it.  Thank you Tantally for the product.  Again, there'll be a 10% off coupon code in the description.  It's a 10% off your entire order.  if you want to order more than one thing.  So check it out.  Thank you Tantally for the sponsorship and for the business.  This is Turd Flinging Monkey.
