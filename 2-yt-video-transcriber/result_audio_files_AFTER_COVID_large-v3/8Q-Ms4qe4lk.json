A lot of atheists ask for scientific proof of God because people believe that there's a God that interacts with reality in some detectable way.  And if they can never offer evidence for that.  So it's like what I was saying before.  If somebody believes that there's a Loch Ness Monster, it's up to them to present evidence for it.  It's not up to somebody else to prove it wrong.  So the fact that atheists would ask for evidence for God is natural.  Everyone should be asking for evidence for God, and nobody should believe in a God until the evidence is overwhelming. ",

But even that doesn't work out for me.  I actually just had a long conversation with a young man who's been drafting philosophy papers the other day about the definitions of God.  And we were talking about the different types of God definitions, like classical and neoclassical definitions for gods and the way that, and for Christian gods specifically, and the way that they have internal inconsistencies once they're analyzed.  So the reason that people might ask for scientific evidence for God is because somebody is saying God is interacting with the world, like Matt said, and the reason somebody might ask for philosophical evidence for God, because there are different types of evidence, is because somebody is asserting that there is a God, and you can only really prove that philosophically if you take away the interaction component.

So that means that the conceptualization of God existed before the religion that you currently believe in was plausible or existed.  Like you recognize that.  And then you said, but they had a conceptualization of God and sacrificed babies.  So in your argument that you made to us, you essentially said there's possible conceptualizations of God in which it could be morally conceivable that it's okay to sacrifice babies.  But based on your subjective standards, so your internal innate sort of understanding of what is good or bad, you understand that that That can't be a good thing to do.  You recognize that as a truth for yourself.  But I don't think that.  and you said you were born again Christian as well.  So I wouldn't think that before you found Christianity, that you thought it was OK to sacrifice babies and then somehow had an emotional experience that somehow gave you this conception of morality through your belief in God that changed your mind about sacrificing babies.
