            "text": "Yeah, so the West Point Mint, the United States Mint in West Point, New York, even though it's up closer to the Canadian border near Buffalo, shut down.  It was inevitable to me.  I knew it was going to happen, and indeed it's done.  And they have given no guidance as to when they will open back up.  And this has been one of my biggest concerns, is the fragile supply chain.  And, Duncan, you don't have to look any further than the United States Mint.  They are the largest supplier of precious metals to the United States, to North America.  The Canadian Mint, which just did come back online in a very limited capacity, is massively backordered.  They're finally starting to catch up with all the product that they've owed and committed to for the last three weeks.  And so this is just more of the same concern that I've been echoing for quite some time, that when you see institutions like the United States Mint and the Canadian Mint go offline, at a time when there is massive demand, it's very concerning to me.  And I really don't know that this ends until we see some sort of normal semblance of normal activity again in the United States and in the world.  We're dealing with mints that are on razor's edge.  They're overburdened with demand.  They're understaffed with social distancing.  And other than the United States Mint in New York shut down, the Canadian Mint in Ottawa working limited capacity just to keep up.  The other three major mints, one's in Africa, one's in Australia, and one is in Austria.  When you talk about Austria, you're not too far from Spain and you're not too far from Italy.  When you talk about Africa, I don't have to tell you what would happen if the pandemic were really to take foot in In Africa, of course, the other being Australia.  After that, the UK mint and the Chinese mint really don't amount to too much.  And so as far as product is concerned, done again, I think it is until things change, this is a new reality we all have to live with. ",

And yet, when you look at what actually came out of the U.S.  Mint, there was only 350,000 Silver Eagles that came out this month in comparison to well north of, I think, 5 million last month.  And so at a time when demand could not be more robust, you have... a giant golf ball stuck in the hose of supply.  And it's really quite startling.  And, you know, thank goodness for the Australian Perth Mint.  They have really done a bang up job of keeping us supplied with product.  But we're literally working 24 hours a day to continue to get supply in.  And luckily, we've been able to do that.  But this is just another Another peg out of the, you know, out of the base of our supply chain that is being ripped out from underneath us with no warning whatsoever.

That's an unanswerable question.  But second of all, based on what we were talking about, about the demand carving its way up into the food chain of the supply chain, this sounds like it's really endgame time for now for people who want to obtain any physical products.

            "text": "Well, I'd like to address that in a few different ways.  Number one being this isn't 2008.  This is not a V-shaped recovery.  This is not Fed-induced recovery.  credit and lowered interest rates to stimulate things.  That's not what this is about.  That's what happened in 2008 and everything turned around.  You can see the Fed is certainly doing all they can to induce some form of liquidity by dropping barrels of money from the sky.  And I think their balance sheet increased by $6 trillion this month.  It took this country over 300 years to print $800 billion.  And now in one month with the keystroke, the Fed produces $6 trillion and adds it to our to our deficit.  So as far as a recovery and things resuming in a natural fashion, I don't think that this is about easy credit and money being poured out by the Fed.  And quite to the contrary, I think this is more about people being afraid to go back and resume daily life.  And just because the all clear gets signaled, does that mean things go back to normal?  And probably not.  And even if things do go back to normal, what happens if we see a resumption?  I've been bringing this up lately, thanks to Chris Martinson.  The Spanish flu in 1918, the second wave, killed six times as many people as the first.  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but what I am saying is that it's naive to believe that once the all clear is sounded, that it's safe to get back in the water.  If a shark flies by real quick, once you jump back in the water, you may never get back again.  I'm very concerned.  I'm very concerned about the fact that this is our new reality until things get better.  And people who are waiting for premiums to come down I think are making a very big mistake because until it does get better it's going to get a whole lot worse.  and which brings me to my second point that I've been talking about a lot lately and that is asset price inflation changing to price inflation in this industry.  the volatility in the stock market I believe has rattled a lot of people and they're coming out of the market and they're the first place that they're going is to precious metals.  it's the only logical Stop right now.  And we are getting phone calls that go something like this.  Andy, I was referred by Joe Smith.  He's a client of yours.  He's been telling me forever to do this.  I should have listened to him.  I got a million dollars I just came out of the market with.  What do I do?  That asset price inflation that has been courtesy of the Fed's easy money and low interest rates over the last 12 years has manifested itself as asset price inflation in stocks, bonds, and real estate.  The volatility... And the trouble in the economy and with this virus has woken people to, well, maybe I should pare down my exposure to the stock market.  And when they come out, they're coming out with a lot of money in a broken supply chain chasing safety in this market.  And they're going to be a lot of disappointed people who are waiting for premiums to come down and prices to go down.  And you may see prices to go down, but you will not see premiums go down unless we see a resumption of normal supply chain activity.  And quite to the contrary, I'm very concerned about it for my own business.  What am I going to have to sell in a month?  What does a month look like from now?  I don't know.  I'm being dead serious.  I have no idea.  But when I see the United States mint close down, it is a precursor to a complete destruction of the precious metals supply chain.  If there's any more demand, like we've talked about before, if we just go back to regress to the mean of the last 40 years to 2.5% allocation amongst U.S.  portfolios, that's a five-fold increase in this market at a time when it can't handle any more increase.  I'm concerned.  I don't think that's a good strategy right now.  It would have been over the last 10 years.  I don't think it will be now. ",
