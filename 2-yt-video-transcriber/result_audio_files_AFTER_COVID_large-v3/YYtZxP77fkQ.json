            "text": "As many of you know, I came to faith in a church that preached the pre-tribulation rapture of Jesus.  In fact, I heard about that before I even heard a clear gospel message because my friends were talking about the end times and hearing these little bits and pieces and fascinated by it and sharing it with me.  And then along with that, I heard the rest of the gospel of God.  saved them, God saved me as teenagers in 1971.  But that's just gospel-less.  That's what we knew.  You believe that.  I didn't know there were other options or other views of things.  And when I went through the Bible cover to cover about five times the first couple of years, and when I memorized 20 verses a day for at least six months and probably memorized 4,000 verses overall, and someone asked me to explain the difference between the rapture and the second coming, I said, I didn't have a lot of answers.  I thought, that's odd.  Everything else I believe I can defend fluently just by reading the Bible day and night, memorizing all these verses.  So I bought all the classic books that taught the pre-trib rapture, learned the system, got devoted to the system, taught it zealously.  Until a few years later, I thought, wait a second.  Why did I have to get that from books instead of straight from the Bible?  When I went back to the Bible, I said I never would have come up with this.  I don't see it in Scripture.  So with all respect to my friends that hold to a pre-tribulation rapture, friends that love the Lord, love the Word of God, solid believers, we can differ on this.  But I want to give you one text that was one of the more major texts for me.  to make me realize that this, the separating of the rapture from the second coming by a seven year period or a three and a half year period was just not scriptural.  Look at what Paul wrote in 2 Thessalonians 1, right into the believers in the midst of persecution.  This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are also suffering.  since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us.  Now look at this.  When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  Paul says to persecuted believers, you will receive deliverance and rest from your persecutors.  And he goes on to say this is the day when he's going to come to be admired and glorified among his people.  That's when he comes in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who don't know God.  That Paul's saying.  the day of our deliverance, the day of our relief, the day when our persecutors are stopped, the day when we will meet the Lord is the day when he comes in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who don't know God.  It's one event.  our deliverance takes place at that same time.  he comes in the clouds of heaven and flaming fire for the whole world to see.  we are caught up to meet him think of it and in triumph we descend with him as he destroys the wicked.  that's one of many verses but it's one of the strongest to say that the rapture and second coming were the same event.
