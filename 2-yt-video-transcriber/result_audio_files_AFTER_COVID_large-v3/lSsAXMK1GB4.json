            "text": "Thank you for tuning in to Terry Swoop videos of Swoop Films Entertainment.  I'm going to do a Where They Now video on an R&B and pop group, Lisa Lisa and Caught Jam.  This was a very popular group during the 1980s.  They came out in 1985.  And the three members in the group were Lisa Lisa, Mike Hughes, and Alex Moselle.  Now, they were discovered by the group Full Force.  As you all know, Full Force was very, they wrote a lot of the R&B songs.  They wrote and produced a lot of different artists during the 1980s.  And Mike Hughes is the one that introduced Lisa Lisa to Full Force.  And then they got the other two members of the group, and that's what started the group.  Now, they had a lot of hit songs between 1985 and 1990.  They had four number one songs and three platinum selling albums.  Now, what I remember about them as a kid, I grew up in the 80s.  What I remember about them was this Lisa Lisa.  I didn't even know about the other two members in the group.  I just looked at the other two members as background dancers, but The other two members actually, they wrote a lot of the songs and they produced a lot of the songs.  And then Lisa Lisa, she did all the singing.  So when a lot of people think of this group, they just think of Lisa Lisa.  When Mike Hughes was responsible for creating all the beats, he created all the rhythms for all the songs.  And Alex Moselle would do a lot of the writing of the songs.  And all Lisa Lisa would do is get up front and sing.  And she was gorgeous in the 80s.  This woman was beautiful.  Now today, Lisa Lisa is 54 years old.  She's of Puerto Rican descent.  And a lot of people say she paved the way for Jennifer Lopez and Shakira.  Without her, a lot of these other Latina artists would not be as famous today if it wasn't for her paving the way for them.  Now, the other members of the group, Mike Hughes is 57 years old.  And he looks great for his age.  He's 57 years old.  You can tell he works out a lot.  And the third member of the group is Alex Moselle.  He's 56 years old.  It looks like he's mostly kept a low profile.  I don't really see him performing with the group anymore.  But Mike Hughes and Lisa Lisa, they still perform at concerts.  They're still touring all over the country and performing at concerts.  And I'm glad to see that they're still making music and being creative.  A lot of people have different opinions about this topic.  Leave a comment, rate and subscribe. ",
