            "text": "First thing I would say to myself is it's about quality, not quantity.  What is this thing about just going out there and sleeping with as many chicks as you can?  It's not about that.  And the most fun times you're going to have in your life with a woman is going to be when you have an amazing connection with a woman, and it's mutual, and you're crazy about her, she's crazy about you, and beautiful things happen.  It's not just about the sex, okay?  In fact, when you have a real connection, the sex is a billion times better.  So be a little bit more discerning and focus on quality, not quantity.  Next thing I would say is stop trying to impress people.  What are you doing?  trying to impress people?  Why?  What do you care?  what all these other people think?  Dude, you're trying to get all these chicks.  so people think you're cool.  I mean, sure, the sex is fun too, but stop trying to impress other people.  Your value or self-worth does not come from how many people you have sex with.  That's ridiculous.  Hooking up with loads of people Does not make you a better person, a better man, more successful.  It doesn't make you anything but a hoe.  Okay?  So just stop it.  As soon as you do that and you're just cool being who you are, you're going to have way more success.  You're going to feel better.  You're going to have more mental clarity.  You're going to be more calm and just happier.  Just way happier.  So just stop it.  Also, I would say your ego is too big, bro.  You're a dick.  What are you doing? ",

            "text": "Yes.  That's good.  That's good.  Okay.  Lower the ego.  Go read like, go read some Eckhart Tolle.  You know what I'm saying?  Go read some spiritual books.  Realize that you're not this guy.  This guy's not that important.  You know what I'm saying?  Like the ego.  You need to, you need to tone that shit down.  Getting out of control.  Today, I'd like to recommend a book that I read that changed my life.  This is another really big point I would say to myself.  You're going to get burned at some point.  In fact, one year in the future, you're going to get fucked over big time, okay?  Because when you run around and you just treat sex like nothing, like eating a piece of candy or whatever, you don't take it seriously, you are going to fall in love with some girl who's going to crush you.  She's going to crush you like you have no idea how you're going to get crushed.  What you're doing, do it more consciously.  You know what I'm saying?  These women you're talking to, they're human beings.  They have feelings too.  They can get hurt.  So if you're going to have tons of sex, be completely honest all the time about your intentions, just that you're only going to have sex and nothing more.  So you don't hurt anybody.  You don't want to grow any bad karma.  And also just be more mature with what you're doing and more present because you are playing with fire.  Take it seriously.  Sex is a serious thing between two people.  Take it seriously. ",

            "text": "Do it.  Another thing I would say to myself, I'd say, dude, stop trying to be funny.  You're already funny.  You're already a funny motherfucker.  There's nothing you can do not to be funny.  You just are funny, right?  You're not even just because you did comedy for your whole fucking life.  You're just funny.  So let it just be funny in the natural moments.  You don't have to on purpose be super hilarious.  So chicks are like, oh, look how funny this guy is.  Yeah.  Look, the girls who are going to like you anyway because you're naturally funny, they're going to like you regardless.  You don't have to be extra funny.  It comes off as try hard.  You're actually going to scare some girls away because you're trying too hard, right?  It's just another crutch, having to do something extra, like really hard trying, in your case being funny.  It's the same as trying to show off about how you know famous people or how much money you have or how successful you are or all this bullshit, right?  It's trying super hard to impress somebody.  And it doesn't actually work because women aren't stupid, okay?  You're stupid.  Women aren't stupid, okay?  So just accept that you're already good enough, you're already funny, and stop trying to be funny.  Hey, I'm Sasha.  How you doing?  So I thought I'd do a little video and tell you guys a little bit about me.  Hi, I'm me.  I'm from Canada, a little place called Toronto.  Nice.  And I used to hate Toronto, actually, because I used to think all the women were bitches.  2010 Sasha, what's going on?  Listen to me, man.  You're fucked up.  You got a lot of anger and frustration when it comes to women.  You're pissed.  You got some shit you need to resolve.  Yes, it has to do with your mama because your mom treated you like shit.  She's the only woman you had in your life and she committed suicide when you were 18.  What you're doing is you're finding women who also are going to break up with you and break your heart just like your mom did.  So you're in this pattern where you're constantly falling in love with these women who are dumping you because you're being super needy and pushing them away so that they'll dump you.  So you can repeat this pattern, which to you is love, but it's actually really fucked up and it's just you getting your heart broken over and over again.  Okay?  You need to stop that shit.  See it.  I know it's painful.  You don't want to hear this shit.  I get it.  I get it.  But that's what's going on.  Deal with your shit.  Do some shadow work, dog.  Go and heal your wounds with the feminine.  Do some courses.  Read some books.  Do some meditations.  Whatever you got to do, son.  But do the work first on you so you feel good and you heal this really messed up stuff you got going on.  Then you're going to find your goddess, amazing woman, or several.  But do the work first before going around because you're going to hurt yourself, you're going to hurt them.  It's a no-win situation.  Okay?  Just as you need to be doing your own shadow work, yes, look at where women are at in their personal development.  If you meet a woman, she can be beautiful, she can be great, she can be whatever.  But unless she's really consciously working on her shadow, her dark stuff, her fucked up stuff, her messed up beliefs, you know, her trauma that she had in her life from her parents, all that kind of stuff.  If she's not working on it, if she's damaged goods, that stuff is going to explode.  blow it into your relationship and it's gonna fuck you up.  yes because if you're in a relationship with somebody it's gonna affect you right.  so just as you need to be doing your work if you want to get serious with a woman she needs to be doing the work also because if she's conscious about her shit and so are you you can work on it together and you can grow together and heal together and learn together and that's beautiful.  but just getting into a woman's pants because she's hot and then having lots of sex and then accidentally getting her pregnant and then marrying her because that she's fucking crazy and fucked up and is going to ruin your life.  That's not good.  You don't want that.  I think the main thing I would say to you, though, is you're already good enough.  You're already good.  You don't have to do anything.  There's nothing you have to do.  You were born good enough, man.  Right?  So stop trying to impress all these chicks or impress all these pickup guys.  Do all this fucking bullshit.  You're already good enough.  You were born good enough.  Okay?  And go on the spiritual journey of self-discovery.  But go on that journey now.  Don't wait.  Don't wait.  Don't wait another five, 10, don't wait.  Start now asking the question, who am I?  What am I doing here?  What is my nature?  What is the purpose of life?  All the good stuff.  I know you're a little bit started, but go deeper into that because that's where all the real joy and happiness and peace lies.  The more you get in touch with the truth of your nature, The more you will just let go of all the fakeness of the reality, all the stuff that's not real, not useful, not helpful, the illusion, the money and the fame and the recognition and the ego, all that bullshit.  You're going to let go of all that stuff as soon as you start remembering your true nature.  But it's a journey.  It takes time.  So start reading those spiritual books.  Get into meditation.  Whatever you've got to do, but start on that journey now.  Now, go on the journey of awakening.  That's what it's all about.  Find your place in the world.  Figure out what you came down here for.  Go and do that stuff.  And in that passion, you'll be so happy.  Your vibration will go up.  You're going to feel fucking amazing.  You're going to attract the most amazing people, experiences, teachings, everything in your life.  And you will meet the one you have been looking for.
