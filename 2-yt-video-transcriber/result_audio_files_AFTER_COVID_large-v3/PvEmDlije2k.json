            "text": "I got to talk about DMX.  Hold on, let me tweet this.  All right, we're talking about DMX.  We got to get on DMX.  We got to get on DMX right now.  Hold on, let me let people know on Facebook that we're going to be talking about DMX right now because we got to get into this.  Tell me y'all saw this DMX on Iyanla, Fix My Life, The Nigga.  When I say this shit was comedy, that DMX shit was comedy.  And it's bad that, you know, the brother's on that narcotic.  He had his son on there.  Hold on, let me get this.  Let me get this thing, Bobby.  Hold on, because my shit is freezing up.  Hold on.  All right, letting people know that we're talking about DMX right now.  So anyway, DMX was on this show.  It's on the OWN Network.  It's a show called Yonla Fixed My Life.  And, you know, it had DMX on there.  And DMX is the funniest nigga ever.  Because DMX, he really, I think that he might be fucking with that narcotic again.  And the thing with DMX, I really want this brother to get some help.  He really, really needs help right now.  It's funny and sad.  It's still funny now, but he really, he needs to get help because the thing is, he's using this whole, I'm a drug addict to justify doing real grimy shit.  And when you don't really, you're doing your family grimy, that's not a good look.  So a lot of dudes would just do all this little grimy shit to their families and then blame it on the drugs and all that.  And that's a cop out.  And I was before I saw the show, I was thinking that Iyanla was going to be on some bullshit with them.  But the thing is, Iyanla, I got to tip my hat to her because she called out a lot of behavior.  See, the thing is with DMX, he's used to getting sympathy now by getting up there crying and all that.  And he tried to do that with Iyanla.  And she was like, okay, we're not going to go there.  We're not going to talk about you being a victim because that's his whole thing.  He gets into this whole victim thing.  And when she was like, okay, I don't want to get into that, that threw him off his shit.  And the thing is, what's funny, he has those crackhead emotions where... He's happy one minute, crying the next, and mad the next.  And he was going into this whole thing, this whole victim thing.  Look, I understand certain shit happened to you as a kid.  I understand that.  But now, when you're an adult, you got to charge that shit to the game and stop using that shit as an excuse to fuck with the pipe.  And she kind of called him out on that because he was like... My grandmother, you know... I was my grandmother's baby, you know?  My mother with me in the group home, and he was doing all that shit.  And he, you know, doing all that shit.  And Ayala was like, she's like, look, from this point on, ex, don't ever tell the story that way again.  What do you mean?  Don't ever tell that story like that again.  You're being a victim.  That's what happened.  That's what happened.  She's like, let me show you.  Come on, DM.  Because the y'all is real slick.  Y'all will be doing, you know, they say one thing and then they pull a twist on you.  So she got him, brought him in another room.  And in the other room, it was a whole wall of mug shots of him looking real crackish.  It was a bunch of mug shots of him.  He got real pissed.  I'm on the floor dying laughing.  Like, this is you.  These are your demons.  Y'all will be all up in the motherfucker's face.  These are your demons.  I ain't with this, yo.  I ain't with it.  I ain't with it.  I didn't sign up for this.  I thought we were going to talk about me, you know?  That shit was funny as fuck.  He couldn't handle it.  Because he couldn't play that victim thing.  It was time to look at himself.  So he's like, I don't want to do this, yo.  I don't want to do this.  So he's like storming out and she said, okay, let me talk to him.  Will you talk with your son at least?  Will you talk to your son?  You know, I don't want to do this shit.  This is something else.  You tricked me.  I'll talk to my son.  Whatever.  What the fuck?  So... They convince him to come back the next day to talk to the son.  The son looks just like the mom, and the son seems like a real good dude.  The son is like 20, 21 years old, and you can tell the dude is hurt.  You know, it was very sad.  You know, he's, you know... He meets up with his son the next day with a yonder sitting there, and again, he goes through so many emotions.  He sees his son, he starts crying.  No, his son ain't moist, no.  The son looked just like the mom, though.  And the son is talking to him, and... When Iyanla chimes in, he starts going off on Iyanla.  That shit was funny as hell.  He's hugging his son.  I'm sorry, you know.  You know, son, I was there, you know.  Dad, you know, you weren't.  You just weren't there.  You know, I tried, you know.  I tried, you know.  I wasn't the best father, but you wouldn't.  I tried, you know.  I was doing things.  You know, I love you.  The only thing I didn't love you, you know.  He said something.  And Iyanla chimed in and he went the fuck off.  I'm trying to see.  what did Iyanla say to make him go off?  The first time, because he went off on Iyanla a couple of times.  But the first time, yeah, he pulled out the guitar.  He's playing the guitar.  He said, dad, I want to sing a song for you, dad.  He's playing the guitar.  He's DMXing.  Doing the crackhead bob to the song.  And the song was basically about growing up with a crackhead dad.  The son pulled out a guitar singing about crack.  I wrote a song about you, dad.  On that narcotic.  My daddy was on the narcotic.  I grew up without my dad because he's on the narcotic.  It was just a train wreck.  It was a train wreck.  And Ayanla said something.  I'm trying to remember what Ayanla said.  She said something that made X go off.  Okay, she, no, he was talking to his son.  He was talking to the son.  The son's like, Daddy, you know, I just, I want you to be there.  I just want you to be there.  And you just weren't there.  I was there, though.  I was there.  What are you saying?  I wasn't there?  I was there.  Tell me what I did wrong.  I was there.  I never got high around you.  I never got high.  Those other bitches, you other women, my mama, those other bitches didn't mean nothing.  They're just bitches.  Those other bitches didn't mean nothing.  And Ayala chimed in.  Ayala said, look, just accept his truth.  What the fuck you saying, y'all?  He went off.  This nigga went off on it.  This shit is a train wreck.  It is a train wreck.  And this dude's emotions go from hot to cold, hot to cold.  This nigga will start crying, stop crying, and then start going off.  It was love and sex, son.  You know, I love you, son.  Those other women, I love your mother.  I'd do anything with you and your mother.  My other kids, I love you and your mother.  from what the fuck you saying?  yo i'm talking to my fucking son like whoa.  then they get into it they get into a spat then he goes out they talk him back in and this is the say it got really sad.  the last part.  it got really sad.  they talk him back in he's talking to the son and dmx comes in and he apologizes.  you know crackheads love to apologize you know.  That's why I like to say, you know, I'm sorry.  You know, I never talked to a woman like that before.  You know, I'm sorry, you know.  I shouldn't have talked to you like that.  I never talked to a woman like that in my life, you know.  So he's talking to his son.  His son's like, Dad, I want to have a relationship with you.  I want to have a relationship with you, too.  I'm there.  I want to have a relationship with you, too.  And the son threw a curveball at him.  The son was like, but Dad, I only wanna have a relationship with the clean you.  If we have a relationship, you gotta be clean, Dad.  What?  Fuck all that.  He's like, I'm not giving up that narcotic.  What's up, Peanut?  Where you going?  Wait, hold on.  Where you going at this time of night?  Don't make me get like DMX in this motherfucker.  Where you going with my son, yo?  The fuck is wrong with you, yo?  Sorry, crying.  But DMX was talking to his son.  He was like, dad, you got to be clean, dad.  I want to have a relationship with the clean you.  I've been getting high before you were born.  What kind of shit is that to say to your son?  That's so fucked up.  Nice.  What?  No.  I can't agree to that.  You know, you love somebody unconditionally.  You don't put conditions on them.  What kind of shit is that?  You don't put conditions on love.  I mean, your son is telling you, I don't want you to be on the pipe, dude.  I want to love you, but I don't want to love a fucking crackhead.  Love is unconditional.  And he's like, that's my condition.  I just want you to be off the narcotic.  I want you to be clean.  Well, guess what?  It's not going to happen.  So, you know, I guess I say my goodbyes now.  You fucked up with that DMX.  DMX was like, you know, I guess you see me at my funeral.  then, okay?  Yeah, he said, I guess you see me at my funeral.  So, all right, give me a hug.  He stood up and the son was like, the son was like.  And I'm feeling so bad for the son.  And he's like, you know what?  You got conditions.  I don't want to do those conditions.  So I guess we have no relationship.  Come on, get up.  Give me a hug.  And the son was like, oh, no.  And the son almost got up a little bit.  The son almost got up.  And then the young one said, no, you don't have to do that.  What the fuck you saying, yo?  What?  Look at this nigga right here.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Then she got into her whole sister girl shit.  You don't have the right to ever talk to me like that.  This shit was a train wreck and I loved it.  Nigga, y'all gotta see this.  It was nigga shit times ten.  And that was the end of it.  And Liana was like, we want to, at the end of the show, tweet, save DMX at Twitter.  Let me see TGZ.  Look at this little boy.  Look at that.  He's getting big.  He is getting big.  Look at that little kid.  Look at him chilling.  Got his hat to the side just like Pops.  Now, I ain't going to treat him like DMX because I ain't going to have TJ with a guitar.  You left me for that pipe.  Narcotics.  No, no, no, no, no.  You said DMX's ex-wife Tashira, she's on every network with the $5 wig.  Yeah, you know, I feel for her.  You know, I feel for that sister.  I feel for her.  And I, you know, she genuinely, you know, that's the father of her kids.  So she don't want to see this fool out here acting a damn nut, you know?  So I feel her and I feel her pain.  I was a good father.  I wasn't the best, but I was a good father.  I tried.  You know, I tried.  I tried.  I loved your mother and I tried.  You know, I was there.  Those other bitches didn't mean nothing.  Me and your mother, you know.  I was there for your mother.  Anytime your mother needed me, I was there.  Do you understand this pain?  What the fuck you saying to me, yo?  I'm talking to my son.  Oh, man.  Yeah, DMX did another video.  He did another video for Jet Magazine.  And he was clearly on that narcotic.  Talking about the Ayanla show.  And I don't know what he was talking about.  That nigga was rambling.  This nigga, literally, he did it somewhere on the internet.  This dude did an interview talking about the show, how he didn't like it and all that.  And you can't literally understand nothing he's saying.  He's talking just like that where you don't understand one word he's saying.  He's talking just like that.  And this shit goes on for like 10 minutes and you don't understand shit he's saying.  And even when he's talking slow, you don't understand what he's saying.  What the what?  This nigga is gone.  That dude is on that damn narcotic.  Man, that narcotic is a beast.  What the hell is up with rappers from Def Jam? ",
