            "text": "You know, God honors us.  And there are many ways that God honors us.  One of the ways that God honors us is to include us in His plan.  And we are so honored.  God has honored us by asking us to be part of the leadership of the return.  The Return is a global movement.  It starts off in America, but it's a global movement to call the body of Christ to repentance and to prayer.  And it's very important.  The website is thereturn.org.  And I put up on my Facebook.  A photo here of the leaders, and I'm just so amazed how God allowed us to be part of this very wonderful group of people.  I see here Pastor Robert Morris in Texas, Marcus Lamb, the CEO of Daystar, Michelle Bachman, Kevin Jessup, Jonathan Cahn.  Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy.  People outside of America might not know that, but if you're in America, my goodness, those ads are very persuasive ads.  I think even the president sleeps on a MyPillow.  You've got Anne Graham Lotz, which is Billy Graham's daughter, and many other wonderful people.  Stephen Strang, I can see right here.  CBN is represented.  And then we've got us, Discover Ministries, representing the international arm or the international aspect of the return.  So we want to call pastors in Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, Latin America to come and join in the return.  because all that we're seeing, the signs that we're seeing and the signs that we've been preaching about, it really all has one purpose.  We are calling people back to return to Jesus.  It's time to come back to the Lord and to repent personally for our sins and to repent for our nation's sins.  I believe this is the only way.  There's no other way to stop things like coronavirus.  You know, a virus doesn't die.  A virus didn't even start out as a living entity.  There is no reason for a virus to die.  There's no natural reason for a pandemic to actually end other than complete mass exposure, complete mass immunity.  And we don't ever really have that.  Even the bubonic plague died in the 1350s.  But now there's a case in China.  Northern China is called Inner Mongolia.  Even that has come back up.  So any of these things can happen anytime.  How is it that... The question is not really why are they happening, but why haven't they been happening all this time?  And it's because there's a preservation of the earth through the salt of the earth.  The Bible calls the church the salt of the earth.  But are we salty enough?  This is the real question.  We've lost a bit of the consecration that saints of old used to have.  We've lost some of the dedication and the spiritual commitment.  And we've become a lukewarm church at large.  I know that if you're listening, you're probably not in that group.  But at large, we need to pray that the church, which has the power of Jesus Christ, to hold back the darkness and to preach the gospel of the glorious light of Jesus Christ, we need to pray for us to awaken again and then pray for the nation to be preserved from all of these catastrophes, disasters, and pandemics.  and really fulfill the plan of God that God has for this earth.  This is not meant to be a world of suffering.  This earth was made by God to be a world of pleasure, for His pleasure, and for His worship, but we've strayed away so much.  So the return is about coming back to Him.  Go to the website, thereturn.org, And click there, you will see a couple of options.  Register for yourself to attend at Washington, D.C.  It's going to be on September 26th in the National Mall, Washington, D.C.  Or if you cannot be there, you can click option B, receive a live simulcast.  And I think if you're a church leader, this would be a wonderful opportunity.  We're always asking our church to pray and to repent.  Why not do it together, nationally and globally?  And let's come together during that 10-day period from the Feast of Trumpets to the Day of Atonement.  You know, we've been preaching about all of these Hebrew roots, biblical feasts.  Why?  Why learn all this?  Because it's time to fulfill them.  It's time to prepare the way for Jesus.  So from the Feast of Trumpets to the Day of Atonement is a 10-day period from the 18th to the 28th of September.  And it culminates with a live national event in Washington, D.C.  on the 26th for those of us who can go there.  If you're watching in Australia, Discover Church will host the live event as long as we're not in lockdown.  This is how the devil does it.  They try to just implement these restrictions slowly, and it gets worse and worse until the Bible says one day there's going to be an all-out persecution, and they're not going to allow us or they're not going to want us to worship at the cost of our lives.  So before that day happens, I believe there's an opportunity to pray and to repent.  So let's do that.  Go to thereturn.org and register yourself and your church.  God bless you. ",
