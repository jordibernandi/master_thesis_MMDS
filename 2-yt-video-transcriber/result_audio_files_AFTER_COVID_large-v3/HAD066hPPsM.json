            "text": "Stirring the coffee with chopsticks using the vortex method.  The only true way to optimize the taste of your coffee.  At the molecular level.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Daybreak Show.  I am the Sultan.  We'll get started.  But first, coffee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Ethiopian.  Yeah, this was the one that I roasted over last weekend.  Just perfect.  Nice and hot too.  I like it.  It's cold out today.  Coffee with cream and sugar means two different things at McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts.  Dunkin' Donuts means a lot of cream, a lot of sugar.  McDonald's means burnt coffee, just barely sweet, and just a couple drops of cream.  That's my observation, at least in the area where I live.  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel like there are songs to be sung, bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung.  And even when I'm old and gray, I'm going to feel the way I do today, because you make me feel so young.  Frank Sinatra, 1956.  What a happy song that is.  Just happy, even just the way it's composed and orchestrated.  It's really, it's cool.  I try to get out, but they pull me back in.  Michael Corleone, Godfather 3.  Most people hated the movie.  I happen to like it.  Never quit because you had a bad day.  Have a bad year?  You better think of quitting.  Jim Rohn, at 25 years old, shows his mentor his first paycheck and says, this is all they pay.  The mentor corrects him and says, no, this is all they pay you.  What's going to happen when all these fade barbers, what's going to happen to all of them when fades are no longer a thing and people want to actually have a scissor cut?  They're going to be calling me to teach them how to cut hair with shears to create a good look.  It's what happens when you're a fade barber.  Scissors scare you.  I will talk a woman into a wig before extensions and weaves.  because wigs don't mess with the scalp.  Everything else will eventually pull your hair out and create thin spots, which is what you're trying to avoid in the first place.  Good wigs are versatile, they add variety, and they can be sexy or serious.  Big fan of wigs.  if a woman has hair that just is impossible to deal with, or she has very thinning hair, or post-chemo or anything like that, yeah.  I am halfway through Pat Stedman's dating course to see if I want to promote it.  And it's winning me over a little bit at a time.  I call it a thinking man's course.  I'm not kidding.  But don't buy it yet.  Not yet.  Let me finish it.  I want to give you a full review before I can endorse anything.  But I need to get behind something that... Promoting.  I need to believe in it.  Anything that you ever see links for down below on my videos are things that I believe in.  I can fully endorse.  I had people send me products for years.  You remember that.  Some of you OGs remember me going way back.  I had over 350 beard products.  There were some things that people sent me that I'd have to get back to them and say, I can't endorse it.  It's not a good fit.  And I figured out a nice way of saying it.  I just didn't believe in the product.  I just didn't think it was a quality product or didn't think it worked well.  And the words that I would use are, it's not a good fit.  That way I wasn't insulting them.  If they wanted an honest critique, I would tell them, But for the average person sending me product that I didn't agree with or didn't really like, it's not a good fit.  Think about that.  Think about, like you don't want to say, you know, your product is shit.  You don't want to say that.  How can you be more softer, cordial, nicer, encouraging in the way that you say things?  You see what I'm saying?  rather than destroy a person with your words.  You're just saying it's not a good fit for you.  You want to marry an actor or a model?  Well, I hope you have a very good job because models and actors have the most patchy sources of income.  They might be hot for one year and cold and not getting any work the next.  You might meet them when surf is up for them.  Believe me, that doesn't last long.  And as a guy that dated several models and actors, yeah, it's just not, they're not steady.  They're not steady.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Have you done carnivore?  Tell me what you did.  Are you working out as well?  Or did you just cut back on carbs?  Or did you combine it with intermittent fasting or one meal a day?  There's so many different combinations.  I don't think there's any one way.  The best way is the way that works for you.  I will say this.  Take the TRM challenge, the rational male.  Read the book.  Secondly, leave it on your desk, your nightstand, or side table next to your favorite reading chair.  Your wife or girlfriend will pick it up just because of the name, and she'll probably flip through it.  What will then happen?  What will then happen?  I know men that have to read it in private.  Or men that have to listen to the audiobook because they would never want their wife seeing the book.  Yeah.  I think it's a good book.  The issues that I have are with the author himself.  But I have nothing personal against him.  Your face and body might not hit the wall, but your attitude did.  smashed, rolled, and burst into flames.  Attitudes can hit the wall much quicker than face or body.  I don't want to beat anyone with red pill teaching like what was done to me by the red pill supremacists.  But a married man bringing red pill truths home, you might as well bring home a smallpox blanket.  She, meaning your wife, will never be a sound or balanced red pill sounding board. ",
