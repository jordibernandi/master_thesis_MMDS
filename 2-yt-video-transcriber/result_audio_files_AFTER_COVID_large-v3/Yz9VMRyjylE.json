Well, I'm in the possession of this truck, it's no different.  So technically speaking for this purpose, I am the owner of this vehicle.  But you don't have to tell them that.  You don't have to have discussions about ownership of stuff that you're in possession of.  You don't have to talk at all.  You don't have to talk at all.  The only thing that you're required to do in this situation is provide a driver's license.  because it is a traffic stop.  Now, I didn't have one on me.  I couldn't find it right away.  So at that point, I'm required, because it is a traffic stop, to provide three pieces of information, name, address, and date of birth.  And after that, you're not required to even speak.  So whether you want to speak or not or have conversations about like we just had, that's up to you.  You can have all the conversations you want if you know what you're doing.
