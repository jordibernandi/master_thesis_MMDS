            "text": "Stop acting like we are not prisoners of war.  Act like we are prisoners of war.  Now, prisoners of war, and that's why I sometimes refer to a movie called Shawshank Redemption.  Or you can look at some of the war movies, I mean, where people are prisoners of war.  What do prisoners of war think about doing?  They think about not being prisoners of war.  That's their duty.  That's your duty.  Black people have a priority throughout the world, and I've been repeating this on this program and on other programs, and I say it in the book and everything.  What is black people's priority?  as a rule when you go among any black people right now, right where you are, right where I am?  What is the black person's average priority?  minute by minute.  I will answer according to what I have observed and what I am a part of myself, really.  But I have made it a non-priority in the last 30 years, I mean, because it doesn't make sense.  And it hurts me, you know, to have had that priority.  And that is to every day wake up with one thing in mind.  The average black person, if we'll tell the truth, Do whatever it takes to impress another black person.  Stop and think about what black people talk about, what they plan on doing.  Hey, man, I'm going to have some time off this weekend, all right?  Time off to do what?  There's nothing we can do except adopt a code to get rid of the system of white supremacy.  That's what I've been saying for years.  You're not going to be able to stop this in this system.  The system is set up for that.  It's set up to make that happen.  That's automatic.  This is not some fluke in a perfect society.  I mean, this is the government of the non-white people of the planet.  It's designed to do that.  Black people getting pulled over and shot down repeatedly.  And the balloons on the fences, the hoods and the kisses in front of a church, that's going to continue for the next 10 million years, as long as you have this system in place.  These are not incidents.  These are built into the system.  These are requirements.  If you're a white supremacist, this is what you're supposed to do.  You gunned down black people.  That's what the guns are made for.  And black people are given guns only if they are going to use these guns against other black people.  And that's been proven every day.  And we have bought into it because that's how we show off among each other.  Man, I'll kill you.  I'll kill you right now.  You ain't nobody.  You ain't nothing to me.  You know?  No, I ain't going outside and getting no fist fight.  I'm going to kill you right now.  You did, man.  You don't say nothing like that to me.  All right?  Now, what do I get out of that?  I get a rush feeling like like a cocaine high.  All right.  And then I stand a few, you know, a couple of weeks later, a couple of months later.  Well, I apologize.  And, you know, I lost my temper and whatnot.  That's all built in.  The white supremacists know you're going to lose your temper.  And they know you're going to do what you did.  Because that's all a part of their plan.  They know us better than we know ourselves or know anything else.  All right?  Because they taught us.  And they taught us to hate us.  We go around talking about Black Lives Matter.  Black lives do matter.  But only the people who don't matter.  Stop acting like we are not prisoners of war. ",
