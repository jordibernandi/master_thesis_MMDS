            "text": "Hey there internet, my name's Luxander, and today I'm finally talking about Calvin Guerra.  I really appreciate everybody who has been making videos about Calvin and talking about their personal experiences with having been the target of the harassment that his fans tend to carry out after he has made a video about them.  I want to especially give a shout out to Brennan Beckwith, who has made a series of videos about Calvin Guerra, the effect that his video had on Brennan.  Brennan is the person who Calvin started doing this transtrender reaction stuff because of.  Like, he did this video responding to Brennan.  That video was Calvin's first video to get over a million views.  Like, that is what started the whole thing, the whole trend of Calvin making videos about non-binary people, about trans-trenders.  I know I'm really late to this, but I have been really scared to talk about Calvin in the past, not wanting to deal with any potential backlash that could arise from talking about my experience, but I appreciate, you know, everybody else's very cool-ness about it, like people who used to be fans of Calvin talking about how toxic he is, you know, people who were targeted by Calvin, talking about, like, how the ideology itself has harmed them, like, all of these things are really cool, and they have made me feel comfortable, like, made me feel like there may be more supportive people than unsupportive people, enough to talk about Calvin.  So if you don't know, if you don't have any prior knowledge of this situation, it was two years ago, or maybe even three years ago at this point, that Calvin made a reaction video to me.  has done that.  My experience with my hormonal transition has been that I went on testosterone for two years and then I went off of testosterone for two years and now I am back on it and I have been on it for basically a little bit over a year.  While I was not on testosterone, like it may have actually been about a year into me not being on testosterone or something like that, It was a video in which I took the opportunity to describe how I felt about my transition, which I was very explicit in the video, like, this is a transition video, I'm not detransitioning just because I stopped hormones, I'm still trans, I still inhabit this social role, I just wasn't on medicine at that time, basically.  And I made a video because I wanted to show people that you don't have to go on T In the first place, you don't have to stay on T if you start it, and like, I made this video because I wanted to empower people to take control and autonomy in their transitions.  That was basically it.  Just to provide people with information and a different perspective than what you usually see, which is someone who goes on testosterone for their whole life.  I was trying to say, you can go on it for a short time to get the effects that you want, and then come off of it again.  Just, that was it.  So yeah, like, I made that video, and Calvin's fans started showing up in the comments, like, oh, Calvin should respond to this.  And I was like, who the fuck is Calvin?  And he did.  He ended up making a video about it.  My video was called, I Quit Hormones and So Can You.  One of the things that I said in the video that I did do a response to, like, basically I was like, you don't even have to know if you're sure.  to be on hormones like to go on hormones and try it out which i've waffled back and forth about this for a bit.  like i think that you should be informed of the side effects of the medicine.  if you're going to take it like you should be fully informed but i have known too many people who didn't recognize that they had gender dysphoria until after they started hormones to say you have to have gender dysphoria and very be and be very sure about it before you start hormones.  like i think that if you and your doctor are both on the same page about what's going to happen if you are, like, able to stop after about a month, you know?  Like, there's very little changes that will happen in a month or two on hormones, right?  So I did react to that criticism without necessarily saying, hey, Calvin Guerra made a video about me, and I heard about it, and here, let me describe, like, whatever.  At the time, I just offered a correction, like, I do think you should be reasonably sure that you want hormones, or whatever.  And I have never, to this day, watched Calvin's video about me, and I will not.  I decided a long time ago that that was not a healthy or smart thing for me to do when videos responding to Riley Dennis were showing up in my feed, and I was like, these are obviously toxic videos.  Like, I'm not gonna watch any of this because it's so obviously taking underhanded shots at this character, at this creator.  who I really like.  Like, I love Riley Dennis, especially at the time, like, her older stuff.  So from that point, I was like, I am not going to watch reaction content to my content.  It is not a healthy thing for me to do.  So I don't.  And I especially don't feel compelled to go watch Calvin's video about me, because I have been out as trans for over a decade, like, since Calvin was maybe 8 or 9 years old, right?  I've been out that entire time, and I feel very secure in myself, and I don't need what is effectively a teenager at the time to tell me that I'm not really trans, or whatever.  I think at this point that Calvin does recognize that I'm trans because I have dysphoria and because I have medically transitioned, so... i guess i'm glad that i'm valid uwu.  anyway calvin made a video responding to mine and like i don't know exactly what was said i do know that that that main criticism that i mentioned before was like oh you shouldn't tell people they can start hormones without being sure that they're trans.  i have now given you my updated opinion about that which is that you should be reasonably informed of all of the effects of the medicine before you start to take it but that i don't think you really necessarily have to have that concrete.  i know that i'm trans and i know that this is right for me Because I know people who are persistent, like, who have been on hormones for 8 years, who when they first started, did not know that they were trans.  They just had a lot of issues, their doctor suggested it as, like, maybe this could be what's wrong, and then all of a sudden, a lot of their other mental health issues cleared up.  Like... There are some people for whom their brain just does not work right unless they're on hormones.  I have experienced this, which I will talk about at some point.  That was the only thing from Calvin's video that made it to me that I really thought, like, I needed to respond to.  I have no idea what else he said about me.  After Calvin made that video, a bunch of his people came to me, which is what happens.  At the time, Calvin had about 200,000 subscribers, and at the time, I had fewer than 10,000.  Like, I had not even gotten to that point yet.  It was really shitty.  Like, on the most bare of levels.  Calvin knows.  He knows that his fans like to go interact with the people that he makes response videos to.  There's a clip in one of Corviday's videos, like Corviday's video about Calvin Guerra.  where it's, like, you can hear the fucking soundbite where he says, oh, I know you love to go talk to these people.  He'll say now, don't go harass this person.  But he built his whole YouTube career off of going after smaller people, like, smaller trans channels, like, non-binary people who have absolutely no power to respond.  And, like, he knows fully well that his... audience goes and harasses those people and he continued to do it anyway like.  even as of like there was a conversation that calvin had with a streamer named riley grace which seemed really positive.  i will talk about that a little bit more later um but then after that he made another video with blair white trashing milo stewart and then like only took it down after people pointed out that it was really shitty of him to do like people who he respected who are, like, leftists or whatever.  All that to say, I guess, that Calvin has had a, like, devastatingly bad effect on our community.  The result of what happened, for me, was that I no longer felt very safe or comfortable talking about my transition on this platform, which was, like, why I started my channel, really, um, to just document those things and to share those with people and to teach people that, you know, this is an example of what it can be like to be trans.  and be happy.  Calvin really fucked that up for me for a while, because I just felt like if I talked about my body or anything like that explicitly, then that would invite more harassment, especially while I was not on T, or even when I started back on T. Like my video at five months, like I made a five month update on low dose testosterone video, I was really defensive in it.  It's really hard to talk about myself after that, and it's been years.  I'm literally still like having difficulty and not nearly to the same degree as someone like Brennan, but I do still have difficulty interacting with trans people online, because they can be so toxic, and because they can just overwhelm you to the point where you just can't function.  So like, I had to turn off comments on the video, I'm pretty sure.  I don't know how to explain that.  it's so much more hurtful when people within your own community are telling you that you're not really trans than it is for like, cis people, to be like, your, your identity isn't real, like, you're a faker, like, I get it, I get it from them, but they, those, like, cishet people in society who say those things would also say those things to Calvin, and Calvin's just pushing it even further down the hill, and all of his followers do that same shit, you know, all, like, a significant enough number of them do it that it doesn't really matter, like, it's just, it's too many, and it's so uncool.  Like, what do you do?  What do you do when people within your own community, like, when a creator has chosen to single you out as a person who cannot possibly fight back, and, like, they're talking about the way that you look?  Like, again, I haven't watched the video about me.  I've mostly watched other people's breakdowns of Calvin's content.  I don't think I've ever actually watched, maybe I've watched one of Calvin's videos, because I know he mentioned me in another video where he was ranking trans-trenders.  Long story short, it was really shitty.  It made me very uncomfortable interacting, even on my own channel.  It made me feel like it was going to be harder and I would have to be more careful about curating my spaces, being more mindful of what I share, because people could take those things.  Like, I'm being vulnerable, is what I'm doing, and sometimes that backfires.  And that's just something you have to deal with when you're being vulnerable.  And I didn't want to anymore.  I didn't stop, but I didn't really want to anymore.  Since then, I've basically just sort of pretended like.  Calvin doesn't exist in my content, I guess.  I don't really necessarily do a lot of content that is responding to someone, like, directly.  I've made several videos about ContraPoints, which is why my channel has as many subs as it has.  And that's not something I do very often.  I just don't want to feed it.  I don't want to feed into this machine of Calvin Guerra in the algorithm.  But I do think it's important to talk about the effects that it has, and to share with you that this has affected me for years.  Like, again, I don't have, like, trauma to the degree that, like, Brennan has described in their videos, but I am not... I'm not comfy.  So now I want to talk about... the stream with Riley Grace.  Riley Grace Roshong is a streamer and a law student who I have been on her stream a couple times.  I think she's really cool.  I like her a lot.  When she brings on people that she disagrees with, she doesn't just sort of deal with that disagreement.  Like, she doesn't just let it pass, she actually challenges them.  And she was streaming one night, and Calvin Guerra just, like, randomly decided to try to join the stream.  Like, he had been drinking, so he's like, and I listened to the whole thing.  Not at the time, afterwards, when it was re-uploaded.  Like, I listened to the whole three-hour conversation.  At some point, the streamer Xanderhal joined in as well.  I was actually just watching CopsHateMo's video about this same thing, and I agree with them also that... I do agree with Calvin on some things, like about gender being somehow intrinsic and not just a social construct.  There are things that I think we have in common.  Like, I was surprised by that in that video, and it really did make me feel like, I wonder if I could just have a conversation with this dude.  Like, how would that go?  Like, not a debate, not... anything like that, but literally just a conversation.  And we could do it publicly, like, I genuinely for a minute there was, like, trying to spread the word that I wanted to talk to Calvin to see if he would come to me.  And I don't think he ever would.  Like, I'm now doing it in a YouTube video.  His minions are free to take this message to him, if you want, that I do think it would be interesting to have a conversation with him as a nonbinary person, like, We could cover all kinds of things.  I think that I could potentially reach him on stuff like why non-dysphoric trans people do belong in the community.  Like, I do think that I\u2014there were things that were happening in the stream, and I was\u2014in my brain, I was like, well, I would say this.  Like, I just know what to say to explain to someone.  Not to\u2014like, just to explain.  I'm, again, not\u2014I'm not thinking of this as like, oh, oh, I should debate Calvin.  I mean literally\u2014 I think he doesn't understand and that I could explain and that it would be easier to do that if we started with, like, oh, here's the things we agree with.  Like, I would have to go back and listen to the stream with Riley and Xanderhal and be like, ah, this was the point that I wanted to hit on.  This was the point that I wanted to hit on.  and I think it could be really productive.  But I also had a realization recently that even if the word were to get to Calvin, that I think I could have a productive public conversation with him.  I realized that for me, what happened with Calvin was a big deal.  It stuck out to me.  It has affected me for a long time, and it still affects me.  I'm still bouncing my leg, nervous, to be talking about Calvin Guerra, like, in this kind of detail publicly for basically the first time.  I've whinged about him in the past.  I'm sure that we talked about it when I came on Riley's stream one time.  It came up.  Like, she was like, oh, I just had Calvin on, and I was like, funny enough, I did listen to that, or at least I know about it, and... Calvin has responded to me in the past, which Riley didn't know.  But it stuck out for me.  It was a significant thing that has caught in my craw, you know?  It's stuck in there.  But for Calvin, I don't know that he would actually be interested in talking to me.  Because I'm not really anything special for Calvin.  Like, I'm just one of the probably many people that he made fun of.  And that he sent his followers after to harass, whether intentionally or not.  So I don't know.  I don't actually know if he would be interested in talking to me.  I'm not Brennan, you know?  I'm not the one who started it all.  So it's hard for me to... say how I feel right now.  I would like to live in a world where I'm not scared of Calvin Guerra or his stans.  I would like to live in a world where Calvin is genuinely not a shitty person anymore.  I don't know that you can address that with explaining why you shouldn't be shitty to this particular group.  Like, maybe, maybe if I do successfully convince him that non-dysphoric or non-passing trans people deserve respect and to be included in the community, like, He's probably just gonna take that same shit and direct it onto another group.  Unless it is truly what Natalie said and just in-group cringe because you don't want to be seen that way, which I could see as a valid thing.  Like, maybe Calvin is just really deeply insecure.  I think he responded to her video.  I don't actually know, and I don't care.  Another thing that I struggle with is that people told me when I made my video that was, like, responding to criticism generally.  people were like, why didn't you talk to Calvin privately?  Like, why didn't you message him?  I don't think that that onus is on me, and I think that's a really shitty thing to say, because I was a tiny, tiny channel, I am older than him, and, like, he made my life worse, and I don't really think that the onus is on me to take a teenager by the hand to explain to them how what they did impacted me negatively.  Like, I don't feel the need to justify myself to a teenager, and I don't feel at all that it was my responsibility to be like, hey man, you made this video about me, uh, do you wanna talk about that?  Like, that was not for me to do at the time.  Like, it was enough that I was just dealing with the harassment that his video incurred.  I don't know that I really have a lot else to say about this.  Calvin's effect on the community has been a net negative.  I would like to try to convince him to be better, or at least try to explain to him things that may make sense to him, because I sometimes phrase things in a way that clicks for people, like, ooh, high opinion of myself, I could be the one to change Calvin Guerra.  I don't really think that's the case, but it would be interesting.  Again, I don't really think that he would, I mean, he may not even genuinely remember me beyond, like, Oh, yeah, I did make a video about this person.  Yeah, I mean, if any of his harpies want to carry the message back, let him know that I think I could explain things to him in a way that he would understand.  And I think that we agree, probably, on some of the fundamentals, and we don't need to have a cis person there explaining to us what gender is.  I was annoyed by that too, Calvin.  Why was Xander Hall trying to explain to you what gender is?  You and I both have dysphoria.  Right?  We have common ground.  Maybe.  So that's all.  That's gonna be all from me today.  If you liked the video, give me pretty analytics to look at and comments to read.  We'll see what happens with that, whether the comments stay open.  You can hit me up on PayPal for a tip, you can hit me on Patreon, you can subscribe to the channel, and you can ring the bell for notifications if you want.  And I hope you have an okay day.  Bye.  I'm just like, this is gonna go badly.  Happy New Year and thank you to all of my patrons as we enter 2021.  I want to especially shout out Sean, R. Halverson, Frozen Summers, Michelle Winter, Suzanne Maynard, Wellington Marcus, Sarah A., Andrew Kenny, Amanda B., Elizabeth Bartel, Mr.  Atheist, and Athiette. ",
