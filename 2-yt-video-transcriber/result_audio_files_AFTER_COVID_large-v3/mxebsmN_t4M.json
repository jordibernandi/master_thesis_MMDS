            "text": "AMY GOODMAN.  We're broadcasting from the epicenter of the pandemic, New York City, but we're going to end today's show in Florida, where the Miami Police Department is under fire after a video surfaced of an officer handcuffing and detaining an African American doctor outside his home on Friday.  The man, Armand Anderson, was wearing a mask and preparing for a volunteer shift, helping protect homeless people from the spread of COVID-19.  When a patrol car pulled up to his home, surveillance video from Dr.  Henderson's house shows him loading a van with supplies before the encounter.  Dr.  Henderson says the police officer handcuffed him after accusing him of littering and then asking for identification, which Henderson did not have on him.  The officer was not wearing a mask.  Dr.  Henderson was.  He had to yell to his wife inside their home to present identification before the officer finally released him.  On Saturday, Miami police chief has ordered an internal investigation into the incident.  The officer involved has not been identified.  The encounter sparked widespread outrage and comes as African American men report fears of increased racial profiling when they're following the CDC's suggestion that people wear masks in public.  For more, we go to Miami to speak with Dr.  Armin Henderson, an internal medicine physician, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Miami, also an organizer with Dream Defenders.  He was recently profiled by The Miami Herald.  Welcome to Democracy  Now!,  Dr.  Henderson.  Tell us, in your own words, what you were doing on Friday and then what happened. ",

And, you know, while I was doing that, I noticed that the police officer rode down the street, a cross-section of my block, one way, really slow.  And then he came back around the street the other way and basically turned down my block.  And he pulled up next to me, questioning me, if I lived there, if I worked here.  I told them that I lived there.  I told them what I was doing.  I told them that, you know, where I was putting the boxes was where the city of Miami comes to pick up our trash every week.  For example, they're here this week, and people on my block are putting trash in the same place that I put the boxes, you know, on Friday.  And he just, at some point, he just didn't believe what I was saying or he thought that I was being disrespectful and decided to get out of the car and escalate the situation.  Once he got out of the car, go ahead. ",

And so I pretty much went ahead and continued to do what I was going to do because I didn't know where this encounter was going.  And then he just decided to put cuffs on me, basically.  Once he put cuffs on me, I called for my wife.  She came out, and pretty much de-escalated the situation.  But even before she came, he was, like, inches from my face, basically, yelling that I should call him sergeant, I should call him sir, and with no mask on.  He had no gloves on.  I could feel his saliva on my lips.  It was just a crazy encounter. ",

You know, he just broke a number of protocols and violated my rights.  So, firstly, I want him held accountable, and I want an apology as well.  But outside of that, I think the bigger picture is that I was going to serve homeless individuals throughout Miami-Dade County, that basically, you know, the city has said\u2014and cities across the United States have said the same thing, where We have to shelter in place.  We have to socially distance.  And for someone who doesn't have a house, for someone who lives unsheltered, it's very impossible to do those things.  And in a pandemic, you know, these are the most vulnerable individuals.  These are the individuals who we're You know, these are the individuals that sleep on buses, on bus stops, on benches.  And they\u2014you know, because of that, when you're talking about public health response to a pandemic, you have to focus on those individuals who are using the public spaces the most. ",

And first of all, we did a survey of individuals to see what their symptoms are.  And we identified people who needed to be tested.  But then because we are the epicenter of the epidemic and this is the most vulnerable population, I just figured that we should be testing people at random as well to sample population sizes to see how far this virus has spread already.  And, honestly, though, this is supposed to be the city and the county's job in doing this, in providing necessities and testing individuals that are in this vulnerable population.  And I think it just speaks to the fact that I even have to do this.  You know, it shouldn't be my job to volunteer out there to make sure that homeless individuals are cared for, you know, especially in a pandemic.  So, at the surface, it feels like a feel-good story, but it's really not.  AMY GOODMAN. ",
