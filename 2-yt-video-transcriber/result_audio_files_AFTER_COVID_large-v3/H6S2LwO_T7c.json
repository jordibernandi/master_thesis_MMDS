            "text": "uh... i woke up this morning guys i don't normally do videos on saturday but i woke up this morning and uh... i saw something that just made me laugh.  so much so thank you everybody for for for doing this but um... but uh... let me let me let me give you a window social justice christians into how a non-racist thinks about the world.  as i saw this babble on the article uh... yesterday i think it came out And, you know, I didn't click it because I only click it if I really like the link.  And actually, I didn't think this one was that funny.  But let me tell you how a non-racist thinks about this.  So here's the headline.  Ready?  The headline says, Chick-fil-A is now open on Sunday, but only for black people.  Now, I knew exactly what this was about as soon as I saw it.  It was about the CEO of Chick-fil-A, you know, getting on his knees.  and hobbling over to Lecrae to shine his sneaker.  And he said, you know, white people, we need to show some humility, so let's shine black people's sneakers, which, I mean, there's so many things that you could say about that.  But it was really stupid.  And Lecrae's just sitting there like, yes, bow to me.  You know what I mean?  Anyway, so that's what this is about.  So Chick-fil-A is doing something special for black people like all evangelical institutions are doing.  But even if I didn't know that, and something super cringy as well, but even if I didn't know that, I would know instantly what this is about because, you know, I'm a human being.  And it's about evangelicals breaking God's rules in order to appease black people.  So this in this case, Chick-fil-A thinks they shouldn't be open on Sunday to honor the Lord.  But what they're going to do is break that rule so that they can show black people how unracist they are.  You know, they hobble over, wash the shoe, you know, that kind of thing.  That's how a non-racist thinks about things.  But social justice warrior Christians, woke Christians, have come out in droves to condemn this article for being racist.  Why?  Because black people love fried chicken.  That's not what the article is about, obviously.  So there's two things that this reveals that I want to mention.  Number one.  Number one, the people that are saying this is racist, Beth Moore was doing it, Dan Darling was doing it, Jonathan Merritt was doing it, just droves and droves of soy latte sipping men on Twitter were doing it.  Be better, Chick-fil-A, be better.  They're all revealing in their own hearts that they themselves believe the stereotype that they're projecting onto the Babylon Beat.  This is not about fried chicken.  Says that Beth Moore believes that black people just love fried chicken.  And she's calling you racist because she believes that black people just love fried chicken.  Now, I've got some news for you.  I'm one of those weirdos.  Call me crazy.  Call me crazy.  But I don't think that liking fried chicken is a character flaw.  Fried chicken is delicious.  what is this sensitivity?  If somebody said to me, yeah, Puerto Rican, you love arroz con pollo or something?  I'd be like, yeah.  Arroz con pollo is fantastic.  It is so good.  The mixture of rice and chicken, and then you put some beans on it.  It's really good.  That's not a character flaw.  If somebody said, oh, yeah, those Italians, they just love spaghetti.  They love pasta.  Who would take offense to that?  It's true.  Italians love pasta.  Now, I happen to know that there are plenty of black people who don't like fried chicken, but probably most of them do.  Is that racist?  That's not racist.  It's not a character flaw to like fried chicken.  So not only are you projecting the stereotype that you fear the most against black people, the stereotype against black people, you're projecting that and revealing your own heart.  You're the racist, sir.  Beth Moore, you're the racist.  Dan Darling, you're the racist.  But it's not even something to worry about.  They like fried chicken.  Who cares?  Why?  Why is that like the worst thing in the world?  I like fried chicken, by the way.  I mean, you know, I know I'm not black.  But I do have 20% slave ancestry in my blood.  And I love fried chicken.  Just like it said in the encyclopedia.  That's a Dave Chappelle joke from back in the day.  But I don't know.  So here's the thing.  So so so Matt from the Babylon Bee did end up explaining this article.  He says here it's not.  it's not intended to be a dig towards black.  It's intended to be a dig towards Kathy and Matt.  I would suggest not explaining this to leftists and social justice warriors and the woke cult because they're never going to be satisfied.  There's no purpose for the explanation because there's no way they're going to be like, oh, OK, that's fine.  You know what I mean?  So just I would suggest never doing this again, Matt.  You do whatever you want, obviously.  I'm not telling you what to do.  But what I do appreciate about Matt is he's refusing to apologize.  He says, no, there's nothing to apologize for.  I don't apologize.  I'm glad I did it, and I would do it again.  Good for you, Matt.  Good for you.  Now, here's the spicy part.  I'm thinking in my mind, Matt, send me a Twitter message if this is true.  This may have been a very carefully laid trap.  You put this article out there knowing that a bunch of racists are going to call it racist, and then you spring the trap on them and say, by the way, you're the racist.  Good job if that's true.  If you did that intentionally, Matt, bravo.  Send me a Twitter message and let me know if you did that intentionally.  But my goodness gracious, Matt.  This is wonderful.  Now that the trap has been sprung, whether intentionally or unintentionally, this is one of the funniest things I've seen all year.  And I have not laughed this funny this early in a very long time.  By the way, sorry if I look a little disheveled and tired.  It's because it's pretty early.  Listen, if you take one thing away from this video, take this.  Liking fried chicken... is not a character flaw.  Because fried chicken is actually quite delicious.  And by the way, if black people like chicken, and that's supposed to be a racist trope or something, chicken is the most popular meat in the entire universe.  Everybody eats chicken.  What is wrong with you people?  Honestly, what is wrong with you people?  Anyway, I gotta go.  Hope you found this video helpful.  God bless. ",
