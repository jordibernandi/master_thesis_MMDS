            "text": "Hi, and welcome to my movie review of A Candle for the Devil.  This is a horror movie from 1973, and as it says there, it's called A Candle for the Devil.  And it's about, actually, do you know what's funny?  The title with the word candle in it, it just reminds me of a story, I don't know if you've seen it the other day, about... Gwyneth Paltrow.  I'll see if I can find it.  Oh, there it is.  Infernal Flame.  Gwyneth Paltrow's vagina-scented candle.  They've got to be trolling us at this point, right?  I mean, it must be right.  It's like... Vagina scented candle explodes into flames causing an inferno in a women's living room.  Wait, it wasn't a man that bought it?  Okay, strange.  A vagina scented candle by Gwyneth Paltrow exploded into flames causing an inferno in a women's living room.  Jodie Thompson, 50, won the risk, risky, risky, risk, whatever, product sold by the Hollywood star and wellness guru in an online quiz.  So I thought, see, what I thought was it was a bad idea.  The thought, you know, we're supposed to take women seriously, you know, treat them equally and all that crap.  But when one of them goes into a shop or goes online and intentionally buys a candle that is vagina scented you got it raises some questions but this is kind of worse.  she entered a competition where the prize was a vagina scented candle.  Now I'm hoping that she won the prize because she was the only fucking person on the planet who wanted a candle that smelled specifically like Gwyneth Paltrow's vag.  I don't get it.  The only way you could end up with this in your house, or the only way you should end up with this in your house, Is if you go to the shop and you need some candles for an emergency in case there's a power cut during lockdown.  You know, I'm going to get some candles.  Oh, here's some cheap ones here.  I'll grab some and there you go.  And then you go home and then you realise, what the fuck is this?  What?  Okay, I'll accept that.  But intentionally buying it or intentionally entering a competition where you can win this.  You can win a vagina scented candle.  I mean, how many times do I need to say this?  This is real.  This is a real thing.  This is not a troll.  This is not the Sunday sport.  This is real.  This is a real thing.  Gwyneth Paltrow thought that it was a good idea to make a product that's a candle that smelled like her vagina.  Okay.  Okay.  Why is it, right, that feminists like her, why are they so fucking obsessed with their badges?  Imagine men were that obsessed with their cocks.  I mean, we'd be called perverts for that, you know?  Creeps and perverts.  Oh no, but it's empowering when women do it.  It's fucking disgusting.  For fuck's sake, man.  I mean, for fuck's sake.  Exploded in the living room.  It even says on it, this smells like my vagina.  That's what it says on the candle.  This smells like my vagina.  Honestly, women are fucking vile, aren't they though?  Who the fuck does this?  That's fucking disgusting, man.  The candle is described on Gwyneth's goop site as funny.  It's not funny.  Gorgeous.  It's definitely not gorgeous.  Sexy.  Not sexy.  And beautifully.  No.  Unexpected.  Okay, it's unexpected.  Aye.  I mean, it's unexpected.  I'll give you that one.  Yes, that's what it is.  None of the other words.  But aye, it's unexpected.  But Jodie was taken by surprise after lighting it.  So not only did she enter a competition where she could win this, right?  And you might give her a pass and you might go, you know what?  Maybe she wanted to win it so that it's a collector's item.  And then in the future, when people are saying, what's the fucking daftest thing that you own?  What's the most ridiculous fucking thing that you own.  that's so fucking stupid that nobody would believe that you actually owned it?  She could then go, well, actually, I've got a candle that smells like Gwyneth's vag.  She'd win.  But no, she actually lit it.  So she wasn't even trying to get it for a collector's item purpose that she might be able to sell in the future.  She actually lit it.  This, what a fucking weird woman this is, by the way.  And Gwyneth, she doesn't get off the fucking hook.  That's some weird shit, that.  Because if I was famous, right, and, I don't know, some company came to me, listen, we want to make a candle.  Do you want to put your name on it?  Well, sure, why not?  But it's got to smell like your fucking cock.  I'm going to be like that.  No, actually, I don't want that.  That's fucking disgusting.  Who the fuck wants a candle that smells like my fucking knob?  It's stupid.  But Gwyneth didn't think that.  She just thought, sure, okay, I'll do that.  Fucking idiot.  So anyway, so she was taken by surprise after lighting it.  When a 50cm flame lit from the candle and out of the glass jar, it all did it.  Magic flame.  The media consultant told The Sun the candle exploded and emitted huge flames with bits flying everywhere.  I've never seen anything like it.  But you're holding... A candle that smells like Gwyneth Snatch and you're saying, you've never seen anything like it when you're talking about a fire?  You've never seen a fire before?  Okay.  The whole thing was ablaze and it was too hot to touch.  There was an inferno in the room.  Jodie who lives with partner David Snow, so she's got a partner.  So she's not even a cat lady.  She's not even a lesbian cat lady.  She's got a partner with a man's name.  David Snow in Kilburn, North London said, We eventually got it under control and threw it out the front door.  You should have done that as soon as you won it.  I mean, maybe, again, maybe you could give it a pass if... you know, they entered the competition and it was a mystery prize or something, I don't know, but, you know, and then you get it, maybe out of curiosity, I suppose you'd have to light it, right?  Just, I suppose if you got it in a mystery prize, you know, and it comes through the door, hey, here's a candle that smells like her snatch, you'd be like... got it lighted now.  I mean, I've got to know.  Now that I've got it, I've got to know, right?  I bet it doesn't, by the way.  I bet it fucking doesn't even smell like her snatch.  I bet it's just fucking trout or some shit, you know what I mean?  Fuck.  And they threw it out the front door.  Lept out the glass.  I don't know why they're shown as this.  What's that for?  That's just to take up space, isn't it?  The sun.  It could have burned the place down.  It was scary at the time, but funny.  looking back, that Gwyneth's vagina candle exploded in my living room.  That's not really funny.  A candle nearly burned my house down.  Hilarious.  Gwyneth 48.  Explains a lot.  Launched at \u00a357.  \u00a357 for a fucking candle that smells like fucking trout.  Are you serious?  Man, you could actually buy a trout, put it under your nose and buy a cheaper candle for far less than like a fiver.  You know what I mean?  If you really need that smell and the flame, you know.  You can compromise.  You don't need to pay \u00a357 for a fucking candle.  For one fucking candle, you mental.  She launched the.  This Smells Like My Vagina candle last year.  Why though?  Don't you have like agents and stuff and managers?  It was a nobody down the line who said to you, you know what, why are you doing this?  People are going to think you're mentally insane.  They're going to think you've lost the plot.  What are you doing this for, Gwyneth?  The scent has now also been used for a \u00a334 roll-on deal.  Didn't, oh great, so now you can smell like trout when you go outside.  Fantastic.  Thanks for that, Gwyneth.  Really appreciate it.  Couldn't, again, couldn't you just rub a trout over yourself?  Would anybody know the difference?  Let's ask Brad Pitt.  He went out with her, didn't he?  I think he went out with her.  Who cares?  Probably every cunt fucking did.  A goop spokeswoman, spokeswoman of course it is, told the son, we're in touch with the woman to see if she followed the specific fire safety instructions.  It's a fucking candle.  It's not supposed to explode.  What was the instructions?  Oh, don't light it on the wick part.  You know, light it somewhere else.  What fucking instructions do you need for a fucking candle?  For God's sake.  Imagine needing instructions.  Imagine you got a candle.  Imagine you bought a candle off Amazon.  And then you phone them up.  What's the problem?  I got one of those candles you sell.  It didn't come with instructions.  I mean, even the person at Amazon is going to be like, are you a fucking retard?  What are you talking about?  You need instructions for a fucking candle?  Light the fucking thing.  For fuck's sake, man.  It's fucking safety instructions on a fucking candle, man.  included with the candle, such as trimming the wick and not burning it for more than two hours.  It's a fucking candle?  What do you mean?  you can't burn it for more than two hours?  What the fuck in a candle's that?  What was it, 57?  57 pound for a candle that you can't burn for more than two hours?  At GOOT we vet the products we sell and make customer safety a priority.  So we've alerted the manufacturer to the women's issue and have also reached out to her to send her some GOOT products to help pass the days in quarantine.  Oh, for fuck's sake, man.  And there's an actual video, two women talking about it.  One of them I like, the other one, this one here, Susannah Reid, can't stand her.  Lorraine Kelly's alright.  And I'm not biased because she's Scottish, she's just nice.  What?  What the fuck does that smell like?  Do you know what?  Don't answer that.  Don't even answer in the comments because I don't fucking want to know.  Yes, we're all talking about her as a fucking weirdo.  It's not like we're saying, oh, I want to see her films now.  She's a fucking freak.  I went to the candle to find out what it smells like.  Are you intrigued by that?  I don't want to know.  Don't want to know, thank you.  Except, I mean, why would you want to know?  Very much, don't want to, thank you.  Well, you brought it up, Lorraine.  I don't want to know.  I took well on it.  Oh, man.  Oh, no, that's one hot pussy, right?  Okay, disgusting.  It was God trying to send her a message to turn her filthy life around.  Oh man.  How embarrassing.  Admitting he spent 75 quid on an overpriced candle.  Well, 57, but I think I've got the numbers mixed up.  So does my missus when I'm in the mood.  Just... I just can't believe it.  I mean, it's just... This is what happens when they, to women the ages, she said she was fucking 48.  This is what happens when women, you know, they smack into the wall and they're no longer the young pretty thing they were and they're no longer getting asked out 20 times a day without even leaving the fucking house.  That doesn't happen anymore.  So they have to do other shit to get attention and people talking about them.  Even if it's bad attention.  You know, anything, you know.  Because people must have told her, look, if you release this candle that smells like your snatch, people are going to think you're mental.  And she's then thinking, but it's still a tension, right?  Even though they're calling me retarded, they will still be talking about me, right?  I'll take it.  Because that's what these people are like.  Especially women who were pretty when they were younger.  They don't know what to do when they get to that age where they're no longer pretty and men don't flirt with them anymore.  Anyway, sorry, it distracted me from the movie A Candle for the Devil.  So anyway, A Candle for the Devil.  It's okay if you like that kind of thing, I suppose.  Anyway, thank you very much for watching my movie review.  I do hope you enjoyed it.  Until next time. ",
