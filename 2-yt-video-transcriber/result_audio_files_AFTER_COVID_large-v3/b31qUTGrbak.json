Take a look at this image that was obtained by Washington Post journalist Dave Weigel of a text message that Donald Trump sent out last night.  Does this sound like a person who is afraid of inciting a panic?  Antifa alert.  They'll attack your homes if Joe's elected.  President Trump needs you to become a Diamond Club member.  Your name is missing.  Donate here.  This sounds like a person who's more than happy to use a panic inciting text message to raise money for his campaign, but doesn't want to alert the American people to the severity of COVID-19, where now 200,000 Americans have died.  Donald Trump has blood on his hands.  Without question, Donald Trump has blood on his hands.  And this excuse coming from Cortez, his advisor.  Take a listen to how empty and fatuous it really is. ",
