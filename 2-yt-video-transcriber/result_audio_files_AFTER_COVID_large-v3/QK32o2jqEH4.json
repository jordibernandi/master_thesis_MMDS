            "text": "The scenes you have been watching are from Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany.  Notice how they consist of everyday people going about their everyday lives.  How many of them do you think believe they were living in a totalitarian hellhole?  If you stopped and asked them, how many would realize it, let alone tell you?  It's common of Western writers to assume that these poor people were simply brainwashed.  that the likes of stalin or hitler did not enjoy the tacit consent of the governed because they were popular but rather because the populations of the?  u s s?  r and nazi germany were terrorized at gunpoint and knew that dissent would get them shot.  is that really true Or is it what Western liberals tell themselves?  Do you believe that either Hitler or Stalin were widely disliked in the countries over which they ruled?  Or do you believe that they were quite the opposite, genuinely popular with most people, as any ruler must be in order to govern?  I'll leave that for you to answer.  But while you're thinking about it, I want you to consider another question.  Did the average Russian in 1929 or the average German in 1935 seriously think?  about the liberal USA or the liberal United Kingdom as bestians of freedom as compared with the totalitarian hellholes in which they were living themselves.  Well, I ask you, if they did believe that, why is it that 4.4 million German men fought for the Axis powers rather than defecting to the British or the Americans?  Were they simply brainwashed?  How about the millions of Russians who gave their lives in various wars?  Just brainwashed?  Why do we imagine that the people who gave their lives for these regimes were brainwashed, but that our own war casualties were the results of men bravely fighting because of their own values?  In 2020, it has become a clich\u00e9 to quote George Orwell's 1984 endlessly about the societies in which we find ourselves.  We watch history get rewritten.  We watch truth being fabricated.  We watch thoughts being policed.  We see language being controlled and altered.  We see books being censored.  We see enemies of the party depersoned, imprisoned and tortured for speaking the truth.  But I ask you, why do you imagine it was ever any different?  Dissidents have always been persecuted and the system has presented you with many different Emanuel Goldstein figures over the years to give you your allowance of two minutes hate.  The flow of information has always been maintained by a hegemonic ministry of truth.  The only difference between now and then is that the internet, a technology that appears to have caught the authorities on the hop, has made it much more difficult to carry on as they used to.  We are watching our own nations now become more openly authoritarian only because they have lost the control of the information flow.  The standard reading of George Orwell's 1984 has been to see it as some sort of commentary on the totalitarian regimes the world was witnessing back in 1948.  Or some say it was a warning for the future.  But what if Orwell was trying to tell us, in his idea of the three great powers, Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia, who are permanently in some state of war, that even back in 1948, British or American people were already living in some form of totalitarian state.  Certainly there are many things you might point to in the administrations of Clement Attlee or Franklin D. Roosevelt that were unmistakably totalitarian.  If there was a 1948 Julian Assange, how would we really know about it?  Certainly immense propaganda efforts were made during the Second World War and in its direct aftermath.  Does anyone, even for a second, believe that the Nuremberg Trials were free or fair?  with an era of trials more humane than stalin's show trials or whatever passed for justice in the third reich these are questions again.  i only ask you to ponder Before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.  The self-satisfied, sheep-like face on the screen and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne.  Besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and... anger automatically.  he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other.  but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everyone although every day and a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreen in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less.  always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him.  a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police.  oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with east asia.  in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines.  Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with East Asia and in alliance with Eurasia.  But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control.  Officially, the change of partners had never happened.  Oceania was at war with Eurasia.  Therefore, Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.  The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.
