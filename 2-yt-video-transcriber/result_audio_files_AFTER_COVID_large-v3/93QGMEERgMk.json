We're joined by Dr.  Dan Erickson from Accelerated Urgent Care based in Kern County near Bakersfield to share his views on COVID-19 immunity reopening.  Good morning, Dr.  Erickson. ",

And just to give our viewers some context, you recently, along with your partner, you own a number of urgent care facilities in Kern County, the Bakersfield area.  And you recently gave a news conference in which you provided a compelling argument as to why you think society should reopen, that the numbers aren't showing reasons to have everybody stay at home.  And a lot of people are responding to this.  Can you sort of share with our viewers some of the data and what you're seeing and why you think that society should reopen? ",

            "text": "Yeah, we started gathering data, testing people in Kern County for COVID-19 using a nasopharyngeal swab.  And initially our testing had criteria.  The CDC requested us to use a screening of cough, fever, shortness of breath, which is what we did.  And right now we've done just under 6,000 tests and we're getting about a 7% positive infection rate for COVID for Kern County, which has just under a million people.  Our study was initially not randomized, meaning we were selecting who we were going to test.  And then after a few weeks of that, we had a lot of people coming in who were requesting the test for a variety of reasons.  And we had employers who said, hey, I need my employees tested to come back to work.  So we started really testing everyone who needed a test.  And so our numbers really started to climb.  Initially, it was six and a half.  Now it's seven percent.  And we realize that Kern County doesn't represent every county.  Some people have been critical of that.  I'm acutely aware of that.  So I'm reporting my data and comparing it to, for instance, Stanford.  Stanford just did a. they're doing antibody testing in Santa Clara County, and they're seeing between two point five and four point one six percent positive rate.  and which means that they have between 45 and 80 000 cases.  well their health department reported 956 so this is 50 to 80 times the amount of positive cases in santa clara county and in kern county as well.  the amount reported is fairly low And we're saying we're getting about a 7% positive rate.  So the numbers are likely much higher in those two counties than was anticipated by the numbers at public health. ",

But to your point and the argument you're making is that Counties are seeing different numbers.  I know you're in Temecula, so I'm sure you're not unfamiliar with what's going on in San Diego versus what's going on in Kern County.  But you still think the number of cases, positive cases, and the number of hospitalizations and deaths is more similar to something like the flu.  And so your questioning is, Why are we shutting everything down and making, on top of the health matters that are hurting, have it be so economically painful as well? ",

            "text": "Well, and the conversation really has to be about herd immunity.  So, you know, each year I've been following flu seasons for 15 years.  Every year we have a season that ramps up in December, January, February.  It starts tapering off in March and we have a vaccine for flu.  Well, how well is that working?  We have about.  in 2017, 2018, we had 60,000 deaths from flu and we have a vaccine.  So we, the conversation really needs to be about herd immunity and letting that run.  So I think a good way to have this conversation is who has done lockdown and who has not done lockdown?  and has it mattered?  So when I look at the data globally, I look at Sweden and I look at California, New York and the U S and I say, well, One locked down and one didn't.  One let it run its course and one didn't.  And has that affected the death rate?  And the death rate has really been 150 per million for the United States and 200 per million for Sweden.  Italy and Spain have 400 per million and they locked down, which means their death rate was higher.  And there's a variety of factors for that.  I don't want to simplify it.  But what I'm saying is.  Sheltering in place and locking down was supposed to \u2013 the point of it was to not overwhelm our hospital systems.  Well, in Kern County, our hospital census is very low as I talk to the CEOs.  Their ICUs have very few patients.  Their ERs don't have patients.  They have many beds open, and we're saying \u2013 OK, for two months we sheltered, we locked down, we did what was required.  Now I think it's appropriate to start easing up and allowing the medical system to bring all of its people back and function at a normal level because it doesn't make sense to send doctors and nurses home.

I was basically asking Matt, I said, what's the best way to get the city back on its feet?  How can I be helpful?  And so right now we're getting the criteria for testing from Sonic.  MD, PhDs are looking at this in Kern County and saying, what's the best way to test?  And we will likely do a two nasal swab test 24 hours apart.  And we will test a certain part of the population.  We're not going to test everyone.  That's not prudent or feasible.  But they're coming up with criteria, the PhDs in immunology that work for some of these big labs to get to get Americans back to work and specifically to get Kern County back to work and then move out across California.  And again, we need to work with the governor on this.  Obviously, he's the one that's going to tell us when to go back to work.
