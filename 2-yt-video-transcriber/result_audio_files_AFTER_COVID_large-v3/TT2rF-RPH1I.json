So that meant we all had to do that much more better.  So we had to get.  we had to get those right now.  I think the count is Biden has gotten 11 million more votes than Hillary did four years ago.  We never would have beaten Trump.  had we not gotten out the vote.  And where did the vote come from?  Record numbers of black voters, record numbers of young adult voters coming out to vote.  And it happened, this has been forgotten somehow, that we've had the largest historic uprising of people, a movement that formed this year around trying to do a different way of policing.  And that brought so many people out into the streets.  So many people got registered who hadn't been registered before.  And I think that this had so much to do with it.  Thank God for black and youth and progressive voters that put Biden over the top and beat back an insurgent, Donald Trump, who almost pulled it off, but didn't.  And that's the key thing.  How did he not pull it off?  I think it's because... You know, the ballot measures.  Again, we're not talking enough about this.  The vast numbers of Americans in many states went to the polls and voted for the progressive ballot initiatives and passed them, whether it was legalized marijuana, whether it was.  doubled the minimum wage to $15 an hour in Florida.  How about Arizona?  That's not a very socialist state, and yet they voted to raise the taxes of the rich in Arizona.  And Colorado, what did they do two weeks ago?  They voted to give Coloradans 12 weeks paid family leave.  socialism, the people are ahead of the politicians.  The politicians grumbling and whining about, especially the ones that won.  I don't understand.  I love Tim there from Youngstown and Congresswoman Spanberger.  But they won.  They won.  Don't be a sore winner.  Be happy.  Yes, it's a struggle.  It's a fight.

There was one that was right.  I think the Des Moines Register was right, and then all the rest of them had it different.  So, I mean, the polling in this country, to your point, definitely is having a reckoning.  It has to fix this thing up.  Let me ask you, though, about the differences with the moderates versus progressives in the Democratic Party.  You have moderates saying the issues like socialism, like defund the police, That is what's to blame for the losses.  But then, of course, you have progressives, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, defending support for those initiatives.  I mean, she points to, as you're pointing out, she won her race decisively.  Tim Ryan did as well that you were talking about.  What are your thoughts on this, though, and how Joe Biden can get everyone on the same page in the party, or at least to a functioning level?  You're not necessarily going to corral everyone into like-minded thinking, but to get it working properly. ",

And I think that he will, when he extends his hand to the other side, it's not gonna be to compromise and give up things that we value, it's to say to them, Look, you know, we're going to get everybody covered with health insurance, and that means we're going to cover you too, not just our people, not the Trump way where we're just going to do what's for us, what's for me, me, me.

You know, and when he holds his hand out, it's not going to be about reaching across the aisle.  It's going to be about here, here, put this on.  I want to save your life.  You know, I would love it if he would go on TV like a fireside chat one night and just just speak to the red states, speak to the people voted for Trump and just say to them, I want you to live.  You're my fellow Americans.  I don't want you to die.  You need to live so we can have the great debate on these issues.  You are not to die.  You must wear this mask.  You must socially distance.  You must trust that I am going to fight and work for a vaccine, not for political reasons.  but an actual thing based on science that's going to be safe for you to take. ",

It'll take a while once they have their government.  backed health insurance uh and not have to worry about going to the emergency room.  they are going to feel better.  and you know who else is going to feel better the youth of the of of the red states because they're as long as we fund our schools have great schools for all Americans, have great libraries in every neighborhood open seven days a week.  If we do that, the young who are growing up in these homes that are maybe more, you know, thinking this way, you know, homes that don't believe in science, teach the kids science.  When they grow up, as they become adults, enough of them will realize, oh, yeah, it's the same.  It's the same.  It's how we've always made our.  How did we get people to stop smoking?  I mean, eventually people feel, you know, man, maybe it's not cool that I'm smoking.  And I think that enough people who voted for Trump will begin to see, you know, it's really not cool.  I'm not a good neighbor.  I'm not a good American if it's all about me, me, me.  And if I'm not trusting science and if my kids aren't reading books, you know, this is... We will collectively, as a society, reach out and try to create a situation where there will be these changes.  Things will get better because they do.  I mean, look at this, as Alexandria said, Cortez, that... None of the people who were in favor of Medicare for all, Congress people who had the progressive position, none of them lost.  The people who lost, the Democrats who lost, are the ones who were against Medicare for all.  They're behind where the people are at.  The people want universal health care.  I don't care what you call it.  If I had a chance to talk to Biden, I would say, yeah, I don't like that.  Medicare for all.  Don't call it that.  Call it Canadian care.  Call it Biden care.

We've been missing that for hundreds of years.  African-Americans have been missing the fact that they can vote without their vote being suppressed or gerrymandered.  There's a lot of stuff we've had to miss, and we have fought for, we've organized.  Now, for the eighth time in the last nine presidential elections, Eighth time out of nine, the majority of our fellow Americans said they want a Democrat in the White House, not a Republican.  The Republicans have only won once since 1988 when H.W.  won.  Since then, the American people only once have given a popular vote, and that was to W in 04, and that was only by one state, Ohio, 100,000 votes.  We live in a liberal country.  We live in a country where people don't call themselves liberals, but they agree that we should have a living wage, that women should have equal rights.  Look at Florida in 2018, passing a law giving felons the right to vote.  Every state in the last two or three elections that has had on the ballot, let's expand Medicaid for all.  Every time it's won, it wins.  These liberal progressive things win with the people because the people are already there.  And the politicians, including some Democrats, don't get that yet.  And they should stop complaining about this great victory we've had and the few that we lost.  were some Democrats that just tried to win by being Republican-lite.  That doesn't work.  We win when we lean to the left as Democrats.  We lose when we try to pretend to be Republicans, because why would people, when they've got actual Republicans on the ballot, why would they vote for the\u2014people want leather, not pleather.  They want a filet mignon and prime rib.  They don't want hamburger.  Democrats, be proud of who you are.  Fight for the things we're fighting for.  And remember, we're fighting so that every person in every red state has the same exact things.  That's what we stand for.  And I think in the end, we'll win enough of them over.
