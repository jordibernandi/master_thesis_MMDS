            "text": "How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Bryan Logan, and today I gotta come to you straight from the heart.  I'm not really sure where I'll go in this particular video, how I'm gonna get from point A to point B to point C, but my destination is to express to you how I feel about all of what's happening about the so-called protests, which ain't nothing but riots, that have done nothing to actually help anything.  They've only contributed to death, destruction, chaos, and just overall anarchy, okay?  First things first, I have zero empathy for any looters, anybody that's engaging in violence, none of that.  Like, I didn't have any from the beginning.  I did not have any before this thing happened, while it's happening, or right now.  Zero.  If you're a looter, shooter, or whatnot, you should have sent a Gitmo on the first class ticket making big rocks into little rocks.  That's number one.  But number two, there was a little bit of empathy there for peaceful protesters.  And when I say little bit, I do mean little bit.  I'm talking about out of 100%, maybe 2%.  There was a 2% opening in my closed, cold heart for these peaceful people.  OK, but now after what I've seen over the past few days, that 2% is gone.  I've welded that door shut.  I've taken it out of my heart and thrown it away.  You're not gonna find it anymore.  OK, I have no empathy for the looters or the so-called peaceful protesters.  I see them as the same people.  And I'll explain that in a minute.  The reason why I'm saying this right now is because, like I said, I've seen a few things over the past few days that have really sickened me.  You have more black people that have been shot, killed during these so-called protests than were actually killed.  And the incident we're talking about, which is George Floyd, that was the original purpose, right?  Because everybody's protesting and carrying on because of the death of George Floyd.  They said, oh, well, the officers, they didn't get arrested.  They were doing too much.  OK, that was the original purpose because of one person that died, who, by the way, was not a model citizen at all.  You're talking about a dope fiend, a guy that was on fentanyl meth, a guy that robbed a pregnant lady gunpoint.  OK, he's talking about an honorable guy.  Let's just have that be clear.  But moving away from that, that was the purpose of the protest from the beginning.  But now it is devolved into just pure pandemonium and chaos.  The main thing that set me off and really affected me personally was the death of 77 year old David Dorn.  He was a retired police captain out there in St.  Louis who responded to a burglary call at a pawn shop.  So he's out there trying to protect the community, trying to protect businesses.  And what happens?  Not only does he get shot and killed right outside the pawn shop, it also is streamed on Facebook Live.  Is anybody there rendering a maid?  Is anybody there trying to help this man as he loses his life right there on the sidewalk?  77 years old.  My granddad was 74 when he died, and I know how much it looked up to him.  He was like my idol.  77 years old, shot, killed after 38 years in law enforcement.  This man had five kids and 10 grandkids.  So imagine, you know, you go to your pop pop house for Thanksgiving, Christmas or whatever, now that's gone.  All because of what?  You went to flat screen TV from a pawn shop?  Is that what you think that his life was worth?  You know, people looked up to him, not just in his family, but also in the police department.  You know, the younger people, the rookies or whatever, people that were under him, younger than him, looked up to him.  Grown men looked up to this man and admired this man.  He probably was the most prominent member of the family, the most successful in the family, and you want to take him away?  What did we talk like?  If that is how you express that Black Lives Matter, I can't really, I don't understand how that makes any sense.  OK, it was not just Mr.  David Dorn who passed away.  And by the way, if you want to donate to his family, there's a link for that in the box.  It wasn't just him.  It was also a man in Oakland, Patrick Underhill, 53 years old.  He was a protective services officer for the federal government.  He was shot, killed out there in Oakland, trying to keep the peace, trying to make sure everybody was good and safe, just doing his job.  OK, where's the Black Lives Matter protests for Patrick Underhill, David Dorn or anybody else?  There was a young lady in Davenport, Iowa.  I forget her name, but I put that in the box also on the screen.  She was shot and killed just by being in a car close to where the so-called protests were happening.  OK, so I don't understand how black lives matter.  I can't really tell you killing old men for flat screen TVs.  And you know what?  This is why I say that black on black crime is really important.  What you're seeing right now on a national stage, the 77-year-old man that got shot and killed, the young girl that got shot and killed, people that are getting beat up, assaulted, people that are getting guns pulled on them, black folks getting guns pulled on them, black folks getting their businesses robbed and looted and burned and everything else.  You see that on a consistent basis in the black so-called community, which ain't no black community anyway, it's black neighborhoods.  You see that all the time in black neighborhoods consistently.  OK, so when I talk about black on black violence, I'm talking about that.  I'm talking about the everyday chaos, pandemonium and destruction that we do to each other and our own communities.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's why it matters.  So when anybody want to call me a coon or Uncle Tom or a sellout or a sambo or something like that.  What are you even thinking about?  You're the coon.  You're retarded for not wanting to talk about the most important and pressing thing.  You'll talk about some of these criminals that get murdered in the street and sometimes rightfully so by the police as some kind of injustice.  But then when your granddaddy get killed, when your grandmama get killed, when your girlfriend, your wife, your sister, your mother, your brother, when they get killed in your own community, oh, it ain't no real big deal, right?  Ain't no real big deal.  It's ridiculous.  And to anybody that's out there so-called peacefully protesting, you're part of the problem.  I blame you, too.  OK, if you posted a black square on your Instagram page to show solidarity with these people and you're not part of it, I blame you, too.  Now, you may not even know that you're part of the problem, but you are.  And I'll explain to you why.  When you give these people, these cretins, these demons, any kind of leverage, any kind of support, you aid in their cause because they have strength in numbers.  When you go out there to these riots that are disguised as protests, the sheer numbers of people, It sparks a lot of this stuff that goes on, okay?  It gives them cover to go out here, loot, shoot, rob and steal.  It gives them that cover.  So when you out there so-called peacefully protesting, you're adding into it.  You're giving them more attention.  You're feeling the fire.  You're not trying to put out the fire.  I care about those that are out there after all the melee happens, trying to clean up their business, trying to clean up the streets.  I got love for you.  But if you're out there just so-called protesting, Peacefully, what are you even doing?  What are you thinking about?  And define peaceful protest.  And if you're blocking streets, blocking traffic, and you're not actually engaging in fisticuffs or shooting people, that's not peaceful either.  Because there was a story in Richmond, Virginia, where a fire truck or ambulance or both was trying to get to a burning house with a baby inside.  So luckily, they were able to get there in time, despite all the traffic blockage.  But what if they were not able to get there and the baby dies in the fire?  Do you care about that?  Are you thinking about that when you're out there so-called protesting?  And what are you even protesting?  this particular point?  What is the end game here?  That's what I want to know.  What's the end game for you guys that are out there so-called protesting?  It's been days.  Like, you could say that it's about recognition and trying to spread the message and trying to be vocal, trying to, you know, get some attention to the cause, trying to, you know, okay, everybody knows what the cause is.  Like, it ain't nothing new.  Police brutality, white man bad, orange man bad.  Okay, we get it.  And so what?  Do you need to take days to do this to get that across?  How many more black people, white people, Asian and everybody else have got to die, have got to get seriously injured, have got to have their lives and their businesses ruined before we say enough is enough and it's over with.  If you are out there protesting peacefully, non peacefully, you are the same in my eyes.  I don't care.  I just don't care anymore.  I'm done.  David Dorn, may he rest in peace.  Patrick Underhill, may he rest in peace.  Everyone that died as a result of the protests, may they rest in peace.  I don't think the news will cover them too much.  That's not really going to be a big thing, right?  Who cares, right?  Just another black person that gets killed in the black community, just the same as always.  I'm getting tired of people trying to protect criminals, trying to protect those that don't need to be protected.  I don't think that it was a thing that's good that George Floyd died, but if he did not live that kind of life that he was living, he'd still be alive today.  Like I said before on my social media, if we put as much energy toward fixing the black community and all the obvious problems we have, rather than trying to put it out there and protest and making all these signs and whatnot, looting and shooting and carrying on, then we live in a much better place.  We have a much better society.  Maybe Floyd wouldn't have been in that circumstance to begin with, trying to pass a fake check or a fake $2 bill or whatever it was, okay?  Maybe he wouldn't have been on drugs.  Maybe he wouldn't have had any kind of physical problems that led to his death.  Just maybe, I'm just saying.  People have their whole ideology twisted.  You want to protect criminals and speak about them all the time.  You know, police reform, social justice, all kind of stuff, right?  Talk about them all the time.  But just regular everyday people trying to struggle to make it in the hood that aren't involved in crime.  They're just regular Joes.  They get sent to the back burner.  Your focus should be on the regular everyday person as is mine, not the average criminal.  The criminal should be excommunicated from the community, they should not be caped for, they should not be protected at all.  But that's what we're doing, and you see the results.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think the looters, shooters, rioters, and protesters are one and the same like I do?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Or are they different?  If they're different, then explain to me how.  If you have the rioters and the peaceful folks out there at the same time, how you gonna know who is who?  And also define peaceful.  What does peaceful really mean?  Like define that.  If you're out there in the mass of people, let's say it's 5,000 deep.  You got 2,000 rioters, 3,000 piece of protesters.  What's the difference?  It's all the same to me.  You're contributing to the massive people.  You're fueling all these things.  You keep posting up things on your Facebook, talking about go here, go there, piece of protest.  But you know what the end result is going to be?  It's going to be riots.  It's going to be just confrontations that don't need to happen.  And for what though?  Is it about George Floyd anymore?  I don't think so.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.
