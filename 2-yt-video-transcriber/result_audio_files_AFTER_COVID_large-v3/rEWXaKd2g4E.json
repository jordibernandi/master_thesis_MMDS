And a lot of folks send me stuff.  And I get a lot of crazy videos sent my way.  And lots of times my reaction is, you know, yeah, that's crazy.  But, you know, that's Bill Johnson for you.  Or that's Bethel.  Or that's Hillsong.  Or, you know, I mean, yeah, Paula White did that.  That doesn't surprise me.  And a lot of times I have a, you know, I look at it and for me it's just kind of old news or whatever.  But every now and then I get something in my email that happens in the world of theology that is just flat out demented.  And I'm at a loss for words.  as far as what did I just see?  What was that?  And this week, someone sent me a video by Kenneth Copeland doing a blood oath and demonstrating it as a Christian thing.  It's just so bizarre.  And I watched it a couple times, and I'm thinking, I literally don't even know exactly if I know what I just saw.  That was weird.  And I want to show it to you and just give some commentary along the way.  I've kind of prepared this video for you.  And I had to edit it out because the way he talks, he's so sporadic and he's really kind of spacey.  And he'll say something and there'll be like almost a minute of silence.  And so I kind of cut it down for you just so you could see what it was.  But let me turn the echo cancellation on.  And here we go.  Let me just play just a little bit of this video and explain to you along the way what is happening. ",

I tried to write some notes down and kind of get some thoughts together for you on what this is.  But I was at a loss of what to say.  I'll just say this, that there's two ordinances of the local church.  There's believer's baptism.  It's not infant baptism.  It's believer's baptism by immersion, meaning after somebody believes on Christ and professes their faith in Christ, they are to be baptized, like the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 8.  And that's what... It's taught clearly in the New Testament, but also communion, the Lord's table.  And it is a picture.  It is a symbol.  Both of them really are symbolic in nature in that they picture something that God has done for you.  The broken body of Christ, the unleavened bread, and then, of course, the blood of Christ, the grape juice.  It is symbolic.  Now, the Catholic Church teaches something called transubstantiation.  And so I'm going to just pull up a Catholic Mass picture for you and just show you what they do.  When they have a Catholic Mass, what they're doing is they are actually performing a ritual.  And I'll just pull some of this up here for you.  They're performing a ritual in front of everyone where they are actually literally doing through some prayer, which I call it a spell, they are taking the... wine and bread, and they are actually performing a ritual over it so that it actually transforms into the literal blood and literal body of Jesus Christ.  And you literally eat the literal blood and literal body of Jesus Christ.  This is Catholic teaching.  This is what they teach.  Now, the Bible does not teach that.  It teaches that it's symbolic, of course, in nature.  And I just want to show that to you.  But that's what they're doing when they do that in the Mass.  What Kenneth Copeland just did is very similar to that.  Let's just back that up just a bit. ",
