No, that's going to be at the police department across the street.  No, it's usually here.  I don't need a public records from the police.  I need from the city hall.  What exactly?  public records requirement?  Government contracts with private contracts.  Can I get a 94, please?  All right.  You have to be a little bit more detailed.  Well, I was hoping I could just get a form and just possibly mail it back.  A request form for what kind of government forms?  Information.  Public records.  You have to be more specific because it is big building.  There's a lot of services here.  So what specifically is it that you would like information on?  Well, I want to sit down and... and think what I want to request first.  So if you have a form, I can take it home and do it on my own time.  Okay, so you don't know what you're looking for?  Correct.  All right, I just wanted a form to see if there's a public request, any kind of information.  Public records, yes.  Okay.  Public, what is it, right to public information?  Okay, all right.  If there's nothing specific he's asking.  Can you call up to the city managers and see the attorney's office and see if they have anything like that?  Your request form, anything like that?  I think the city attorney's office.  Wyckoff, let me ask you a question.  Officer Wyckoff, yes.  How serious do you take your oath to the Constitution?  I don't know what you're doing.  I can help you with the services, but... I mean, didn't you take an oath?  I don't have to answer any of your questions.  I mean, come on, your oath to the Constitution, it should be something you should be proud about, right?  Don't you think?  Did you get somebody on the phone?  Don't you think, officer?  You sought to protect the Constitution.  I'm not asking... How come... you feel you feel entitled to think.  i have to answer you because you're a public servant.  i don't have to answer your question.  yes you do.  yes you do you work for us?  okay you're a public servant.  you're in a public building financed by tax dollar.  i don't have to answer any of your questions.  why not isn't it your job to be courteous and professional?  are you requesting backup?  are you calling for backup?  Do you feel intimate?  We're going to see if we can find you a form.  Okay, cool.  And then, unless there's anything else we can help you with, as far as what services we can offer you here, and then we're going to ask you to leave, okay?  I'm not doing anything wrong.  No one said you can.  Oh, my God.  Why so many police here?  Why are you guys running in here?  Who's running?  You guys stormed.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to see.  Yes, I told you I'm working on a video.  This is a public look.  let me explain to you something.  it's a public building and I'm conducting business.  I'm working on a story, which means I'm engaged in a constitutionally protected right.  This is a public building.  She can't request for me to leave.  Ma'am.  Someone's going to come down.  Okay, cool.  Cool.  But hold on.  Hold on.  No, you're being a tyrant right now.  You're telling me.  No.  Someone's coming down to assist you.  Cool.  Cool.  Okay.  I got that.  Okay.  I got that.  I got that.  That's all that needs to be done.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Right now you're being disorderly because you're telling me to leave.  Sir, what is your beef here?  Why are you telling an officer that she's being disorderly?  Because she's disturbing my peace.  That's your opinion.  Disturbing your peace?  She's disturbing my peace, yes.  You do understand.  you're in a public place, right?  Correct.  That means that I have the right to be here.  You understand that our job is public safety.  Correct.  And no one's unsafe here right now.  You're here for business.  I am.  And it's happening, correct?  Yes, but why do we need one, two, three, four, five... Because you're acting aggressive.  Aggressive?  Yes.  Specifically, how have I been aggressive?  Specifically.  Are you getting your form?  Is it happening?  Answer my question, sir.  Specifically, how have I been aggressive?  I haven't been aggressive.  You guys stormed in here like something's going on.  You guys are the ones with guns.  I just have a camera.  Look, even he has a gun.  I just have a camera and you guys are storming in here over the First Amendment.  I just asked her her name and batch number and she feels intimidated in some way and calls for backup.  I've done nothing wrong.  I'm actually a private independent journalist working on a story about the city of Port St.  Lucie.  And we're trying to see if our public servants in Port St.  Lucie, Florida are courteous and professional.  We have millions of views.  We're never disorderly.  We're never aggressive.  And we have millions of people that see our work.  We're trying to see if you, Dominguez, uphold your oath to the Constitution.  If you, what's your name, sir?  John.  We want to see if you, what is it, Beiger?  Beiger.  Beiger, I'm sorry.  We're trying to see if you're courteous and professional.  We're trying to see if Morel, Morel?  You got it.  Morel?  You got it, yeah.  Okay, we're trying to see if Morel is nice to us.  We're bringing awareness on freedom of the press, okay?  I shouldn't have to explain myself, but because of the fact that I have... Five armed officers right here thinking that I'm being aggressive or disorderly in any way, which I'm not.  You guys should uphold your oath to the Constitution and protect my rights.  Are you guys going to request that I leave after that?  Because that's my point right there.  You see, I'm not loitering because I'm working on a story that generates revenue that I pay taxes for.  Which means I'm doing official business here.  I do.  But the point is, I don't need to do the paperwork.  The video is my official business.  I'm not impeding the business here in any way.  I'm not being disorderly.  I'm not being loud.  I'm not being nasty.  Although the First Amendment protects me.  To be loud, because when you go to a protest, everybody's loud, right?  But start protesting by yourself, and then you're disorderly.  You also got to keep in mind.  we're in a state of emergency, COVID-19.  Oh, I understand.  We can't just have you running around.  And you're actually in here without a mask, and you request masks.  I was hoping that you get to the mask part.  I was hoping that you get to the mask part.  Yes.  It's only, like you said, it's only a request, ma'am.  We can nicely refuse.  You see?  We can also refuse for you to be in here for the safety of everybody else.  You're not understanding, ma'am.  So why don't we do that?  Listen.  Are you guys going to back this up?  Is she in charge?  So you're exposing people in here.  So why don't we walk out, sir?  And we're going to get you that form.  And if I refuse, what's going to happen?  Well, then you're trespassing because I'm asking you to leave.  But for what crime?  Because now you're exposing people without a mask on.  Ma'am, it's not allowed.  Can you tell me what law?  Yes, sir.  St.  Lucie County.  Is it a law?  It's a St.  Lucie County order, which makes it a misdemeanor.  Okay, okay, okay.  So now I'm going to tell you something.  There are exceptions to that rule.  I am medically exempt.  What's your name?  I'm medically exempt.  What's your name?  Okay, so let me speak.  Sir, I'd rather speak with you.  So why don't you talk outside?  Because you don't have to be in here.  Ma'am, I do.  I'm waiting for my form.  Can you get the form outside?  That's very rude.  Come on, it's cold.  Because it's cold.  But you have a screen.  But come on, ma'am.  This is our building.  I'm not doing anything wrong.  What's your problem with me?  How?  Specifically.  You have to be specific if you're going to say that.  Freedom of the, ma'am, because you're being disorderly right now.  You have a gun.  No, it's not an opinion.  It's a fact because you're making me feel uncomfortable, officer.  You're making me feel uncomfortable.  I've done nothing wrong.  We'll wait right here until you get your phone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm working on a story.  She doesn't get what we're doing, but we're bringing awareness on freedom of the press, which means the idiot with the backwards hat and the tattoos can walk around with a camera in a public place, work on a story, and publish it.  This is a public building funded by tax dollars.  That uniform you're wearing, officer, with all due respect, we bought it.  I also pay taxes.  With our tax money.  Oh, just yours?  Just yours.  Would you like the mask?  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  Because you know what?  I wear a mask everywhere I go.  Because if I want to conduct business with Walmart, then I have to obey by their policy.  But this is our building.  You guys are wearing your mask because you're working.  You're at work.  Your job policy says that you have to wear the mask.  But I'm not at work.  the government can request.  No one's going to jail for a mask, okay, for not wearing a mask.  You guys can't do that, okay?  We can nicely refuse.  We can nicely refuse.  You can't take somebody to jail for not wearing a mask.  We don't want to take you to jail.  But that's the thing.  You can't.  Even if you wanted to right now.  Even if you wanted to.  We want to be really accommodating to you, okay?  So as soon as we get you that form, anything else you think we can help you with, we want to work with you, okay?  Okay.  We want to make this happen.  So there's no reason to make me feel uncomfortable.  Do you need anything else from us, guys?  Because we came in here because we're under the oppression.  Because, yeah, no one is causing a disturbance here.  You're going to walk around and you're going to film and we're done.  Do you need anything from us?  I'm just going to walk around and film, brother.  That's it.  I'm not bothering nobody.  Walk around and do it.  Thank you.  Can you take her with you?  Because she's not going to allow me.  If she's not going to allow me to walk around, please don't leave.  I need their help.  They're being reasonable.  You're not.  I'm going to walk around, officers, without bothering anyone.  She needs to not bother me.  You need to not bother me.  So I understand you're requesting public information.  Yes, and I'm also requesting walking freely at the city hall without being harassed by the police.  All right.  So first up is talk with her about what it is that she can help you with as far as a form.  He has nothing specific he said.  You guys don't have an official form?  Everything's done electronically.  Okay, so maybe you can give me the email that I can, I don't know, maybe your email or something.  I can send whatever I need and you can return it back to me.  Yeah, let me go get you my card.  I don't think I have mine here.  Excuse me, sir.  Sir.  I'll be right back, sir.  No problem.  Is there a form specifically?  No, there is no form.  We've moved everything electronically, so there's a link.  So I'll provide that to him.  I'll be right back, sir.  Okay.  Can I come up?  Sure.  Okay, cool.  Thanks.  You can if you want.  You can if you want.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You see, the police was harassing me.  And if I don't stand up for my rights and exercise my right to freedom of the press, they would have bullied me around.  She was bullying me.  And she called an army of cops to come in here just because I was walking around filming and I just wanted to do a public records request.  I go around the entire country doing this.  You're very nice and very professional.  You're welcome.  Do you feel like you owe me an apology?  For what?  For making me feel uncomfortable?  I'm not responsible for how you feel, sir.  Well, you are because you're a person with a gun and you're giving me orders, right?  And you don't care?  That's why your friends didn't back you up.  Yeah, no, I am.  Listen, I'm on my way out because you know what?  I am on my way out.  But I would like to let you know that you've been owned by Auditing America.  Share, like, and subscribe.  Okay?  A lot of people are going to see this.  Think about what you did.  Think before you speak.  Because you're at work and you have to be nice to people.  Good luck with everything.  Good luck to you.  And don't treat people like that.  The First Amendment is the First Amendment.  Freedom of the press.  Freedom of speech.  That's why Mr.  America does what he does. ",
