            "text": "Thank you.  How do women talk to themselves?  How do they motivate themselves?  What are their memes like?  What memes do they have on their social media feeds when you look at them?  Did your exes or other women you're going out on dates with speaking in meme speak in girl power memes and you just think it's quaint and cute?  I can't believe sometimes how we let these things slide, particularly today where it's no joke.  I want to expand on a topic that Quasimandias spoke about a couple of weeks ago that I had an interesting thought about.  He relayed a story about how in his past, the women he went out with privately had vision boards.  And if you don't know what that is, the modern version recently was the Oprah-styled secret, where if you believe in something \u2013 and there's a big market of women that are into this \u2013 That if you just focus your energy on something, you can make anything materialize.  If you really, really just believe that you are someone who's rich, then it's just a matter of time before it just happens.  It's akin to scrapbooking.  They cut up pictures of what they want and they stick it in these scrapbooks.  And it's a way of sending the universe these images out.  And surely they'll get it eventually.  Sort of like a kid waiting for Santa Claus to give them presents.  Everywhere I tend to look, women's memes are centered around soundbites of smug cruelty.  And they're always somehow the queen, the powerful, the one that gets ahead no matter what.  They're smart.  You're stupid.  Or their memes resemble philosophical ambiguity.  that doesn't mean anything, like believe and the universe will make your dreams come true without any effort on your part, without any action.  You deserve it because you're wanting it so much, because you're wanting it so hard.  That's the calm version.  the heightened and angry version is, I'll take anything I want because I'm the queen.  None of which make attractive qualities, nevermind feminine qualities for a potential partner, but anyone you'd want near you in your personal life, a friend or otherwise.  What is interesting to me?  that whether you look at their scrapbooks, you look at the pictures they stick down, you look at what they're wanting, you see materialistic, symbolic representations, symbols of happiness.  And it really tells you, it reveals a lot about what happiness is for a woman.  Nowhere are words that convey the values of things she wants, her principles, human attributes that she would want in another person that she wants in her own life, even if it's not symbolizing a man.  Instead, she sticks pictures down of materialistic objects and squints her eyes really, really hard.  and desperately wishes for her fairy godmother to tap her on the head and bestow.  riches and financial security and representations are like that, their happiness.  It's the appearance of things she wants, the appearance of happiness, not the substance of what happiness is.  That's what I find interesting.  The symbolic appearance of happiness is generally what women put on their vision boards, is generally what women want to will out of the universe that symbolizes their happiness.  There's very little substance revolving around words that describe values, you know, the important stuff, the stuff that would differentiate one person from another.  The appearance of happiness is what a woman wants, the symbolic, materialistic appearance, the security that that brings, not the context, not the substance.  Your values as a man aren't on her vision board.  Your suit may be, your car may be, the house, ring and children you may provide her may be, but not you.  as a individual specific human that has certain values that she wants.  I doubt they're on her vision board.  Because remember this, gentlemen, the typical girl power memes, even the low-level ambiguous philosophical ones that mean nothing like, I trust in the universe to give me everything.  Why isn't the universe giving me everything?  I'm really, really wanting it, but I won't lift a finger to get what I want.  Don't forget, gentlemen, when you come across women like this, that expect the universe to bestow onto them all the good things in life, and you meet someone like that, guess what?  You become a proxy for the universe.  Why aren't you, as a guy like the universe, why aren't you giving her everything she wants?  Because simply, she just wants it.  That is, in this grandiose way, she expects the universe to give her everything she wishes for because somehow she's that important.  The universe cares.  And she's always operating in this way.  A man comes in her life, treats her like a goddess.  You're the universe substitute.  You better be giving her everything.  You are a stand-in for the universe that hasn't given her everything she wanted up until now.  And you better give it to her now.  And when you talk to these people, when you're sitting across from them trying to have a conversation, trying to see what they think, are they really not saying anything and all they're doing is spitting out memes?  Just like when you talk to people about current world affairs, they just seem like a tape recorder that you've pressed play and they're regurgitating everything the media's told them.  In the same way, when you ask women, particularly when you're having a personal conversation about life and so forth, are the words coming out cliche bumper sticker memes?  Pay attention to what those memes sound like.  Are they modern pop psychology memes like The Secret that mean nothing?  Are they girl pal memes?  Are they materialistic?  Do they actually reveal any virtual character in this person?  Don't dismiss these things, gentlemen, especially if you are the opposite.  If you're a person of depth and you come across a pretty person that has no depth, I'm sorry, gentlemen.  What kind of a life do you think you're going to have?  What kind of time can you enjoy spending with this person?  It'll be dangerous for one.  They don't have their own thoughts and values.  They're being fed their thoughts and values.  They say everything the media says.  They say everything political correctness says.  They say everything girl power says, and they agree with it.  They are coffee shop.  They don't have the purple hair.  They look feminine.  But the more you talk to these people, really pay attention.  Don't do idle chitchat.  Don't talk about the weather.  Don't talk about the food.  Talk about what she believes in certain situations between people.  What her thoughts on how men and women should treat each other in this situation and that, and is this right?  or is this right?  And if all her thoughts are memes and you don't really like those memes and red flags are popping up left, right, and center in the back of your head, don't ignore them, gentlemen.  So whenever I hear women say, oh, I want love, Really?  It doesn't look like you want love.  It's not on your vision board.  Anyway, let me know your thoughts below, guys.  Have you ever come across these women's vision boards of them talking about the secret or willing the universe to give them what they want?  And when you see their vision boards or when you hear what they want, it's usually symbolic representations or materialistic things, never human qualities, never words that contextualize the values that they want.  They're not human things.  They're material things.  And don't forget to subscribe, guys.  As always, hit the bell icon and hit all on the dropdown.  Share my videos on your social media.
