            "text": "So we're watching Dumplin'.  And yeah, the shirt that Willowdean is wearing, I have that shirt.  I have that exact shirt.  This movie was made for me.  Me and me alone.  Okay, bye.  So unlike Willowdean, a cute boy that likes me did not give me these sunglasses for my birthday.  But I was listening to the book and completely forgot that that's what Bo does.  And as I was listening to the part for her birthday, I was wearing red heart-shaped sunglasses.  Hello, everybody.  Princess here.  And I'm actually not talking about Chris Evans for once.  Y'all have been not necessarily hounding me, but certainly I felt like there was always a level of expectation that I was going to make a review of the movie Dumplin' because not only am I, you know, a fat content creator on the internet, but also I read Dumplin' a couple years ago and did a book review of that as well.  And also, like, if you follow me on any social media, you know just how much I love Julie Murphy.  I just, like, had a lot of things happening around the time that the movie initially came out on Netflix, and then I had, like, a million other ideas, including Chris Travaganza.  That's why it took me so long to actually do this review.  I thought again about doing this review, but I hadn't read the book in so long.  And when Sarah and I had talked about the book, she started talking about these things that, like, I could not recall at all.  And I just wanted a refresher on the book before I dove into this movie review.  And then, of course, I also had to rewatch the movie to remind myself of what's in that as well.  The timing had to work out perfectly for all of this to happen.  So going into the movie, I was really excited.  I do really love this movie for a lot of very personal reasons.  Watching the movie for this review is like the fourth time that I viewed it, and I still cry at certain points because there are just some very poignant moments that like hit home with me.  I mean, including, you know, in the first... 6 minutes of the movie, Willowdean is wearing this very shirt.  Dumplin' as a story and Julie Murphy as an author mean a lot to me.  I just want you to know, like, what level of enthusiasm and emotional vulnerability I'm going into this video with.  I don't know how else to say what I felt about the movie, except that I felt seen.  If you were to ask me if I liked the book or the movie better, I don't know if I could answer.  I like them both in different ways for different reasons.  I don't think that they tell the same character journey.  Book Willowdean is trying to figure out who she is in the context of the relationship she's conducting, and Movie Willowdean is much more concerned with trying to figure out how to live without her Aunt Lucy.  Aunt Lucy is to Willowdean as, honestly, Julie Murphy is to me.  So that's why I'm getting worked up.  I remember when Dumplin' the book came out and I was like, okay, it's just about a fat girl that enters a beauty pageant.  And I didn't want to read it.  There was like an irrational fear of seeing myself on a page and having to like reconcile knowing that I was being represented a fat character.  I definitely had some fatphobic tendencies that were ingrained that I had to unlearn.  Dumplin' really helped me, like, figure out how to talk about certain things without feeling ashamed or without feeling like I was pushing myself into a group I didn't want to be in, because this group that I have pushed myself into now is full of vibrant, wonderful, beautiful people, and I regret having those feelings, but also don't.  If I had never had those feelings, I wouldn't know to grow past them.  Because the movie came out after the book, obviously, it didn't like push me in any direction because I had already been put in that direction that I needed to be in.  The movie just like reinforced those feelings of validity.  Let's try to stop talking about emotions and go into content.  says the Enneagram Type 5.  In case you don't know what Dumplin' is about at all, it's about a young fat girl whose mother is a former pageant queen and runs a pageant in Texas.  Her late aunt Lucy is her only, like, positive fat role model.  And in the wake of Lucy's passing, she and her mom are trying to reconcile their relationship, but also they're trying to go through all of Lucy's belongings, and in doing so, Willowdean finds an application for the pageant that Lucy had started to fill out and never submitted.  And she decides then and there that she's going to enter the pageant partially for Lucy and partially to also try to dismantle the establishment of the the pageant, but that kind of falls apart.  It's not just like Julie Murphy just forgot about it, it's like the characters focus their energies elsewhere.  It doesn't end up being about the pageant, it ends up being about the group of girls that she inevitably joins, or they just kind of like surround her, and then they all make each other better.  The unfortunate thing about the movie is that it kind of dwindles.  her friend group down from like four girls to three, which doesn't sound like a lot, but the one girl that they cut is pretty important, I think.  And I don't want to make excuses for excluding a disabled or disfigured character from a story that they are actually canonically a part of.  But I will say that initially the rights to the movie were picked up by Disney, and then Disney just decided they didn't want to make Dumplin' and instead put their time and money into these god-awful remakes.  And Julie Murphy actually spoke a little bit on this topic on the She's All Fat podcast.  I'll link the episode in the description below.  Basically, Jennifer Aniston and a few other producers bought the rights from Disney and made it independently, and then Netflix just picked it up for distribution.  A group of people wanted to see a movie starring a fat girl.  they made it happen.  I think from here I'm just gonna go into pros and cons.  I love the movie.  Daniel McDonald does such a wonderful job with Willowdean, but the star of the movie is really Maddie Ballio?  I just have to say Millie Mitchell-Chuck is a perfect sunshine queen.  Well, I made yours yellow because you remind me of sunshine, so... She deserved to win the pageant, but the fact that she doesn't is, it's fine.  She beats out all these skinny girls and is the first runner-up because she is talented and smiley and beautiful and amazing and... I already said talented, but I want to say it again.  For what the cast is, I do really like them.  I don't remember the guy's name that plays Belle, but he's like really cute.  Also, I'm really glad that this was made by an independent company or just like independently because nobody made him shave his arms.  The flashbacks with Lucy are... so special and inherently meaningful, and they show Lucy wearing a bathing suit, and they show Lucy dancing with Willowdean, and just like basically raising her to be a woman that isn't ashamed of what she looks like.  It's not something that a lot of young fat people get.  Watching this movie is emotional for me on a personal level, but also thinking about other people seeing it and having a reaction that's even similar to mine makes me so happy that I cry.  Lucy's dolly themed room that Willowdean goes into for comfort.  Knowing that that room is all about community and comfort and safety makes that addition worth it, for sure.  The chemistry between Willowdean and Belle is tangible.  It's tangible in the book too, but because there's so much less of Beau in this movie, it has to be, like, cranked up to really come across to the audience, and it does.  I sat there, like, squealing because he's just adorable and very clearly really likes her.  From start to finish, the scene where they go to dolly night at the hideout, always always makes me emotional.  No wonder your Aunt Lucy never took you here.  Lucy who?  Lucy Dixon.  She's good people.  I cried in the car listening to the book.  I cried watching the movie again.  I can't tell you if I cried the first time that I read the book because it's been so long that I just don't remember, but it's very likely.  Okay, I'm like hurting my head trying to remember another like good pro.  to mention that isn't just, oh I liked this thing.  So I'm just gonna move into the cons.  I think Beau has his own very emotional journey to take in the book.  He has a lot of bad decisions to make up for in the book that are not ever touched in the movie.  To be fair, the book isn't about Beau's journey whatsoever.  We don't really get anything super deep and emotional with Beau.  We don't get anything about him suddenly showing up at Willowdean's school.  And that freaking her out, we don't get anything about Willowdean being so uncomfortable working with him when she messes up their relationship that she leaves Harpies and goes to work at the Chili Bowl and is miserable and making less money and only stays there because she can't fathom going to face Beau again.  I know that that is not the point of the story, but I think it plays very heavily into Willowdean learning about who she is.  We couldn't have the red sunglasses?  There's no Mitch in this movie, and that's okay.  It's not necessarily a con in the way of, like, I hated the movie because of it or anything.  He is kind of Willowdean's only friend for a while.  There is almost nothing in the movie in the way of Lucy and Rosie.  There's, you know, a few brief mentions of how they were both fat as kids.  It is harder for big girls.  I was one, I know!  And Rosie lost the weight and became a pageant queen and Lucy never did.  And Rosie seems to think that Lucy's weight had to do with why she passed away so young.  You were always so focused on her weight.  You never even really got to know who she was.  Rosie coming to terms with her broken relationship with her sister after Lucy has passed away is what helps Rosie realize that she needs to fix her relationship with Willowdean in order for her own daughter to be happy.  So it's not that I mind that Lee is the one that makes a dress for Willowdean, but in the book, Rosie finds a dress for Willowdean or helps Willowdean find a dress and says that she won't approve it because of how it sits on Willowdean's body, even though Willowdean is comfortable and she likes the dress and she honestly likes how she looks in it.  I feel like that could have made the movie a little bit stronger and really wouldn't have added more than five minutes to the whole runtime.  And I think it could have earned it.  There's just a little bit more like character development with Rosie in the book.  So Hannah Perez in the book is a woman of color, and she's queer, also has big buck teeth that she gets made fun of for.  And there's a conversation between Willowdean and Hannah at a sleepover at Millie's house.  Willowdean says, Hannah, I want to ask you a question.  It's rude, but I'm not asking to be rude.  Shoot, she says.  Why haven't you ever gotten your teeth fixed?  Why should I have  to?\".  she retorts immediately.  Her voice softens as she adds, plus it's expensive.  You're right, I say.  You shouldn't have to.  In the movie, Hannah is very funny, but I think they also could have and probably should have made more choices.  And to be very honest, I would be more satisfied with how little Beau is in this movie if Hannah had been a bigger part.  And speaking of Hannah, along with Hannah comes a character named Amanda from the book who wears orthopedic shoes, and this is why I think you could read it as disfigurement even though it's not spoken of as a disfigurement in the book.  Essentially she's either disabled or disfigured or both maybe.  She and Millie get along because they live their lives exactly how they need to according to their own statutes and rules and their own personalities.  And I recognize that to some level that does give them quite a bit of privilege.  Amanda, Hannah, and the queer people at the hideout open Willowdean up and make her a better person just by being themselves, essentially.  They teach her how to be herself by being their own people.  The fact that like half of this is missing.  I don't want to say it diminishes the movie or makes it not worth watching because, I mean, I've seen it four times and I cry every time.  I just think that it definitely could have made the movie stronger than it already is.  The movie functions well as a story about a young fat girl learning to cope with the death of her only fat mentor, the only person that has ever supported her as a fat person.  Ellen even goes far enough to say, I never thought of you as fat.  Even though she is, and it's not offensive that she is.  She shouldn't be ashamed of it.  She shouldn't have to fix it.  The book does more work.  It has more room to do the work.  But there are certain things that I think it could have had the room to do.  if they move some things around.  Or if Disney had just made the damn movie in the first place.  Overall, I love the book and I love the movie.  They both make me emotional.  They both call me out on some bullshit that I used to do.  What are your favorite parts of the book or the movie, Dumplin'?  Those are all the thoughts that I have.  Thank you so much for watching this video.
