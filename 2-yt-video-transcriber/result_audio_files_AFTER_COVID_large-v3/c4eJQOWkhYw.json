            "text": "Hello and welcome back to the channel.  I'm going to take this time to dive more into the history of January 1st or what they call New Year's.  I kind of touched on New Year's yesterday where I explained how this is actually not the real New Year.  So if you want to, you can take a look at that video.  I'm giving you more of a history of what New Year was like back in the day.  But in this video, I want to talk about how slaves actually dreaded this day, okay, that they call New Year's.  And the reason was New Year's was a time when many slaves were separated from their families.  So after I share this history with you, if you want to continue to celebrate New Year's in the way that is being celebrated, I've done my part.  There's nothing I can do about that.  You can continue on in the tradition that's been handed down to you by our oppressors or you can look at it for what it is and learn from there and grow from there.  so anyway there's an article on time.com and it shares a bit of history as to what our ancestors had to deal with on january 1st or what they call the new year.  it says americans are likely to think of new year's eve and new year's day as a time to celebrate the fresh start that a new year represents.  first of all let me just say this again you can't start a new year or fresh start in the dead of winter.  okay that's what the other video was talking about how historically um a new year started in the spring.  but anyway i'm not going to stray off into that.  you can go check that video out Okay, but there is also a troubling side to the holiday's history.  In the years before the Civil War, the first day of the New Year was often a heartbreaking day for enslaved people in the United States.  In the African American community, New Year's Day used to be widely known as Hiring Day or Heartbreak Day.  as the African American abolitionist journalist William Cooper Nail described it, because enslaved people spent New Year's Eve waiting and wondering if their owners were going to rent them out to someone else, thus potentially splitting up their families.  The renting out of slave labor was a relatively common practice in the Antebellum South and a profitable practice for white slave owners and hirers.  Hiring Day was part of the larger economic cycle in which most debts were collected and settled on New Year's Day, says Alexis McCrossin, an expert on the history of New Year's Eve and New Year's Day and a professor of history at the Southern Methodist University who writes about Hiring Day in her forthcoming book.  Some enslaved people were put up for auction that day or held under contracts that started in January.  These transactions also took place all year long and contracts could last for different amounts of time.  these deals were conducted privately among families friends and business contacts and slaves were handed over in town squares on courthouse steps and sometimes simply on the side of the road.  So this is why it's very important to understand the history behind all of these holidays that are celebrated here in the U.S But we blindly follow these things.  If I remember, I will leave the link in the description area so that you can finish the rest of this article.  OK, very interesting stuff to read here.  But our people, we blindly follow after these holidays and we say, well, that's in the past.  When a day represents something, why would you want to celebrate it and take on a whole new meaning?  For some of you, it means you can go shoot off your guns and you can fire off your firecrackers or your, what do they call these things, fireworks or whatever.  So you look at it as a day of celebration, but you don't look at the historical point of view of how our people were separated.  Families were separated, torn apart, sold, auctioned off, And as they said, some were traded right on the side of the road.  But we have such a disrespect for our history to where we disregard these things that we just take on the customs of others, take on their beliefs.  take on their pattern of doing things, all in the name of fun and entertainment.  Some of you use that as a day to get together with family.  And this Christian thing of watch night, I don't know where that came from, you know?  But anyway, these celebrations and these holidays, and some people call them hellidays, that are celebrated here in Western culture, They need to be examined.  They need to be understood.  They need to be researched because we unknowingly celebrate things that were detrimental to our people, things that were harmful to our people.  Of course, when you look at Thanksgiving, that's a good example of knowing and understanding history and how it can change your outlook on things.  The textbooks will tell you that that was a time where pilgrims and Native Americans came together to celebrate a specific day.  But history reveals the truth about Thanksgiving.  That was a day or a time of slaughter of the Native Americans by the pilgrims.  OK, but they celebrate it as a victory for them.  But they can't put the truth in history books because it will make them look really, really bad.  But if you research the history of Thanksgiving, you may not want to celebrate it.  But of course, we have shared the history of Thanksgiving with many people and some reject it.  they're like well that was then.  this is now.  it means something different now.  no it doesn't.  those who established thanksgiving they established it for their victory of slaughtering native americans.  but now you want to take on their custom so that you can have a day to come together and celebrate and pig out.  you even dress your table the same way they do You see, not realizing that you are being a partaker of their sand.  So understanding the history of these holidays or these hellidays, as some call them, is very important.  We've got to draw the line somewhere.  Do we want the truth?  Do we want to build on a foundation of sand or do we want to stand on solid rock?  We have to choose ye this day.  History is important.  Understanding history is very important.  And we've got to draw a line of separation between paganistic or heathen celebrations and depart from that.  The truth is what it is.  I know it's hard to hear because people love their traditions, but the truth is more important than your traditions.  So based on what I've shared with you about New Year's, and I'm going to share the link to the article so that you can get more understanding of this.  Do you want to celebrate a day to where your ancestors, my ancestors, were being separated, families torn apart, families auctioned off, some never to see each other again?  You want to help celebrate that by the very people who did such things?  The ball is in your court.  I've shared the details.  Now you can do with it what you will.
