            "text": "If you're a true American, watch this whole video and help me expose this clown.  Colin Kaepernick was born half white and half black.  He was put up for adoption by his white mother because his black dad decided to not be there.  And he was adopted by a white couple by the names of Rick and Teresa Kaepernick.  His dad Rick is the vice president of a company called Hilmar Cheese Company.  So you black people who idol Colin Kaepernick and think that he grew up just like you in the projects or in a shitty place, you're dead fucking wrong.  Colin went to a nice high school and got a scholarship to the University of Nevada, Reno.  Colin played six years in the NFL and then eventually got kicked out because of his antics on the field.  So hi Colin, let's dig into this for a second, why don't we?  You were a player in the American Football League.  American.  Yet you kneel over issues that are one, ignorant, and two, you have never dealt with.  Then after crying for a few years, you get another shot and have a workout where a whole bunch of NFL teams are willing to come to watch you.  I've been ready for three years.  I've been denied for three years.  We all know why.  And you wear a Kunta Kinte shirt to your workout.  For those of you who don't know who Kunta Kinte is, he is a fictional African slave.  Were you ever on a plantation?  Have you ever dealt with police brutality?  I've met people like you in my life, and I'm not talking about all this other BS.  I'm talking about someone who was given everything as a kid, and if you weren't given it, you threw a fit until you did get it, and your parents didn't know how to say no to you.  Oh, you got called names at school, honey?  Okay, here's a PlayStation, okay?  And your parents didn't smack the shit out of you when you were acting like a spoiled brat.  Shit, if you were my son, I would have booted you out of the house the first time you kneeled, and then you could have called me five years later once you joined the Black Lives Matter movement and tell me how you're doing.  Tell me how that's going.  And then you got the company Nike to get on board with you.  Wow.  You actually made this disgrace of an American one of your cover guys for your brand.  Nike, you are a disgrace to America.  You want to know what a true American patriot thinks of that?  There we go, that looks a lot better.  So now if you wear Nike anything, you are wearing a symbol of hate against America.  So Colin, let's talk man to man for a second.  Or I can talk like your daddy to you because clearly your real dad never knocked any sense into you.  Do you know what July 4th stands for?  It is the birth of American independence.  Do you consider yourself an American?  Are you sure?  Okay, but you call the celebration of July 4th a celebration of white supremacy.  Wow.  Colin, if you haven't figured this out yet, you were raised by white people.  I wonder what the grandpa of those parents that adopted you thinks of that.  If you're an American, do you think it's okay to wear police officers depicted as pigs on your socks at your football practice?  Have you thanked a veteran lately who got his legs blowed off so you have the right to disrespect the flag that he was fighting for?  You say you're an American, but you wear a Fidel Castro shirt to one of your press conferences?  Wasn't he a communist?  What about in 2016 when it was time to vote for Hillary or Trump?  You must have voted for Hillary because she would have supported everything you were saying, right?  Guess what?  You weren't even registered to vote.  I guess you were spending too much time on your knees, clearly.  Are black people today not born with the same freedoms that white people are under the Constitution?  Yes?  are you sure?  are you positive?  there isn't like an appendix in the constitution that says black people need to be treated differently than white people.  you're sure?  okay then shut your mouth stop playing the victim and show that you are a proud american that has reaped all of the benefits of being an american.  you spoiled little princess.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Side piece on my head in case it gets heavy.  Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names.  John Wayne. ",
