            "text": "Hey guys, it's your old pal, Stainable, here, and today we're talking about the Ta-Tunguska event, or as I like to call it, Space 9-11.  Hey!  Don't make fun of 9-11, that is not okay!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go on 4chan and make jokes at the expense of Holocaust victims and gay and lesbian teens who kill themselves.  A Tunguska event took place on June 30th, 1908, when in the dead of night, a loud, bright explosion disrupted the forests, a pine forest in a near river in Siberia.  Pitiful.  It's only caused a disruption in the woods.  My company has contributed to global warming, the extinction of several endangered species, and rising ocean heights.  Bloomberg 2020, he is the poster child of big business.  And it's far better than that demonic Bernie Sanders who eats children for breakfast.  It's his true good, sir.  The blast burned 20,000 square kilometers worth of trees and flattened 500,000 acres of land.  Scientists believe that the blast was either caused by a meteor or a comet.  Um, actually, scientists believe that it was either a comet or a meteorite that hit the Siberian forest that caused the Tunguska explosion.  Since when have you cared about facts?  When I became a conservative.  That's when I started caring about facts.  My point exactly.  Despite having 1,000 times the power of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima blasts, no humans died in the event.  From 1927 to 1930, Lenoy de Kulik, a Russian mineralogist who... For some reason, it looked like a weird, um, demented mixture between the Mythbusters and a Russian Orthodox priest investigated the event in an expedition where nothing but the basic facts of the explosion were found.  The event was investigated again from 1950 to 1961, and again in 1999.  Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my video, learned something, and have a nice weekend. ",
