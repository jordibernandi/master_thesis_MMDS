            "text": "So there have been some developments since we last conducted our live stream.  Speaking about Gail King's very disrespectful questioning about our deceased brother, Kobe Bryant, who has not even been buried yet, but he will be on February 24th at the Staples center.  Now they tried to flip the script here because Snoop Dogg was very upset with the situation because Snoop Dogg knew Kobe Bryant personally.  He knew Vanessa personally.  He knew Gianna personally.  He knew the whole family.  So you're speaking on people that he knew.  Okay.  And what Gail King done, it pissed the black community off, rightfully so.  And I'm, let me say something.  I am proud of the black community that you have came together with one voice and one accord to let the sell out.  black folk like Gail King and Oprah Winfrey know that your disrespect is no longer going to be tolerated.  You see, we know you're bought and paid for because you work for CBS.  We understand that.  We know good and well you're not going to speak on the behalf of the community.  but you don't do that when it comes to people like Harvey Weinstein, when gales and all kinds of pictures with Harvey Weinstein.  Now that should be questionable.  Why are you in the vicinity of this man that's known to do all the things that he's done to women?  And yet I don't hear you Ron Ron and championing anything about Harvey Weinstein because that's your boy.  That's why you're not going to speak anything against Harvey Weinstein.  You're not going to say nothing about Charlie Rose that worked for CBS.  You're not going to talk about Matt Lauer.  You're not going to ask those questions.  But when it comes to anybody black, you want to sit up here and tap dance and make sure you play your role as the black mascot to carry out the message of white supremacy in the airwaves.  And they pay you heavy Gail $5.5 million per year.  what she's paid to do what she's doing.  And I'm glad the community has let her know that no matter how much they pay you is not going to be tolerated no longer.  Oprah got on NBC.  She didn't go on CBS.  We don't NBC saying, Oh, she isn't doing good. ",

            "text": "Well, chastisement don't feel well.  I remember growing up and doing things I shouldn't have.  And when I was chastised, it never felt good.  It made me cry too.  Sure did.  But you know what?  I learned lessons from that.  that kept me out of a lot of trouble that friends that didn't get that particular chastisement, they ended up going to jail or some of them a little worse.  So they try to flip the script on Snoop Dogg and say, Oh, he threatened her.  No, he didn't threaten her at all.  That is a lie.  Snoop talking just like Snoop talk any other day.  Now all of a sudden he's threatening.  He's not threatening.  No.  So Oprah came out and stated, well, I know Snoop Dogg is not going to do anything and he wasn't making threats, but other people could hear his language and react.  Nobody cared about Gail like that.  They don't.  The fact is she's never had anyone check her and that's her problem.  You understand?  And the black community checked her.  But aside from that, this situation for me has gotten way past the situation with the black community.  Gayle King, Snoop Dogg, Oprah, all that.  Now you have former national security advisor, a woman in the Obama administration by the name of Susan Rice.  Now she weighs in.  She never says anything, but she weighs in on a situation with Snoop Dogg.  Let's put that tweet up.  So as you can see, Susan Warrice says this is despicable.  Gayle King is one of the most principles, fair and tough journalists alive.  Lie.  Snoop backed up whatever she's saying off.  You come for Gayle King, you come against an army, you will lose and it won't be pretty.  So now she's being threatened by former Barack Hussein Obama cabinet members.  Interesting.  But, You know, I'll say, what's her vitriol?  Why is she coming out against Snoop Dogg?  I didn't hear her come out against Darren Wilson.  Not at all.  I didn't hear her say anything about George Zimmerman.  What about Michael Slager?  Any of these white police officers that kill black folk?  I didn't hear her say anything about Dylann Roof.  Didn't say a word.  But when it comes to black men, Oh, you ready to bring out an army or are you like, well, is that a threat?  Susan?  Now Susan, I take what you say is a threat because you got access to things.  So we need to say this.  Susan Rice is threatening Snoop Dogg and saying it won't end pretty.  What do you mean Susan?  What do you mean?  And why are you even coming up speaking?  We ain't forgot about Benghazi and the people that were killed in Benghazi.  Nobody forgot about that.  You and the administration you worked for was horrible for Africa.  Horrible.  You sit up there, green lighted, talking about Obama, NATO going in and killing Gaddafi, sending Libya into chaos.  That's why you have slavery in there now.  Then you tried to bring the alphabet commune to Kenya and Kenya ran you out of there.  Say, you keep your aid.  We don't want that over here.  Oh, you was telling them that unless you accept that you ain't gonna get no money from the United States.  And they say, well, we, I guess we ain't getting it then.  And right on for Kenya and other nations for taking that stand.  But this woman has threatened Snoop Dogg.  Now this is the thing.  It shows the continued hatred and anti black behavior of the Democrat party because this woman represents the Democrats and these Democrats got a vitriol for black Americans.  And this is why black Americans every day is becoming sickened by the minute at the Democrat party because you making yourself look too bad these days and you'll be openly hostile to the involuntary builders of America.  Very hostile.  But then I was wondering why her vitriol come from.  Let's put this up.  because I noticed when I see that combination, I noticed the ones who attack black men the most, have that kind of combination with their marriage.  We'll talk with the women because it seems like they got to prove themselves that they're not on black men's side at all when they marry people like her husband.  I've seen it too many times.  I've studied it for awhile and it's like, I gotta be more white supremacist than a white woman could be.  Who is that way?  I have to prove my worthiness cause I don't want him to think that I care for black men.  I don't want him to see me defending black men.  because he's insecure that I may want him.  So I got to make sure to be extremely against the black man.  But Susan writes, you're the last person to talk.  You are the last person to talk.  And this is why every day more and more people are just seeing the deeds, seeing this anti black man venom and hatred.  You see, you think we forgot about Charlie Sheen and how Gail and the rest of them don't talk about Charlie Sheen.  You don't talk about Kevin Spacey or any of these Caucasian males at all.  You remember y'all started to meet to a moment off of them, not black men, but yet black men is the one you want to come after.  And let me tell you something, if anything happened to Snoop Dogg, Susan Rice is behind it because she's sitting up here making threats.  behind Snoop Dogg giving out his opinion and everybody else giving their opinion.  Snoop Dogg wasn't the only one that had an issue with Gayle King.  You just mad that.  Snoop Dogg's platform was big and more people saw what he had to say and they came after Gayle King and rightfully so.  Gayle King was disrespectful and she was handled with that and was chastised.  No one that I know or any person in their right mind said to do something silly.  You, you mad.  See, this is the thing today.  You don't like the pushback.  And I heard okra on NBC saying, you know, social media, it, people could just say anything and be venomous.  because yes, because you want censorship on social media.  Those Democrats, they want social, they want censorship.  They don't want you to have a freedom of speech.  Just like they was mad about a video that Trump posted about Nancy Pelosi and she was mad that Facebook didn't take it down.  Why should they take it down?  You did rip up the speech.  You did.  You did that.  You did it in front of the camera.  You threw it.  You did it.  So you gave the ammunition for that.  So why you want censorship?  See, this is the route they want to go and this is why you don't have the black vote cause they keep saying, where's the black vote?  And you know, you try to put Pete Buttigieg up there, you put black women behind the scenes and try to act like you got black support.  No one supports you.  No one because you have shown us the involuntary builders of America, not no immigrant bill crap.  Black Americans that come from the descendants of African slaves did not come here voluntarily.  They didn't apply for green cards.  They didn't get a visa.  They were put in the bottom of ships.  They were dragged over here to be sold, to be raped, to be pillaged.  to have our culture destroyed.  That's what happened to black Americans is no such thing as some immigrant.  Ain't?  no immigrant built nothing.  My ancestors built this country involuntarily, so I would never let you come around here and say immigrants built America cause you didn't.  It was the slaves that come from Africa built America through free labor.  246 years of slavery.  Another a hundred years of Jim Crow convict leasing, red lining the Ku Klux Klan, everything that we dealt with and then other immigrants at that point walked on our backs to get into America.  That's the true story.  I would never let you say immigrants built America in front of me.  That's a freaking lie.  Show me where you built it.  Show me the slavery that you was in.  If you was a slavery with us, then Hey, you'd been with us.  Now did African slaves build the Caribbean?  Sure they do.  And they deserve reparations for that.  Do much.  We deserve reparations, but we're not going to have other people saying that immigrants built America when you can't even show the proof of that.  When our ancestors, blood and sweat and tears built America, I don't say that with pride because they built it involuntarily and we don't benefit and we don't control it.  The thing is Susan Rice, And people like her want you to get in line.  black folk.  This is what they say behind the scenes.  Them Negroes getting out of line.  Them Negroes got too much mouth now.  I'm talking about these, these black elites.  They, they, they, they are encroaching on our crumbs that we get from the table.  White supremacy.  We can't allow them to mess that up because you understand something.  They got black folks that benefit from white supremacy and wanted to continue and to survive.  Understand that black people.  the Susan Rice's of the world, the Gail King's, the Oprah Winfrey's, all the ones like that, They benefit from that system.  They don't want to be held accountable for what they say and see.  understand some notice some of them coming to their defense, but they're not coming to the offense for real because they don't want to say it.  See that, that's how the devil works.  The devil gets you to do something and then you getting across hairs and then the devil sit back laughing at you.  Always.  It happens that way.  Gail didn't have to say anything like that in that interview.  She didn't want to.  But Susan Rice making threats on Snoop Dogg.  That's very interesting.  You didn't threaten no cop.  You didn't threaten the white supremacist.  You didn't threaten the clan.  I do anything in your tenure, but all of a sudden now you're threatening a black man.  But like I said, we understand why.  Well, leave me a comment.  Let me know.  Think about the situation with Susan Rice threatening Snoop Dogg, former Obama administration, national security advisor, Susan Rice threatening Snoop Dogg.  The thing is we have to understand you guys on social media and the new black media members are making a difference and we shaking the Bule.  And I saw uncle Luke, shout out to uncle Luke.  He had made a comment under Susan Rice that I thought it was interesting.  The hip hop nation fought the Bule before and won.  And they can win again because when you got the ear of the community and when you have the grassroots on your side, the Boulay would never win.  See the Boulay benefit when we're quiet.  That's why you guys need to go to my African diaspora news insider channel and watch my video called the origins of the Boulay, which YouTube demonetized.  There was no cussing in that video, but I was just exposing the Boulay.  Because remember, the boule is Negroes being used by white supremacy.  So they definitely don't want that exposed.  But check that video out if you have a chance.  But Susan Rice and her threats is very interesting. ",
