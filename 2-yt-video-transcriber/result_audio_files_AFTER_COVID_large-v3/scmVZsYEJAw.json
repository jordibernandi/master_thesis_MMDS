            "text": "Every father that has a daughter, don't you want your daughters to love you?  That had to be a good father.  So Miss Gayle, Miss Gayle King.  Miss Gayle, you are my sister.  I love you and I admire the good that you've done, but you were being used on that day to besmirch the memory of a good man, Gail.  You were there to knock down my brother, She did a documentary on, what's his name?  Who?  R. Kelly.  R. Kelly did some bad things.  But there's some fathers in this audience that have raped their daughters.  There's some fathers out there who misuse and abuse their granddaughters.  Kobe did so much good in his life.  Couldn't you find something, Gayle, to say good about your brother, a fellow sufferer?  Mr.  Rose from CBS, he was charged with Abusing women.  You defended him.  Sister Gail, my brother Snoop.  No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  My brother Snoop was angry.  Angry with you because, what you did was so unnecessary.  And so, I defend the good that Gayle has done in her life, but I'm saying to all of you that are in privileged positions with white people, Don't let them use you.  She gave an interview.  My analyst told me 34% of her questions were probing questions to Lisa Leslie, and you kept coming back to the same theme, even though she defended her love for Colby.  Couldn't you find in his 20 years of marriage that he was still married?  Brought us four beautiful girls.  Couldn't you find something to say about the daughter of Father Love and the people telling him he needed a boy to carry on his legacy?  And there was Gianni becoming a basketball savant.  Couldn't you find something to say that he championed the rights of women?  So Sister Gail, though I love you and I love Kobe and I love Snoop, I defend Snoop's anger I defend Snoop's rebuke.  And I defend Snoop's speech.  Now, I don't approve of no man referring to any woman, black or white, with the title of B. At the Million Man March, all of you that were there, you took that pledge.  But in his anger, I defend him from the Quran.  For the Quran says when somebody feels hurt and they use hurtful speech, hurtful speech is justified when you hurt like you hurt.  He was hurt and we are hurt.  But I pray for you, Sister Gail.  I pray that you will recover that lost sense of commitment to your people out of which you came.  your people who were made by the white man.  On the back of their collar, you will see it, made in America.  You can regain your place with us, but not by justifying what you did.  Why don't you just repent?  and say, I'm sorry.  As Snoop said it, he was sorry because mama got on him.  My mama was right, but God is also right.  She did something that provoked hurtful speech from many more people than Snoop. ",
