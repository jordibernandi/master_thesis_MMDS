Something strange is going on in China.  But this idea about a strange pneumonia coming from China had all of my alarm bells go off.  And because of that, we immediately started to develop a vaccine in literally the first week and a half of January of this year.  And then somewhere around February, it became clear that this was not a disease that was inefficiently spread.  It was spread very efficiently and it started to ravage through China.  At that point, I knew, wow, we're in for something that's gonna really be transformative.  Fast forward multiple months, and we're living through one of the most devastating or the most devastating pandemic that we've experienced in well over 100 years.  Breaking news tonight, the coronavirus outbreak declared a global pandemic.  The Incident Command Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine, they're preparing for a sudden surge of patients who need immediate care.

So I took a fellowship down here at the NIH in infectious disease and immunology.  And then that got me interested in doing research because I never thought I really wanted to do research.

Tried to go not only the places you expected, but maybe some places you didn't expect.  Loved hearing him talk a little bit about how he got into medicine in the first place, about how HIV ultimately changed the course of his focus in his career.  Was intrigued to hear him talk about Churchill and John F. Kennedy.  Didn't expect that.  Maybe I should have known Billy Crystal was coming and appreciated what he had to say about the vaccine.  I candidly have been among those who worried not about the things that we'll see immediately, about the things that we may not see until later on.  Hey, I hope you enjoyed this show.  I hope that you're part of this Carlos Watson Show family.  If not, please subscribe.  Definitely tell your good people.  And we've got a beautiful podcast that sometimes extends the conversation.  You might want to give it a try.  Hey, tune into The Carlos Watson Show.  It's like no other.  You're going to enjoy it every weekday on YouTube.  .  .  . ",
