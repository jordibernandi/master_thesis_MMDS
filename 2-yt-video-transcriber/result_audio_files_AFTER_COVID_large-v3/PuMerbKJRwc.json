            "text": "Hey guys, so I took down the videos as a way to hopefully preserve this channel.  I'll post notification videos here, but the real videos will be posted on BitChute.  So the BitChute video is linked in the description, so you gotta be able to click on descriptions from now on.  Also, I request that you let this video play all the way through.  Thumb it up.  if you think the penetrating silence is really worth that thumb up.  You could sort of leave it in the background.  The penetrating silence is just audio, so you don't have to listen to it.  It could just be in the background, and you could just let the video play through, and you may even get a sense of when the video ends.  Maybe leave a comment as well, please, saying whatever you want.  For example... the five reasons why fallout 3 is better than new vegas or whatever.  leave a comment talking about something else like why dogs are better than cats or the advantages of a desktop pc over other computing devices Or the advantages of cords over wireless crap.  And why TJ needs to get cords.  Commenters tell TJ why he needs to use cords and stop using all that wireless crap that has connection issues.  Anyway.  I also humbly request that you thumb up this video, watch it to the end, but only if you think it's a great video.  It's silence for most of it, but let the silence play.  This is an artistic expression.  The silence is penetrating and has some sort of meaning.  It's profound or something.  Also, BitChute has a new comment system.  So comments are available on BitChute now.  So click the description for the real video.  Don't get too excited.  It's long, but it's just me talking.  And there are visuals, but I just put them in the description.  They're not edited in.  So that's what we're doing now. ",
