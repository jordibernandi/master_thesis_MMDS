            "text": "Welcome to five things that only a man deals with in society.  Let's go.  If you don't know what the hovering hand is, you're probably too young or you're a female.  Have you ever noticed how a lot of male celebrities, when they're taking pictures with their fans, they put their arm around them, but their hand is hovering.  It's not touching their body.  It's hovering.  It's called the hovering hand.  This guy is literally the king of keeping his hands to himself.  Literally the fucking king of hovering hand.  Take no chances with absolutely anybody.  Jesus Christ.  Even to Dolly Parton.  Anyways, you get the point.  Not really sure why I'm laughing.  It's pretty sad that they feel like they have to do that.  But why would men feel like they can't simply put their hand on a woman's back?  Could it have anything to do with false allegations, maybe?  Men are so psychologically manipulated and gaslit in society that even that's a double cross for them.  Because on one hand, if they do that, if a girl's leaning in to take a picture and they don't touch her, it can be read as respectful.  On the other hand, if they don't, it can also be looked at as lack of confidence.  So they don't really know what to do.  Oh, and you wonder, why don't men know how to act in society?  Huh.  Number two.  Men are always expected to be in the mood.  Now, before you laugh at me and be like, oh, how shitty it must be to be expected to always get what they get, shut up, okay?  That makes you sound desperate.  It's a real thing.  You don't get to minimize other people's issues just because you have a lack of it.  I know that sounds rude, but I'm just saying it how it is, okay?  Now, therapists have actually shown that men over the age of 40 Sex isn't really a priority anymore.  And even then, in their 30s, in their 20s, work becomes the president.  All the other pressures that they put on men, as well as in relationships, if men are feeling disconnected to their partners, they don't really want to fuck all the time.  And sometimes they will, just to avoid feeling like an asshole, because they feel like they should all the time.  Number three, and probably the most selfish, they always have to make the first move.  Story time.  I was laughing with a friend of mine the other day because he said that Bumble was kind of funny to him because women rarely talk to them.  They give one word answers or they'll wait till like the last second for the timing to time out.  For those that don't know what Bumble is, it's a dating app where you guys have to match each other and the woman has to message first.  Well, there's a flaw with that.  See, we've taught women that men have to make all the first moves.  So now that women are in the position to make the first move, They don't know how to do it!  I for one have always been the one, well, there's been a couple times, but most of the time I'm the one to ask him out on a first date.  Yeah, that means I pay for the first date too.  But first moves isn't always just asking him out on the date.  It's also things like complimenting him on the street.  I compliment men all the time on their beard, the way they walk, their haircut, you know, and they always smile.  They always give me just this genuine smile.  You can tell that it just felt good because they don't get that very often.  We take it for granted.  Now, what is number four?  Um, men die much, much sooner.  57% of the people who are over the age of 67 are females.  Women on average outlive men by five years.  And that comes from Harvard, by the way.  Oh, but Lord knows women love to throw that in men's face.  Now, this is why we live longer.  You live longer because there is nowhere close to the amount of pressure on you that there is on men.  And that is a fucking fact.  Also, there's a lot more attention paid to your mental health than there is to men.  That is a huge contributing factor.  Thank you.  But number five.  Men suck at emotions.  And why do they suck at emotions?  It's not because they don't have them and so it's just this rare thing.  so they don't know how to handle it.  They have them, just like you and me have them, except society gaslights them into believing that they don't have them.  and then if they exhibit their emotions, it's toxic masculinity.  When in reality, toxic masculinity is created by the pressures that society places on men, and in return, their behaviors can become toxic due to that.  Are people still responsible for their own actions?  Absolutely.  But as a society, I think we need to set back and look at, hmm, why is this happening?  Because when an entire classroom fails a test, it's not the whole classroom that's to blame, it's the teacher.  So if we're having a majority A lot of men struggling with their feelings.  Maybe it's time to look at society and ask ourselves what we're doing to contribute to that. ",
