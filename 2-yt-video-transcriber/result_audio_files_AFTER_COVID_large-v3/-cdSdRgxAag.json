            "text": "Good morning, cinnamon bun.  So it is five minutes to seven in the morning.  I don't know why I'm awake so early.  Well, I mean, I have an idea, but I'm just not happy about it.  I couldn't really get to sleep last night.  I was up later than usual.  And I think it's because today is a writing day, but it's also special.  writing day.  I think I'm just a bit nervous and excited and I got to sleep really late and I also woken up really early.  Like I woke up like before six and then I couldn't get back to sleep.  So I've just been listening to a bit of The Adventure Zone in bed and now it's time to actually start getting ready and stuff because I am heading out to meet Kirsty for writing day at 10.30.  So I need to get breakfast and get ready.  Happy vlog day.  I can see all the days, all the coming nights Big words and real thoughts, there's the part that screams your name.  Okay, um... So I just had a quick task to do for the Story Magic Academy there.  I had an Academy deadline that was pretty tough, which I actually had a project to do for it, and I finished that yesterday.  The deadline was yesterday.  So this is my first day of freedom post-deadline.  And... Yeah, I'm dressed and things but I woke up like really hungry and my appetite is just kind of gone.  Or it was gone.  And I just really didn't fancy eating any of the things that I have in my fridge right now.  It's about, what time is it?  Not even eight o'clock yet.  That's crazy.  Yeah, it's five minutes to eight.  And I am up and dressed and I've done my makeup.  It's crazy.  I mean, I guess I could just go in early and get some breakfast before I meet Kirsty.  What do?  What do?  What do?  So we're going to a coffee shop that I've not been to before, which is actually a roastery.  I actually used to work with... both of the guys that run that place.  I've never been there and it's a little bit out of the way and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to eat anything there because gluten.  So my safest option is to be well fed by the time I get there.  So gonna have to eat something.  Maybe I'll just have Weetabix.  Why am I so cranky now?  Am I just hungry?  I am cranky.  Mmm, my eggs are ready, my toast is unready.  Okay.  We're back on.  Okay, don't do it again, don't do it again!  I nearly just burned my toast twice in a row.  That's my alarm just going off right now.  That's how early I woke up.  It's going to sound a little bit batshit, but it's very exciting as well.  I've quit writing North at the end.  I've just decided, like some cosplayers say, I've just done with it.  And so today is day one on my new novel.  It doesn't sound batshit at all.  I never would have suggested to you that you do that, but I do think it's the right choice.  I am a bit sad that I do really like a lot of the characters and stuff.  I did that.  The first novel I ever wrote, I couldn't re-write it from scratch three times because I couldn't let it go.  like the core of it wasn't working but you kept trying to put stuff in it.  Yeah and like I actually made a ton of progress like with like I figured out what wasn't working and stuff.  but then I was like faced with like actually having to redo it all and I was just like this isn't worth it because I think it would still be a good book at the end of it but it's not worth it when my heart isn't in it anymore.  I think you've moved past it.  Yeah exactly I'm a totally different person.  yeah it's.  it reflects my interests and what I cared about like yeah.  you know, almost six years ago, which is crazy.  So yeah, today's day one, new novel.  So exciting.  Yeah, what about you?  That's amazing.  Oh, what's new?  What's a new novel?  Or do you like to not really talk about it until you've done it?  I did this whole decision-making process of, like, writing on the pros and cons, and finally came to this decision, and within an hour of doing that, I was like, cool, I know that I'm doing a novel next, and I know that it's going to be probably this thing.  She was saying, like, what does your novel notebook look like?  And I'm like, so this is mine for this novel that I finished.  Well, full-time teacher.  Right.  Yeah.  That took up a lot of time.  Yeah.  I'm like psychological model.  so I'm like.  I think it does work but I think it's because you think it works.  it's like being passed down to her or it's something that's in her family or that she has.  even it doesn't come naturally to her but she's taken a long time to learn how to do it.  yeah I think I want to.  I think I want to avoid the heritage thing because I feel like that's like almost a cliche at this point, Rhaise.  Yeah.  And I do just want it to be like, it's a craft like anything else.  I suppose the main question is like, what are people doing with it?  Yeah, I need to establish like, what can you do with it?  Yeah.  And what can you not do with it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Good evening.  I have just arrived home.  I went to a place called Dumpling Monkey for dinner for a treat but also because I don't really have much food in the house at the moment and I forgot to take a clip or anything or to take out my camera at all.  I was so focused on like just food now.  But yeah, so I'm home, uh, had a pretty good day with Kirsty.  Um, I started a brand new novel today.  Um, so I got my story seed put together and I chose, I kind of crafted my theme for this story and I identified the central conflict.  I made a start on some of the world building mechanics, cause it is going to be a fantasy story.  So there's going to be some magic and stuff.  So I'm pretty happy with that progress.  I could have gotten into the plot embryo today if I'd remember to bring a fricking pencil, which I did not.  But I think theme and conflict, so internal and external quadrants and a little bit of world building is pretty damn good.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to continuing to work on this.  I'm pretty dang tired now, given how early I woke up and My period is on the way.  I'm just feeling a bit worn out and I'm really looking forward to just getting into my pyjamas and just having a super chill evening.  I have been watching and rewatching Supergirl, Gilmore Girls, Elementary, so I'll pick something nice and I'll just have Really nice, cozy evening.  But it's been a pretty good day and I'm really excited about this story.  And I can't wait to just like bash out a plot embryo for it.  And, you know, throw together a couple of world building mechanics and just like dive into drafting in probably the space of a few days since I had this idea for this story, which is really exciting.  Good night, Cinnamon Bun. ",
