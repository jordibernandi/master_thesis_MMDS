She would take us to the lab after school and on weekends.  When I was a teenager, my first job was cleaning pipettes in my mother's lab.  I was awful, and she fired me.  But other than that, things worked out quite well.  This is Maya and me.  We clearly were wearing bell-bottoms at the time.  And as you can see, I went through a growing spurt.  And so my mother took the hem out the pants.  So that bit out.  Here is a photograph of me and my grandparents.  My grandfather, it's so funny, you will never see him smile in a photograph.  He just did not smile in photographs, but he loved to laugh.  And he had an incredible sense of humor, but you will never see him smiling in a photograph.  He was my favorite person.  We were pen pals forever.  So this is a photograph when I was joining my sorority during a particularly active week.  in front of Rankin Chapel.  That's where we are here, where we would go every Sunday for services.  One of my names was C cubed for cool, calm, and collected.  Ah, here's my wedding day.  And this was the moment when we were told you can now kiss the groom and kiss the bride.  So that's me and my Dougie.  Doug has been a prince.  He has been so supportive.  I love my husband.  Oh, my God.  This is so funny.  So I'm in my car leaving the Capitol after a vote.  And they're walking across the street by himself with like one staff person was Joe Biden.  And I rolled down the window and I was like, Joe, he's like Kamala.  We pulled over and I hadn't seen him in so long.  And we hugged and we talked and then we took a photograph.  and here it is.  That's so great.  I love Joe Biden very much.  It's a great photograph.  We should frame this one. ",
