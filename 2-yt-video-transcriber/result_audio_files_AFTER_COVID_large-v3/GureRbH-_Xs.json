We have the screenshot available on my Twitter because it violated their.  their policies and then it was sort of disseminated and jack dorsey apologized.  he'll have to speak before a hearing.  so for people who haven't heard yet this is a bombshell in new york post.  uh what is it if you have to give them the bullet points?  hunter biden joe biden what's the implication here?

So it makes Joe a complete liar for the last seven years.  It shows that he met with Burisma.  I think it's not on his public schedule.  But we have another one where Hunter Biden was snuck into the back of the State Department.  So he's meeting with the Deputy Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, as it reported, because he had the meeting that would have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  So there are plenty of very, very damning things with regard to Ukraine on the on the hard drive.  The main one being that Joe Biden's been lying for seven years about it and knew all about Burisma as as as you knew was true.  Well, you have to say anything about my son's foreign dealings.  How credible is that?  Right guy is suffering from really massive drug addiction, which the hard drive will make clear.

Biden signed a receipt for it, which I have here.  It said he would have to.  he was going to come back for it.  Two days later, he came back and gave him a part.  And then when it was done, he never came back.  According to the agreement, after 90 days, the hard drive is abandoned under the law, and it belongs to the merchant.  The merchant held it for another three, four months, and then he heard all this talk on television, and he started to get worried.  What do I have here?  This could be criminal evidence.  So he opened it, and he almost fainted.  He said, I never saw anything like this before.  And if you look at the photographs... you'd probably come to that conclusion also.  But then he took a look at the text, and he saw in the text major contradictions to what the Bidens were saying on television, like the one I just told you.

I think you're going to see more emails and text messages that describe how Joe was compensated, how he was getting a portion of this money.  In fact, he was getting a large portion of this money.  And it'll explain also how Joe Biden, who never really made much money, has two or three very, very luxurious homes because he didn't pay for anything Hunter did.  So this is a long term bribery scheme that started at a low level in Delaware with his brother James selling his office, holding the money, taking care of Joe.  And when they got to the big time, they shook down Iraq for, I think, about 500 million.  Ukraine for about 20.  China, I don't know.  I mean, 30, 40 million.  Right.  Oh, gosh, I missed Russia.  3.5 million from the mayor's wife, who is a good friend, by the way.  We're kidding around about Putin.  That woman is a close ally of Putin.
