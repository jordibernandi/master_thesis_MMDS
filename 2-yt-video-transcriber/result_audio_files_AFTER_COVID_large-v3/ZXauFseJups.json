            "text": "The Trump regime is punked by a TikTok teen K-pop army.  Now there's a headline I never thought or imagined I'd ever be reading.  Yes, it looks like America is waking up to new words and new terms this morning on Sunday, May 21st, 2020.  The words and the terms are like K-pop, K-pop army, Zoomer, the Z generation, TikTok grandma.  That's the one I really like.  It's got a nice ring to it, don't you think?  Now, if you are confused as to what a Zoomer is or the Z generation, well, it's a young person who was born in the late 90s.  or early 2000. you know they're basically a teenager today and you will be surprised that it looks like they punked the donald trump regime.  now i gotta admit.  okay this is a race i have no horse in.  this is an mma fight that i care nothing about the fighters.  this is a burning down house that i have no equity in.  this is a corporation i own no stock in.  this is a heavyweight fight with no marciano and no muhammad ali but I like a TikTok grandma joke as much as the next guy now.  So let's grab some popcorn and find out exactly what is a TikTok grandma.  This is going to be good.  Seriously, this is going to be good.  Sir, you disgust me.  Ah, so you disgust me.  I'm a trust fund, baby.  You can trust me.  Okay, so that's the TikTok grandma responsible for giving an army of TikTok K-pop teens the idea to reserve thousands and thousands of the Trump regime's Oklahoma rally tickets and then not go to the event.  The goal was, of course, to have lots of empty seats, a.k.a.  punk the Trump regime.  Hmm, very interesting indeed.  So what is a TikTok?  Many may not know.  Well, it is a new social media site that's popular with the teenagers, where they upload short videos with blasts of cute, trendy tidbits designed to amuse a nation of overindulged, mindless generation with too much time on their hands, accompanied with a memory that is equivalent to that of a goldfish.  What's that?  Maybe 11 seconds?  22 seconds if you repeat it.  For example, here you go. ",

I need a stroll on Miami Beach to get my daily dose of salty air skin treatment.  please come get me my little toy dog too.  okay this is getting too much.  actually let's do a profile on the tick-tock grandma.  let's do a little bit more profiling on this creature because she's well interesting.  I could choose a better word, but let's do the profile.  So for starters, I would assume that she owns many, many shares in McDonald's and she would not be caught dead in a room.  with a deplorable like myself okay so she's a 51 year old Caucasian progressive liberal female from Fort Dodge Iowa.  good grief.  obviously she is a teacher.  she gets paid by taxpayers to brainwash our children.  hence she's on Tick Tock doing her well her brainwashing.  Well, what can I leave you with?  It's obviously she got the best of Donald Trump on this given battle.  I don't think they're going to win the war, but she won the battle.  I'll give her this much.  She is well-trained in the George Soros socialist propaganda movement.  She employs the latest rapper styles to enhance her TikTok footprint.  And she's smart enough not to show any fancy footwork dance moves.  Anyhow, I thought, well, she is entertaining, and I'm glad she was here to amuse me on Sunday morning. ",
