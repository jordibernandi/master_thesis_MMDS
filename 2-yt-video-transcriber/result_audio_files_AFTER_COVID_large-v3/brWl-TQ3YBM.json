            "text": "Here's what you do if you lose a leg in a bar fight.  Now prosthetic legs can be kind of expensive, right?  So instead of buying one or getting your insurance to pay for one, because you ain't got no insurance, you steal a prosthetic leg.  Now, who are you gonna steal a prosthetic leg from?  Well, preferably a child, because they can't put up a fight, right?  Now, they might be able to run away, though, because if you're trying to steal a prosthetic leg, it stands to reason you ain't got one.  But they do, so they can run and you can't.  So you gotta set up a trap to catch the child, the one-legged child, right?  Because you can't chase him.  So you plant some landmines.  And you wait for the kid to step on it.  He'll lose his other leg.  But then you'll get his fake one.  It might be a little short though.  But at least you might be able to walk.  It's just like you're going to kind of bob up and down with every left step.  but at least you'll still be able to walk.  It's not going to be ideal, but it'll be cheap. ",
