            "text": "Hello scaredy cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  Today we're starting off on a journey, a journey that's very personal to me.  Wishmaster is not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it's absolutely one of my favorites.  Back in university, me and my friends were obsessed with the Wishmaster franchise.  To this day, if anyone starts a sentence with the phrase, I wish, I have to turn to them and say, guaranteed.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're a horror fan specifically and you haven't seen Wishmaster, let me just... let me just spend a minute telling you how bad you fucked up.  You got cameos by Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Unglund.  You got the indisputably best Jason Voorhees, Kane Hodder.  Angus Grimm and Reggie Bannister from Phantasm.  Ted Raimi, who's not only Sam Raimi's brother, but he's also the weird bad boy in the flashback that starts Candyman.  Oh, and by the way, speaking of that, Tony Todd from Candyman!  Legendary special effects master Tom Savini, who you might also recognize as Sex Machine in From Dusk Till Dawn, or more importantly, Morgan Le Fay in George A. Romero's Knight Riders.  And Joseph Pilato, the man who delivered the best line read in cinema history.  I'm running this monkey farm now, Frankenstein, and I want to know what the fuck you're doing with my time!  Not only that, it's produced by Wes Craven, the music was composed by Harry Manfredini, the guy who did the music for Friday the 13th.  That's right, the... And it's directed by Robert Kurtzman, who did special effects makeup in everything from Night of the Creeps to Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3 to fucking Little Nicky to the Bye-Bye Man.  And somehow, despite this ridiculous pedigree, despite all of these incredibly iconic actors, this man, Andrew Divoff, who you've probably never heard of, steals the show so hard that you forget there's an entire movie happening around him.  Aside from Wishmaster 1 and 2, he's most famous for being a recurring guest star on Lost as the character Mikhail Bakunin.  Sounds familiar for some reason.  A lot of roles are inseparable from the actors that made them famous, but the Djinn in Wishmaster is not a character, it is a performance by Divov and nothing more.  Listen to the way he talks and over pronounces all of his words.  Run, insect. ",

Anyway, this is followed by a montage of crazy shit, including a scene where a skeleton rebels against a human body and removes itself, and attacks everyone else, I assume, to pull their hair up, but not out.  They pull your hair up, but not out to turn into a man and have another chance at life.  But if they pull it out, they turn to bone.  The gem-forging wizard finds the king of whatever country they're in, being tricked by the djinn into wishing away all the chaos he's created.  But before the king can make his third wish, the wizard locks the djinn in a gem he made like a blacksmith.  I'm not letting it go.  That is not how gems work.  We flash forward from the ancient past to the slightly less ancient past of 1997.  Robert Unglund is shipping a statue from the Middle East, but uh-oh!  The crane operator is cartoonishly drunk at work and drops the statue on Ted Raimi, smushing him instantly.  One of the other workers sees the magic gem and pockets it because this is the worst dock in history with the worst dock workers ever imaginable.  He sells the gem to a pawnbroker who brings it to an appraisal shop and we meet our protagonist, Alex, a gem lady who knows gem stuff.  It's a big expensive gem, except it has one small flaw, which is that there's a gin inside it, and it wakes up, and now he needs Alex to make three wishes so that he can fulfill a prophecy that allows him to bring all his gin pals to Earth and fuck shit up.  Those are the types of impurities in a gem's structure that are the result of forging a gem like a blacksmith, which is not how gems work.  She brings the gem to her best friend and tennis partner Josh, who's in love with her, and she's like, yo Josh, I do not want to date you, and he's like, please?  And she keeps saying no, and the film wants you to like him, and it's deeply uncomfortable. ",

That of course destroys the gem and the machine and the gin crawls out, but he's a little baby gin played by Verne Troyer.  Then he tricks Josh into making a cheeky little wish and that gives him all his height back and makes him extra gooey.  The Djinn is all-powerful, but can only use his powers to grant wishes.  But he has full discretion over how he grants the wish.  And also, he's just a real asshole, and he'll trick you into phrasing your wish in a way that makes it kill you.  You don't have to know you're making a wish either, you just have to ask him for anything, no matter how abstract.  A typical interaction with a Wishmaster goes something like this.  Someone walks up to him and says, hey buddy, you got the time?  And then he says, so you want me to give you the time?  And they say, yeah, that'd be good.  And he says, granted.  And then they age real fast.  See, get it?  Because he gave them time.  That's the type of shit he does.  And even if you manage to outsmart him and make a cool wish that doesn't blow up in your face, he'll grant it, but then he's able to trap you inside his bullshit gym and torture you.  So you're fucked either way.  Don't, don't take wishes from him, please.  Anyway, Alex knows what's up.  She knows the gem was haunted and the gem killed Josh.  So she tracks down the guy who stole it.  He sexually harasses her because, again, just the worst doc in history.  Just the worst.  Just the worst.  He tells her the whole thing about the guy getting smashed and then the other guy getting smashed.  She goes to see Robert Unglund, who is just horny for ancient gods, just absolutely loves ancient gods.  He talks a lot about Ahura Mazda, the god of Zoroastrianism.  And like, the way he does it, it seems like the filmmakers were not aware that they're still practicing Zoroastrians.  That's not a dead god, it's very much a thriving religion. ",
