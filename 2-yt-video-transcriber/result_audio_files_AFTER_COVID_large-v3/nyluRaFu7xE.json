            "text": "We are the children of the one YAHWAH.  Ye are the chosen of the one YAHWAH.  And he has given his life to us.  For as much as there is none like unto thee, O YAHWAH, thou art great, and thy name is great.  See you in a minute.  Exactly.  That's what's great.  YAHWAH is great.  There's nothing like him, and his name is great.  That's right.  Why do you think the Jewish man is so afraid to say, he say HaShem?  Why do you think?  You said what?  Who told you a higher was the name of the Most High?  When did Moses say a higher was the name of the Most High?  Give me Exodus 3.  I'm going to show you right now.  We're going to go to Exodus 3, brother.  We're going to read in context, right?  Who said I am?  Who said that?  The Most High did not say that, brother.  I'm going to show it to you.  Don't worry.  I'm going to show it to you.  Listen, exactly.  He didn't say, he said he wasn't known by the name of Ahaya.  He never said that.  Right?  Listen, listen.  No, no.  He said he was known by the name of God Almighty, which is Alishagia.  He said, by my name, Yahawa, was I not known.  Alright?  I am his name.  I'm going to show it to you right now.  But, but, but, hold on.  I'm going to show you.  I am, that's how you say Ahaya.  But that's not the name of the Mopai.  No, it's not.  I'm going to show you.  But you convoluted.  Hold on.  Come here, brother.  Why don't you listen?  Brother, why are you running away from the word of God?  Come on, listen.  I'm going to show it to you now.  We're going to read it.  We ain't going to talk about it.  Because you just convoluted Exodus 6 with Exodus 3.  We're going to read Exodus 3 with Ahiah coming.  Read it.  I'm sorry.  Verse 2 real quick.  It's Exodus 3 and 2.  And the angel of the Lord.  And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire.  So who appeared to Moses?  The angel of the Lord.  Do you hear what it said?  Read it again.  All right.  Exodus 3 and 2.  Oh, man.  See that?  Where are we at?  3 and 2?  Right there.  And the angel of the Lord.  Right?  What's that word, Lord?  James Version.  What is the Lord... Would it say the Lord in English?  Hold on, but this is what, brother, you can't, I understand that you've been told something, that you think something.  I'm going to read the book.  Let's just see what the book says.  Let's go off that, right?  Hold on, come on.  You don't want to read?  You don't want to go off what the Bible says?  Hold on, hold on.  You don't want to go off the Bible, whatever you're telling me?  Oh, let's read it then, read it.  Verse 2.  Oh, come on.  Read the Bible.  Why are you running for the Bible?  That's why you're running around smoking, brother.  Because you're calling on a higher.  You know what a higher means?  I am.  So you know when you pray to a higher, you know you're praying to yourself.  You know that, right?  No, you're praying to yourself, brother.  That's why you can't get off them.  damn cigars, man.  Because you keep praying to yourself.  You need to pray to him.  Yah, Yahweh.  That's what you need to pray to.  No, no.  Ahayah, that's, you call it on yourself.  Ahayah means me, I. That's what that means.  Who's God?  Yehawah.  That's God.  He is.  Jehovah is English.  There's no J in Hebrew, brother.  Jehovah is called a transliteration.  Huh?  Hashem?  Hashem means the name.  What is the name?  What is Hashem?  Yehawah, brother.  Huh?  You are supposed to say his name.  You are supposed to say his name.  The Bible says you're supposed to say his name.  Give me number six to about the end.  No, let's read the Bible, brother.  Can we read the Bible?  Why you keep running for the Bible?  That's why you can't get off them.  goddamn black and brown, brother.  Right there.  That's it right there.  That's what I'm going to get you.  All black and brown.  You know.  what's so cool is that you go to the book of Genesis, right?  It says that Abraham came that way.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Yahweh.  Let's talk about that after he bring it up.  That's how it be.  He made us know his power.  See Satan don't like that.  Go ahead, preach this.  Genesis 4, verse 26.  Oh, there you go.  And to Seth, to him also.  there was born a son, and he called his name Enos.  Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.  That's the name of Jehovah.  People act like Jehovah when they say the Lord, it don't mean Jehovah.  No, that means Jehovah is right there.  That's before the flood.  So they knew the name.  But Yahawa made himself known in his judgments, man.  The judgments that he rendered upon Egypt.  Right?  So let's go.  Give me that numbers real quick.  First it's a higher.  Now we ain't supposed to say the name.  The brother's all over the place, man.  Right?  See what I'm saying?  No, I thought it was Joel.  Right?  But see, that name, that name is fearful.  See that?  They're saying that name, Yahawa.  There's power behind that name, man.  Right?  I don't just say Jehovah, but you're not saying I am Jehovah.  Exactly.  You're still going to say I am, but you're going to say Jehovah, right?  That's all.  See, our people are bugged out out here.  Right?  They keep praying to themselves.  That's why they can't get right.  Stop praying to yourself.  Right?  Toward the end.  Oh, oh, oh, 20, 27, right?  This is Numbers 6 and 27.  And they shall put my name.  They shall put what?  My name upon the children of Israel.  You're supposed to put that name.  If you ain't vocalizing the name, how are you going to put that name on the children of Israel?  You blacks and Spaniards got to know your God is your Howard.  That's right.  You got to know that, right?  and i will bless them uh-huh.  so that's how we gonna get blessed.  putting the name on the trinity.  give me the army 28 so like you about what is that about?  um 47 about the name because that's a part of the curse that's coming upon us.  it's not honoring and extolling the name of the most high yahweh.  you so-called black and the spanish need to know your god name.  in hebrew which is your original tongue is your howard.  you need to know that's right.  david's only begotten son yahweh not sweet.
