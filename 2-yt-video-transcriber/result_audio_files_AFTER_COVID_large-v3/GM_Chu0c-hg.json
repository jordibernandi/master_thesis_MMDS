So you're just a piece of shit.  We came here with every intention of filing a report.  We've been cordial.  We waited for 30 minutes.  You can trespass me, but I want your name.  Okay, you know, I want you to check something out.  There's a video with the CSOs in Berlin.  What's going on, guys?  Josh, the kind of buddy for all here with No Name Audits, and we're at the U.S.  Marshals in Providence, Rhode Island, following up and making a complaint and reporting the crime of that video that we surfaced.  drunk feds beat gay man.  So right now we are at the security checkpoint for the U.S.  Marshals and we are going to provide them documentation of this crime because it's super important.  If they weren't police officers, if they weren't U.S.  Marshals, then they detained this man and physically assaulted him while impersonating federal agents, which is a felony.  And if they are, we want to make sure that the Marshals know what's going on and what that behavior is.  So let's take a look.  How's it going, sir?  How are you?  Good, good.  Come on over.  Sure.  So we have a video that we wanted to produce to you guys, and we have the video with us today.  There was two gentlemen beating a man.  They were both drunk, and on the video, they identified as US Marshals.  They also admitted to drinking and admitted to being on the job.  We got license plates of the vehicles.  After physically assaulting this man, they both got in their two respective vehicles with the plates and drove away.  So our concern was either they're US Marshals, and while they're admitting that they're drunk and on duty, detaining someone and physically assaulting them or they're falsely identifying as U.S.  Marshals, which is a crime because now they're giving directives illegally detaining people and assaulting them.  So we wanted to bring the video to you because of the severity of it, because we figured it was your jurisdiction whether they are U.S.  Marshals or if they're... Yeah, absolutely.  So we went to East Greenwich PD and they told us that it was... So that's just a clip and then it'll show the whole video. ",

We found actual two U.S.  Marshals outside that took the complaint, looked at the video, and here's the thing, right?  So, oh, you know, give ID.  We didn't give ID.  I gave my first name, my last name, and my telephone number.  Because when they go to the judge, they can't say, oh, there's no complaining party.  Normally the victim would be the complaining party, but we don't even know who the victim is.  So we gave our name and contact information, so when they look into this, they pull the license plate and all that stuff, they figure out either they're pretending to be cops and using police powers, or they are cops, they're drunk on the job, and they need complainants.  So at this point, they can contact us and say, hey, we're moving forward with the judge, do you want to be a complainant?  Abso-fricking-lutely, dirty cops go down again.  And that's the reason we stopped you today.  And you better go to No Name Audits, okay?  He's part of the Accountability for All family now.  He works with us, okay?  He was the one that caught this footage.  So awesome job.  Go to No Name Audits, share, like, and subscribe.  And that's the reason we stopped you today. ",
