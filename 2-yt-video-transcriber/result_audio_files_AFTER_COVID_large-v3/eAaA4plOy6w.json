            "text": "okay everybody spitting cobra here.  um this person has two videos.  i don't know why it was filmed in in uh two sections but uh this is arizona highway patrol slash dps.  um after watching this video I could pretty much tell what had happened here.  This officer, in my opinion, was following this vehicle, ran the tags, was waiting for the information to come back.  Apparently they had pulled into their home and he made us because he was waiting for the information and everything to come back, he flipped his lights on and followed them into their home.  And then the guy got out and went to his house.  And then I guess this officer was mad that he got out of the vehicle and went to his house.  But he was waiting on the information to come back.  So his initial... His reason for stopping them was saying that they had failed to stop at a stop sign.  But I really think, in my opinion, that he was just waiting to see if there was wants or warrants for this vehicle.  And then this person did the exact right thing and started filming, which everybody should do.  You must film the police when you interact with them.  I cannot stress this enough.  But this video, this is going to be two videos.  And I'll stop talking and show you that at the end, this officer realizes that he was... on video and decided to to let this one go.  but you make the judgment so you want to sit here and wait.  he's lying and saying that he conducted a track shot just like uh french did.
