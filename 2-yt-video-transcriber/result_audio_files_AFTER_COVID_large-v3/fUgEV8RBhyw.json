Ancient histories about influential people weren't written anonymously, and also they didn't appeal to scriptural evidence over historical evidence.  Paul is the closest thing that you could get to a contemporary witness of this Jesus person.  but all he records is just the general Christian message.

The smallest organizational group in the Roman Legion was called a contubernium.  This is basically a squad of about eight Roman soldiers.  Now, if you were to group, say, 10 Cantubernia into a much larger group, you would have a Centaurea, and then the next level above that is the Legion.  Guard is simply not an organizational unit of the Roman army.

Let me be clear, that would be a strong indication that he was in fact crucified, if he had sourced his stuff with historical things and not scripture.  So the Romans never producing a body is not really a surprise. ",

Also, why are you adding the caveat of, you must believe in this if you're talking to Christians?  They already believe in it, man.  You literally don't have to keep selling them on their religion.  They've already bought it, hook, line, and sinker.  I mean, do you think that there are Christians out there that don't wholeheartedly believe in the resurrection of Jesus?  In any case, all five of your reasons here just amount to the same apologetics that everybody has heard before.  All you have are anecdotal accounts based on visions and scriptures, as well as some bad historical references that are not even true or relevant, in order to prove the magical resurrection of your particular deity.  These are not undeniable reasons.  They are perfectly deniable reasons.  They are reasonably deniable reasons.  Well, heathens, I really appreciate you guys watching this video today.
