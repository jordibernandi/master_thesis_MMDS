            "text": "Number one, and perhaps the most disturbing out of all the creatures that have ever been on this earth, are the Nephilim giants.  It says in the Bible, right at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 6, the Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward.  When the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them, these were the mighty men.  who were of old, the men of renown.  Now I'm not going to lie to you, this is a very difficult passage in the Bible to understand.  But just try and take it into your mind.  Here we have these angelic beings, the sons of God.  These are the same sons of God that we hear about in the book of Job.  You know where Lucifer wants to try and attack Job and take him out?  These are the same angelic beings who were with the Lord God in heaven and they fell.  You see, these angelic beings, they look down and they saw that the women on earth were beautiful.  So they go down to earth and they have relationships with the women.  And these women get pregnant and they give birth to these sort of hybrid creatures, these half-man, half-angel creatures.  And that's where the Nephilim giants come from.  And because these Nephilim are so big in stature, the people around make them as like leaders.  They look at them and think, these are mighty men.  These are wonderful.  So you may be asking the question, how did the creator respond to all of this?  Well, it says in the Bible that it grieved God's heart.  Don't believe the lie.  when people say the God of the universe, he doesn't care.  He's just some distant deity sat on a cloud.  He doesn't intervene.  No, when we sin, it breaks God's heart.  The God of the universe is a sensitive God.  We are made in his image.  And the reason we have feelings, deep feelings of love, of compassion, is because the God of the universe... gave us his feelings to feel so.  he took those angelic beings and he wrapped them.  he bound them into everlasting chains.  he put them into a place of gloomy darkness into the very abyss of hell and confined them there saying no longer will you be able to leave this place.  you are here for all of eternity.  and then what happened to our own race to men and women?  Well, have you ever heard of the story of Noah and the ark?  It's not so much about this cute cartoon with rhinoceroses and elephants hanging out of the window.  No, Noah's ark was no joke.  The floods that came purged the earth of all of that perversity.  God wiped out all of this sickness, all of this disgust that was such an abomination to him.  that it might return to be something of what He first created it to be.  And the Bible tells us at the very, very end of this earth, God will again purge the earth, He'll renew it, He'll melt it, He'll make it into something beautiful.  so it returns to the original creation.  because you and I, although we haven't done some of the perverse things we're talking about now, we have sinned and we have corrupted this beautiful earth.  And the sensitive God who loves us all deeply wants us to be pure and holy and to worship him.  And for it to go back to the beginning where man and God walk together in the garden.  But hey now, that is not the last time we hear about the Nephilim in the Bible.  Am I the only one?  When I was a kid at Sunday school who used to sing this song, 12 men went to spy on Canaan.  You see, when the people of Israel were freed from slavery in Egypt, they wandered in the wilderness for many, many years.  But God promised them that they would have a land.  They would have a nation, a place where they could build up their people and live there forever.  And God led them to the people of Canaan.  And as the spies went out to see if the land was safe to take for themselves, they saw these giants.  It actually says they saw Nephilim.  And because these giants were so big compared to the spies, the men felt like they were just grasshoppers.  And then it gets even more interesting because we hear about this other giant clan, these people called the Rephaim.  And from them came someone called King Og.  So not only was he a terrifying king, but he was also a giant.  It is said about King Og that his bed was 13.5 feet long.  Now that is a king-sized bed if you've ever heard of one before.  And before I move on to the next creature, I know what some of you are thinking.  When are you going to mention Goliath, Joe?  Well, yes, Goliath, it is believed that he was also a descendant from the Nephilim.  And you remember the story.  Here is this great Philistine, and he's terrifying all of these soldiers of Israel.  They're so scared.  And then that ruddy little lad, David, turns up with no armor, but just five little stones.  He casts that stone into the sling and the great giant comes tumbling down.  And who came from David's line after he became king?  Many years later, the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, came out of David's lineage.  And he too would defeat the powers of evil once and for all on the cross.  All the giants, all the wickedness of evil was defeated when he died for sinners there.  Have you put your trust in the Son of God?  Dangerous creature number two, Behemoth.  Now, I live in England.  I'm English.  And this nation used to once be a great nation which loved the Lord Jesus Christ.  Not everyone was a Christian, but there was a lot of people who respected God.  We sent out missionaries to some of your countries, Nigeria.  We sent out missionaries to America, to all around the world.  But now, very few people respect God, and many people would identify as atheists.  And as a street preacher, do you know what one of the number one questions I get asked?  Well, let me just show you right now.  Yeah, I was about to say that.  What about dinosaurs, mate?  Pardon?  What about the dinosaurs?  Yeah, good question.  Many atheists come to me, and if you're an atheist, you ask me this question all the time.  Where do dinosaurs come from?  If you read the Bible, there are dinosaurs in the Bible.  Now, to my Christian friends listening right now, have you ever been asked that question before?  Well, if you ever get asked, are dinosaurs in the Bible, just point them to Job chapter 40.  It says this, see now, his strength is in his hips and his power is in his stomach.  He moves his tail like a cedar.  Indeed the river may rage, yet he is not disturbed.  So dinosaurs are really in the Bible.  Why?  Because the Bible is true.  And the book of Job is believed to be the oldest book ever written in the Bible.  So it's very possible, in fact it's very likely that dinosaurs were still roaming the earth when the book of Job was written.  And this dinosaur with a tail like a cedar tree, like a tree trunk, is probably a Diplodocus.  But it is important to remember this.  God doesn't describe this dinosaur so that skeptics think, oh right, okay, the Bible's true because dinosaurs were around at the same time in the ancient world.  No, God describes Behemoth really for one reason.  To humble you and I. You and I have something in common.  We both came from dust.  We're nothing but dust and ashes.  And the God who made these great big beasts, Behemoth, and in a moment's time we're gonna think about another one, is saying, look, you're weak.  And although we are nothing, This great big God loves us deeply, but he does demand that we respect him, that we repent, turn of our sins, put our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and live every single breath for him because he's worthy of our praise and our worship.  And thirdly and finally, one of the most terrifying creatures described in the Bible is Leviathan.  From the beginning of the world, men and women have been fascinated with sea monsters.  We hear about mermaids, we hear about Moby Dick.  In the Pirates of the Caribbean, we heard about the Kraken, Jaws.  And not too far from where I live, there's a place called Loch Ness.  Have you heard of Nessie, the Loch Ness monster?  But if we put all of those sea monsters together, none of them are more terrifying than the description of Leviathan.  God says this, can you draw out Leviathan with a hook or snare his tongue with a line which you lower?  Who can open the doors of his face with his terrible teeth all around?  on earth there is nothing like him which is made without fear.  fact is this guys god in his sovereignty has crowned man and woman above all the rest of the creation and in our greed in our cruelty we have damaged much of the beautiful wildlife which the good lord created.  we've captured giant squids We've shot mountain gorillas.  Whales have been tamed.  We've been able to do all kinds of things to animals.  But the Bible says there is one animal which does not fear man.  There is one animal which cannot be tamed or caught by any skill of any human being.  And that creature is called Leviathan.  Now I want you to know something about me.  I am not the guy who pretends to have all of the answers and there are many, many different interpretations of who Leviathan is.  Some believe that Leviathan is just metaphorical, he's poetic like other images that are used in the Bible.  Some say that Leviathan was actually the fish which swallowed Jonah.  Some say that Leviathan was the devil himself and some say that leviathan was like behemoth a sea reptile like a plesiosaurus or something like that.  personally i don't know but there is one thing i do know leviathan has a master and the master's name is yahweh.  there's an old old prophecy which the prophet isaiah prophesied of many many years ago and it still has to be fulfilled.  it says this in that day the Lord with his severe sword great and strong will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent Leviathan that twisted serpent and he will slay the reptile that is in the sea one day.  God is going to destroy everything that is evil And my question to you is, whose side are you on?  Will you be caught up with all the things that are evil, with Leviathan and all the wicked things on that day of wrath?  Or are you protected by the Son of God's precious blood who died 2,000 years ago for sinners?  If you have not yet come to the Lord Jesus Christ, don't resist Him a day longer.  He loves you, He rose from the dead and He says any sinner, anyone who will humble themselves and realise that they need me, the Saviour of the world, If they put their trust in me, if they turn from their wicked ways and give their life to me, I will forgive them and give them eternal life.  Will you do it?  Will you come to the Lord Jesus Christ?  Just before you go, can I be a little bit transparent with you?  I really have struggled to make this video today.  In myself, I like to go to the easier texts.  I'm not a very deep guy and very often I'm quite comfortable just paddling around in the shallows.  But the Christian faith does demand that we do go deeper and we do wrestle with passages that we don't understand.  So I do hope today that this video has helped someone and maybe it's challenged someone else to look at things that we don't understand and topics that might make us feel uncomfortable.
