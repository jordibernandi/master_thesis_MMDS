            "text": "For the love of God, people find a high maintenance partner.  I know, I know what you're thinking.  High maintenance, no one wants a high maintenance partner, but you're thinking about it wrong.  No matter what you do, you cannot escape maintaining a relationship.  Hello everyone.  My name is Jennifer Molesky.  This is my YouTube channel.  Today we're going to talk about high maintenance relationships and how I really want you to have one.  Okay.  But first I do want to tell you that I'm going to be launching new videos every Tuesday at two, every Tuesday at two.  And then I'm going to do something called commenting on comments where I respond to your comments.  If you use the magic word at the end.  Why Jennifer?  Why?  Why have a magic word at the end?  Because sometimes you people will come in and comment within one minute and I've totally, and you're like, you that's not right and I will have totally covered that and then you've wasted your time commenting on what you think I'm gonna say instead of responding to what I have said.  so I have a secret word at the end.  if you use that I might respond to your comment in the live video which will be held Friday.  every Friday at 6. my time Jennifer.  what's your time?  it's a mountain time ready ready.  today I want to talk about maintenance.  what is it?  are you willing to do anything to maintain your man or woman?  what are you willing to do?  Would you prefer a low-maintenance partner?  Let's consider.  What is it to maintain something?  It doesn't mean you have to fix it, no.  And it doesn't mean that you leave it worse than when you found it.  It's simply to preserve it, to keep it as close to its original condition as when you came across it, right?  When it came into your possession.  Right, right.  So that is why I rail so strongly against everyone and anyone who comes to my channel and doesn't seem to understand my message, this channel's message about being the best version of yourself and to find a partner who appreciates it and can keep up.  Finding a great person to have a stellar relationship with is a three-step process, I think.  I mean, number one, You have to present yourself clearly and accurately.  No bullshit, no lies.  You present yourself to the other person and you say, hey, do you want me?  And they say yes or no.  That's it.  Step one.  You're just not good enough.  Done.  Step two.  You have to let your potential forever partner know what your intentions are of your maintenance program for repair and shine for the rest of your life.  How much are you wanting to repair?  What kind of work are you going to do?  Because, because honestly, if they are not into becoming better and you are or vice versa, or if you don't move at the same or similar pace, you're probably doomed.  You're probably doomed.  And then you're going to get mad.  Don't, don't do actions today that will make you mad tomorrow.  Okay?  I personally was looking for a partner who would move rocks with me.  I wanted to uncover every creepy crawly thing underneath all the boulders of my life and of my partner's life so they could be exposed and fixed.  And the only way I could do that with a partner is if he was willing to do an equal amount of heavy lifting because pains, failures, traumas, bad habits, insecurities are heavy.  And they are embedded into the bedrock of one's soul.  And you need to be dedicated to the backbreaking work that it will take to expose what is underneath.  Expose them to yourself, to your parts, light.  I know this sounds so dumb.  And this is how I call it fertile soil.  I personally have wanted fertile pasture land as my soul's terrain.  There are boulders, but most have been removed by me.  And then I can show that off.  Oh, there used to be a boulder right here.  But now there's room to plant something you want.  What would you like me to plant there?  Oh, there used to be a huge boulder right here about five years ago.  I removed it and planted a peach tree.  Would you like a peach?  Do you understand what I want for you?  Do you understand my frustration at the people who come to my channel and have the audacity to tell me that I'm responsible for their past year's rock problem?  that I somehow need to enter into their soul and toil for them, I toil for no one.  I toil for no one except for me and my husband.  When you tell me that you have unfit pasture land because of an ex-wife or an ex-husband and you want me or worse the government to come and do work for you to remove boulders because A, you didn't work hard enough to remove the boulders or B, allowed another person to put boulders in your field because let's be honest with each other right now your ex did not move those boulders in overnight.  you watched through the months or years or decades as they slowly rented a crane probably even with your money and slowly and deliberately moved boulder after boulder into your pasture land until they got bored and disgusted with the fact that you allowed them to do it.  and then they said enough i don't want to own pasture land with you anymore.  There's rocks everywhere.  Looks like shit.  I've had enough.  I'm done.  Now you have shitty land.  And now you have some choices to make.  Don't you?  It's either do what needs to be done to once again, or maybe for the first time ever, be able to grow and support nutritious food, or you will sit there and starve and become enraged about it.  Then you will tell me or someone else or a future partner or a government that we are responsible for helping you clean up your own goddamn mess.  I have no respect for that thinking.  I have no sympathy for your situation.  I have no desire to lift rocks that I didn't put there.  Now you have a rocky pasture.  If you can find another partner who accepts that devastated pasture, you just found yourself a real piece of shit.  You found someone who was willing to, in their one life, live a life close to starvation, to accept property where they have to search every day to find a space to plant a potato.  They are willing to maintain, maintain that property, that relationship.  You, yuck.  Why do you want that?  Why do you want that?  A person who is willing to do that is the kind of person who has their own pasture land full of rocks.  That's why they're willing to accept yours.  Do you think they're willing to maintain what you have to offer because you are so special?  No, no.  They're willing to maintain what you have to offer because they're so absolutely unspecial.  Maybe you're thinking, or maybe you have that.  Well, you two will clean your pastures together.  You just want the company.  Okay, fine.  We've all seen that, right?  We've all seen people do that.  But the thing of it is, as I said before, moving those boulders takes a lot of work.  It takes a lot of time.  Often it takes a lot of money.  It takes a lot of energy.  So why was this hard work not done before they invited you to their property?  Because they don't really want to clear their land.  They don't really want to do the work.  They just don't want to be alone.  That's it.  They don't want to be alone.  And by the way, if a person has bad pasture land and they invite you to share it, what do they really think of you?  Do they think highly of you?  Are you held in high regard by them?  Do you care if you're held in high regard by them?  Like what kind of a person are they?  When I have company, I make sure the house is clean, right?  I'm sure you do too.  Why?  There's two reasons.  You don't want to look bad.  That's fine.  I admit I don't want to look bad around people, but I also don't want my company to feel uncomfortable.  So why in the world do you think it's acceptable to not clean up your life and invite someone into it?  Why is it acceptable for you to go into someone's messy life?  Probably because you have a messy life and you don't want to clean it up.  So my friends, that is why it is so important that you find someone who is high maintenance.  Like I said before, you're going to do maintaining.  You might as well do it with a high maintenance person.  They have a clean field already.  They already have fertile soil.  They already have a garden there and space to plant other things.  A peach tree, things you want.  What are you in the mood for?  Baby, I got room.  And you know what?  Maybe there is a boulder.  Maybe you meet someone and they do have a boulder, but you can see it and they show it to you.  They're not deceitful about it.  Yeah, I've had this boulder for, God, since I was raped.  When I was seven.  But I'm slowly, slowly... Getting the money it takes to get the crane to lift it up.  I know exactly how to do it.  And then watch them.  Do they slowly and slyly start to bring in small pebbles to scatter around that boulder?  Watch out.  They have a plan.  Those small pebbles will turn into big stones and finally big boulders.  And the bitch of it is, is since you were there to watch them, they're going to blame you.  They're going to blame you.  And they might even get some boulders on your land if you're such a dodo bird that you can't stop it.  Watch them.  Do they instead... make small moves that need to be done in order to get rid of the big boulder.  watch it.  they have a plan.  they are true to their word.  they execute what needs to be done to get what needs to be done done.  wait they do what needs to be done.  now you can be in a relationship that is high maintenance hallelujah But life continues once you find that great partner.  People will see how good your land is and they will try to lure you over to their land.  Don't be fooled.  You will be aggressed upon by our wonderful government.  They'll see the fruits of your labor from this wonderful fertile soil that you have worked so hard to get and they'll want that.  Your neighbors will gossip and slander against you because they're jealous.  all of satan tricks will be yours to fall for or not but you'll have your partner your equally strong but totally different partner who is on your side and they will help you every day chuck stones off the pasture land back onto the road keeping it clean and beautiful and there may come a day.  There may come a day where one or both of you bring a boulder into the property.  You're imperfect, sorry, you're imperfect, but so are they.  But the beauty of the high maintenance partner that you chose is that they will see, acknowledge, and want to remove the boulder.  They will do the work required to roll it out and be wise enough to not let it come back.  Watch people, watch yourself.  My house is messy.  And as I'm sitting here telling you how to be a better person and what to look out for, that realization of what it means is pretty heavy on me.  I'm not treating my husband right now like I respect him.  And that makes me sick and angry about myself.  Do you see that too?  Is there anything in your life that is a boulder?  There is no excuse for my behavior of having my house messy.  If he lets me get away with it for too long, then I will think he's an idiot and my respect for him will go down and I'll start to act in a way that is more disrespectful, which will cause him to act in a way and then the spiral of a bad relationship begins.  Luckily, I'm not too proud to acknowledge my behavior is poor and I'm gonna put an end to it.  Hmm.  But before I go, maintaining a loving relationship, a good life, a respectful relationship is no small task.  It takes looking into the mirror and seeing yourself for who you really are.  That is a good person who has all the potential in the world to be a class, a piece of shit.  And I don't want to be a piece of shit.  So I'm going to go, I'm going to go right now and I'm going to clean this house from top to bottom.  And I'm going to give my husband and I'll see you on Friday.  Oh, the code word is inculcate inculcate.  Look it up.  Inculcate.  Bye. ",
