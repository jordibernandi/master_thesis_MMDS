            "text": "The virus that we're talking about having to do, you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes in.  Typically, that will go away in April.  We're in great shape, though.  We have 12 cases, 11 cases.  I think it's going to work out fine.  I think when we get into April and the warmer weather, that has a very negative effect on that.  and that type of a virus.  So let's see what happens, but I think it's going to work out fine.  You know, in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.  Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.  I hope that's true.  It's going to disappear.  One day, it's like a miracle.  It will disappear.  Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus.  You know that, right?  Coronavirus.  And this is their new hoax.  The hoax is on them.  I'm not talking about what's happening here.  Certainly not referring to this.  How could anybody refer to this?  This is very serious.  Anybody that needs a test can have a test.  They're all set.  You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?  Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low.  When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done. ",
