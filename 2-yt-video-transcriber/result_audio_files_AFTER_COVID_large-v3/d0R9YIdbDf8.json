I was thinking back to our founding fathers and how they had signed their name to a document, knowing the ridicule and even possible charges.  death would come just by signing their names to these documents.

I signed my name to six documents to stand for our Constitution, to stand for election integrity. ",

She's a gun owner and she was going to walk around DC defending herself from the Capitol building to her office, which also has tunnels underground, with a gun and also going to Congress with a gun because she has the right to do so, even though she don't in DC.  Let's just make that very clear, even if you are a Congress member.  Then just a couple of days later, we were just talking about it, how dangerous could that be?  Then a couple of days later, we witnessed it.  I'm opening up the floor.  Anybody wants to try?  Okay, I know you've covered Congress.  Have you ever seen that kind of crazy? ",

And like, we're constantly responding to their, They're like, we're, we're never like, and I'm not, I'm not including myself in this, but like, like the left and Democrats are never in a position where we're setting the agenda.  And I guess that's a, that's a function of the power structure that we've been under for the last, you know, like however many years, but just the idea that like, we can't start from a place where everyone is on the same page.  that like, okay.  there are certain things that are fact and there are certain things that are not fact.  And like AOC tweeted it today.  It's like, this is not like a difference of political opinion.  These are not like people that you should be respecting as leaders and somehow they get away with, I mean, I guess this is just part of what we were talking about, but like they get away with, uh spouting absolute nonsense in the in the in the under the guise of being being patriotic and being you know being strong-willed and and somehow like we're always on the defensive and i think that's what we kind of what we were talking about at the beginning of the show.  that like and what we've talked about many times.  maybe like that democrats don't have.  we don't have.  they don't have a messaging platform like they don't the left didn't have.  um They only came up with something to give voters in the last three days of the Georgia Senate election when they were telling people to vote for them if they were going to give them $1,000 checks.  And everything else has always been a response, a reaction, a pivoting, a sort of trying to kind of quarterback in response to like the GOP just flinging literally anything at the wall to see what sticks.  And I don't know, I don't know when or if, I mean, I guess we're seeing some members, and actually this is a point that I want to make.  that, The most aggressive legislation that we're seeing to sort of try to combat or hold accountable anyone who is complicit in last week's attacks is coming from the new members that were just elected, Jamal Bowman and Cori Bush and Mondaire Jones.  Those are the people that are actually stepping in in the footsteps of AOC and Presley and Ilhan and Rashida Tlaib saying, wait a minute, like, am I psycho or are you guys crazy?  Like, like we, like, we're not, not to use like ableist language, I apologize for that.  But like, are we like, are, are, am I, are we reading the same language?  Like, and, and it's so refreshing and I don't know.  I mean, I think so many people are feeling this, like how, how have we not had someone stick up for this before.  But I think, yeah, I don't know.  I don't have a coherent point from that. ",

I mean, Cori Bush, who in the lead up to this was receiving threats already from the fact that she was profiled in the RNC.  Don't forget the convention.  The two crazy people with the guns on their lawns, you know, of their McMansion were the ones who decided to target Cori Bush before she was even officially elected.  And, you know, as she waited to go into office, I mean, how do you invest your own own money into security at that point?  That's before she has the protection of being a congressmember.  And she within minutes of her being sworn into office, she presents one of the most.  just incredibly courageous pieces of legislation to, or is it a legislation or is it a resolution?  It's a resolution. ",

And I've, I just, you know, I think there's also among the Democrats a refusal to vote.  you know, have the courage of the convictions that they spouse, you know, the GOP is clearly, I mean, you know, I have my problems with the Democrats, but the GOP is clearly a threat to like the guaranteed survival of a great many of things, whether it's like the ecological niche that we have, or some political institutions that, you know, Democrats cherish, or whether it's, you know, tackling various monopolies that dominate, you know, huge sections of our lives and the response should not be to consistently cater to them or meet them on these issues.  But at the same time, there are also, you know, structural barriers, I guess, to the Democrats actually wielding the power in a way that would hold these groups accountable.  And I don't know, I just, it is frustrating to watch and have it fall on the shoulders or feel like it falls on the shoulders of like, the newest, most radical congresspeople who also have the largest targets on their backs, either amongst the party or on outsiders, or people in the street that are taking cues or inspiration from the rhetoric of people that oppose them.  But I think that it's just a political system in one way or another just dominated by cowards, or it feels like as if it's dominated by cowards.  There's a clear threat.  There's a clear problem.  There's a clear way to address it.  And whenever the clear problems and solutions emerge, there's refusal to really acknowledge them or their existence or take them up.  And then that just leads us further and further and further into this hell. ",

I mean, big tech, I think so much of the roots of big tech fall, their libertarian roots.  But the capitalism that has evolved the business model, I should say, has created opportunities for Democrats to be woven into it.  And that's just, it's like pay to play politics.  Not only are they donating to Democrats and Republicans, of course, but they're also bringing actual staffers in who are now back in this administration, but like took some time off and went to Silicon Valley.  I mean, we have to be able to break up with these donors, these companies that are now giving jobs to our staff or the democratic side staffers.  I mean, this is how corruption works.  It's legalized corruption and the results are what we saw. ",

It's been, they've played a key role in, you know, providing jobs to specific areas of the country and ensuring that surpluses from trade flow back into the country and keep regions that have otherwise been neglected by the state, you know, to still have people employed and still have access to, you know, resources.  But You know, the over time, I think that that bargain has become a Faustian one where these firms now have enough autonomy and sovereignty to dictate the terms on which they'll operate and engage with or follow or abide by the law.  and You know, it's going to require a huge shift, I think, not just in like, you know, the actual laws around these companies, but in the way that the parties or people in the party see their relationship to them.  I think that many still kind of view big tech or technology firms as like you know tech when at its best moments it can help us and can you know let us be better than we might otherwise be can connect us can you know do all these great things.  when you know, the reality is if you take a hard look at it, most technology firms, I mean, they provide some good, you know, consumer facing products, but at great cost to everything else, to the ecology, to people in the global South, the children that they use as laborers or miners to slaves that they use in China or India to, you know, contract workers that they use in the United States.  Is that worth it?  And I think that's also like as big of a pressing question is like, are you fine with allying with firms that will just burn you when they have enough power? ",
