I'm just kidding, my husband doesn't let me drive.  I'm also kidding, I don't have a husband.  I'm single.  I'm 28 and single, which to my parents means that I'm old enough to be a mother of four, but I'm too young to be allowed to stay out past 10  p.m.,  so... I'm an engineer, but I'm still trying to do that math.  Okay, let's get something out of the way.  You, sir, what's your name?  Fred.  Fred.  What did it take you five seconds?  Is that really his name?  Can you confirm?  Fred, do you know the name of what I'm wearing on my head, what it's called?  Hitchhiker.  Yes, give it up for Fred, everyone.  I'm so confident.  You got it right.  It's called a hijab.  I've been wearing it majority of my life.  I often get a lot of questions about it.  People often ask me, are you hot in that?  The answer is yes.  But I'm hotter without it. ",
