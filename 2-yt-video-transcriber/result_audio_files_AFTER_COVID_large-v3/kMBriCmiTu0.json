            "text": "Last week, Britain discovered they had a eugenicist advising the Prime Minister, which caused a great deal of upset for everyone who agreed that eugenics is wrong.  Well, almost everyone.  Some people argued that while eugenics is wrong in the ethical sense, maybe it's not wrong in the scientific sense.  And one of the people arguing that was, drumroll please, my old friend Richard Dawkins.  There's only so much I can talk about one particular person in a lifetime, so I was going to just leave this one alone.  But I polled Twitter and found that a very slight majority wanted to watch a video about this topic.  And I am nothing if not forever eager to do the bidding of a very slight majority of people who follow me on Twitter.  Here's what Richard Dawkins tweeted.  Why on earth wouldn't it work for humans?  Facts ignore ideology.  Oh boy, where do we start with the kind of edgelord commentary you're most likely to find posted by a 12-year-old with the handle cuntslapper88 on a subreddit for Nazi clown memes?  Conslapper 88, I'm sorry, I mean the Honorable Professor Richard Dawkins, went on to clarify to you snowflakes that just have to find fault with everything whenever anyone expresses even the slightest positive comment about eugenics.  For those determined to miss the point, I deplore the idea of a eugenic policy.  I simply said deploring it doesn't mean it wouldn't work.  Just as we breed cows to yield more milk, we could breed humans to run faster or jump higher, but heaven forbid that we should do it.  A eugenic policy would be bad.  I'm combating the illogical step from X would be bad to... so X is impossible.  It would work in the same sense as it works for cows.  Let's fight it on moral grounds.  Deny obvious scientific facts and we lose, or at best derail, the  argument.\".  Hmm, really make you think.  He has a point, right?  I mean, an edgy point.  Way too edgy for you, Snowflake.  Eugenics works, and that's just a scientific fact.  Were he correct about this, it would perhaps be a valid point.  Let's say that some politician were arguing for us to end the HIV AIDS crisis by systematically executing every person with HIV or AIDS.  And you fought back against that by saying that would be morally wrong.  Dawkins would technically be correct to then tweet, look, It's one thing to deplore shooting every HIV-AIDS patient in the brain on ideological, political, moral grounds.  It's quite another to conclude that it wouldn't work to end AIDS.  Of course it would.  Technically, he's right, but he's missing a lot of points.  Like, would it work in reality?  Like, how would you identify every single person who has HIV or AIDS, for instance?  People who make arguments like Dawkins is making are fond of saying that they're just elevating facts over feelings as an intellectual exercise.  But in fact, they are not.  They are actually elevating facts over other more complex, inconvenient facts.  Because the only way everyone can agree that it's a fact that eugenics would work is if we agree that eugenics is, let's say, selectively breeding humans for a certain very specific trait.  Yes, that will work.  If you want to create a race of people with blue eyes, you could do that.  That would, quote unquote, work.  But this intellectual exercise ignores the more complicated facts, like the fact that eugenics is not simply selectively breeding humans to have a certain trait.  It's selectively breeding humans to have superior traits without severe negative consequences.  And that, my friend, does not really work.  Because first of all, we have to decide what's a superior trait.  Blue eyes aren't superior to brown.  In fact, light-colored eyes are more susceptible to cancer due to a lack of pigment protecting the eye from ultraviolet rays.  How about increased intelligence?  We have little data, a little data suggesting that some aspects of intelligence may be inheritable, may be genetic, but a lot more data suggesting that diet and money and other environmental factors are way more important.  And what about animals that we've selectively bred?  Dawkins points to cows, horses, pigs, dogs, and roses as examples where eugenics has worked.  First of all, that's not eugenics.  That's selective breeding.  But fine, let's pretend that eugenics applies to animals.  Did it work?  Behold, the end result of centuries of man's selective breeding of the noble dog, the pug.  No, actually, you know what?  That's way too easy.  Let's take America's most popular dog breed of the 1980s, a dog that I personally grew up with, the Cocker Spaniel.  The Cocker Spaniel was selectively bred to be a hunting dog.  Good senses, good hearing, good nose, good eyes in order to identify woodcocks.  and other birds, flush them out of the bush, a soft mouth for retrieving the body, high energy to be able to run around for a couple of hours, and very loyal.  Considering all of those traits are, in fact, hallmarks of the cocker spaniel breed today, can we say that eugenics, in this case, was a success?  Dawkins says yes, but the cocker spaniel might beg to differ.  It's one of the unhealthiest dog breeds that exist.  Those big floppy ears are actually extremely prone to infection.  Their eyes, bred to be able to pinpoint a bird in the bush, are prone to progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, patellar luxation, and glaucoma, many of which can and often do lead to blindness.  often fairly early on in a dog's lifetime.  Their little legs and hips are prone to dysplasia.  Their body shape in general leaves them at serious risk of gastric torsion, a twisted stomach that kills them in 10 to 60% of cases.  And they often die even if they manage to get treatment for it.  Their brains are likely to have idiopathic epilepsy in which they experience seizures with no apparent cause that require a lifetime of medication to manage.  Their hearts are prone to dilated cardiomyopathy in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood through their system and it just gives up.  They also have several less severe genetic disorders, including anemia and hypothyroidism.  Dawkins says eugenics worked for dogs.  I say humans fucked up a perfectly good wolf.  If you want a healthy, happy dog, my advice is to get one whose parents rejected human selective breeding and just fucked in an alley somewhere in Oakland.  The Cocker Spaniel is just one example of a eugenics success story.  Dawkins also brings up dairy cows several times.  The road to breeding a cow that produces more milk than usual has been a very long one, and it's still going on, and one unintended consequence of that road was that we accidentally made it so that the cows that produce the most milk also experience serious fertility problems, which led to, you guessed it, less milk overall.  These days, breeders tend to go more for general overall health in breeding because they found that identifying these specific traits and then only focusing on breeding those resulted in seriously fucked up animals.  These aren't my feelings.  These are facts.  We try to selectively breed some really basic traits into animals with no rights, and it ends up being kind of a fucking disaster.  So what's it going to be like when we try to breed humans who do have rights with very specific, very complicated traits, like intelligence?  But edgelords like Dawkins don't want to deal with those facts because they're too complicated.  They require too much thinking.  You can't get a lot of attention by talking about those facts in 280 characters on Twitter.  And that's what people like Dawkins ultimately want.  They want attention without needing to do any of that bothersome thinking.  Here are some more facts.  Eugenics has been used throughout human history to subjugate marginalized people in the anti-scientific and bigoted belief that it works.  You can ignore that fact if you want to just have a discussion on whether or not it works.  But once that discussion is done and you realize that the evidence shows that it doesn't work, Now you have to deal with the fact that you just told your audience of millions of people that eugenics works, making it so that the only thing standing in the way of the next eugenics program is a little moral quandary.  So now when a politician introduces a plan to say, require people under a certain IQ to get a permit to reproduce, that politician will be able to just glide right past the question of whether or not this will work to make a smarter, better population of people because the great scientist Richard Dawkins already told him it'll work.  Now we only need to debate the ethics of it.  And in a world where children are kept in cages because they were born in the wrong country and where people die of preventable diseases because their jobs don't give them health care, are we comfortable believing that ethics are going to save the day?  I just want to end this by saying thanks to all the very smart scientists I follow.  Particularly, I'll give a shout out to Adam Rutherford.  Go follow him over on Twitter, where he pointed out that eugenics works so well that following the murder of two to three hundred thousand people with schizophrenia in the Holocaust as part of their eugenics program, by 1975, the numbers in Germany had returned to pre-war levels.  Huh.  Adam's new book, Arguing with Racists, is out now, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Thanks for watching.  Make sure you subscribe and turn on alerts so you know when new videos go up.
