            "text": "Hi everyone.  So I'm doing this video today on fertility.  It's not going to be a political video because I really haven't done any political videos since Trudeau won reelection.  I've been pretty uninspired in that department.  I've also been undergoing some fertility challenges and I was hoping that while you're sitting at home during this horrible corona outbreak that you could watch this YouTube video if you are struggling with fertility issues.  Mine in particular was egg quality.  so my sad story last year in 2019 i went through three miscarriages in less than a year.  it was horribly devastating and uh you know i was kind of at my breaking point and we went to a doctor downtown a fertility clinic and she immediately said to me you know what based on your age i was 38 at the time i'm now 39. she said i think that this is an egg quality issue.  i think that you are having miscarriages due to egg quality.  It turned out her diagnosis was correct because we did some genetic testing on the last miscarriage that I had and it turned out that the baby had chromosomal abnormalities.  So fast forward to January of this year when I did IVF.  I only did my retrieval.  I have not done my transfer yet.  But we had tremendous results for a woman of my age.  We actually had four genetically normal They were tested with PGS, chromosomally normal embryos, and then we had one Mosaic embryo.  So really we have five embryos to work with heading into our transfer.  So obviously we were very thrilled with these results.  I definitely think that it was a combination of the doctor's advice as well as a book I read and my diet and lifestyle changes that I made.  And that's what I'm going to talk about in this video because women that are undergoing IVF and really want to amp up their egg quality, For their retrieval definitely want to take some of this advice.  Listen to it because it could help you and you could have some success and of course it could lead to a healthy baby.  the first thing I did obviously was listen to my doctor when she said it was an egg quality issue and I talked to her and she recommended some supplements for me and And, you know, so those I bought at the clinic and I use them in conjunction with reading this book.  So this book was recommended to me by some women on some chat forums in regards to fertility.  It's called It Starts With The Egg and it was written by an author named Rebecca Fett.  She was going through her own infertility issues and she decided to put her research skills to work.  And she was able to come up with some supplements through all of the intense research that she did.  that helped her improve her egg quality and it actually helped her produce some beautiful eggs.  And she now has two healthy children.  So I read this book and loved it.  It was very good.  It had so much information in this book.  She's got all different plans for women, depending on what your infertility issue is.  Mine was reoccurring miscarriage due to egg quality.  So I go to page one 98 and I take a look at what she's written here.  So let's talk about the supplements that I took.  I took her advice in conjunction with my doctor.  And of course, all the supplements are pretty much the same.  I took a little bit more supplements based on Rebecca's advice than what the doctor had decided to give me.  I think it was.  she gave me about five supplements.  And in this book, there's a few more.  So let's talk about the advanced plan for recurrent miscarriage that I personally did.  Now, of course, if you pick up this book, you might not have recurrent miscarriage.  That might not be your issue.  But I do find.  a lot of the supplements are pretty much the same.  Depending on your issue.  really these supplements are across the board.  They work for all types of different cases of infertility.  She says here consider taking the following supplements for two or three months before trying to conceive which I did a prenatal with at least 800 mcg of methylfolate.  where is my?  I have this whole thing here.  all of my Supplements looks like a doctor's office.  Okay, so I took this prenatal vitamin.  How do you do this?  see that prenatal multivitamin.  it's called Vita Day.  I bought.  I bought some of my supplements online.  I bought some of them a health food store and I bought some of them at Walmart.  this one in particular I did buy at a health food store because it's very difficult to find prenatals that have methylfolate.  of course you can spend a fortune on prenatals.  so this one didn't have as much because I couldn't find one that had that much in it and So I went with the next best option.  This one had 333 MCGs.  Now, I don't have that genetic mutation MTHFR.  So I wasn't as concerned with the methylfolate.  I also took folic acid based on my doctor's advice.  So I know that this is a little bit of a conflict because if you can't process folic acid, typically you would take the methylfolate.  And in my case, I didn't have the genetic mutation, so I just took them both.  So I don't know, not the best advice there, but I wanted to stay in accordance with both Rebecca's advice and my doctor's.  So the next one, which is pretty much the gold standard for egg quality is CoQ10.  Rebecca devotes an entire chapter to CoQ10 in the book.  talking about how important it is for women with poor egg quality and the improvements shown through research that CoQ10 really works.  So that one was really important.  This one I just got at Walmart.  So she says that you should take 400 milligrams per day, one 200 milligram capsule with breakfast and one with lunch.  And the reason for that is you should take it with some fat, but also you can't digest 400 milligrams of CoQ10 altogether so it's better if you space it out.  Now as I was leading up into the IVF about a week prior I got a little excited and I took another tablet.  So I was actually taking three tablets of CoQ10.  so it was 600 milligrams I was taking but honestly we had amazing results.  so I have to think that CoQ10 probably worked right.  Okay so the next one that she recommends is A-L-A, I can't really pronounce it.  This one I got at the health food store and she says 200 to 300 milligrams, preferably at least 30 minutes before a meal.  Vitamin E is really important for both retrieval and transfer and you can take that at any time.  I typically take my supplements in the morning because as we go through the day, I tend to get busy and then I forget.  So I really do everything in the morning.  The next one is one that I cannot pronounce.  So I'll just show it to you.  I got it at the health food store.  600 milligrams.  And yeah, you can take this one at any time during the day.  Now, if you're trying to conceive through IVF, which I was, she also recommends taking melatonin.  You can get this pretty much any health food store.  You can get it at Walmart.  You can get it at the grocery store.  If they have a vitamin section, it's relatively cheap.  And that one you should be taking two weeks to one month before the egg retrieval.  I kind of slipped a bit and forgot about that one.  So I only took it about a week prior to the egg retrieval.  Okay.  So the other thing that's really important is if you have an underactive thyroid, you should go to the doctor.  and get your thyroid panel tested.  I did that.  My thyroid came back fine.  However, I had a healthy son in 2018, that pregnancy, everything was fine.  But when I was first pregnant, they did a blood test on me and they saw that my thyroid was actually higher.  And so they put me on a very low dose of Synthroid.  And so I went to this doctor that I'm currently working with now.  And I told her that story and she said, you know what?  We're going to put you on thyroid medicine.  even though your thyroid looks to be okay, your TSH levels are fine.  It's not just TSH that you wanna look at.  When you do the whole thyroid panel, they really take a really good look at everything that's going on.  For me, it didn't seem like there were any issues.  Regardless, they still put me on the thyroid med.  It's very important to get your thyroid tested, especially if you are going through recurrent miscarriage as I did.  Vitamin D is also incredibly important.  Now this one is the capsule version of vitamin D. This is just a cheap one.  You can just get that at Walmart.  When I was actually gearing up for the retrieval, I used a liquid D3.  And that is also what Rebecca suggests.  Most women who live in the Northern Hemisphere are actually deficient in vitamin D. So if you don't get a test, assume that you are deficient and take about 10,000 UIs of vitamin D for two weeks and then back off to about 5,000.  Okay, so DHEA.  is not available in Canada over the counter.  you have to get it from your doctor.  my doctor recommended it to me as a supplement and I took it happily so.  here's the one that I took like life extension DHEA 25 milligrams.  she told me to take it.  I think I took it three times a day.  They didn't test me for testosterone, but she just said this is a very popular supplement to give women for egg quality prior to their egg retrievals.  I also took fish oil.  Okay.  Fish oil is just, it's really good for you.  Omega-3s.  I took vitamin C. I took one a day.  500 milligrams.  Rebecca suggests that you do take some vitamin C. And something else that I took is called Oversalt.  Yes.  So I ordered this online.  It's expensive.  It's like $100 for this.  This is supposed to help with egg quality.  I took that for about a month and a half.  It was recommended to me by a different doctor.  This went out of the US and I just thought, okay, fine, I'll take it.  I mean, it's not going to hurt, right?  Diet is the other part of this equation.  So not only did I take all the supplements, I also changed my diet and I changed my diet significantly.  In the book, It Starts With The Egg, Rebecca recommends the Mediterranean diet.  Because I have some inflammation, I decided that I was going to go against that advice and I was going to go keto.  I thought, you know what?  I don't want to have any of that white bread, white rice, white pasta leading up to the retrieval.  So for almost two and a half months, I did not eat any sugar.  I mean it.  I was so diligent.  I was like a woman possessed and it was hard because it happened over Christmas and you know, chocolate at Christmas, wine at Christmas.  I didn't drink anything, no alcohol, zero alcohol.  I wasn't so stringent with coffee though.  Because I thought, oh, wow, I can't have any of these vices, sugar or alcohol.  You know what?  Maybe I'll have some coffee because I love coffee.  And I really struggled to give it up.  The doctor even said, you know what?  One coffee a day is okay.  I was drinking probably one to two and I was drinking it with heavy cream, no sugar.  Basically, a regular diet plan is, you know, on keto, I would eat bacon and eggs in the morning.  I would use butter and I would have a coffee with some cream.  And then in the afternoon, I would have salad with chicken with some dressing that I had made with olive oil, no balsamic vinegar.  You can use red wine vinegar, but no balsamic because it has sugar in it.  And then for dinner, I would have a piece of meat and greens, and that would be it.  That's all I would eat.  If I was really hungry, I would have fruit, but it was only berries because on keto, you can eat berries.  You can't really eat any other fruit, and then with a little bit of cream.  I was really diligent about my diet.  I felt really good.  Inflammation cleared up.  I felt my head was very clear.  I didn't have any headaches anymore.  I didn't have any mood swings.  Even on IVF meds, I didn't have mood swings when I was on keto, which I thought was really interesting.  And I just felt good.  Like, I just felt like I was being very healthy.  And I mean, the thing is with keto, it's, you know, gearing up for the egg retrieval.  You're, you're determined to do it, but it's a very difficult lifestyle to keep up.  I'm sure I've got some people in common saying, I've been doing keto for four years.  It's amazing.  Blah, blah, blah for me.  It was difficult.  But again, leading up to your egg retrieval, I would be as stringent with your diet as you can possibly be.  I've talked to some women and they even say that they didn't eat anything other than steak and the occasional greens.  They were doing the intermittent fasting.  They would have a coffee in the morning with cream and then they would eat at night a steak.  That's it.  A ribeye with lots of marbled fat.  That's it.  I'm like, no.  Okay.  Interestingly enough, I did talk to a doctor at a CNY fertility in Syracuse, Dr.  Keltz, and he said that you should be on the baby diet.  That's his diet.  So it stands for butter, eggs, bacon, something else, and ice cream.  Oh, beef and ice cream.  And that's a little too hard for me.  I couldn't do it.  He said vegetables are evil.  I shouldn't eat them.  I thought green vegetables.  I don't know.  I really like them.  So, but he said that he's seen women with miraculous results, just eating that diet.  And when I say ice cream, it's like a special concoction ice cream that he's created.  It's not regular ice cream with sugar in it that you get at the grocery store.  I think it's like Egg with heavy cream.  Those are the things that I did.  In terms of exercise, I just did some moderate walking.  I also did fertility yoga.  I will leave a link in the description of who I was watching.  And her name is Yoga Yin.  She's on YouTube.  She does all these amazing fertility videos.  It's very calm.  It's very relaxed.  She does egg quality yoga.  She'll do yoga for reoccurring miscarriage, yoga for the two week wait, yoga for uterine lining thickness.  I mean, she covers it all.  She's great.  And I guess part two of this video will be, you know, were my results successful for when that day comes when we do the transfer.  So that'll be my next video.  At least this is a two part series.  That's how we'll look at it.  OK, well, this is the retrieval and then gearing up for the transfer.  and then was a transfer a success.  I don't know.  We'll have to find out.  Anyways, thank you so much for watching this video.  Thank you for liking and subscribing.  And also, please take care during this coronavirus outbreak.  Stay safe, stay healthy, wash your hands, wear a mask if you have to, self-isolate, do all the things that you need to do.  Good luck.  to all the women out there, I should say, that are struggling with infertility as well as the pregnant women.  But all of the women that are going through infertility, it's very hard.  And just know that there's a lot of women like you out there.  And I hope that everything works out for you.  Thanks, bye. ",
