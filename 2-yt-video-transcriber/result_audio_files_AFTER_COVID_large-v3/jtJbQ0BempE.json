And then when King was assassinated and Kennedy was assassinated, that was pretty traumatic for a young teenager.  And I kind of lost a lot of hope.  and then the Vietnam War was there and I became an anti-war activist and went off to college and from there got involved in international issues, but domestic issues as well.  And, you know, it actually came up for me when I went to George Floyd's funeral.  And I looked up at his portrait and I saw he was born in 1973.

For those of you who don't know, I've done a lot of politics over the years, met a lot of people on every side of the aisle.

And I don't know whether that's just her warmth, her intelligence, the fact that I just felt like there was a real commitment there, but I've always been a big fan.  and always said to people who would listen, if there's ever another Democratic Speaker of the House after Speaker Pelosi retires, I think it will be Congresswoman Bass.  I think she's that special.  But guess what?  Tonight, maybe we saw the next vice president, or at least the next vice presidential nominee.  Who knows?  But it was really interesting to hear.  And sometimes, sometimes in life, an interesting fit and interesting overlap leads to something special.  I hope you enjoyed today.  If you did, definitely tell people about it.
