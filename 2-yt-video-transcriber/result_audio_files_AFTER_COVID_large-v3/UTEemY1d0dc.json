            "text": "How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Brian Logan.  And today we got to talk about what you just saw, which was a father and a mother in Atlanta, Georgia, talking about Black Lives Matter, taking the life of their eight year old daughter, Sequoia Turner.  Now, this was really sad, really unfortunate.  I'm not even really sure where to begin.  I guess the first thing would be to explain a little bit of the context.  behind what they were saying and then we'll get into what's actually going on and my humble opinion about it.  now the mother as you saw in the video got off of the interstate at the university boulevard exit and this particular part of the city had been blocked off intermittently.  because right off that exit is the wendy's where rayshard brooks was shot and killed by police.  you know the guy that was drunk driving passed out in the drive-through.  The police come up to him, tell him to pull over, talk to him for like 45 minutes to an hour.  They try to arrest him.  He fights back, punches him in the face, steals a taser, fires at the cop, and then the cop shoots back.  And then there's this whole big thing about Black Lives Matter, hands up, don't shoot, all this, that.  And then third, talking about Rayshard Brooks as an innocent person.  Not really so, but I digress for now.  My whole point is that there was this whole big protest behind that.  They burned the Wendy's down in that particular area where the husk of the Wendy's is.  became kind of a mini-chazz.  Some so-called BLM protesters that blocked that area off.  Now, since this area is right by the interstate, people have to go right there to get on to the interstate to get to where they gotta go.  It's an on-ramp right there and an off-ramp.  So you have a really high-traffic part of the city.  They were stopping people from going through and, you know, trying to check people kind of like a checkpoint, unofficial BLM checkpoint, basically ran by gangbangers as general thugs in the area.  Not a peaceful thing.  But anyway, the police had cleared this area out.  But the so-called protesters, rioters, insurrectionists, gangbangers, drug addicts, general criminals put the barrier back up.  So I don't know if the mother knew that the barrier was back up or whatever the case may be, but she was just trying to get home with her eight-year-old daughter and the mother's friend in the car.  Now, once they get off at the exit, they are trying to approach the barrier, go around or whatever.  But they were instructed by the so-called protesters to pull into a parking lot and turn around and go to other direction.  But they were not given the chance to actually turn around and go to other direction.  You may have heard her say, we tried to do a U-turn.  We couldn't do a U-turn.  They shot my tires out.  They shot into my car.  Why?  Why?  It was not just one person just accidentally shooting.  It was at least two people firing into the car, killing the eight-year-old girl, okay?  And like the father said, Black Lives Matter, when, where, how?  If Black Lives Matter, what'd it be doing?  You killed your own.  Black Lives Matter, what?  And contrary to some rumors that are out there, this is not a block party.  This kind of went wrong.  It wasn't like, you know, it was a block party.  Somebody get into a fight over a girl.  They start shooting and then a bullet indiscriminately went into the car and struck the girl.  No, you had two black men.  so-called protesters, one dressed as a bounty hunter, other one had on a white T-shirt.  These guys fired into the vehicle and like the mother said, shot at her tires.  So they were trying to disable the vehicle.  They were trying to kill whoever was inside the car.  shooting indiscriminately, not as far as not knowing where it's gonna go, but not caring who's inside the car or what they were really doing in that particular area.  Maybe they were just trying to get home.  Maybe they were innocent people.  And this same thing happened over in Chad's shop where the so-called Chad security shot and killed at least one, probably two black people, a 16 year old boy and a 19 year old young man.  Why do we have so many kids that are being shot and killed as a result of Black Lives Matter?  You tell me, because I was told that Black Lives Matter wants the best for black people.  They want the advancement of black people.  They want to protect black kids and black adults, elderly, everybody else.  They want to do the right thing for the black community.  But I see everything except for that.  All I see is death, chaos, and destruction all over the country, not just in Atlanta with Sequoia Turner, not just in Chicago, Illinois, where the murder rate has skyrocketed, not just in New York City, in Philadelphia, Houston, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, all over the United States, I'm seeing the exact same thing.  Like I've said many times before, these so-called BLM protesters don't care if the black-on-black murder rate jumps up exponentially.  They don't care if it goes from the way it was over the past few years to like 200, 300 to 400 percent higher.  They don't really.  it doesn't matter because all they are actually out there to do is a few things, but probably two main things.  Number one, to just undermine the police.  And then number two, to push for a Marxist political agenda, an anti-Trump political agenda.  The founder of Black Lives Matter, one of the founders at least, got on TV, it might have been MS-13 DNC, and said that they are trained Marxists and their goal is to get Trump out of office.  How do black lives and Marxism connect at all?  How do black lives and Donald Trump's presidency connect at all?  They're talking about Donald Trump's presidency being a clear and present danger to black people.  But how does that make any sense?  You're talking about a lowest black unemployment rate ever before the virus hit.  You're talking about very low taxes, rules and regulations for black folks to be able to prosper.  The Opportunity Zones permanently funded HBCUs.  I can go on.  I'm not sure how his presidency has anything to do with black lives.  It doesn't have anything to do with that.  This is a political agenda.  That black folks are being used as cannon fodder to fund, to operate, to push forward, to give excuses for.  Because you get some kind of bipartisan support because people don't want to say that black lives don't matter.  Or, you know, everybody knows that black lives matter.  But what are we talking about when we say black lives matter?  We got to be very clear.  All right.  All lives actually matter, and that includes black lives.  When you say black lives matter in this particular context in current day America, you're saying it in a kind of separatist way.  You are encouraging those that are out there with these barriers and little autonomous zones, black house autonomous zone, Uh, crack heroin, if enemies own, I mean, Capitol Hill autonomous zone, you're encouraging them to go out there and do what they're doing.  So-called peaceful people are right out there with the non-peaceful people engaging in general chaos and lawlessness.  And to get back to the whole anti-police thing, how is this working out?  OK, this whole blue flu thing in Atlanta is not necessarily over with because the officers still don't feel like they have the support of local leadership.  Keisha Lance Bottoms will come out every now and again and say the right thing.  Like in this case of Sequoia Turner, she came out and said, look, It's not about police brutality, it's about us killing us.  We're doing more damage to each other.  She's saying stuff like that, but at the same time, she'll throw the police under the bus and not really give them any kind of protection.  The DA, Paul Howard, doing the same thing.  So it was like, what are you gonna do if you are a police officer and you want to do your job properly, you wanna protect citizens, but you're not allowed to do so?  The result is all the shootings that you've seen all over the country.  In Atlanta, I think it might have been like 14 people got killed or some, you know, some number close to that in several different shootings.  There was a house party in Edgewood.  This was not the shooting that killed Sequoia Turner.  However, there are multiple shootings that killed multiple people in Atlanta and all over the United States, all because of Black Lives Matter.  OK, how many more people have to die?  How many more parents got to go on TV?  This is the second parent that I've seen go on TV crying about their child.  The first one was the 19 year old in Seattle, Horace Lorenzo Anderson Jr.  His father, Horace  Sr.,  was on TV crying.  Now you have Sequoia Turner's father and the mother TV crying.  So, I mean, how many more deaths do we need to have?  The death, chaos and destruction that Black Lives Matter has directly caused by them shooting people or indirectly caused by nullifying the police or succeeding in defunding the police or, you know, having the police kind of being forced to back off because they can't afford to have their lives ruined over a false allegation of some kind of misconduct.  The lives that they have taken have far and beyond outpaced the lives that police have taken in an unjust fashion.  So as I close, I want to say this.  If black lives really matter, you would start the Black Lives Matter protests.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think that Sequoia Turner's death could have been prevented if the police were allowed to do what they're supposed to do?  The Black Lives Matter protesters were not right there on that particular intersection.  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Or am I just wrong here?  Is it not the Black Lives Matter protesters that are killing these people directly or indirectly?  I mean, who is it then?  And Chaz Chop, you had Black Lives Matter everywhere.  And in the zone, it was Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and one of the so-called security killed a young black man.  They killed two men.  young black people, a 19-year-old and a 16-year-old, both men, both young, both black.  So I'm just trying to figure out what are we really doing?  Are we trying to advance the cause of black people in Black Lives Matter?  Or are we trying to just use black people as cannon fodder for pushing a particular political narrative, ending of the nuclear family, ending of just the American culture as we know it in general, all right?  Ending of... gender norms like being male and female and gender roles.  what are we really doing?  where are we going?  are we going forwards or are we going backwards?  whatever your thoughts are please let me know in the comments below.  and that's all i gotta say for this video.  if you like what you heard please comment rate share and subscribe peace.
