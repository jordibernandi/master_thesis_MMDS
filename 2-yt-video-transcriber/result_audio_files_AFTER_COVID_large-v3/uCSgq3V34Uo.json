            "text": "Why'd you put a sad face on Twitter?  Everything is so sad.  I wouldn't normally talk about anything because I don't, for whatever reason, because I don't like to talk about private stuff too much.  But man, dude, I hope Lily doesn't do any crazy dumb shit today.  That's all I'm going to say.  It would be really hard not to say something if she did.  I drove over last night to chat with her about the... Because she was getting pretty crazy messages.  And she's super second-guessing herself on things that both of us know happen.  And it's pretty disappointing how much her mind is fried because of dumbass fucking comments online.  And because of emails she's getting too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope that that... I hope that... Yeah, I don't know.  It feels shitty because, like, I don't want to speak out and, like, pressure her to do, like, a certain action, but holy fuck.  Sky, you have no idea, dude.  You don't even know the start of it.  You don't even, you couldn't even guess.  Oh my god.  Did you see some of the old shit that was brought back up about Jake and Bake?  Um, yeah.  Apparently he tried to, like, hook up with a girl that he was, like, streaming.  Like, it was pretty shitty.  It was pretty dumb.  I hope he's, like, learned better by now.  I don't know how long ago that was, but.  Lily and Melina got shit on.  Melina will probably get super shit on, probably because she's in an open relationship, so she's basically begging to get raped at all points in her life.  It wouldn't surprise me if that's, like, the mentality.  Damn, dude.  Anytime anything is posted about either of us, it's pretty crazy, like, how insane the comment sections are.  The song's in your music sharing thread.  Oh, yeah, what?  This used to be on our playlist.  Oh, and then also dating me, a lot of people will hate her by default, too.  What do you think is the probability of ice getting unbanned?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Oh, man, dude.  Like, I like Chris and Pekka.  I don't even think Chris is, like, a bad guy or anything.  I think that he just acted so insanely fucking stupidly that night.  But, like, to try to blame it on being blackout drunk, like... Like, all three of us were there.  Like, nobody, like, I've seen Lily way more drunk than that.  She was even close to blackout drunk.  And Chris is basically an alcoholic.  There's no fucking way that he was drunk.  Like, I don't know.  Well, we'll see what happens today, I guess.  Somebody said the most recent Alice Phoebe Lou video has a super not safe work thumbnail.  Does it?  Oh, it's boobs.  Holy shit.  Okay.  Nevermind.  The thing that doesn't sit right is that they're trying to collaborate on a statement.  It feels like they're trying to manipulate the wording to paint them in a better light.  Yeah.  That's yeah.  You're getting, you're on the right track.  People are shitting on their Noveroo on Noveroo post.  What was Noveroo's post?  In a perfect society where all this predatory stuff isn't the norm, would it be appropriate to handle stuff like the Fed situation in the public eye, or would that ideally be handled behind the scenes if this stuff wasn't so pervasive?  I think there's a couple different ways to look at it.  I think that in an ideal, perfect world, I think that all of it would be handled probably behind closed doors.  I think there is value in making people see, though, how insanely pervasive it is.  And it seems sometimes like behaviors don't change.  I don't know.  I'm kind of mixed feelings on it, but... I kind of wish that, like, everything wasn't so black and white.  Like, I don't think that Fed is, like, a horrible, like, rapist, disgusting, horrible piece of shit person.  I just think it's just, it's a story of, like, another guy that has no respect for people's boundaries and thinks he can get away with more than he should.  Like, yeah, I don't know.  How much does being drunk actually inhibit your cognition?  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, like... I really don't know.  I'm not sure.  I... Like... Like, on, when I was on, like, when I was super ultra shroomed up, I still asked Becca if, like, it was okay to touch her.  I've been ultra fucking wasted around people before, and I generally ask them, unless I think it's okay for some reason.  Like, the Mia shit was dumb.  I probably shouldn't have been so handsy with Hasan.  But if I know it's somebody who is careful with their boundaries, I think even when I'm drunk, I'm generally asking.  I know on MDMA, I'm usually pretty cognizant of people's boundaries.  I don't feel like just taking a drug.  GHB, supposedly, can make you ultra blackout.  So that might be a drug that can do it?  You asked Hasan, Destiny, if you can touch him?  Oh, did I actually?  Oh, if I did.  Okay, I feel a lot better about that.  if I did.  I don't remember.  I probably still should have recognized it.  It was maybe uncomfortable.  I don't know.  Oh, well, that's good at least.  I feel a little bit less bad about it then.  Yeah, GHB is a really bad thing, I think.  But in terms of just drinking, I don't know.  Oh, I did ask him.  Oh, that's... Oh, okay.  Well, good.  Fuck.  Okay.  Well, fuck it then.  Okay, never mind.  I feel way better about that.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  What if he said no?  Uh-oh.  Alcohol depresses the center of the brain.  that inhibits your bad actions.  I think that, like, something that's more important to recognize, though, is that, like, if you know that you have a proclivity to get that drunk, you probably shouldn't do it then around people like girls, right?  Like, that seems to be, like, let's say we were to assume that, like, oh, like, when you drink, like, it seems like you get really touchy with girls.  Okay, well, maybe then don't.  this yikes this was apparently like two or three weeks ago. ",

The fuck do you expect me to do about it?  Like, I don't know.  I don't understand.  But, whatever.  Keemstar reacting to that clip.  That wasn't him reacting to the clip.  I think that was him reacting to the TwitLonger.  I don't think this could have gotten popular.  America has a huge drinking problem?  Maybe.  I used to wonder that.  There's a lot of alcohol in fucking Russia, though.  I know at the very least.  And I've heard in Sweden, too, that they have a lot of problems with alcohol up there.  There are a lot of fucking alcoholics and shit.  I would have to go look up the numbers.  Sweden, alcohol.  Is it like related deaths or... Or maybe it was alcohol-related, like, accidents?  I feel like in both Sweden and in Russia, I think those two, Denmark, you'd have the most, like, there was, like, some pretty fucked shit.  It was insane, I thought.  I don't remember what metric or what figure I was looking up, though, but... Hot take ban all alcohol over 5%?  Yeah, I don't, I just don't understand.  Man, I'm so lucky, dude.  Because I'm just like, I'm like biologically wired to be lucky in some ways.  Like, for alcohol, I just don't like the taste of it.  I could never, ever drink recreationally.  Like, if I'm drinking, it's literally just to like, get a little bit fucked up to have a little bit of fun.  But that's like, I could never do that every night.  Oh, God.  Alcohol tastes so fucking gross to me.  Like, beer is disgusting.  Ugh.  I don't even, yeah.  I can do like some mixed drinks.  why okay isn't it mostly a learned taste?  maybe i don't know whatever the fuck it is.  i hate it.  it's disgusting.  what about wine?  nope same way you're so mean.
