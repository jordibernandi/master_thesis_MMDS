I was calling my sister at the time and somewhat distracted by looking at my phone.  When two men approached me, stepped toward me off the curb and said, you know, hey, who are you?  I said, I'm James.  And they asked me, is that your real name?  I said, yes, that's my real name.  But one of them stepped behind me, boxed me out, and took my wallet out of my back pocket.  So I went to run, to flee, and I was tackled and ultimately beaten pretty severely.  I was screaming for someone to call the police.  When I was being choked, I feared for my life, truly.  And it was a moment where everything went black.  And as far as I know, that is as close as you can get to being dead without being dead.  The police came, and then that was when I realized that they weren't muggers, but they were just police detective and an FBI agent. ",
