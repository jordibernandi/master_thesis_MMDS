            "text": "The long-standing view, as summarized by the philosopher Immanuel Kant, that without man the whole of creation would be a mere wilderness, a thing in vain, and have no final end, is revealed to be self-indulgent folly.  A principle of mediocrity seems to apply to all our circumstances.  We could not have known beforehand that the evidence would be so repeatedly and thoroughly incompatible with the proposition that human beings are at center stage in the universe.  but most of the debates have now been settled decisively in favor of a position that, however painful, can be encapsulated in a single sentence.  We have not been given the lead in the cosmic drama.  My journey into secular humanism began once I realized that humanity need not be understood as a specially created hybrid creature of material and spirit who was assigned a spiritually transcendent moral purpose.  In a chapter titled The Great Demotions, within Carl Sagan's classic work Pale Blue Dot, the author presents scientific findings which have, historically, challenged the pride found in the presumption that humanity is central to the universe.  In earlier times, humanity's centrality was upheld quite literally.  Humanity and the world it inhabits are at the center of all that is.  The sun and the rest of the heavens all revolve around us, we proudly believe.  Eventually, though, this notion was challenged upon our discovery that the Earth itself revolves around our sun.  This was perhaps the first of humanity's great demotions.  Many more demotions followed in increasingly rapid succession as we learned more about the natural world.  We held to hope that our sun, and even later, our Milky Way galaxy, were still the center of the universe, but we discovered they were not.  We hoped our planet, and later our galaxy, were the only planet or only galaxy in existence, but we discovered they were not.  We thought ourselves primary and specially created beings, here since the beginning, created with different materials or by some different process than anything else.  But we discovered we were not.  Our most reliable tools of inquiry lead us to the understanding that our being in the universe required no more a special creation than anything else.  Acknowledging this, among other things, brought me out of religious superstition and into secular humanism.  This, of course, was no easy realization for me.  I fought against the demotions which scientific knowledge offered humanity just as many far brighter than myself have historically done.  With a good deal of cognitive dissonance and even more special pleading, I staved off the then-crushing realization of my actual place in the universe.  Eventually, though, the case against my religious conceits grew too strong to reject.  Once on the other side of that realization, I understood that my resistance to my change of mind wasn't born entirely out of intellectual conviction, but rather out of my own desires.  I wanted to believe I was specially created.  I wanted to be assigned some objective, transcendent purpose.  If you'd like to hear more about my journey out of faith, I have a dedicated video on that linked in the card box as well as the description.  This video isn't meant to provide as much detail on the process as that one.  My intellectual stubbornness, born out of emotional fervor, was, I later discovered, rather typical of human cognition.  In a paper that's become quite influential for me, The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tale, A Social Intuitionist Approach to Moral Judgment, psychologist Jonathan Haidt makes the empirical case that human cognition especially in moral thinking, is largely directed by quick, automatic, unconscious processes, and that moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction generated after a judgment has been reached.  Later in his book, The Righteous Mind, Haidt uses the analogy of an elephant and a rider to illustrate the relationship between the intuitive unconscious mind and the verbal rational mind, respectively.  If you'd like to read that paper, it's linked in the description.  Upon my acknowledgement that the intuitive elephant was usually in control and that the verbal reasoning-capable writer acted as a kind of lawyer, inventing a logical case for the elephant's prior judgments, I recognized a pattern in humanity's reactions to the great demotions of the past and present.  When scientific findings challenge what Sagan called human chauvinism, we firstly consider those findings offensive, perhaps even purposely insensitive to humanity.  We then, armed with whatever data we might use to defend our feelings, construct a logical case for why, ultimately, we are still as central to the universe and worthy of special consideration as we feel.  If you ever wonder why countless religions make some sort of case for human centrality and exceptionalism while also being mutually contradictory in their minutiae, Haidt's social intuitionist model provides some explanatory power.  We feel and intuit first and reason second.  We feel we must be exceptionally special, so we invent colorful, intuitively persuasive explanations for why this must be so.  Allow this process to play out among a geographically, culturally, and linguistically divided humanity, and you've got yourself a plethora of religions which wildly disagree about the proper logical justifications for human moral instincts.  This kind of post hoc reasoning is precisely what I did to defend my own religious beliefs in the past, and I was proud of myself for having ultimately changed my mind on such a personal issue as my faith, despite my human tendency to exploit the writer for the sake of the elephant's comfort.  I tried not to get too caught up in that pride, though, because I knew that even if I had overcome an irrational tendency once, I was still prone to it going forward.  This is where the next part of my ideological journey picks up.  In 2019, I found myself confronted with ideas and information which put the elephant on the defense and the rider to work.  The primary idea which provided me such a challenge could be stated as follows.  The case for equal moral consideration of any beings, human or not, may only rest firmly on the consideration of those beings' ability to suffer.  Put another way, a capacity for suffering is the only attribute which we may take into account to be logically consistent in grounding the idea that all humans must be given equal moral consideration.  If we so ground our principle of equal consideration, though, we find no basis for refusing equal moral consideration for non-humans with a capacity for suffering.  If this idea is reasonable, I thought, I should accept it.  Although it would conflict with a behavior I wanted to continue doing, using animal products.  I wouldn't, after all, in my application of the principle of equality toward humans, purposely use products which require the entrapment and slaughter of humans to produce.  I didn't exactly meditate on this idea when I first came across it.  I briefly considered it, told myself I'd circle back to it in the future when I had more time, and then moved on.  I had no plans of making any behavioral changes at that time.  Later, I did revisit this idea, but not unprompted.  If I were to try to pinpoint a time when I actually began mulling it over, it might have been when I overheard Alex O'Connor and Armin Navabi casually debating the topic in person.  With my mind turned to the issue again, I thought up some objections in the form of other traits upon which I thought an ethical principle of equal consideration could be grounded.  These traits were high intelligence, conscious foresight, a capacity for existential anxiety, and belonging to a community.  Other traits which I read others propose included autonomy, a sense of justice, and the capacity to respect the rights of others.  For a while, I thought my objections were valid.  Given a bit more time, though, I started to see some holes, or more precisely, one giant hole in every single ethical grounding I thought up.  If instead of grounding our ethical principle of equal consideration in the regard for a capacity for suffering, we grounded it in the regard for a capacity for high intelligence, conscious foresight, existential anxiety, belonging to a community, individual autonomy, a sense of justice, or respecting the rights of others, we'd have ourselves an ethical principle of equal consideration which excludes either human infants, young children, people living apart from society, some people who are mentally handicapped, or all of the above.  Grounding our ethic on such things would allow for a disregard of the lives of those who I still believed should be taken into consideration.  I'd love to tell you that I changed my position and behavior upon this realization, but I didn't.  Instead, as I found myself, not intrusively, but more frequently presented ideas regarding the ethical treatment of animals, I began to get... bothered.  Any sort of explanation of animal suffering which utilized analogies to any level of human suffering, even those where animal suffering wasn't said to be comparably severe, made me angry.  It's utterly dehumanizing, insulting to humans to compare or draw analogy between the suffering of humans and animals, I thought.  At some point, I spoke this thought aloud to myself, and quickly realized its obvious flaws.  Humans are animals.  My disgust at any analogy between the suffering of human animals and the suffering of non-human animals was an attitude based not on the consideration of some fact of biology, but on my natural human inclination toward irrational human exceptionalism.  See, in comparisons between human and animal suffering, humans were not being dehumanized.  Rather, I resisted this comparison because, without plain disregard for the concerns or interests of other animals, I could not claim complete and total superiority to other animals.  It turns out that when faced with one of science's most recent great demotions of humanity, the fact that humans are animals and possess the same evolutionarily ancient machinery of a nervous system that most other macroscopic animals possess, I reacted the same way that superstitious humans have to the great demotions for centuries.  I wanted to be the center, in this case the moral center of the universe, so I allowed the writer to invent post hoc rationalizations for the sake of the elephant's comfort.  I had even directly ignored the brief discussion of this great demotion within Sagan's Pale Blue Dot.  In each age, the self-congratulatory chauvinisms are challenged in yet another arena of scientific debate.  In this century, for example, in attempts to understand the nature of human sexuality, the existence of the unconscious mind, and the fact that many psychiatric illnesses and character defects have a molecular origin.  But also, well, even if we're closely related to some of the other animals, we're different, not just in degree, but in kind, on what really matters.  Reasoning, self-consciousness, tool-making, ethics, altruism, religion, language, nobility of character.  While humans, like all animals, have traits that set them apart, otherwise how could we distinguish one species from another, human uniqueness has been exaggerated, sometimes grossly so.  From that realization on, I knew I had to abandon the special pleading and acknowledge this great demotion.  Humans possess no special, ineffable, metaphysical quality which separates us from other animals, and when it comes to moral consideration, we have no reason other than rash human instinct to place ourselves on a pedestal.  I considered humans in my moral framework because they have the capacity to suffer.  And now, I consider other animals in my moral framework for the same reason.  For clarification, equal consideration does not entail treating all human and non-human animals exactly the same.  This is for the exact same reason that equal consideration of human interests does not entail treating all humans exactly the same.  Different humans have different needs and interests.  Different species also have different needs and interests.  The actions which I think should be taken in regard to this ethical principle are primarily, one, ceasing the exploitation of animals, which includes, among other things, animal agriculture, and two, acknowledging that our species currently has the ability to cause acute environmental collapse for countless others and taking steps to keep that from happening.  Basically, this just means leaving animals alone much more than most of us currently do.  Now, I don't think this position of mine disqualifies me from adopting the label of humanist.  From what I can tell, humanism is often expressed as the proclivity toward utilizing reason rather than religious dogma and problem-solving, or as the valuing of human well-being over some divine order.  I could still call myself a humanist, I think, because I identify with those humanist values.  My sphere of moral consideration extends beyond humans, though, And that isn't a value which seems to be included under the humanist label most of the time.  In fact, from my observations, it seems that for some, humanism prioritizes the concerns of humans at the direct expense of other animals.  I don't think it has to be that way, and I still think I share most of my values with humanists.  Right now, though, I don't find the humanist label to be as useful in describing myself as I once did.  This video is not meant as a dig at humanism or humanists, because such a dig, I think, would be grounded in little more than what's been called the narcissism of small differences.  I won't pretend humanists can't agree with me on all of this or that I don't share most of my values with humanists.  While the following labels have their own drawbacks in that they're either lesser known or often poorly understood, I do like the labels of sentientist and ethical vegan when they can be usefully communicated.  If you're a humanist and you're watching this, great.  We're allies on most things and I think we're perfectly capable of constructively discussing where we are not aligned.  So that's my story of how I stopped thinking of myself as a humanist, at least for the time being.  I'd like to acknowledge that I didn't provide complete argumentation for any specific actions to be taken on the basis of my ethics, as this story wasn't primarily about those actions.  Maybe that's a discussion for another time.  Lastly, I'll state that I've used the exact same tone and level of argumentation in this video as I have in videos about other topics, although I do understand that many viewers may disagree with my conclusions.  As I often do, I'll end this video with a call for empathy.  If not for all other sentient creatures, then at least for the humans like me, who now see moral worth differently.
