            "text": "I'm just a fake silhouette Avoiding every threat.  I wanna stay like a silhouette But I can't do that.  No, I can't do that.  Hey internet friends, as we continue to chronicle the strange happenings of 2020 on this channel, between riots and coughs, a rather curious case has emerged, and no we're not talking about the fake alien invasion, which is certainly scheduled for later this year.  Rather, I'm talking about the latest update on Galen Maxwell, who was arrested by the FBI within the last week.  I'll be blunt with you, I'm not ready to make a video on the latest updates because this script is one we've all seen before and it was baloney the first time too.  So instead, we're talking about bloodlines.  Specifically, the bloodline of spook royalty, the Maxwells.  The mainstream media has rarely covered this ancestral context, and while alternative media has, you know how I am.  I just want it simplified and like 15 minutes or less.  Because I need some context from the past to navigate the present, but I also don't want to go cross-eyed staring at my computer screen for hours.  So today, we're talking about the House of Maxwell.  And we're starting with Big Papa Maxwell.  Originally born as Abraham Lieb in Czechoslovakia in 1923, the official origin story of the House of Maxwell begins in Squalor, in an impoverished village where winters were cold, food was scarce, and apparently, a few dozen name changes were par for the course.  Soon, Abraham Lieb's name transformed to Jan Abraham Ludwig, and with this name, at age 16, he left his village, dyeing his hair an unnatural black color, marching off with his mother's advice.  Act like an Englishman.  The English are successful.  Don't screw this up, twerp.  And so he followed his mother's advice.  If he were ever to achieve his family's dream of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, there were sacrifices to be made, especially as whispers of war traveled across Europe.  And with those whispers, waves of what was dubbed anti-Semitic messages spread over radio stations.  Upon hearing this talk, Abraham Lieb or Jan Abraham Ludvig or whatever the heck Robert Maxwell's name was at that time, took it upon himself to cast a better depiction of his people.  So before World War II had even started, Robert Maxwell became a storyteller, telling those who would listen that he'd lied about his age so he could join the local Czech resistance movement in Budapest.  A tale which he would relay to the BBC decades later, but it was a lie.  There was no Czech resistance at the time in Budapest because there were no German soldiers in the city.  But the facts didn't matter, it was the emotion from the story that mattered.  Which is perhaps why Robert Maxwell went on to become such a successful media mogul.  By the time he requested to join the British Army's pioneer corps, he was going by the name Jan Hotch.  Perhaps because it sounded a little more English and a little less, well, you know, not English, because he certainly didn't speak any at the time.  He kept pushing to enlist in the English ranks, setting his sights on the 6th Battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment.  And with a few character endorsements, Jan Hotch found himself in the 17th Infantry Brigade Intelligence Unit.  But this time he changed his name to Leslie Dumouriez, Dumouriez being a popular cigarette brand.  And Leslie Dumouriez was popular with British shoulders too, so much so that he became a second lieutenant shortly after his 21st birthday.  But the commanding officer took him aside saying that Dumouriez was an acceptable name for officer in the North Staffs.  So he suggested a Scottish alias instead, Ian Robert Maxwell.  And from then on, this was the Robert Maxwell, a man from nowhere that would take on the world.  All that was missing was a wife.  Maxwell no longer had to brag about battles he'd never fought.  He was seeing plenty of action in 1944 when he arrived in the newly liberated Paris for a few days of rest and relaxation.  where an arranged pairing between allied servicemen and Parisians was orchestrated by the Paris Welcome Committee.  And among the eager ladies was a woman named Elizabeth Maynard, the underfed and frail 23-year-old daughter of a silk merchant with a Protestant middle-class background, who was immediately taken by Maxwell's presence.  They were married and together they had nine children over the span of 16 years.  But unlike their post-wartime counterparts, they weren't looking to settle in their newfound peaceful life.  Robert had other ideas.  While Elizabeth found purpose in fostering relations between Christians and Jews throughout her career, focusing on Holocaust history and organizing conferences around the goal of combating anti-Semitism, her husband chased power and influence.  One of the outcomes of World War II was the establishment of the State of Israel within the region known as Palestine, a place that the newly formed United Nations had allocated as the Jewish State.  Maxwell was key in the creation of Israel given that he used his contacts to help smuggle aircraft parts to Israel during the 1948 War of Independence.  Officially established in 1949, Mossad became the National Intelligence Agency of Israel aimed at intelligence collection, covert operations, and counter-terrorism.  Sort of like the Israeli equivalent of the CIA.  It's assumed that shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel and Maxwell's rise to power that Maxwell was recruited by Mossad.  In 1964, with Maxwell representing the left-leaning Socialist Labor Party, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Buckingham and re-elected in 1966.  After his government run, Maxwell had used his contacts in the Allied occupation to build his business empire, becoming a distributor for a scientific book company and then eventually buying a controlling stake in a publisher by the name of Butterworth Springer, whose name was changed to Pergamon Press and then catapulted to Prolific Greatness.  Pergamon, which would have been located in modern-day Turkey, was an ancient Greek city known for its altar, the Pergamon Altar, also known as the Seat of Satan.  That was brought over to Berlin in 1930.  I thought that was an interesting aside, but moving right along, not only did Israeli intelligence take an interest in Maxwell's publishing companies, specifically the scientific journals he published, but the KGB also took notice, as did MI6.  Intelligence agencies of every country did deal in one thing after all.  Information.  The flow and collection of it.  As electronic communications became more refined over the decades, a software called Promise Software was developed for the specific purpose of monitoring and managing federal government databases and was bankrolled by the U.S.  Department of Justice.  It was licensed under the condition that the U.S.  did not modify or distribute the software.  Well, that promise didn't last long because, as the story goes, it was realized that the program had more capabilities than the original intended use, which was to monitor court cases.  But someone figured out if they sold the software to banks, the program could actually electronically spy on folks in real time, specifically monitoring the flow of money.  Under the guise of protecting U.S.  national interest, US intelligence took the program to an Indian reservation and the program was altered to create a backdoor to allow government spying.  As the story goes, Israel wanted to buy the software but couldn't afford it so they stole it and became a vendor for the software.  Well, guess who had access to Promise and the backdoor?  You guessed it, Robert Maxwell.  One of Promise's stories was that it was sold to Middle Eastern arms dealers, and even allegedly used by Osama bin Laden to obtain intel on the US.  that led to the attacks of 9-11, if you believe that official story.  In 1984, Maxwell acquired Mirror Group newspapers, which included the Daily Mirror.  And pretty much everyone who worked at Mirror Group said Robert Maxwell was a crook and a liar.  To say that this guy was a media mogul at this point would be an understatement.  He had his hands in everything.  MTV, New York Daily News, Macmillan Publishers, Nimbus Records, European newspapers, tabloids, and even a home computer company.  So when I look at this guy, I see someone who is firstly privy to the latest information and he collects it.  And two... He's a guy who is uniquely able to control the flow of information to the public, whether that be through educational texts, gossip columns, or even biographies about world leaders.  It's a perfect job for an operative, a perfect job for a spy.  All that's missing are sharks with laser beams.  In 1991, Maxwell died a mysterious death off the Canary Islands where his naked body was found floating off his yacht, named the Lady Glenn after his daughter.  There is much debate over the cause of his death whether it was a result of a heart attack, suicide, or hit job.  Either way, he had a lavish funeral in Israel.  And the Israeli Prime Minister eulogized him saying that Maxwell had done more for Israel than can today be said.  It's debated whether Maxwell was Mossad or Israeli military intelligence, and where his actual loyalty rested, as the billionaire publisher was rumored to have spoken eight languages fluently and was an asset for MI6, KGB, and Mossad.  It appears his main loyalty was to Israel, but when you behave the way Maxwell did, I wonder if your only loyalty is really to yourself.  It later came out that Maxwell was responsible for stealing \u00a3460 million from the Mirror Group pension fund, amounting to about $1.1 billion to finance his operations and his lifestyle.  Alright, and that, my friends, was my super-fast summary of Robert Maxwell, Israel's Super Spy by Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon.  But all this spy business didn't end there.  In fact, it stayed in the family.  It's theorized that Galena was heavily affected by her father's death and demise of his reputation.  Her status and fortune had taken a hit, and thus, Epstein provided her re-entry to the society to which she was accustomed, even though the key to that society was blackmail.  I, however, suspect she was much less prey and altogether more predator, being spook family royalty and all.  Galen's twin sisters, Christine and Isabel, were apparently internet pioneers who founded Magellan Web Search Service.  Magellan was one of the very first search engines that was live on the internet from 1995 to 2001.  Imagine the data collection potential of manning a search engine.  Find out an important person's IP address and keep a log of their inquiries, or perhaps even their darkest desires.  Excellent blackmail potential, but I digress.  The search engine was very popular amongst users.  It really had the momentum to become Google, but the company sold out, only for Galen Sisters to chase a spooky new endeavor.  Christine founded Kiliad, which is a data analytics company who managed to obtain big-time government contracts.  ranging from the FBI, CIA, and the software was likely even preloaded onto HP servers going back to the early 2000s.  The firm's software was behind the data search technology used by the FBI's counterterrorism data warehouse.  And the company's advisory board includes Alan Wade, former CIO of the CIA.  So at this juncture, since we've seen it before and history repeats, we ask, does Kiliad have a backdoor much like Promise Software that Papa Maxwell used and it was sold to foreign governments?  Christine is not an American, and a quick Google search and understanding of her family background would lead you to believe that her loyalty lies with Israel.  So how and why did Kiliad get contracts with the United States government to surveil individuals under the guise of counter-terrorism?  Hmm.  The line of questioning becomes even more damning when we factor in our lady of the hour, Galynn Maxwell, and the accusations of running a sexual blackmail operation with the abuse of underage victims.  then turning around to weaponize that abuse to blackmail individuals for, presumably, political gain, as she's been accused numerous times of being a Mossad operative.  Seriously, the continuous threat here is Mossad, so what do you Mossad people want?  Can you just come out with your list of demands already and get it over with?  What are normal people supposed to do with the idea that some of the most powerful people in the world, the people who run their governments, their media, whatever, people with access to the nuclear codes, are controlled by sexual blackmail with minors?  And am I really supposed to buy this whole story about Glenn Maxwell being arrested by the FBI with no footage of the arrest, no mugshot, no nothing?  It took a long time to arrest her.  Did this time afford her enough space to delete or move her whatever blackmail or evidence she had on others?  Now we have reports that she's on suicide watch in a New York jail rife with COVID.  So how's this exit strategy gonna go?  The way of Epstein?  By suicide or by plague?  And is any of it real?  How convenient is it that the Maxwell sisters are pioneers of the modern internet completely intertwined with US intelligence agencies?  I would define myself as a slightly optimistic realist, so as much as I want to ride the hype wave that justice is around the corner, I feel like we're getting a bit hoodwinked here.  A family of foreign spies who've influenced United States policy, intelligence agencies, news media, and even the internet?  Well, they seem like a tricky bunch.  What do you think internet friends?
