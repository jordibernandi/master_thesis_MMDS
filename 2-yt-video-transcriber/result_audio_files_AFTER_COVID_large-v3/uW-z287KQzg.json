Just wanted to ask you some questions, if you have a minute.  Do you still feel you're the most trusted name in news?  Because I have to say, from what I've been hearing on these phone calls, I don't know about that.  I mean, we've got a lot of recordings that indicate you're not really that independent of a journalist. ",

            "text": "Yeah, you too.  So you just heard me talk to the president of CNN, Jeff Zucker, and inform him that... that we are going to release a number of recordings today.  I unmuted myself into the conference line and they're still on there.  They're listening to me right now.  This is being live streamed for those of you still on the call.  And we've recorded for a while and we have clips of various producers talking, the president talking, describing their motives, describing their political philosophy, describing how they don't cover certain things and certain political parties tell them to cover things a certain way.  Lots of little clips that takes us into the minds and hearts of our people, powers that be, that inform us because government is downstream from media.  So we're going to be releasing these tapes thanks to one of our sources.  One of our brave insiders has given us this information.  And as you can see, they're still milling about on the call.  They're listening to me right now.  They have to, quote, change their systems and get a different dial-in, I guess, now, because we've compromised the dial-in.  Well, I guess we need to change the channel, huh?  Change the number, huh?  Is that Zucker there?  Store 6 again.  Hey, Jeff, you still there?  Yeah.  They're still on there.  Yeah, so we don't want to change the channel, really.  We want to stay on the channel.  We think it's important for the American people to know how you make the sausage.  To quote Noam Chomsky, manufacture consent.  Consent should not be manufactured.  It should be informed.  People should be an informed populace to make informed decisions.  So there you have it, folks.  Live streaming, the CNN 9 a.m.  conference call.  It was abruptly ended when James O'Keefe.  There it is.  AT&T.  Isn't that the company that Zucker is being fired from?  Yeah.  So they abruptly ended the conference call when I dialed in and unfortunately for them we've been recording for a while.  So what else can I say?  There's not much else to say.  I think my message to you for those watching the live stream is get ready because tonight at seven o'clock Eastern time, we're going to start releasing these little, little tapes, little clips, little clips, little audio bits of Zucker, the president, who also, uh, Chalyon, David Chalyon, vice president, Stephanie Becker, Stephanie Becker.  Um, what's the name?  Marcus Mabry.  Who's the other man that made the comments about, um, that we recorded about, um, white supremacy.  That was Mez Mabry.  Marcus Mabry made some comments and, uh, you know, we'll be airing those for all to hear and see.  And it's important that we hold accountable the mainstream media.  The media has to be held to account.  They are hurting the American people with their lies, their innuendo, their slander, their defamation, their hyperbole.  And I think Mr.  Zucker is shaking in his boots right now.  And he's very afraid of what might be coming.  So I don't really know what else to say, guys.  I mean, content is king.  And we were trying to live stream the beginning of the call, but we didn't know when Zucker was going to come in and interject and ask the question.  So we just sort of got there.  We sort of got in just in the nick of time.  What else?  More insiders.  More insiders.  Thank you to the brave insider who supplied us the information for the call.  VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
