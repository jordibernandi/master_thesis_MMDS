            "text": "Hi guys.  So these stories keep coming in almost on a daily basis.  Small business owners who voted for Brexit and then realized that it's going to destroy their industry or at least damage them financially.  Now, there are some Brexit supporters, people who voted for Brexit, who have turned around and said, look, it was a mistake.  I was lied to by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.  They led me up the garden path.  While there are other Brexiteers or Brexit supporters, I should say, who still don't realize or it doesn't seem that they realize that it was a bad choice.  It was a mistake to vote for this disaster.  Here is an example of a haulage company that exports fish from Wales and she voted for Brexit.  It cost her an extra \u00a340,000.  She was okay with that and she'll explain why.  But then we'll jump to the present day where we realise the cost that she's going to suffer now.  This report is from the 27th of September 2019. ",

            "text": "So she voted out for ideological reasons.  Now, I think she voted out because she was convinced by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, this is for the greater good.  Your business may take a bit of a hit, but it's worth it.  Now, this is another case of somebody voting that's going to affect someone else.  She's going to be directly affected by this.  We're going to see the consequences in a moment.  But remember, she said, I voted for my grandparents, a grandchildren's future.  your grandchildren will not have access to freedom of movement.  You voted to take that away.  You know, how do you sit down with your grandchildren when they're a little bit older?  I don't know how old they are, if they're able to, if they were able to access freedom of movement.  But you'll sit down with them and say, I voted to take something away from you.  You had an opportunity to go and live in France or Germany or Italy or Spain or anywhere else in the european union.  now you can't and i voted to take that away from you.  why?  well because niger faraj said something now.  remember she voted for it.  she took a 40 000 pounds hit preparing for brexit.  she said it's still okay.  i i still.  i would put this down to this footballism that uh James O'Brien describes in another way, you can also call it tribalism.  I believe it's a type of ideology where people buy into a lie, invest in the lie, and then to save face, they continue to accept the lie.  I don't know all of her reasons for voting for Brexit.  She said for the good of the country.  I don't know what that means.  Britain is worse off.  But... Let's jump to now, January.  This is the same lady.  Let me just go up so you can see.  This is the same lady.  She said, I can't do this again.  Miss Edwards, who exports shellfish from local fishermen, had sent a lorry to the continent reinforcement.  She has spent two years preparing to export into the EU after Brexit and had been confident after this week's catch that she had all the documentation she needed.  \u00a348,000 has already been paid to a group of 25 fishers.  Okay, so she prepared all the documentation.  She paid the fishermen for their fish.  She put it on a truck and she sent it to Portsmouth.  But because of issues at the border, the consignment was stuck in Portsmouth for 24 hours.  After boarding a ferry to Cayenne, it was then held by French customs for another seven hours.  Miss Edwards said that the importer in France had made a mistake on the document and that he needed to complete.  So he made a mistake on this document.  This is another thing I've talked about before and many other people have talked about.  A border has two sides.  So you can have everything perfect on your side, but if the customer, for example, doesn't have the documentation correctly, or if the customs officer on the other side makes a mistake, you suffer the consequences.  Now you can complain about that, you can ask for compensation or something, but at the end of the day, you don't control the other side of the border.  You control your side, but you don't control the other side.  Now, under the Single Market and Customs Union, there was no border.  So you would just ship things directly to France and there was none of this requirement.  You voted to create more paperwork.  You voted for this problem.  Anyway, she goes on to say, I can't do this again this next week, she told BBC Wales.  I need a break.  I can't leave the fishermen without incomes for long.  She added, we're a tiny Welsh company.  It's family run.  We're fourth generation running it.  We can't afford to take the hit.  The businesswoman said it's not only her business affected that there had been others in the queue for the ferry that had been refused.  So we're a fourth generation running it.  So she voted for Brexit.  She voted for Brexit, in her words, to help her grandchildren.  She took away freedom of movement from them.  She voted to make it more difficult for her to export her goods to the EU.  And this is helping her grandchildren.  How the hell is this helping your grandchildren?  I struggle to understand how this is.  Now she said it's to help her grandchildren.  I don't know how that's going to help them.  I don't want to put words in people's mouths, but I get the impression that she voted for Brexit for some other reason.  I don't want to say what that other reason is.  We can all imagine what that other reason is.  But if you run a business... and your principal market is the EU, why would you try to restrict your access to the EU?  I can't understand, I can't fathom the reason behind that.  Now, people outside the industry can say, well, you know, I didn't know.  I didn't know it was going to affect the fishing industry in this way.  But if you work in the fishing industry, you have no excuse for saying, I didn't know it was going to be like this.  She said at the beginning of the interview, yeah, I knew it was going to be like this.  So she could have been honest there and said, yes, I understood.  And for me, it didn't make any difference.  But she can't sort of complain now that there is a hold up in France or there's a hold up at Portsmouth because she voted for that.  I hope that this is going to be resolved.  I would suggest that she puts pressure on Boris Johnson and his government to fix this because they are the only ones who can fix this.  They have to go to Brussels and sort something out.  I don't know what else can be done.  They can try and put pressure on the French to add more staff.  But once again, the French can reply and say, it's not our problem.  You voted to leave.  Really, I struggle to understand why Brexiteers thought it would be a good idea to give the French, for example, more power.  Because the French could say, oh, I'm sorry, this document isn't correct.  These products have to wait another few days.  As far as I know, and I don't know completely, but as far as I know, on the French side, they haven't hired more staff or they've hired very few staff.  They haven't extended the hours, the opening hours at the customs offices.  They're not doing anything to help the British side, but they're under no obligation to do that because they didn't vote to leave the European Union.  They didn't ask Britain to leave.  The European Union on numerous occasions said, you know, if you leave, you're going to suffer consequences.  The response from Brexiteers, project fear, they need us more than we need them.  And I'm still looking for reports on how businesses in the EU are suffering because of Brexit, but I can't find anything.  If people can find me examples of how businesses in the EU are suffering, I'd like to hear it.  But most businesses have just changed.  Businesses that were relying on the UK have just switched to local companies or companies within the EU.  Brexiteers lied to these people.  In some cases, the people bought the lies.  In other cases, they bought them and continued to maintain the lie.  Let me know in the comment section, guys, what you think.  As always, your comments are greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot. ",
