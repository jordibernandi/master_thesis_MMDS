Evolution by natural selection explains exactly how unconscious natural forces can and have produced exceeding complexity.  Furthermore, it perfectly explains the vile as well as the beauty, and the near-perfect as well as the catastrophic failures.  God, on the other hand, is and will always be an argument from ignorance.  We don't know, therefore God.  The trees are beautiful, therefore God.
