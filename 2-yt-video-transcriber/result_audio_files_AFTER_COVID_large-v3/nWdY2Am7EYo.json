            "text": "Donald Trump is on another Twitter tantrum right now, Saturday night.  Poor guy has nothing better to do.  He was supposed to be at a G20 virtual meeting all day today, instead went and hit the links.  And he actually tweeted about this G20 meeting and said that that's all they were talking about was COVID, but he actually went to play golf when the specific topic of COVID preparedness came up.  Donald Trump also tweeted, President Trump has done many great things, biggest tax and regulation cuts in history, Space Force, rebuilding our military, fixing the VA, the wall, but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now, exposing the massive corruption in our electoral process.  Donald Trump, Man, pretending that all of those accomplishments helped the United States of America, including the tax cuts that bankrupted our government or the wall that you built, that's just as much of a fantasy as the massive corruption in the electoral process.  Then Trump, tweeted a little later look, donald they didn't have to rush out a vaccine for the swine flu because they took it seriously from the beginning and it never got as bad as someone dying every minute.  now this one should really piss you off.  donald trump tweeted fake news always forgets to mention that far fewer people are dying when they get covid.  this is due to both our advanced therapeutics and the gained knowledge of our great doctors nurses and frontline workers.  Let's forget the fact that the guy misspelled the word do, and let's take a look at the graph for deaths in the United States.  Notice how it's going back up again.  And because Donald Trump is such a poor planner and still doesn't realize that Joe Biden is just a better person than he is all around, He tweeted, Why is Joe Biden so quickly forming a cabinet when my investigators have found hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes?  Enough to flip at least four states, which in turn is more than enough to win the election.  Hopefully the courts and or legislatures will have the courage to do what has to be done to maintain the integrity of our elections and the United States of America itself.  The world is watching.  So that's it, Donald.  That's what you want to ask.  Why is Joe Biden preparing for his presidency?  Why is he getting his team ready to clean up the mess that you've left us with?  And it goes back to your question, man.  Like, you're not prepared.  You were never prepared for this.  And look where we are today.  right now.  thanks for watching this reflect video.  my name is brendan plank.  if you liked it hit the like button and share it with your friends and subscribe.  if you're new here you can also check out our merch store if you want to help the channel grow or become a member and get some special perks.  see you guys in the next video.
