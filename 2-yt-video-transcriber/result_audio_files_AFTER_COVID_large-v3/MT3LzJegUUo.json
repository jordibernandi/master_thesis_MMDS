You're a human being.  We got a deep Jewish brother named Bernie Sanders who's bringing us together.  Everyday people of this nation, they do truly understand who is on their side.  There is real concern right now that Bernie Sanders is so far ahead in the lead.  Democrats need to sober up and figure out what the hell they're gonna do about that.  The corporate media is there to further the agenda of the establishment.  Ran by billionaires and hosted by millionaires.  Bernie Sanders makes my skin crawl.  The abuse that we have all been subjected to by Bernie bros.  You see, there's a powerful club here in this town and you're not in it.  I don't really trust any of them because what they want is ratings.  The DNC came against Bernie.  What many in the Democratic Party establishment fear is not that Bernie couldn't beat Trump.  It's that Bernie would beat Trump, transform the Democratic Party, and transform the country.  That is the establishment's nightmare.  It is hard to stand up and fight for someone you don't know.  Wall Street is mine, but Main Street is catching hell.  Hello, somebody.  People are standing up for justice.  That is what this campaign is about.  Do you want a better America? ",
