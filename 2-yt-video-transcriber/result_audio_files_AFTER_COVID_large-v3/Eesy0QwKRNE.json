Diese besagen, dass Assange w\u00e4hrend des Redigierens der Dokumente des Au\u00dfenministeriums extrem vorsichtig war und alle M\u00f6glichkeiten ausgesch\u00f6pft hat, um sicherzustellen, dass dieses Material verantwortungsvoll ver\u00f6ffentlicht wird.  During the call, Assange-Johnson warned that the file storage place for the database archive of the Foreign Ministry by the former Wikileaks employee Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which was suspended a year earlier, would be handed over to smaller media organizations.  The file storage place would allow access to the unedited encrypted depeshes.  However, you would need the decoding key to access the file.  Nun hatten einige Monate zuvor, im Februar 2011, die Guardian-Journalisten Luke Harding und David Lee diesen Dekodierschl\u00fcssel als Kapitel\u00fcberschrift in einem Buch ver\u00f6ffentlicht.  Sie hatten auch das zus\u00e4tzliche geheime Wort publiziert.  Sowohl der Speicherort der Datei als auch der Dekodierschl\u00fcssel erm\u00f6glichen es jedem, auf dieses Material zuzugreifen.  Der Guardian, der Spiegel und die New York Times arbeiteten zusammen mit Wikileaks an den Dateien des Au\u00dfenministeriums, weshalb Harding und Lee Zugang zu diesem Schl\u00fcssel hatten.  And because the file location of this former employee's file was passed on to smaller media organizations and the key was already published in the book, it was feared that it was only a matter of time before the uncensored depessions were published.  Assange and Wikileaks were not able to change the location of the file and the key, because the file from Wikileaks had been placed on BitTorrent pages in the past to protect themselves against denial-of-service attacks.  In addition, no password is used for the website, but for the decoding of the actual file.  Assange was concerned that within a few days the complete, unedited wire reports could be published.  So he contacted the Foreign Ministry to ask them to help with damage limitation measures. ",

            "text": "In the meantime, Wikileaks adopted its own security measures to delay the publication of unedited wiretaps.  24 hours before the phone call took place, Wikileaks published 100,000 edited wiretaps to stop the onslaught of other organizations and as a distraction.  Wikileaks made legal demands on German lawyers to call on the former employee to resign.  However, Wikileaks did not have legal control, as the wire reports are not owned by Wikileaks.  They belong to the US Foreign Ministry and this should introduce legal steps.  Assange also demanded that the German newspaper Freitag to hide details if they wanted to write a story about the distribution of the location of the file and the decoding key.  In addition, Assange asked the Foreign Ministry to inform those who were in contact with the embassy.  And he called on the Foreign Ministry to introduce measures again that would prevent the publication of unedited documents.  Assange suggested that an employee of the US embassy in England could meet him in Norfolk to share the location of the file and the decoding key with him, instead of telling him over the phone, as this would be too uncertain.  The State Department did absolutely nothing after it was reported by Julian Assange.  Finally, the website Cryptome published the unedited wire reports and was the first to publish this material, a fact that they admit on their website.  Then Pirate Bay and other torrent pages began to publish the documents.  Julian Assange and Wikileaks continued to work on the editing and published the documents over and over again after they were published on other pages.  Regardless of the contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the many months he spent with it to go through the correct editorial process, Julian Assange is prosecuted for publishing these wire reports.  Under the false claim that he was careless during the editorial process and put life in danger.  During the extradition hearings and the process against the whistleblower Chelsea Manning, it was confirmed that there is no evidence that someone was harmed or killed because of this publication.  The accusation is based on a lie.  The truth is, it was Julian Assange who took extensive measures to ensure that no one was harmed, and it was the US Foreign Ministry that decided not to do anything, even after it was warned.  And while the incarceration and politically motivated persecution of Julian Assange continued, there were additional appeals to President Trump to drop the charge and to pardon Assange.  UN expert Nils Meltzer wrote a letter to the president asking for a pardon.  In it, he repeated his findings that Assange is a victim of psychological torture and that his health condition is deteriorating.  In the letter, Meltzer explains, I ask you because you, Mr.  President, have sworn to fight corruption and the wrongdoing of the government, and because the continuation of the persecution of Mr.  Assange would mean that under your authority the speaking of the truth about such corruption and such wrongdoing has become a crime.  And to add to the list of the celebrities who show their support for Assange, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin even expressed herself in a YouTube video to support the Wikileaks founder.  Hey, this is Sarah Palin up in Alaska.  I am the first to admit a mistake.  I admit that I made a mistake a few years ago by not supporting Julian Assange. ",

Richard Bergen from the Labour Party sent a letter to the British Ministry of Justice demanding a video meeting with the Wikileaks founder.  Another 16 members from all sides of the political spectrum signed this letter, including Angus McNeill, Jeremy Corbyn, David Davis and Diane Abbott.  The letter follows a meeting of a group of parliamentarians with Nils Melzer, in the case of Julian Assange, and it is about Melzer's conclusion that Assange was tortured.  In the letter it says, quote, the case has important effects on the press and freedom of publication, end quote.  Assange's journalistic work on Wikileaks, the US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, is also recognized.  And in Germany, a group of members of all democratic parties, including Angela Merkel's conservative party, formed a parliamentary working group called Freedom for Julian Assange.  Mit dieser gemeinsamen Initiative soll ein klares Zeichen der Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr die freie Presse gesetzt werden, die durch eine m\u00f6gliche Auslieferung Assange's gef\u00e4hrdet ist.  Und in Assange's Heimatland Australien haben Abgeordnete und Senatoren einen offenen Brief an Pr\u00e4sident Trump verfasst, Julian Assange zu begnadigen oder die Auslieferung zu verhindern.  Der Appell an den Pr\u00e4sidenten endet damit, dass man Assange begnadigen sollte, damit er zum ersten Mal seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt in seine Heimat und zu seiner Familie zur\u00fcckkehren kann.  People in positions of power see this case as what it really is.  An unprecedented attack on the first supplementary article and a means to prevent other journalists from publishing information that is shameful for governments and institutions around the world.  Justice Vanessa Bereza will announce her decision on the delivery on January 4 in Old Bailey.  Activism Munich has access to this decision to follow.
