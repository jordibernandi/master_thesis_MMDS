But that is a social media post from the police department in Burlington, Indiana.  The public servants in that town wanted their... Citizens to know that y'all better use this time to fix your cracked windshields, plate lights, expired tags, and insurance, because when this is over, it's game on.  Police car emoji, police car emoji, police car emoji, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, police car emoji, police car emoji.  Oh my God.  But watch that video.  The link will be in the description.  It is absolutely fantastic.  To start, I'm talking on the phone, walking through the parking lot.  The officer pulls up behind an elderly woman who would be considered stopping or standing, depending on how you interpret the law, as she is in the vehicle running with her emergency lights on.  She's also in a handicapped spot on a private lot.  He tells her something, then she moves.  He then parks in a handicapped spot and walks in the store.  He comes back out of the store.  20 million people are out of work.  I say, very calm.  I know you are not bothering people for the same action you are doing.  He snapped and said, not today.  I said, what do you mean not today?  He lost it.  He yelled.  Then he got on his radio.  He was obviously calling for backup.  That's when I turned on my phone, and the video started.  This is where he was parked, in the handicapped spot. ",

Get, block all the handicapped spots, get another car parked, go in a semicircular formation, a tactical formation, and wait for me to come out the store for 15, 12 to 15 minutes, 10 to 12 minutes.  That's an ingenious plan.  Cause a bigger disturbance, which I never caused a disturbance.  You saw how calmly I was.  But my pet parrot can't stop yelling.  Shut up, my pet parrot.
