Eventually, it's going to explode, but not yet.  JP Morgan's going berserk.  This week was obviously sensational.  I've never seen anything like it, what I call the gold cartel and what JP Morgan did in silver.  Silver was at 19 on Friday when it closed.  Most traders went home after the COMEX.  They attacked it, went straight down.  Next day was quiet.  They attacked it again when nobody was around.  They attacked it again on Thursday, and of course, Wednesday and Thursday.  And then on Friday, we had an absolute tobacco in gold, which was taken off down $160 off its high.  I mean, everybody was going into gold, not getting out of it.  But the gold cartel attacked with the price of gold, what was 1640, 1680 was the high.  It was going great.  They just buried it and eventually it caused speculators to sell at the end because they were getting killed and the open interest in gold and silver is at all-time highs.  But if I might say, from my standpoint, the gold cartel has blown up.  It's over.  That doesn't mean they can't take it down.  But what I'm sure of, they've run out of enough physical gold to to keep doing what they don't they're doing suppressing the price.  That's why the gold price went up to 1680.  The gold price has changed the way it's traded since last May.  All dips are bought.  It continues that way.  They don't have the physical gold.  to carry on the way they've done.  And now they've got a situation with a physical goal on fire in the sense with interest rates going down to 0.1%, 1.03% today in the 10-year note.  The stock market's in trouble.  People are flocking into gold.  So what can be done?  The easiest way to make money in the whole world is that physical gold is way up.  The paper gold, they're trashing on the COMEX.  So you just sell the physical gold and you buy the paper gold.  And that's why a lot of these dips are being bought because the physical market is so strong.  They have just run out of enough supply to do what they've been doing.  And I've stressed it enough to my people on the Metropole Cafe and hopefully to your listeners.  I mean, it's a big, big deal.  It's historic. ",

Gold was acting as a safe haven until Thursday night.  It was fine.  All of a sudden, somebody hit it for 15 bucks, and it kept on going, and it kept on going and going.  They pressured it, and that caused a panic.  Nobody was selling physical gold.  As far as I know of, they're buying.  It was all the gold cartel in the paper market.  And the same with silver.  JP Morgan has full control of that market.  They still have it.  It's a whole different setup than gold.  The gold-silver ratio just went to an all-time high at 96.4 to 1.  What's going to happen is the gold price is going to go berserk.  And eventually, silver is so cheap, people want to buy cheap silver.  I've had friends that talk to me like that.  I've got to get silver.  Gold is too expensive.  All of a sudden, with gold soaring, there's going to be a surge in the physical gold, and the supply that's available right now will dry very quickly.  A few weeks, gone.  And the next thing you know, silver will go berserk and finally break out.  I've been talking like this for a long time.  We'll break 21 and go towards 100. ",

But the physical market is strong, and the buyers are there.  The gold open interest is still at the old all-time high levels.  Silver has now finally come down a bit.  There have been big league buyers that have challenged us, what I call the gold cartel, all year long, and the bad guys haven't been able to get them out.  That's been the story all along.

They know that this, what I call the gold cartel, has run out and the tricks they're using to suppress the price are waning.  I mean, they've done this thing, which is total mystery, called exchange for physicals, 13,000 contracts a day.  Exchange for physical, simplistically, is the easiest thing to understand in the world.  You know, you're long a futures contract, you give it up to get the physical.  But what they're doing is thousands of contracts a day and they're disappearing.  Nobody knows.  And this kind of a trick works.  Whatever it is, and even the smartest guys I know have been able to explain it to me, worked and worked for a couple of years.  Whatever they were doing, these and these other tricks, they're not working anymore.  It doesn't work because they don't have the physical goal.

And the government has been behind our market, the plunge protection team, for a while, for many, many years, creating false news.  upward prices.  A year ago, December, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin called in the plunge protection team.  I understand there's an emergency meeting tomorrow with Fed Chairman Powell.  they come in and keep lifting the market like they did today.  Last night, yesterday afternoon, right into the close, they ran it right up and it backed off again.  The next thing you know, the Dow's up 1,300.
