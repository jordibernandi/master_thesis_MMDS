            "text": "And now even his golf game is getting interrupted by aircraft towing messages and taunting him.  The banner says Trump, worst president ever.  Another banner read Trump, you pathetic loser, go back to Moscow.  The taunts are not about to end anytime soon.  In fact, there's every indication that the taunts and the ridicule are only gonna get worse.  Hello everybody, I'm David Shuster and thanks for joining us.  For the last four years, there have been flight restrictions over Palm Beach, Florida.  Whenever Donald Trump was in town, usually on weekends, aircraft were not allowed to go in the air by the beaches or anywhere near Mar-a-Lago.  Those restrictions, now that Donald Trump is no longer president, those restrictions have been lifted.  And word is getting around South Florida that it's actually not that expensive to deliver the message of your choice through one of those tow planes.  For 40 characters, it'll cost you about 1,500 to 2,000 bucks for five passes of the target of your choice, whether it's a beach or Donald Trump's golf course.  There are also reports now that one aerial towing company in Florida is quite happy to take everybody's business, Skyward's Advertising.  They lost 82% of their business over the last four years because of the flight restrictions.  It was about $250,000 in prepaid contracts that they had to give the money back.  And so they're not discriminating in terms of the kind of message that they are taking from people who want to advertise.  Bad enough for Donald Trump, of course, that he's facing impeachment over the next couple of weeks.  And Mitch McConnell's now making it clear that he may vote for impeachment, but that his larger goal is to make sure that Donald Trump is essentially eradicated from the Republican Party and can never run for president again.  When Donald Trump is not playing golf, there are reports out of Mar-a-Lago that he's spending a lot of time watching cable news interviews of Anthony Fauci, the nation's top immunologist, You recall that it was Fauci who over the last couple of weeks has been saying that it feels liberating to be working on the coronavirus task force without having to deal with the nonsense from Donald Trump.  So Donald Trump is seething, he is stewing, he is angry and he is largely alone.  And making matters worse for Donald Trump, the fight between him and his Mar-a-Lago neighbors is apparently intensifying.  Back in December, at least one of those neighbors sent a letter to the Palm Beach Commission demanding that they enforce an old contract Donald Trump signed in the 1990s when he acquired Mar-a-Lago.  It said that he would never live at Mar-a-Lago for more than 21 days a year.  Well, that was largely ignored during his presidency.  But again, the neighbors say that it appears Donald Trump is living at Mar-a-Lago and they are demanding now, again, that the old contract be enforced.  CNN is adding fuel to the fire by doing stories about all of this.  In fact, they asked some of the residents of Palm Beach on the street about all of this and their message to Donald Trump was clear. ",

According to multiple reports, the organization owes something like $400 million in loans to foreign entities and that those loans will be called over the next year.  That helps explain, for example, why Donald Trump is apparently trying to sell his hotel in Washington,  D.C.,  to try and raise some cash.  There is an old German word that may be applicable here, it's called schadenfreude.  It means the experience of pleasure, joy or self satisfaction that comes from learning or witnessing the troubles, failures or humiliation of another person.  Indeed, many Americans when told about these issues with Donald Trump are likely feeling schadenfreude, Donald Trump all alone and angry. ",
