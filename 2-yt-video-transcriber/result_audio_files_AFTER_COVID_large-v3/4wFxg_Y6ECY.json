And when I told another citizen about it, because citizens were asking me about this law, they turned around and said, that's Attorney Clyburn's information.  You can't use that.  You're going to get a 312 on you.  That's why I don't come and talk to the staff.  Because every little thing that I do, that's why I have to have an audit camera with me.  Citizens are wearing body cameras because they're afraid of this city manager and her police chief and her cronies out here that are terrorizing our citizens by trying to get to the truth.  And they're trying to shut down, just like we took out, oh look, citizens be heard, just disappeared.  They're trying to stop openness.  That's why I started out with transparency in government. ",

            "text": "I've been living in Leon Valley for three years.  I watch this constantly when you have them most of the time.  I see nothing but infighting.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.  You've got a doctor over here that acts like a juvenile delinquent.  Mr.  Bradshaw, my home, and to speak about crime, my home was graffitied.  My Trump sign was graffitied.  I wouldn't go to your house and do that.  Mr.  Bradshaw brought an entire team to my home.  to get Nazi off of my Tahoe and Nazi off of my house.  He's the only city council member that even reached out, besides Mr.  Martinez, who's not a city council member anymore.  But I take offense of what this gentleman says about people in this room.  We are taxpayers.  He may not live here, but he certainly has the right to speak.  And how dare you to think that you can monitor him?  You are nobody, sir.  And I talked about this earlier.  You know, I mentioned it the last city council meeting when I spoke and, you know, I think that there's a, there's a collective effort here, you know, and it's not really what we hired or, excuse me, elected officials to do.  It's not attack one another and elective officials and things like that.  You know, I had mentioned that, You know, I was hoping, and I asked that we would please rise above this and start kind of being a little bit more professional and stop this convictment.  Because it really does look bad for the city.  You know, we continuously seem to be making the news for all the wrong reasons.  What are we doing for our citizens?  That should be what we're doing.  It's not things about attacking one another and it looking suspicious.  And so I'm just, I realize that you can't talk to the council because you don't really get listened to anyways.  So I'm going to talk to the citizens real quickly.  And I'm just going to say that if you're tired of this crap, and if you're tired of elected leaders undoing your vote, make sure you go vote in November.  We're a court of order.  This is off topic.  Mr.,  was that the attorney that... So make sure you go vote for somebody that promises to you- Fair point of order, this has nothing to do with the attorney.  Yes, it actually does.  So as... Mr.  Stevenson, make sure it ties back to the attorney.  Can you let me... Can I get out a couple of words so I can actually say my point?  I understand you're very defensive right now.  Okay, wait a minute.  Let's not go back and forth because we do have a citizen speaker.  hopefully at the end of the hour if you want to... Can I reclaim my time?  I'll give you about 30 seconds more.  Okay, thank you.  Since we've been interrupted.  So make sure... that you vote for somebody who you aren't going to have to hire an attorney with for a 312.  It's as simple as that.  And come November, make sure that your elected leaders are unwilling to cancel your votes for dumb reasons.  And then you won't have to ever hire an attorney for a 312 hearing.  Let the real courts decide that, where there's a real impartial jury of 12 people.  That's the way the United States is.  It's not sham political hearings.  That shouldn't be the thing.  So everybody, I hope you go vote in November.  I won't.  Thank you.  You won't have to go through this if you vote for me.  But like the gentleman said, four against one.  I didn't see Hody.  I didn't see Rodriguez.  Even ever second of motion, anything Will ever did.  Will has worked real hard for the citizens.  of Leon Valley.  And then we have someone that sits there with her mouth closed most of the time.  And then we have one that says, I second the motion.  that's somewhere in this cloud here.  And Hody, I wish just one time you would stand up and say, I second the motion.  You let two people rule Leon Valley.  And I don't think most of the citizens in Leon Valley realized what Olin Yarnell was arrested for.  And I think y'all know.  Does Officer want to say anything now?  Excuse me.  We need to just keep it.  on the subject of mediation.  Well, mediation.  But I don't think Will will get it.  And I don't want to spend the money on 312.  I don't think any of the citizens do.  And they need to get out the cell because Arnelle only touched her arm.  Okay.  I hope she goes to jail.  So I actually wanted to address something from earlier in the council meeting that I was not allowed to respond to and that was to Chief Salvaggio when he came up for the first agenda item and put on a performance in which he lied about at least myself.  I don't know probably others too but he said that we had reached out to the district attorney's office the Texas AG, the Texas Rangers, all to investigate the first agenda item related to abuse of power, official oppression, and financial crimes.  And that's not true at all.  If you'd like me to, I definitely will take the time to do that, but I haven't.  So if they've been investigating you already, that's not something I spurred.  That's something they probably figured out on their own.  So, but it goes into a trend, and it's a trend of mine.  And so last council meeting towards the end, Mr.  Bradshaw brought up the fact that we not too long ago hired a Leon Valley police officer that stood on somebody's neck.  So anybody from home can go to changelionvalley.com slash fired from SAPD and you'll see all of the suspension documents from the officers that were terminated from San Antonio Police Department that Leon Valley later or recently hired really.  And so I'm going to read a little part from the suspension paperwork.  Officer Elizabeth J. Montoya kicked Mr.  Flores in the stomach area while he was still handcuffed and lying on the ground.  Shortly afterward, Officer Montoya is observed putting her right foot onto Mr.  Flores' neck area.  Officer Montoya's actions brought reproach and discredit to both the department and herself.  And then if you're looking at the document at home, you'll see her signature is actually about two and a half inches below that where she signed her indefinite suspension paperwork.  Well, shortly after, Leon Valley City hired this officer.  But I wanted to focus on the behavior of two elected officials approximately 25 minutes ago in trying to shut down a fellow elected official from bringing up an agenda item.  We've seen this time and time again.  They've done it to citizens.  They've abused their power.  at council meetings to shut down citizens and have them removed.  I've been the subject of that on multiple occasions.  Straight up lies.  So the idea that they sit there and try to interrupt the proceedings here today to really try to put a cloak over what Mr.  Bradshaw, and I think many citizens see, which is corruption, abuse of power, I think Mr.  Brashaw read a letter where it indicated your insipid behavior is going to get out of control, and it has.  I want to thank Alex, right?  Yes, sir.  I want to thank you for your comments, and what it tells me is that all the people in Leon Valley are watching you, all of you.  The comments made by Councilman Brashaw are very serious.  Misappropriation of funds and put you in jail.  And that's where we're at today.  If you don't have anything to hide, give him the information that he needs to make a determination whether we should go forward or not.  I don't see you pretty soon.  There may be a 312 on Council of Bradshaw.  That's another $600,000 that we're going to be wasting of government money that the citizens of Leon Valley has put in here.  That's a lot of money.  What could we have done with $600,000 that we wasted this past year?  You know, our infrastructure, our parks, our citizens.  I'm asking you guys to work together.  Give the information that, if you're not hiring anything, give the information to Councilor Brashoff.  And let's go on with this and let's start making Leon Valley a better place to live at.  And I don't want any 312 hearings going on.  I don't want anyone to vote somebody else out, Will out or whoever, until this mess is cleaned up.  We have two city council members that cause problems that don't show up.  They're up there somewhere in the cloud, but we want it to stop.  And we've asked Kelly to resign, to fall back.  She hasn't resigned yet.  Two councilmen tried to cut everything down.  We don't want that.  I don't want that.  You as a body are in control of our money, what we want to do, not what you want to do.  So stop acting like children and do the right thing for the citizens.  If they have nothing to hide, then put it out there.  Don't discourage people.  I support Will.  I do.  I think he's done a good job.  He's just playing along.  I work at the university, and my colleagues are saying, what the heck is going on?  And I'm saying, I don't know.  It's embarrassing.  It really is.  I didn't really pay much attention.  And then, like I said, I came that early June and I witnessed just the dysfunction and the animosity.  And so then I started paying attention and started asking some questions and doing those things.  And then all of a sudden, it's like the more questions I ask, the deeper this rabbit hole goes.  There's something wrong here.  And it's discouraging when I hear letters from citizens that are scared to come and voice their opinion at a city council.  What are we doing here?  You know, to me, that's the definition of tyranny.  I mean, honestly, when you're, you know, squashing the voices of your people and you're not listening.  You know, there is a city council that is deaf to the people that they're representing.  You know, a lot of the things that I was going to say, unfortunately, tie exactly into what, you know, the councilman Bradshaw was saying, you know, but I don't want to talk about it because I can't, right?  Because Al Pacero or who did Charles are going to censor me or whatever.  And I think that that's just wrong, just fundamentally.  And I just hope Al Pacero and Charles do some soul searching.  Seriously, go home.  I mean, do you sleep well at night?  Do you really think that what you're doing is the best thing for the citizens of your city?  Because I don't feel that way, and I'm a citizen.  This shows that I think that we're moving in the right direction, and I think as a city, hopefully, we can come together and start healing and being the community that I think everybody really wants us to be.  I know that's what I want.  I apologize.  I guess I got confused earlier on.  I thought this was more than mediation.  And now all of a sudden we're talking about hiring an intern.  So I'm confused.  I really thought that we had grown.  I mean, this is a good word for it.  You know, I think it's a mistake to hire an intern.  I mean, honestly.  You got a guy who is asking all the questions, which I think that the whole city council should be doing.  Honestly, you know, a city manager that has a substantial amount of authority.  And so the only people that can hold them in check is the city council.  So when you have a city council member that's actually asking questions and maybe in an aggressive manner, I don't think that that's the reason for removal.  And I don't think that that's the direction the city should be going in. ",
