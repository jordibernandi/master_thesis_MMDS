Silver!  surprised us again crazy week for silver and it's only tuesday as we all know what happened yesterday?  for the first time in quite some time silver was able to crack the 20 mark 20 an ounce silver.  it had a hard time keeping its head above that 20 mark because it kept dropping down to 1995 then back up to 2004 and then back down to 96 and then up to 03 and it was having a hard time staying above the water if you know what I mean and I had a strong feeling that it was going to drop back down.  sure enough today.  check the spot price.  silver not only was able to keep its head above the $20 mark It made its way all the way up to and above the $21 mark.  It's about 21 and a quarter as I am recording this video.  Who knows what it's going to be by the time I finish editing and by the time I post the video.  Silver could very well be on the move right now.  It's actually a pretty exciting time for silver and really anybody who's been involved.  However, I fear as though the wrong people are going to get wind of this, the wrong people are going to find out about it now that silver has officially surpassed the $20 mark.  I'll get into that later in the video, but I wanted to talk about the spot price a little bit more because I truly did not believe we were going to see this happen just yet.  I truly, genuinely, wholeheartedly did not expect this to happen and a lot of people have been commenting on my videos because I've been saying it for the last couple of months.  I've been saying I'm kind of taking a step back away from silver just temporarily not waiting for the price to drop although that would be nice but more so just because at first starting in about march during the whole initial crash of planet earth we'll call it i said it may or may not be a smarter idea for me to hold on to my cash just because i have no idea how long this is going to last.  for i don't want to get ahead of myself.  so i'm gonna stick to stacking cash for the time being and i did that for about three months and then starting the very end of June, the beginning of July, I started stacking again.  Quite a bit of silver.  I got some silver that I've showed off in recent videos.  I've gotten some silver that I just placed the order yesterday and the night before.  So that hasn't even arrived yet.  I got some new coins coming.  I got a 10 ounce bar coming.  I got some really interesting pieces of silver on the way to my house.  And as soon as they arrive, I'll do an unboxing.  However, I received a comment from a lot of people saying if you do not hoard as much silver as you possibly can, this was during the three months that I was taking a step back away from silver, they said that I was going to regret it if silver pops off.  If silver goes up, I'm going to regret it.  And here's the truth.  I would absolutely not regret it.  I went about three months not stacking silver.  I let about 90 days or so go by where I could have been getting a decent amount of silver when spot was, you know, 15, 16, 17, 18 bucks.  Now it's over 21 bucks.  Might be going higher.  Do I regret it?  Absolutely not.  As I always say, I would rather miss out on an opportunity than be controlled by the fear of missing out.  Doesn't matter to me in the slightest bit.  I got more going on in my life than just silver coins.  However, when it comes to the silver coins, I'm obviously involved, I'm obviously enthusiastic about the silver, but I'm not a big believer in tunnel vision.  I think that everybody should be diversifying.  I don't think that everyone who's stacking silver should be solely exclusively stacking silver.  I think they should be stacking a little bit of gold as well.  At least that's just what makes the most sense for me.  I'm not a big believer in putting all your eggs in one basket, so I do save a little bit of my currency.  I do convert a little bit of my currency into money, aka silver and gold.  I also invest a little bit of my money as well, or my currency rather.  I like to say that I save a third, convert a third, and invest a third.  That's the way that I do things.  And another thing that I wanted to point out before I get into talking about why I believe that the wrong people are going to be finding out about silver right now, or whatever the case may be.  Before I get into that, I just wanted to say that all of the markets out there, all of the different realms that there are, I know a lot of people, they exclusively stack silver, they prefer the hard assets only, they don't like to get into the paper, they don't like to get into real estate, they don't like to get into this, they don't like to get into that.  I could understand that, and there's a couple different realms that I personally, I don't wanna say that I am against, but I would not get involved.  I'm a big believer in studying those markets anyway.  You don't have to put your currency into those markets.  You don't have to buy in.  You don't have to invest.  You don't have to put your currency over there.  But I believe that everyone should pay attention to the different markets.  Even if you're not a big fan of the stock market, I think you should still be paying attention to it.  If you do not have the currency to get into real estate, I think you should still be paying attention to the real estate market.  So on and so forth.  That's what I wanted to say about that.  However, now I wanted to talk about the wrong people getting wind that silver's on the rise.  The opportunists, the people that... lunge out of emotion.  The people who have not a clue in the world about silver, they haven't heard a single thing about silver in a couple years, I've been thinking about this for a while now.  I said that if silver surpasses the $20 mark, I think that's probably or may or may not make headlines.  I think that's going to be newsworthy.  I mean, if silver goes from $15 to $19, no one really bats an eye.  But for some reason, the $20 mark is a little bit of a milestone.  And I think that might be a little bit of a wake-up call to a lot of people right now.  And these are the same people who are going to be happily, enthusiastically paying a ridiculously high premium.  When it comes to the silver, the rounds, the bars, the coins, the three nines fine, four nines fine, the 90%, the 40%, whatever it is that they're going to be getting their hands on, these people are likely to be paying a relatively high premium.  And all for... the idea that they might be able to profit from all of this.  Oh, $20 silver?  I'm gonna get a whole bunch of silver right now and then when it goes to a million dollars an ounce, I'm gonna be rich.  It's a get rich quick scheme.  That's what silver is.  I'm gonna hop on this opportunity and I'm gonna get rich.  Those are the people I'm referring to.  What is that going to do?  Why did I say that those are the wrong type of people to be getting wind of what's going on with silver right now?  It's because all of them are going to be happily enthusiastically paying that high premium and it's just gonna be another supply and demand situation where the premiums are gonna stay high or the premiums might even go higher.  That's my honest expectation.  I think that $20 milestone somewhat newsworthy.  i think a lot of people are going to be talking about silver who have no involvement in silver.  a lot of people are going to be diving in expecting for silver to be in the beginning stages of the quote-unquote skyrocketing process and these people are probably going to be paying ridiculously high premiums which are going to crank up the premiums for everyone, because once again, supply and demand, if people are happily paying, you can charge whatever dollar amount that is.  That goes for anything.  No, it's not price gouging.  Silver is not something that we need to survive.  Silver is just something that we want to have.  And that's how supply and demand works.  If people want it, if there's demand, you can crank up the prices and from a business perspective I think it makes perfect sense and even though it's unfortunate for those of us who want to be involved in silver for the long run and those of us who understand that silver isn't something that should be used as a tool to make money because it is money.  you can't make money on something that's money.  this is for saving money.  we're converting our dollars into silver to save it for the long run.  sure it would be nice it were to increase in value over time but i think the overwhelming majority of us are just using it as a physical savings account if that makes sense.  i don't think the overwhelming majority of us are sitting here desperately waiting for silver to explode.  i don't think many of us require for silver to do that.  sure it'd be nice.  everyone would love for that to happen eventually.  But I think the overwhelming majority of people are just trying to save money.  Save it for the long term, preserve their wealth, act as a hedge against inflation.  And that's the primary objective.  That's the requirement.  In my opinion at least.  I also said something the other day in a video that I posted a few days ago talking about when silver was almost at $20 an ounce.  I posted a video, I think it was just two days ago, talking about how silver might be on the way to $20.  And if you ask me, if we see $20 silver, I don't think we're gonna be having that easy of a time getting ourselves some silver eagles for under 30 bucks.  The reason I said this is also because of the supply and demand aspect.  With the spot price of silver for the last couple of weeks being in the $19 range, we've been able to get generic silver for 21, 22, $23 an ounce.  But silver regals for some strange reason, 25, 26, 27, $28 an ounce.  And I said it the other day, if silver goes up or above $20 an ounce, I don't think we're going to see silver eagles under 30 bucks.  So out of curiosity, I went online, I searched up some silver eagles.  Here's what I found.  When you're smiling, when you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.  That's right.  $30 and up Silver Eagles.  That was my expectation.  I don't want to sit here and say that that was my psychic prediction because I ain't no fortune teller.  None of us are.  None of us know for sure what Silver is going to do.  But from a business perspective, it would make sense because guess what?  Customers are paying.  If customers are able to pay or willing to pay, they don't care about the people who... can't afford it or are unwilling to pay, we are replaceable.  Hard pill to swallow, I know, but we are replaceable.  If we take our money away from someone, someone else will give them the money.  If we take our $20, $30, $100 away, someone over there will pay their $20, $30, $100.  That's just the way it works.  And that's why I said I have a feeling that the wrong people are gonna be getting involved right now because the wrong people are going to be desperately stockpiling silver trying to make a quick buck and with supply and demand, the premiums are gonna stay high.  That's just my assumption.  I don't know for sure.  I'm just speculating over here.  I'm not a financial advisor.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice, but that's what I honestly believe might happen.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice.  It's all for entertainment purposes, but it's also to initiate a conversation as well.  So number one, I'm curious, what are your thoughts?  And secondly, I want to move into another point.  The future of silver.  Like I said, I'm not a fortune teller, so I couldn't tell you for sure, but this is a very interesting time for silver.  A very exciting time for silver.  Silver has had an incredibly busy week so far, and like I said, it's only Tuesday.  What in the world is going to happen on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday?  I think if there's anything silver has taught us, especially over these last four or five months, it's that anything is possible.  Silver, in my opinion, seems to be in complete and total control.  I feel like the ball is in silver's court.  Silver's going to do what silver wants to do.  Will it go up?  It's 21 and a quarter right now.  Will it go up to 22, 23, 24, 25, $26 an ounce?  God, I would hate to see the premiums on that.  Will it stay right around where it's at?  Will the 19, 20, $21 become the, as much as I hate to say this, the new normal, where it kind of sits tight for a little while?  Will it drop back down into the 19, 18, 17, $16 range?  There's really no way of knowing.  Now, as I've been saying over the last couple of months, of course, I didn't think it would happen this quick, but it could drop back down.  I believed that because of all the printing that's going on right now, I kind of expected silver to be on the rise a little bit quicker than it's been over the years.  But I didn't think it would happen just yet.  So this could very well be the beginning stages of silver officially starting to climb back up.  We might get to the point where we see silver in the 25, maybe $30 range.  Maybe 35, 40 bucks.  Who knows, maybe even 45, 50 bucks again.  Silver has already proven itself capable of reaching that $50 range.  Mark, it's already happened.  And right now with silver being in the $21 range, it's about a six year high.  I think the last time silver was in the $21 range, according to the chart I was looking at, I believe it was right around this time of 2014.  So almost exactly six years later, silver's at about a six year high.  And if silver were to climb back up into the 40, $50 range, That would be a nine-year high.  And if silver were to somehow manage to climb its way up above 50 bucks, 55, 60, 65, 70 bucks, we'd be looking at an all-time high for silver.  Or one could argue an all-time low for the dollar.  Yes, it's an exciting time for silver right now, but don't take your eyes off of what's actually going on.  Don't let silver and the spot price distract you.  The dollar bill we all know is old and sickly, seems to be kind of fragile, seems to be standing on its last leg.  As I've been saying for a while now, according to history, historically speaking, when currency takes some punishment, when currency becomes weaker, real, true, honest, genuine money becomes stronger.  real true honest money, referring to silver and gold.  But the dollar bill on the other hand, it's not looking too good for the dollar bill.  So who knows what's going to happen next?  I have no idea.  Like I said, this is all speculation.

You can find some other ones for $33.  But I believe that Silver Eagles are going to soon all be above $30 apiece.  Let me know your thoughts in the comment section down below.
