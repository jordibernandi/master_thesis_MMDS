            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents listener Q&A July 2020.  Hey everybody, I hope you're doing well and if you're watching this in the far future, I hope we've all survived this terrible world that we find ourselves in here in July of 2020.  I received an email to the tvatheist-community.org email list and And there are several that I'm going to try to address, but some of them have multiple points.  I have no idea how many I'm going to get to, but some of these I felt were worth addressing.  This one in particular that I'm going to start with, which may be the only one we get to, is from someone who identifies as a realist, and they keep putting a capital R on there, and yet what they're talking about doesn't match with philosophical notions of realism that I'm familiar with.  I don't care what you call yourself, so we're not going to dig on the label.  But he seems very concerned about identifying as a realist and wants to know how much of a realist we are, essentially.  And he begins by saying, as a realist, I have several axioms.  Cool.  Let's take a look at what those axioms are.  because I find many of the things this individual says are representative of the conclusions many atheists reach.  And I don't feel that they're all justified, and in some cases they are the very conclusions that we are accused of making when those of us who are skeptics don't begin with these axioms.  So let's take a quick look at these axioms and talk about what's wrong with them.  Well, I have a problem with virtually every aspect of that axiom.  First of all, if you're going to have an axiom, it should be something that seems like essential.  Like not something that could be demonstrated by evidence, but instead is your default assumption that may not be able to be demonstrated, but seems reasonable and upon which other conclusions are based.  So it starts off with all religions.  I'm not aware of anything other than the label religion, which could truly apply to all religions.  That just seems overly broad to start by saying all religions as if they're all the same and they were all created the same way for the same purpose.  It's just bizarre.  But he says all religions were devised and revised, there's problems with that, both in the sense that he seems to be thinking that somebody invented the entirety of a religion out of whole cloth.  And that's just generally not how religions form.  These things are generally, they form over time with more and more stories and more and more events and more and more bits of wisdom or knowledge being passed around and spoken to different people.  Maybe that is the revision that is going on.  But devious minds suggest either a nefarious notion, which isn't, I wouldn't say is always the case, or a knowing, like they're engaged in a knowing deception.  And that rules out the notion that some of these religions were just people honestly telling the stories that they found convincing or that were told to them.  And it's the fact that they persisted.  It's not like... the bulk of religious believers are cognitively inferior or seeking or are weak minds.  So you've got to figure if it's devious minds controlling weak minds, then how does anybody become a pastor?  It's like you were taught this growing up, and then you go to become a pastor, and now you've graduated from weak mind to devious mind because now the pastor is the one that's informing the congregation when just a few years before, the pastor was part of a congregation.  So to suggest that religions are invented fictions, all of them, Merely to control the masses is certainly an idea that's been popular.  It's certainly an idea that's been tossed around in a sort of cynical sense.  But it's not something that one should take as an axiom.  That is a sort of claim that would need to be demonstrated.  And it's also overly broad.  So as a realist, this person has axiom number one, which they have labeled axiom number one.  is basically saying all religions are intentionally created to control weak people.  Now, if I were going to talk to someone about being a realist, religion isn't even the first thing that would come up.  Not religion, not gods, but things surrounding epistemology.  How do we know what we know?  Because those are the true foundations.  Things surrounding logic.  If you want to axiomatically accept identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle, fine.  Now you're talking about the foundation of some model of thought.  But when someone emails to tell me they're a realist and their first axiom is that religions are all just invented fictions to control the weak, I know that they're not so much a realist as an anti-religionist and that they're now constructing something in a way where they may, they want to call it an axiom so they don't have to defend it, perhaps.  And that what they're really talking about isn't their strong ties to reality and reason.  but their strong opposition to what they view as destructive fairy tales labeled religions.  Now this individual has a second axiom, and that is axiom number two, all gods exist, but only as software in brains.  And when I saw this, I realized that somebody's playing fast and loose with the meaning of exist.  And I don't mean that they're wrong.  Certainly you could say a unicorn exists as a software in brain.  The Loch Ness Monster exists as software in a brain.  But all you're doing in that sense is you're saying we can conceive of X and therefore X exists as a conception.  To say that X only exists as a conception is something that you can't demonstrate.  For example, I have a concept of a dog in my head.  It might also be the case that concept of a dog ties to an actual extant dog in the real world.  And so, as long as that's a possibility, you would need to demonstrate that my concept of a dog is just a fiction, that it does not tie to anything real.  And that's essentially what he's doing with Axiom 2.  He's just saying... God's existence concepts, they just don't tie to anything real.  And neither, I mean, I don't know how he, well, he does make an attempt to justify that, which is why he's using it as an axiom.  And so both of this person's axioms are being used to make assertions and avoid having to defend them.  And I don't find that to be consistent with realism or any sound notion of epistemology.  at all.  this particular individual gets hung up a little bit on.  there's no such thing as the bible because there are multiple versions of the bible and so he wants to call them the bibles and this person's being a little verbose and pedantic and they've got some ideas that they're desperately clinging to.  but i also they objected to something that i said the other day on the atheist experience, where I talked about people using Karen and Chad and other people's names as pejoratives, that essentially we're creating new stereotypes, but we're not giving them new labels.  We're just labeling with the names of people.  And so he took exception to the fact that I didn't also call out people for using dick as a pejorative when it's somebody's name.  And that's because, at least my understanding of the etymology of the word, is that using Dick to describe part of anatomy or as a person is something that predates the use of Dick as a short version of Richard, etc.  But we get lots of email from people and some of them have really good ideas that they just can't quite put into words right.  And some of them have really bad ideas and they're convinced that they've got the best words for them.  Let's take a look at another one.  So another email came in and I'm not saying this at all to embarrass this person.  I'm not going to give you their name.  I had a back and forth with them and explained to some extent what was wrong with the argument that they presented.  But the email begins, it may be the reason the world is constantly being turned on its head by crazed evangelicals and others is because their faith is toxic, logically toxic.  And then what follows there is what appears to be an argument.  Premise one, premise two, conclusion one, conclusion two, bonus, premise three, conclusion three, conclusion four.  Here's their argument.  Premise one, faith is the acceptance as true of what cannot be known to be true.  One more time, faith is the acceptance as true of what cannot be known to be true.  Now, they're onto something there.  What they're talking about, I've said before, faith is the excuse people give for believing something when they don't have a good reason, because if you have a good reason, you give the reason.  When you say faith is the acceptance of true, of what cannot be known to be true, you're now asserting that what they believe cannot be known.  And I don't know how you make that demonstration.  Maybe if you inserted the word currently, so that faith is the acceptance as true of what cannot currently be known to be true, or faith is the acceptance of true of that which has not yet been demonstrated to be true.  If you put something like that in there, now all of a sudden this premise makes more sense.  But what we're doing in premise one, the way it's written, is essentially doing the same thing the other person did, which is, ah, faith is, well, it's Mark Twain, so he's in good company.  Faith is believing what you know ain't so.  That's a humorous take on faith that's attributed to Mark Twain.  And it does tie to our experience of people claiming this.  And I understand atheists frustrated.  You know, I understand atheists saying there are no gods.  That's all fairy tales.  That's a load of crap.  I get why you would say that.  I just don't get why you would say that and try and put it into an argument structure when you're having a conversation with someone.  Because all it does is it means that they now come to me and say, please prove there is no God.  And I say, that's not my position.  Well, it's some other atheist position.  And I say, hey, go talk to that other atheist.  Because depending on how we're going to define belief, knowledge, and what our standards of evidence are, my view about whether or not there is a God or whether or not we can say anything about a God is going to vary.  But that was premise one.  Premise two says, without knowledge, faith is a declaration of truth.  Based on premise one, you've got faith is a declaration of truth with or without knowledge.  I think what they mean is that faith is a declaration of truth without knowledge.  So it's like a restatement of the first one.  But from those two premises, they draw a conclusion.  Conclusion one, faith is dishonest.  Okay, if you're gonna construct a syllogism, you're gonna go to the trouble to list premises.  conclusions you should try to make sure that you have a major and minor premises and the connecting terms.  there are major minor terms in your premise premises and the connecting terms so that you have a proper syllogism.  because what happens right now is we have premise one faith is the acceptance of true that which cannot be known to be true.  premise two without knowledge faith is a declaration of truth.  conclusion one faith is dishonest.  conclusion to faith is sin.  I don't know where the hell that came from because from a secular perspective, I don't have any notion of sin.  I reject the very concept of sin.  Then they go to premise three, faith is easy and requires no effort.  Not only do I not know why that's relevant, but I don't think it's true.  And then their conclusion three, faith is lawful.  And conclusion four, faith is a sin twice over.  So conclusion four is the same as conclusion two.  Right now, because I haven't typed any of this on the screen, There are people out there saying, Matt, why are you even addressing this?  Here's someone who doesn't understand logic, who's presented what is one of the worst arguments I've ever seen.  And I told him that because I'm nothing if not honest.  And what I replied with is, I think that may be one of the worst arguments I've ever seen, despite the fact that you're a little bit right somewhere.  Every premise is either false or... or is not true or not accepted, and none of the conclusions follow from their premise, no one who can get so much wrong so quickly should be lecturing anyone about logic.  And that's essentially what they were doing, is saying that crazed evangelicals have a toxic faith.  that is logically toxic.  Here's the reason I wanna mention it.  I've talked before about charitable listing.  I'm clearly talking to someone who hasn't bothered to study logic in any formal sense at all.  And yet they're putting like P1, P2, C1, C2.  They're putting these labels on there.  So that means they've started to try to understand the value of syllogisms.  And yet they've managed to get it massively wrong.  There are a number of books that I've recommended, including Hurley's Concise Introduction to Logic and Walton's Informal Logic.  There are a number of books like that that I've recommended, but you don't have to do that.  You can go out and take a look at syllogisms, validity, soundness, structure, all of those things.  Even Wikipedia is a good start for it.  But if you don't have any expertise in the area, First of all, don't run out and start lecturing on it.  Don't think that you've come up with the end-all, be-all argument to show how religion is just stupid, because that seems to be a lot of people's goal.  But don't give up.  If you want to know and understand logic, you can.  It's not magic.  It's not even complicated as calculus.  It's simple, straightforward, and it takes a little bit of work.  And so this individual, to their credit, continued to back and force, even after my first, literally the first thing I said is, I think that may be one of the worst arguments I've ever seen, despite the fact that you're a little bit right somewhere.  And that can be viewed as harsh.  But I get, I have 16,000 unread emails, and it's like, oh, I picked this one to read.  And when I looked at it, I was like, wow, that's really bad.  But And I replied with something that was intended to only keep the type of person who's serious around.  It's a risk.  But that person kept coming back.  They wanted to make a secondary argument about whether or not Mormons should count as Christians and wanted to talk about their motives.  And I'm at least interested in continuing a discussion with them because I'm cautiously optimistic that this is a person who wants to learn and wants to get better.  And so don't overreach, don't go out and try to prove that something is bad or that it's not true when the opposition hasn't made their case that it is true or that it is good yet.  But if you're going to put things, if you don't understand the basics of logic, don't put a P1, P2 conclusion.  Instead say, what do you think of this idea?  What about the notion?  that religions exist to control the masses?  What about the notion that faith is lazy?  What about the notion that faith is potentially sinful?  I mean, that could be a great discussion.  It could be a good video.  Is faith sinful?  Even for someone like me who doesn't accept the concept of sin at all.  So those are a couple of emails that came in this week that I kind of wanted to address that hopefully you guys got something out of one or both of them.  I know I did.  And that's the whole point of this is to share some of the things that we all can learn from.  And by the way, don't worry that you're going to get it wrong.  Everybody gets it.  I've got stuff wrong probably in this video and in the one before it and the one before that, the one before that, the one before that.  Just be willing to correct and change based on the new information.  But also, just because somebody comes up and says, oh, you're wrong and here's new information, don't get in a panic that you might have completely screwed up.  Evaluate it honestly every time.  I'll see you next time.  Bye-bye.  This video is made possible by supporters of the Atheist Debates Patreon project.
