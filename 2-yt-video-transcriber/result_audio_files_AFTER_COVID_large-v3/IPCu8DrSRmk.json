            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  In the prophet Amos chapter 3, the prophet says, Indeed, the Lord God does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets.  I'm just pathetic.  I tend to agree with the second group a little more but for some time the Lord has been urging me to encourage my viewers to stockpile food just in case there's a second wave of government restrictions and lockdowns and it's complicated to go to the store and buy things.  now Almost every government has a disaster preparedness agency and these agencies instruct us to have a stockpile of food.  So I'm not asking you to do something that the government itself isn't already asking you to do.  Some of these agencies recommend at least a three-day supply of food and other things.  During the first wave of lockdowns from COVID-19, governments were saying you should have a 14-day supply.  And so I leave it up to you to decide how much you need.  The two things I'm insisting on though is number one, don't break the bank.  Don't go spending a ton of money on things you don't need.  I think when I did shopping for the first wave of lockdowns, which I don't want to say I predicted, but I got on YouTube when the stores were still calm, when the shelves were still full, and I did a little video of me buying cans of tuna fish and some other items saying, hey folks, I think now's the time to do a bit of stockpiling.  And many people followed my instructions and they're very grateful they did.  So again, once again, I'm inviting people.  I think during these summer months, these next couple of weeks, we'll have lots of time.  Get your stockpile of food.  So anyways, number one, don't break the bank.  And number two, just buy things that you actually already use.  I shared, I like tuna fish sandwiches.  If we are under another lockdown, I'm okay eating tuna fish sandwiches every day for a couple weeks.  That's how much I like tuna fish sandwiches.  I give this as an amusing example, but don't go buying silly things you're not going to use.  Now, in the last wave of lockdown, One of the things I didn't buy was toiletries.  And I think I ran out of like, I don't know, toothpaste or shampoo or something.  And it was a pain to have to go to a drugstore during the lockdown because it was complicated.  I had to wait in a long line outside in the cold rain one day just to get into the store to buy fresh produce.  So again, this is serious.  And one of the things too is people might be accusing me, oh, you're taking exaggerated precautions.  Maybe I am, but if you want an example of exaggerated precautions, and I don't share this critically, this is just a matter of fact, the wonderful province of Nova Scotia, shout out to my Nova Scotia friends, since July 31st, People have been required to wear masks indoors in most public places.  And so everyone in the province of Nova Scotia wearing a mask when they're indoors.  Now, this is updated yesterday and it's been like this for some time.  In Nova Scotia, how many new confirmed cases of COVID-19?  Zero.  How many people are in the ICU units in Nova Scotia because of COVID-19?  Nobody.  Zero.  How many patients are in the hospital with COVID-19 in all of Nova Scotia?  Zero.  Nobody.  How many active cases of COVID-19 in all of Nova Scotia?  Zero.  None.  And yet the government is requiring people to wear masks in most indoor public places.  Again, I'm not saying this critically.  Health officials are trying to keep people safe.  That's fine.  But if we don't get ready ourselves based on What maybe some people are sensing might be coming.  I've been open that I believe things could get worse before they get better.  And I'm not talking about the pandemic because there's also maybe a worse fear-demic going on.  What I'm talking about is the times we are living in.  Like those who have eyes to see.  These are strange times.  The Lord is trying to get our attention.  And we need to get ready.  Spiritually is more important, but also practically.  And so you get out there, get your supplies, and I'll be doing videos on how to prepare also spiritually.  Viva Cristo! ",
