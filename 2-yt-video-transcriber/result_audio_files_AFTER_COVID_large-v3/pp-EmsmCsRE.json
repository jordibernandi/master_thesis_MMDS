            "text": "The United States first noticed that Guillermo del Toro might be more than just an interesting B-movie stylist, with the stateside release of Pan's Labyrinth in 2000s\u2014 technically 2006\u2014 we're gonna say 2007.  That was a great year for Hispanic filmmakers, by the way.  Pan's Labyrinth was in theaters the same month as Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Children of Men and Pedro Almod\u00f3var's Volver.  But, see, I used to work in a video store.  And on the recommendation of a co-worker, I had already seen del Toro's earlier work, The Devil's Backbone.  And what was interesting to me about Pan's Labyrinth, aside from just being a brilliant movie, is that it was kind of a soft remake.  They're both stories about kids living through the tail end of the Civil War, which draw explicit parallels between politics and dark fantasy.  The big act of translation is, where The Devil's Backbone is a ghost story, Pan's Labyrinth is a Grimm's fairy tale.  And then nine years later, del Toro made Crimson Peak, which is basically the same story but as a gothic horror.  And two years after that, he made The Shape of Water, which is the same story but as a 1950s monster movie.  Now, del Toro is one of those people who implies that all his movies are kind of the same movie, and there are certainly commonalities between these four and everything else he's done, but these four have way more in common with each other than they have with the rest of his oeuvre.  And, lucky for GDT, I really, really like this one movie he keeps making.  Another interesting thing about Guillermo del Toro is he and Benicio del Toro are actually different people.  Ida.  The core component to all these films is the monster is never the monster.  If we want to break that down into its constituent pieces, I'd say there's the monster, the hero, the other, and the wince.  So the monster, the real monster, is always human.  Not humanity, just individual humans.  Humans who are avatars of oppressive power structures.  In what will be a running theme, this is a bit looser in The Devil's Backbone before the formula really gets solidified in Pan's Labyrinth.  Does that mean it's a stretch to include it as part of the pattern?  Yeah, maybe.  You wanna fight about it?  The villain of The Devil's Backbone is Jacinto, the groundskeeper at the orphanage where the story is set.  The orphanage is run by socialists who are secretly funding the anti-Franco forces with a cache of hidden gold, even though the war is effectively already lost.  Jacinto is a bullying piece of shit who only sticks around because he's trying to get his hands on that money.  The parallels between Jacinto and Franco's army are metaphorical.  He is not, himself, to the best of my knowledge, a fascist.  Though the metaphor is, uh, it's... It's pretty on the nose.  Where the ghost, Santi, comes from is.  he was one of the orphans, but he saw Jacinto trying to break into the safe and Jacinto killed him sort of accidentally.  This moment mirrors the opening shots of the movie where Franco's army drops a bomb on the orphanage that never detonates.  It gets defused, but not cleared away.  It just sits in the courtyard for the entire movie.  The boy is like the bomb, stuck in limbo, forever frozen in a moment of violence, and therefore, Jacinto is in the same role as Franco.  These events happen on the same night, by the way, in case the analogy wasn't blunt enough.  But in Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, and The Shape of Water, the villains are much more literally avatars of, respectively, fascism, capitalism, and white patriarchy.  Vidal, the villain of Pan's Labyrinth, is a sadistic captain in Franco's army.  The Sharps, villains of Crimson Peak, are British nobles murdering women for their money as they try to hold on to their title.  And Strickland, the villain of The Shape of Water, is a racist, sexist, anti-communist G-man working for the racist, sexist, anti-communist US government during the Red Scare.  They are written to exemplify the horrors of the systems they perpetuate and, in a touch I absolutely love, Every single one of them is miserable.  Jacinto?  Jacinto gets to feel tough because he has authority over ten-year-olds.  The moment an adult stands up to him, he crumples like an overproved loaf of bread.  His boss, the other boss whom he has sex with, even his girl, none of them actually respect him because... because he kind of sucks.  Even his friends bail on him as soon as it looks like he might not have gold for them.  And then he gets stabbed by children and drowned by a ghost.  Vidal?  Vidal's got a fucking death wish.  His father was a famed commander who crushed his pocket watch when he died on the battlefield so his son would know the exact minute of his death.  And Vidal's fixed that watch up so he can do the same.  And he just... gazes longingly at it from time to time.  He's willing to let his new bride die in childbirth if it gets him a male heir because he's checked out of this life and all he has left is the idea of leaving a heroic story for his son.  And he doesn't even get that.  The Sharps?  An ostensibly wealthy baronet and his incestuous sister-lover who are, in fact, utter failures and totally broke, and having to marry and murder wealthy women for their money just to keep up appearances as the man and lady of Allerdale Hall, which is, btdubs, falling apart and also haunted.  Lucille's a sick twist who murdered her mother as a child and Poor Thomas.  He's the one villainous character who actually looks at his situation and says, wait a tick, this is a crap deal.  I should probably get out of here.  And for that, his sister kills him.  Strickland?  Strickland's doing everything he's supposed to.  He's got the wife and the kids and the government job and the picket fence, and he bought a Cadillac because that's what G-men do.  He doesn't even like the color, but the guy tells him it's, like, manly, so he gets it anyway.  He doesn't wash his hands after he pees because someone told him it shows weakness of character.  And he feels nothing.  He confronts his boss, like, hey, I've been doing everything right my whole career.  When do I get treated like a decent human being?  And his boss is like, yeah, decency is a lie.  we tell people to get them to do what we want.  We allow you to exist for precisely as long as you are useful, and then we will end you.  So nut the fuck up.  And instead of saying, way to tick, this is a crap deal, I should probably get out of here, he nuts the fuck up.  And each of these villains has a moment where their true monstrosity is literalized, but... We'll get to that.  By contrast, the hero is someone who lives on the fringes of whichever system the monster upholds.  Carlos is a war orphan whose father just died fighting Franco.  Ofelia is a general stepdaughter whose father just died and whose mother dies halfway through the picture.  Edith is a woman whose mother died when she was a child and whose father is murdered early in the picture.  And Eliza is a mute woman found abandoned by a river as a baby whose last name literally means orphan.  you might be detecting a theme.  These are the orphans of society.  Fascism has no place for children of dissidents or little girls who won't carry on the family name.  Capitalism has no place for women who can't inherit.  Edith's money is going to go straight from her dead father to her new husband.  She's not going to lay a finger on it.  And white anti-communist patriarchy certainly has no place for a disabled woman or her little hero to. ",
