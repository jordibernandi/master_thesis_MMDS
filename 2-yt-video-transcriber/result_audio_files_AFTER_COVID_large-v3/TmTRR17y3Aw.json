            "text": "Hello, gentlemen.  I found a nice little article for us to review today.  I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I will skip around and read the best parts.  But the summary of this article is basically the coronavirus, a worldwide pandemic, women most affected.  From the Atlantic, the coronavirus is a disaster for feminism.  Pandemics affect men and women differently.  Enough already.  When people try to be cheerful about social distancing and working from home, noting that William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton did some of their best work while England was ravaged by the plague, there is an obvious response.  Neither of them had childcare responsibilities.  so this article wants to summarize the point that women are most affected because of this lockdown because of this quarantine because they're unable to be strong independent women.  And as soon as you understand that feminism and this empowerment and entitlement only exists in a productive and prosperous society where the civilization can afford to give women that fake illusion of freedom, you know, to give them that participation trophy, to give them that cushy office job where they can earn an income oftentimes higher than most of their male counterparts doing jack shit so they can feel special, so they can feel like they're a part of society, a productive member of society, that illusion falls apart as soon as society can't afford to give them that illusion of freedom.  You know, feminism only exists as long as the lights of civilization are on.  As soon as shit hits the fan, all of those strong independent women cease to exist.  They disappear.  And the ones who remain bitch and complain that they can't maintain their lifestyle when just moments ago they were so proud and entitled showing off all of their victories in the workplace.  But now, because society can't hold them up anymore, they can't maintain that lifestyle.  So continuing, purely as a physical illness, the coronavirus appears to affect women less severely.  But in the past few days, the conversation about the pandemic has broadened.  We are not just living through a public health crisis, but an economic one.  As much of normal life is suspended for three months or more, job losses are inevitable.  At the same time, school closures and household isolation are moving the work of caring for children from the paid economy, nurseries, schools, babysitters, to the unpaid one.  The coronavirus smashes up the bargain that so many dual earner couples have made in the developed world.  We can both work because someone else is looking after our children.  Instead, couples will have to decide which one of them takes the hit.  so women are adamant about not wanting to be traditional household caretakers.  they want to have kids but they don't want to fucking raise them.  they want the schools to raise the kids.  they want babysitters to raise the kids.  if they have extended family they want the parents or the grandparents to raise the kids.  you can bet they'll have the kids but they don't want to fucking raise them and to do so.  to even suggest that is heresy in today's feminist culture.  They will do everything they can to get out of that parenting, which makes you wonder why they had kids in the first place, but that's a separate topic entirely.  Skipping further down the article, at an individual level, the choices of many couples over the next few months will make perfect economic sense.  What do pandemic patients need?  Looking after.  What do self-isolating older people need?  Looking after.  What do children kept home from school need?  Looking after.  All this looking after, this unpaid caring labor, will fall more heavily on women because of the existing structure of the workforce.  It's not just about social norms of women performing care roles.  It's about practicalities.  Who is paid less?  Who has the flexibility?  So here she's trying to throw up that fucking bullshit debunked falsehood of women getting paid less.  Just a simple logical experiment in your head would disprove that.  If women got paid less, then employers would hire more women.  Employers would hire almost exclusively women because it cuts corners, it reduces costs.  So I'm not even going to get into that fucking argument because that's stupid.  Who has the flexibility?  Again, women are fighting tooth and nail not to go back to the traditional way of things, the way the natural order, the way things should have been, the way things should be.  They will fight tooth and nail to avoid that.  And it's quite amusing to see that, that they're just being blatantly open, that they don't want to fucking stay home with their children, they don't want to take care of the house, they can't take the quarantine because they have to be strong independent women and get out there and earn their own money.  And oftentimes what you find is when the man earns the money, it's our money.  When she earns the money, it's her money.  But now in the quarantine, since she's getting affected, women are the most affected out of the entire fucking worldwide pandemic that's going on right now.  Despite the mass entry of women into the workforce during the 20th century, the phenomenon of the second shift still exists.  Across the world, women, including those with jobs, do more housework and have less leisure time than their male partners.  Even memes about panic buying acknowledge that household tasks such as food shopping are primarily shouldered by women.  I'm not afraid of COVID-19, but what is scary is the lack of common sense people have,\" reads one of the most popular tweets about the crisis.  I'm scared for people who actually need to go to the store and feed their fams, but Susan and Karen stocked up for 30 years.  The joke only works because Susan and Karen, stand-in names for suburban moms, are understood to be responsible for household management rather than, say, Mike and Steve.  Again, total fucking stupidity.  They use the meme of Susan and Karen because Susan and Karen don't understand anything about the worldwide structure, don't follow news, are politically incompetent, politically misinformed, and they wait till the last fucking second to get supplies.  They have no stocks, their fridge is empty in their apartment, they have nothing, they eat fast food every other day, and they don't really cook for themselves.  And they are dependent on the stocking of shelves and the stocking of restaurants and fast food chains.  And they have no real independence.  They're dependent on everything around them, all of the services around them.  And then when they don't follow the news and then they wake up one day and there's a massive panic.  And now all of a sudden there's a mile long line outside the Costco because Susan and Karen waited till the last second to prepare.  That's what they're referring to.  Skipping further ahead in the article, single parents face even harder decisions.  While schools are closed, how do they juggle earning and caring?  No one should be nostalgic for the 1950s ideal of dad returning to a freshly baked dinner and freshly washed children when so many families were excluded from it even then.  And in Britain today, a quarter of families are headed by a single parent, more than 90% of whom are women.  Closed schools make their life even harder.  So that dream of being a strong, independent woman is not possible without the help of government and the stability of society.  You can't endure tough times because you're not supposed to be a strong, independent woman in the workforce outside of the house.  You're supposed to be at home, caring for the children, barefoot and pregnant, the traditional way of things.  It's the way it was supposed to be.  This is nature's way of telling you that you shouldn't be doing that.  But, alas, they'll get bailouts, they'll get money.  As much that can be done to prop them up will be done.  And in closing, this woman writes, We shouldn't make that mistake again.  Grim as it is to imagine now, further epidemics are inevitable and the temptation to argue that gender is a side issue, a distraction from the real crisis, must be resisted.  What we do now will affect the lives of millions of women and girls in future outbreaks.  The coronavirus crisis will be global and long-lasting, economic as well as medical.  However, it also offers an opportunity.  This could be the first outbreak where gender and sex differences are recorded and taken into account by researchers and policymakers.  For too long, politicians have assumed that childcare and elderly care can be soaked up by private citizens, mostly women.  effectively providing a huge subsidy to the paid economy.  This pandemic should remind us of the true scale of that distortion.  Wenham suggests emergency childcare provision, economic security for small business owners, and a financial stimulus paid directly to families, but she isn't hopeful because her experience suggests that governments are too short-termist and reactive.  everything that's happened has been predicted right.  she told me as a collective academic group we knew that there would be an outbreak that came out of China.  that shows you how globalization spreads disease that's going to paralyze financial systems and there was no pot of money ready to go no governance plan.  we knew all this and they didn't listen.  so how?  why would they listen to something about women?  That one line right there kind of pisses me off.  That shows you how globalization spreads disease.  So on one hand, these fucking people argue for open borders and interconnectedness and the destruction of nationalism and the spreading of globalism.  And then here they are with their hands out.  Pleading for the government to support them and how globalization got them into this mess in the first place.  You cannot fucking win with these people.  That's why you shouldn't even listen Jesus.  that's terrible.  But anyways, so just so everyone is aware women are the most affected from this pandemic so our condolences go out to them.  I also wanted to touch on a topic that I have observed a few things.  So there have been some memes going around how only the two genders are affected, men and women are affected by the coronavirus, and the 57 other genders aren't mentioned.  And that's because all of that social justice virtue signaling only exists when society can tolerate it, when society can handle it.  As soon as times get tough, that shit goes right out the window, just alongside women's rights and women's independence, which should show you the actual value of it, which is nothing.  um but also i want to talk about how men and women are differing during the quarantine.  from my observations um and then just observing on the internet you know i know some thoughts that are going fucking crazy right now because they're in isolation whereas myself and plenty of other guys are completely fine during this quarantine and in fact actually productive.  Now, I'm not defending the lockdown.  You know, this is global martial law being implemented.  I don't like that.  That is not good, and we're going to lose a lot of rights because fucking Susan and Karen are panicking, and they want to give up all their rights for some fucking stupid-ass virus.  We're going to lose a lot of liberties, and it's going to be tough to get those back.  But... Yeah, like average women nowadays are going fucking ballistic because they can't leave their apartments.  And why is that?  Because women feed off of social interactions.  Their currency is social currency, you know?  And when they're isolated and they're inside, they can't do anything because they're dependent on that social interaction.  Whereas, if we go back to the start of this article, she has a brief little tangent about William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton being productive in their times during a plague.  And I can totally relate to that.  This lockdown came at a perfect time for me so I could focus on writing the MGTOW Survival Guide, which I was already writing before this happened, but now I have more time to focus and dedicate to that.  Plenty of other guys are productive as well, but also plenty of other guys are doing their own hobbies.  They have their own hobbies because men are often isolated regardless of if there's a quarantine or not.  20% of men get 80% of the women and then the rest are invisible.  and men have to make do with themselves and enjoy the company of themselves.  Whereas women, they don't need to reflect.  They don't need to self-isolate.  They don't need to spend time in solitude.  they don't need to concern themselves with keeping themselves busy.  you know when they're done clubbing and when they're done working their cushy office jobs.  they come home and watch Netflix and you'll be lucky.  maybe they cook a meal or two throughout the week or they go out to fast food or dinner and rely on those and Netflix is their fucking hobby.  So they have no prerogative to entertain themselves, to develop themselves, to be productive in isolation.  And in fact, they're going fucking crazy because they're losing out on social currency, which is what they're dependent on.  Very amusing to see the differences.  Very amusing to see the rationalization of this.  This is from The Atlantic.  So, you know, keep on keeping on guys.  I'll try to pump out some more content while we're in quarantine.  But yeah, let me know your thoughts on this.  Not too unexpected.  You know, women, their solipsistic nature forces them to make themselves the primary victim in any situation.  Um, what's that quote from fucking Hillary Clinton?  I'll put it on screen right now.  Uh, women are the primary, um, victims of warfare or something like that because their husbands and fathers go to war.  So they end up dead in the ditch and women are the victims somehow.  It's fucking ridiculous.  But, um, you know, here's a, here's a little taste of that solipsism for you guys.  But, uh, I'll see you guys next time. ",
