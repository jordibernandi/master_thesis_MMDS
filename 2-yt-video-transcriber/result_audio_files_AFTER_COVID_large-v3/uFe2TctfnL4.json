            "text": "Hello, brothers and sisters.  We continue on our four-day prayer assignment, praying for the four states.  that was dreamed about by Clay Nash, Dutch Sheets intercessor and prophet.  Let me review the dream.  In the dream, there were four liberals spinning four blue plates.  And in the dream, they were trying to serve a blue plate special to the United States.  But in the dream, we were looking for a sharpshooter who would shoot these four blue plates.  And in the dream, as it was, they called in Lou Engle.  which I believe is not just me.  I believe it's you that are listening.  And in the dream, we were called in to shoot these four blue plates.  And the first one we shot was a blue plate.  And when it fell to the ground, it became the red state of Georgia.  I want to continue praying for Georgia.  Secondly, the second plate we shot, blue plate, fell to the ground.  It became North Carolina, a red state.  And then Pennsylvania, which we pray for today, we shot that blue plate and Pennsylvania, the red state of Pennsylvania, that plate became that.  And then the final one was Arizona.  I've been pondering this dream.  And I think we need to be sharpshooters.  There are those that are spinning the elections of these four states to try to turn it into a blue plate special to serve this meal of... Communism, Marxism, state mandated education, nine months abortion, funding abortion worldwide.  And I believe God is saying, I want you to target those that are spinning the plates.  I want to pray today that God would expose the high places of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the high places of the Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, those in charge of elections, counting votes, and the likes.  And I want to pray today that God would expose the spinning of of men spinning, the media spinning the lies that are fueling this blue plate special.  I want to pray that God would expose, expose, expose, and that it would go ultimately to the Supreme Court and that those six judges so to speak, conservative judges, would not kowtow, would not bow down to political pressure, but would uphold the law no matter what it cost them.  I am praying that Amy Coney Barrett will have such an anointing on her life that she will influence the other judges even more than John Roberts would influence them.  She would become the Esther who has the anointing to influence Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Thomas and Alito.  We need five judges.  We need to secure the judges.  So today we pray for Pennsylvania.  But before we do, I want to share a dream that I had last night.  I think sometimes we can get caught up in all the fire and all the animosity and the anger and the exposures and all of this.  But I think God wants to bring it back, at least to me, to the heart of things.  Last night I had a dream.  I was trying to catch these eels, slippery eels, and I could not catch them.  And I was afraid they were going to bite me.  And it was like on this farm, and it was so uncomfortable.  And then in the place where these eels were swimming, I saw a little lamb.  And that little lamb was perfect and pure.  and was needing help.  It was like it was lost.  I picked up the little lamb and I held it.  And it was one of those most vivid dreams.  And I held it close to my heart.  And I felt as if I was a father to this lamb, that I was to protect this lamb at all costs.  And that lamb just stayed in my arms.  And it was just such an intimate dream.  And I was gonna do whatever I could to protect the little lamb.  I woke up and I felt this morning the Lord said, there's lots of eels, lots of political slippery things, slippery deals going on and they're hard to catch and they bite.  But if you keep your heart in the right place, I'm going to answer your prayers.  It's all about guarding the little lambs.  I felt the Lord speak to me.  Lou, you're a father to the needy and you will take up the cause of the little ones that are going to be aborted.  And God just brought me back to the simplicity of it all.  This is not about elections.  It's about the unborn.  It's about God's most innocent ones.  who's looking for the church to protect, to love, and guard his little lambs.  Right now, in Jesus' name, I just pray over Pennsylvania.  I just pray, first of all, for the church, that I pray the church would catch your heart, that God, this would be about protecting the unborn.  I pray that those who are making decisions would be so captured by the fact that this must be made right for the sake of the little lambs, the helpless and the needy.  That God, I pray that God, you would move on the courts of Pennsylvania, that they would see that they're judging on behalf of the little lambs.  I pray that God, we would catch your heart.  This election is first and foremost about the unborn and God who wants to fight and guard those little ones from the slippery eels of politicians, wicked spinners of plates, My God, I ask you today, God, expose the spinners.  in Pennsylvania, expose the wicked schemes, expose the dark and deep secrets.  God, I pray, God, we shoot in Jesus' name our spiritual weapons to tear down and expose the spirit's powers of darkness, the eels, the slippery eels that bite.  Lord, expose them, catch them in the name of Jesus, all for the sake Of the little ones.  I pray for Pennsylvania.  That great land where my forefathers came.  To the 1700s.  Saw revival.  I pray for Pennsylvania.  That once again it would be the land of liberty.  Be the land of the constitution.  It would be the land of the declaration of independence.  Living God.  Where God.  that it would be life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That, God, that first thing would be the life of the most innocent, the weakest of all.  Living God, turn America back to you.  God, go back to the root of Pennsylvania to save a nation.  And I pray today.  For the Supreme Court, I pray that these states will go to the Supreme Court, these arguments, these slippery lies, and that, God, you would cause these judges to stand on truth, not on political pressure, not on self-preservation.  But for the sake of the nation, for the sake of your name, for the sake of the unborn, and for the sake of them being on the right side of history, move on those judges.  John Roberts, cause him to tremble.  Tremble at the unborn in Jesus' name.  God, I pray, God, for Sotomayor and Kagan and Breyer.  I pray, God, that you would even shift them with dreams.  And let not... Let the other judges, Lord Thomas and Alito and Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, pray for Kavanaugh.  Let him remember the fires that he went through in that court case.  Let him remember it was all about life.  that he has gone through hellish operation.  Let him be able to stand in the fires and hold fast to the truth.  Let him judge not according to what their eyes see or ears heard, but according to the truth, to the Constitution, and to the biblical foundations of which this nation was born.  I pray, save us for such a time as this.  In Jesus' name, amen. ",
