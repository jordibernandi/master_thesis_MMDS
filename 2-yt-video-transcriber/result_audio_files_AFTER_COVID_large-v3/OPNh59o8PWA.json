            "text": "And I'm here to tell you this evening with the open Bible that God is a spirit.  You haven't seen God and nobody's ever seen God.  Now it's true, of course, that the Bible speaks about his hands, but that's just a way of getting it over to our poor minds that God is very powerful.  It's true that the Bible sometimes speaks about his eyes, but that's just a way of getting it over to our poor minds that he sees everything.  It's true that the Bible speaks about his mouth, but that's just a way of getting it over to our poor minds that God speaks and reveals himself.  God is a spirit.  He has no body.  He can't be weighed.  He can't be measured.  He can't be touched.  He can't be felt.  He is a spirit.  And God is a personal spirit.  Because he's not a something.  He's a someone.  That's why God has names.  And God's most best known name is, of course, Jehovah.  Yahweh.  Which is just the English way of writing the name which he revealed himself when he spoke to Moses at the bush.  I am that I am.  God is a someone.  That's why several times in the Bible... We read that people became his friends and that he becomes theirs.  And that's why from the beginning of the Bible.  to the end, we read that God can be known.  This is the great God that we find in the scripture.  But what is he like in himself?  As far as space is concerned, God is everywhere.  Do not I fill heaven and earth, says the Lord?  Jeremiah 23, 24.  And what that means, of course, is that God is not absent anywhere.  And that means that God in all his glory, all his being, all his majesty, all his purity, all his power, all that God is, is in any place at any time and in every place at every time.  As far as space is concerned, he is everywhere.  now our mortal minds can't take that in.  how can it be that the whole of God is here and yet the whole of God is there?  how can it be that God in all his fullness is here?  yet if we went to the furthest and farthest flung galaxy the whole of God is there.  that completely baffles us and blows our human mind.  but that's what the scripture declares And all we can do is bow down in adoring wonder and worship God.  So far as time is concerned, he is eternal.  From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.  When Abraham prayed to him, or when David prayed to him, or when we prayed to him, just now he was exactly the same.  he is completely unchanged.  he had no beginning he has no end he has no age.  he is infinite.  there is no sort of limit for God as far as knowledge is concerned.  God knows everything.  Our knowledge is very small, and if we put together all that the human race knows, it's very, very small.  It's only a part of the whole.  When we come into the world, we have very little knowledge, and we have to learn things one at a time, and then quite often we forget them just as quickly.  God never learned anything.  Ever.  And there's nothing that he doesn't know anywhere.  And he sees all things as they really are.  And he sees all things as they really are all the time.  And we read in the scriptures in Psalm 147, his understanding is infinite.  And that means, of course, if you're unconverted, that it's impossible to deceive God.  You can't pull the wool over his eyes.  You can't make things out to be different from the way they really are.  As far as power is concerned, he does whatever he chooses.  Psalm 115 verse 3 says, he has done whatever he pleases.  And we read in the book of Daniel, he does according to his will in the armies of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth.  No one can restrain his hand or say to him, what have you done?  We read in the book of Ephesians, he works all things after the counsel of his own will.  that the very movement of an insect, the very blowing of the wind, and listen, even what wicked men do, every detail brings to pass exactly what God planned, without him being wicked in any way.  What is this God like?  This everlasting God, what sort of God is he?  This God who is a spirit, what is he like?  And the Bible tells us he is holy.  We read just now God is light and in him is no darkness at all.  Now in God's presence are wonderful creatures who've never sinned.  And yet there's something different about God which is so splendid that these creatures which have never sinned, they can't even look on God because he's holy.  The word holy means to be cut off.  And God is cut off from all his creatures.  He's completely different and separate from all his creatures because he is entirely pure.  And yet we can never really understand what that means.  We just have to accept what Scripture says and say with the psalmist and with Moses that he's glorious in holiness.  He's a purer eyes than to even look upon sin.  Isn't that a wonderful truth?  Can you imagine what it would be like if the God who exists from eternity to eternity, who is in all places at all times, who knows all things and can do whatever he likes, wouldn't it be a terrible message that I had to preach if I had to tell you that that God is wicked or tyrannical or selfish?  But thank God I don't have to tell you that.  He's holy.  Everything about him is pure and right.  Which is the next word?  He is righteous.  We read this evening in Psalm 145, the Lord is righteous in all his ways.  God can't do anything wrong.  He can't think a wrong thought.  He can't speak a wrong word.  He can't do a wrong act.  Absolutely everything that God does is right.  And when I read the Bible, I breathe a great sigh of relief.  Wouldn't it be a terrible thing if this great, infinite, eternal God did even one thing wrong?  But that's a fear that I never have to nurse.  He's righteous in all his ways.  He can never be blamed for anything.  And he's loving.  Everybody knows that.  The Bible says God is love.  The Bible doesn't say, by the way, that love is God.  If you don't know God, you don't know what love is.  God is love.  We read in Exodus, the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abounding in goodness and truth.  Slow to anger, we read in Micah and Joel, and of great kindness.  God is love.  Why do some of you stay away from him?  And God is good.  The Lord is good to all.  The Lord is good to all.  Isn't that marvelous?  Thou art good and doest good, said David in his Psalms.  Now ordinary men and women consider God to be their enemy.  They would rather have God out of their life.  Yet their hearts still beat, their lungs still breathe, their minds still think.  He gives them rain and sunshine and fruitful seasons to enjoy and sometimes even gladness of heart.  He sends into their world laughter and joy and love and children.  And he's actively good to them.  And the harvest still ripens for them.  And the bread is still made and they still eat it.  But the greatest proof of the goodness of God... is that he loves to forgive his enemies and does so when they come asking him for mercy.  The Bible says, You, Lord, are good and ready to forgive, abounding in mercy to all those who call upon you.  And the last word in that particular list is the word wise.  Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, said Daniel, for wisdom and might are his.  Look at the intricacy of the creation.  The fine balance.  The tiniest creature.  The smallest molecule.  The atom itself.  DNA.  It's all the handiwork of God.  How wise he is to have created it.  And the very existence of knowledge.  The very fact that there's such a thing as understanding is God's invention.  Then when we think of how he planned a way to save rebels and sinners and ungrateful, spiteful people, and he did it through the blood of a cross.  Oh, we admire the wisdom of God.  And we say with the Apostle Paul, oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.  who has known the mind of the Lord, who has been his counselor, who is first given to him and it shall not be given to him again.  For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever.  He is incomprehensible.  You see, as we read the Bible, what the Bible says is clear enough.  I can tell you, and you can find out for yourself, what the Bible says.  Questions which begin what we can answer.  What is God like?  What sort of God is he?  What is he in himself?  Those sort of questions we can answer because God has given the answers.  Questions which begin how, none of us can answer.  How is it that God can be in all places at all times in the wholeness of his being?  We can't answer that.  How is it that God can know all things as they really are all the time without learning them?  How is it that he can be just and love, righteous and good?  How, how, how?  How is it that he can be three and yet one?  We can't answer any of those questions.  Because we're just ordinary creatures, our minds are very limited.  And we're sinful creatures and our minds are very darkened.  There is no question beginning with how that we can answer.  Because we are not God.  And all we can do there is bow the knee before God, acknowledge the mystery, and admit that he is God and we are his creatures. ",
