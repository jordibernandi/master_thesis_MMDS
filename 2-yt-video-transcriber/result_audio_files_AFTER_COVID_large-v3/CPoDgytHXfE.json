            "text": "It's Christmas time, but there's no need to celebrate.  A six grand fine on twelfth night is what awaits.  Because it's 2020.  Block your ears and close your eyes.  Wrap your hands around your throats.  We're saving lives.  And so beware the authoritarians who hate their lives and hate you for having one.  They're a paranoid misanthrope in a world of doom and gloom.  And they won't ever be satisfied until they've dragged us off their tube.  They'll blow smoke right up the shitholes of an uncanny Disneyland.  But this time, it's actually you, it's Shredder Graham.  The world locked down in Africa, this Kwanzaa.  Cause black lives matter even in Rwanda Where there's no fake media shit show To sell you down the road.  Do they know that sickness is better old?  Here's to you and the past forevermore.  We don't need to have your own fucking door till you know the circus is yours.  Thank you.  I'm telling you, people are dying.  And not just right now.  All the time people are dying.  All the fecking time.  They're dying from everything, aren't they?  The sooner you don't turn up blind, die so you don't.  And you shouldn't.  Ah, life goes on.  So please, don't give us the money.  Do not give us the money.  Don't stay at home.  Don't get on the phone.  It's your life.  It's your money.  I'm begging you.  Keep it safe.  Keep it in your pocket.  And go down the fucking pub.  Yes, we know this.  Death is gross, but red bread lines are here.  Worse, our strength is not the borderline.  So I have the power to buy me a towel.  Remember, it's our world in here.  I have the power to have the shell.  It tells us what the Italian mind is.  We have the peace to free us from this mess in time.  Only those who belong to us will be the choice for the last time. ",
