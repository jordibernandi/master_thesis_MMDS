You see, here's, excuse me, what's on the menu today, hamster?  Dale's Pale Ale.  Oscar Blue's Brewery.  Longmont, Colorado.  Right up the road.  Rocky Mountain Pure Spring Water Chip.  Being child-free by choice.  Does anybody really have a problem with this?  What's the argument, you know, to these women that they have to respond as if this is a thing?  What was the F word movement about?  Well, it was about women making choices with their own lives.  In other words, you know, in 1950, maybe women were expected to have children, be married and all, but we're in current year, 2020.  None of that applies anymore because of F-ism.  Of course, if you want to argue... that it still applies, perhaps you have to admit that the F-ism movement failed utterly and totally because nothing is different than it was 70 years ago, right?  So let's jump in and see what these oppressed women have to say because they don't want to have children and no one is saying they should, but they're going to say, well, wait a minute.  No, no, it's still oppression.  Somehow, the patriarchy gotta be somewhere. ",
