            "text": "As James Woods so eloquently put it, stick a tomahawk in her, she's done.  So why has Senator Elizabeth Warren pulled out of the presidential race?  Well, it's pretty simple, really.  She ran third in the Massachusetts Democratic primary on Super Tuesday.  Now, running third in a single state primary is not a disaster, but it is if it's your home state.  And coming into Super Tuesday, she'd finished third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and Nevada, and fifth in South Carolina.  In Massachusetts, Warren managed 21.5% of the vote, well behind Biden, who got a third, and Sanders, who got a little more than a quarter.  So Warren could see that the writing was on the wall and made the correct decision.  But whilst Warren may be done, she's not done playing the sexism card.  And neither are her supporters or the compliant media done repeating this same tired bullshit. ",

Now, what is this narcissistic self-obsession with your own feelings?  It's a fact that you are left with a choice between two white men for the presidential nominee.  Your feelings don't enter into it.  But this idea that you just heard Warren say previously, that millions of disappointed girls and women will have to wait for their female savior, is not only sexist, it's delusional.  Look, I get it.  There's never been a female president, and so when one is finally elected, it'll be a first and celebrated by those who think that kind of shit matters.  But let me ask the millions of African Americans out there.  Apart from the symbolism attached to the election of Barack Obama as the first black president, did your life improve measurably during his two terms in office?  Did your world change in a significant way?  If you think electing a woman president will dramatically change the lives of women and girls, then you're either a child or a child in an adult's body.  Now, Warren doesn't come out and blame it all on misogyny, but she implies it with this response later in the interview. ",

            "text": "I promise you this, I will have a lot more to say on that subject later.  Well, the planet I live on is the one in which Hillary Clinton won the nomination in 2016.  I guess that must have been the pantsuits.  Oh, but it was misogyny that cost Clinton the presidency.  Yeah, that makes sense given that almost three million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than Trump.  By the way, why hasn't the misogyny angle been wheeled out against Tulsi Gabbard or Amy Klobuchar?  Why is it only being proffered in the case of Warren?  Katie Herzog, writing in Reason, provides an explanation.  Warren's followers are both primed to see sexism everywhere and so enamored with their candidate, so sure of her and their own righteousness, that they're unable to see any of the flaws that are so apparent to anyone outside their bubble.  This was exemplified by this ridiculous tweet from a now famous, for all the wrong reasons, Yale professor, attracting one of the biggest ratios on Twitter I've ever seen.  This is a philosophy professor at Yale.  So perhaps it's not that surprising.  Anyway, let's put some data around the Massachusetts primary result, again remembering that this was Warren's home state.  According to exit polls, Warren did significantly better amongst women, getting 24% of the female vote as opposed to only 17% of the male vote.  So there's your smoking gun.  Misogyny is rampant in Massachusetts.  Or is it?  See, we can all play this game of asserting truths with no evidence if we want to.  Why couldn't the interpretation of that be misandry?  Warren attracted more of the female vote because she attracted the misandrists that think genitals are more important than policy.  Biden attracted significantly more female voters than Warren and as many female voters as males.  And even Bloomberg, who's been labeled a misogynist, got a percentage more of the female vote than the male one.  And is someone going to address the rampant misandry against Sanders, who got 31% of the male vote but only 26% of the female vote?  And where are the news stories about the blatant homophobia of Massachusetts females?  Mayor Pete got 4% of the male vote and only 1% of the female vote.  Herzog wrote of the Warren campaign, Warren could have focused on the working class.  Instead, she focused on the wokest class.  She advocated for social positions that may resonate with highly educated, largely white activists, but just don't appeal to a broad base of Americans across race and class.  She talked about non-binary driver's licenses and advocated for trans women to play women's sport and used the term traffic violence when the rest of us simply say car crash.  She's out of touch, or at least her advisors are, and there aren't enough Oberlin grads for her to win Ohio, much less the swing states that will likely determine the outcome of the 2020 race.  Yeah, perhaps faking that you're a woman of color doesn't resonate with minorities.  Warren attracted just 14% of the black vote and 17% of the Hispanic vote.  And just as an aside, it's interesting to note that Bloomberg, who has been labeled a racist for his support of stop-and-frisk policies, during his time as mayor of New York, polled significantly better amongst black voters than white voters.  How could that be?  Well, perhaps that's because the woke, as Katie Herzog said, are largely highly educated white activist types, whereas black voters actually think what Bloomberg did as mayor was good for the city.  Anyway, you can use exit polls as a Rorschach test depending on your ideological viewpoint, but there's no compelling evidence that Warren's poor showing in her home state was because of misogyny.  And just to emphasize the liability of wokeness, remember this tweet from Warren.  Black trans and cis women, gender non-conforming and non-binary people are the backbone of our democracy and I don't take this endorsement lightly.  And then there was this response to a nine-year-old trans boy who asked what Warren would do to keep kids like him safe. ",

            "text": "There's just no need for this woke pandering bullshit.  And aside from that woke pandering, there were other reasons Warren's campaign failed to keep the momentum it gathered late last year.  As Peter Suderman of Reason pointed out, she tried to distance herself from the explicit socialism of Sanders by insisting that she was a capitalist to her bones.  However, it's tough to maintain that stance when you insist on a punitive wealth tax.  I don't know how her strategists thought this was a good idea, because when people are polled on income equality, they say they are concerned about it, but they generally think that it's fair for people that have earned their fortune not to be punished for it.  But when you come out with tens of trillions of dollars in new spending plans, I guess you've got to come up with a way to pay for it somehow.  And then there was the Warren health care plan.  First she endorsed Sanders Medicare for All and then backed away from it because she couldn't explain how she'd pay for it, even though she was the woman with a plan for everything.  As Suderman writes, eventually she released a plan that was simultaneously convoluted to the point of being unworkable and bad on the merits.  After significant criticism, Warren released a second plan that called for implementing Medicare for All, a difficult political task in the most promising of circumstances, several years into her presidency.  It was a tacit admission that she wouldn't pursue single-payer health care at all.  Warren's have-it-both-ways approach had become a trap.  Voters who didn't want Medicare for All believed she was for it.  Voters who did believed she wasn't genuinely invested in the issue.  In a race that often revolved around health care policy, Warren had put herself in a no-win position.  So there are plenty of reasons why Warren's campaign tanked, and sexism wasn't one of them.  As the title of Katie Herzog's article stated, sexism didn't kill the Warren campaign.  The Warren campaign killed the Warren campaign.  As usual, let me know your thoughts in the comments below.  I'll see you next time. ",
