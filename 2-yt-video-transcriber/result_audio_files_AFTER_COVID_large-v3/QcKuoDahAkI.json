            "text": "Testing.  One, two, three.  Mic check.  Mic check.  It's not like I'm really checking anything.  Today I want to talk about everything unknown.  Exploring the unknown.  What has the truth done for us?  I can speak for myself, it's made life more exciting.  Everywhere I look, whether in a big city or small town, or in the middle of nowhere, there are mysteries to explore.  And the truth of our real existence is a thousand times more fascinating than the ridiculous narrative that we've been fed.  And in today's video, I have nothing in particular, but rather a bunch of miscellaneous bits, notes scattered all over the place, waiting to be talked about, emails and comments alike.  I wanted to start off by saying that whether Tesla was the real deal or not, I was heavily influenced by the ideas brought forth from this character and not easy to obtain.  In 2001, I was trying to recreate a free energy device with magnets.  And I met an electrical engineer.  In fact, I was working at my coffee shop in Salt Lake City.  And this customer, a big bearded seven foot man, who would come in with a small mandolin taking great pleasure in singing and picking away at his mandolin.  And at times we would talk about the things I was working on.  And he taught me all about Nikola Tesla.  And he also told me the things I was trying to do could not be done.  And inside I was very upset and refused to believe this idea.  And upon doing a lot of research at the time in books, I found the inventions of Nikola Tesla in which he had discovered free energy.  Looking back, he absolutely understood the use of the constant occurring static electricity that floods our air and how to harness it.  And when we typically look at machine diagrams they're very complicated and this particular invention or reverse engineering involved a panel above the ground and one below the ground copper wire wrapped in a particular fashion both meeting in the center and this is where the electricity was produced or harnessed.  It took me in a lot of different directions, and I found myself talking to people on the phone in Canada who had replicated these instruments and invited me to come see their research.  At the time, I was in my early 20s.  I never did make it out to Canada, but I never did let go of my passion.  Again, only a small part of the equation.  Yes, power is important, but also something that we can do without and live a perfectly beautiful life, even if it is by candlelight.  And I have lived that way for years and really have no desire to return to that.  And I don't pay for power.  I'm perfectly content using solar as my free energy source.  And I really wasn't in the mood tonight.  Sometimes I feel like I'll never make a video again.  And then you have a fine conversation with a friend and suddenly your mind is reinvigorated.  And he told me after watching my last video, he read a comment which led him to this Brocks Monument at the Niagara Falls.  Absolutely fascinating.  And I think we could spend a lifetime investigating all the anomalous sites at the Niagara Falls really pointing to an old civilization.  And here we have the Brocks Monument dating back to 1824.  And this thing is just massive.  And here they tell us.  in 1841 it suffered damage via explosion.  And both these older images, of course, being renderings.  And finally it was replaced with this monstrosity.  Let's have a little look in 2015.  Here she is.  And over here we get some sort of scale with this person.  And I believe it was almost a hundred feet.  And a glorious Corinthian column with statues on top.  Pretty mind-blowing.  And not only did it suffer an explosion in 1840, but in 1929 a lightning strike severely damaged the statue, sending large portions crashing to the ground below.  And these monuments are pretty amazing, typically serving another purpose.  Here we see these portholes And up here as well.  And actually we can see some nice pictures of the inside of this building.  Apparently the comment said that there used to be a giant mansion next to it, which was destroyed.  And the beauty just extends all around this property.  And where was I?  This is something I've been wanting to share for months.  Some pictures taken in Wyoming.  And thank you, Brian, for this.  And he was just driving along the highway when he saw this anomalous, what seemed like a wall from afar.  And what do you think?  Remains of a massive wall clearly built by a giant race or some random geology?  I have places very similar in my neck of the woods.  But these blocks, if they are blocks, still in pretty good shape.  And notice the trees here, just to get a frame of reference.  Something similar to the megalithic size of blocks seen in Baalbek, Lebanon.  I'm very tempted to take a little trip out here.  And really, when it comes to melted or at the very least damaged buildings from a past reset, we clearly see signs of building turning to stone, concrete, brick, and other block works having what ultimately appears to be a natural composition in spots and really leaving a fine line between natural and man-made.  Many sites that our cult castle today look like nothing more than mountains with many cave entrances.  And this may represent a large part of the stone and mountains found all throughout our realm.  But not all of them.  I tend to lean towards all three categories.  This being one of them, another being massive trees and wood that has petrified into stone?  And finally, how could we leave out Roger's theory of giant creatures themselves petrifying in the right conditions and turning into lumps of stone mountains?  And we've just looked at a quick building example.  If you want to see more, I'd recommend checking out Jerry's channel at When the Buildings Crive.  And for a good tree example today, We're going to check out this channel as seen here.  An excellent channel.  Again, similar to what I shared with you in the last video.  This channel not too dissimilar as far as doing some boots on the ground work.  Very fun explorations with his dogs.  And he goes out and discovers this site of what seems like a chunk of a massive tree.  and many great examples, in my opinion, almost an undeniable proof.  We can see wood grain throughout this whole thing, and the chunks of quartz he proposes are petrified sap from the tree.  And really, if we were to judge or guess the age of this tree, not seeming too far along, in its petrification process.  And I think you're getting the picture.  And I encourage you to watch his video.  By the end, I think you'll see the same evidence for this case.  And only one example in so many thousands of examples.  And this was just a mind-blowing picture.  I featured it at the opening of my last video, made no mention of how strange it is.  is it photoshopped?  i don't know.  do any of you know about this?  if this was a real picture this would lend to the idea that the narrative about these falls receding over millions of years is a bunch of bs and in fact this is just a giant crater and we're seeing The blast site.  And even without this hole, still seeming like a crater.  And Martin mentioned that Lee is missing.  Where are you, Lee?  And Wiseup just put out a good video lending to the idea that this stone may have been wooden slats.  And always presenting a good case.  And then there was this awesome video by Jamie at A Plain Truth.  I wanted to feature it in my gold mine video.  I think it would have tied in beautifully, but I was short on time.  And it was a great video in which he showed all of these tunnels and the controller's plans to implement this network.  And it's very possibly being used today.  And here, this little map put out in 1972.  And of course, we doing research, typically going back to 100, 150 years ago, rediscovering these tunnels all throughout our realm in every city and remote locations alike.  And here, Jamie brings it back to a more modern time period.  We can see what kind of plans they have for, in my opinion, what is actually repairing upgrading, and often cleaning out of these tunnels.  And very, very high-tech technologies going on under our feet, always tying back to the old Hopi story, where the Hopis were brought underground to avoid being wiped out in the past cataclysm.  In their oldest story, we learn about a highly advanced people with cities in the Underrealm.  And the inhabitants of these cities were called the Ant People.  Perhaps this is short for Atlantean.  And we've looked at old maps where this infrastructure was in place by the mid-1850s, full of roads, rail systems, tunnels, and canals.  But this is no surprise to us now.  after years of research we know that the past was much greater than the present and most of it just lying under our feet.  and at this point I want to look through my emails.  these are emails I usually send to myself in hopes of sharing and usually never do.  for every thousand things I want to share with you I might only get to a couple.  today's ideas momentarily making us forget about yesterdays.  This is similar to my bookmarks for my internet browser.  Probably 10 years worth of research and topics that interest me, and essentially videos to come.  Here I want to open this one, but it looks like Stolen History is back up and running.  No longer StolenHistory.org, but rather Net.  And here we'll look at a share by Jeremy Vicious.  And what we see is the Soldier and Sailor's Monument being excavated.  We've looked at the monument in the past.  One of my favorites.  It's said to have tunnels and even occasional tours underneath.  But this fine photo, and I thank you for this, is a real treat, giving us a peek at the city that once laid under this modern-day city, really lending to the idea that all these fine works we see all throughout are merely the tops of the past wonders that were exposed.  And here's an old article that was shared some weeks ago by the Conspiracy R Us channel, and it showed how every home and essentially building, was actually using the Antiquitech wires and wells to store an electrical charge.  And again, getting back to Tesla, what we can see is that this technology is nothing new, was being implemented plane-wide and in plain sight.  And here's some photos of the Salt Lake Temple construction.  and a beautiful picture of a wagon train on the way to the dedication of the temple.  And I saved this a long time ago.  I'm not even sure what I wanted to show you.  Here we go.  So this is the beginning of construction, we're told.  And they seem to glaze over the fact that this tabernacle already exists, and all these massive blocks and foundation.  that looks very weathered.  And I propose that the temple was already here.  But let's see what these construction pictures have to offer us.  Now these pictures in their own right seem ridiculous.  Very little construction being done and really seeming like a site that has been stumbled upon.  Here we can see the oxen and cranes and a big unorganized mess.  I'm not sure What to say about these photos?  All these blocks would have been cut and moved almost 20 miles away by horse and wagon.  And this guy moving a piece of wood seems to be the most construction activity I've seen.  Are these pictures staged?  Every single one seems to be a photo op.  But yet the building does seem to go up.  But with these vanilla skies, it might be easy to crop out section by section and impose these men, posts, and wires into the picture.  And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.  As always, I don't know.  So that's it.  I thank you for joining me.  And do have a blessed day.  Please like, comment and subscribe.  These would make great photos, but this looks like this used to be a pipe.  This is probably one of the coolest things I've found out here.  And this, I'm certain, is a rusted out pipe or some kind of piece of metal.  You can really see The metal hair.  This is so cool.  What do you see?  He's excited.  He's really excited out here.  Again, he kind of prompted me to come back here.  Always a good scout. ",
