            "text": "Today we're going to look at what law enforcement knew before the January 6th event.  And we're going to ask the question, was this event totally preventable?  Hey, what's going on?  If it's your first time here, my name is Nate, the lawyer, and welcome to the Brody's Bunch, where you are the joy of today's content.  So don't forget to like this video, share this video, and subscribe to the channel if you like what you hear.  So I just want to ask you, if I told you there was going to be a bank robbery, and I told you when the bank robbery is going to happen, I told you who was going to rob the I showed you the plans for the bank robbery.  Do you think that law enforcement would be capable enough to stop the bank robbery and possibly even catch the people who committed the bank robbery?  Well, that's kind of similar to what we have going on here with this Trump rally and riot on January 6th.  Now, before we get into this, let me be very clear.  I am not making excuses for the people who who rioted and violated the law, for the people who brought pipe bombs, and for the people who brought zip ties to the event to capture lawmakers.  Those people are criminals.  Those people should be prosecuted.  No doubt about it.  Even the rioters who entered the building, they should be prosecuted.  It is absolutely abhorrent what happened.  I think we can all agree that that was unacceptable.  But saying that doesn't stop us from looking at the event and seeing what actually happened in the background and whether any of this could just have been avoided by simple planning.  And what did authorities know before the event happened?  Now the first thing I want to do is for all of us to look at the factual evidence about the event.  Now you're hearing in the mainstream media, this was an insurrection.  This was an overthrow of the government.  This was domestic terrorism.  And there are elements of all that that are true.  Now let's go back in time.  and see how this event was billed, how this event was organized, and what actually happened before it turned bad.  One thing that the mainstream media is not going to tell you is that this was a permitted event.  Yes.  Here are the permits.  There are two permits for this event.  Now these permits last over a couple of days.  For instance, one permit by the silent majority actually had rallies the day before on January 5th to prepare for the big rallies on January 6th when Congress was going to certify the Electoral College vote.  Then the second permit was from a group called Women for America First.  Now this group's permit covered a couple of days, ending on the big rally on January 6th, which President Trump spoke at now just for context. ",

Yeah, Tasmeen, it is going to be a busy week in the district, that's for sure.  Multiple protests have been planned and approved by the National Park Service.  Some of these protests approved even just within the last hour.  Now, as of this morning, there was only one demonstration that had been approved, and crews were already out setting up for the event today.  A stage, lighting, and port-a-johns were being set up for a March for Trump rally that will be held on Wednesday morning.  And this will be on the ellipse with a view from the South Lawn at the White House.  Now, two more permits were approved this evening for events happening tomorrow on Tuesday.  According to the permits, both of those will start their marches and rallies at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  Now, one of those events is called the Rally to Revival, and the other one is hosted by the silent majority, and they say that this rally is to support First Amendment rights as a whole.  Now, these will be monitored by MPD and the National Park Police. ",

            "text": "So we have two events being held lawfully that have permits for the city.  They told them that they were coming.  Now, a day before the event, President Donald Trump wrote this.  I will be speaking at the Save America rally tomorrow on the Ellipse.  at 11 a.m.  Eastern.  Arrive early, doors open at 7, big crowds.  He said that on January 5th.  So let's stop here and go back to what police knew.  Well, we knew we had a permanent event, a rally to support President Trump.  And now we know the president is going to be speaking at that event.  We know that when the President generally speaks at these rallies, you have tens of thousands of people who show up to support him.  We also know that this is the last hurrah.  If the President loses on January 6th at the Electoral College, his presidency is essentially over.  Joe Biden would then officially become president-elect.  Now, we know there's going to be objections and stuff, but no one is fooling themselves.  Joe Biden is going to be president after that day.  Now, first, let's talk about what police usually do when you have a big rally that's about to happen and people are excited and upset about political events.  For instance, like a Black Lives Matter rally.  These are pictures of how police were prepared for a Black Lives Matter rally.  As you can see here, everybody's in riot gear.  You have a huge number of police.  Now, this type of planning and preparation by police was done ahead of time.  And since we're talking about the federal government, it's not like resources are a problem.  They can call in as many people as they want.  They have the money.  They are the feds.  So this is the type of response you would expect.  if you're having a rally that you know is very politically charged in nature and that could get violent.  But that is our first question.  Was this a surprise to the Capitol Police?  Did they believe that this could get violent?  What did they know ahead of time?  Well, this is where I turn to the news media.  Now one of the more interesting pieces of law enforcement is that now there has to be this intelligence apparatus attached to law enforcement.  when you know you have a group who is bent on coming to an event and maybe causing trouble, you want to go online to see what they are talking about, the online chatter, how they are describing the event, if they are planning anything, and what those plans may be.  Now, sometimes you can't get a roadmap to exactly what they are going to do, but sometimes you can.  So let's see if these groups that were planning any of this stuff laid out their plans online and whether police were tipped off to them.  Well, first let's go to the Washington Post.  A day before the event, the Washington Post, this article said, one day's protest can get ugly, but officials should be able to handle it without armed forces, meaning the military.  In that article, it says more than 500 Capitol Police will protect the building.  But the situation could be inflamed by pro-Trump members of Congress emerge to make inflammatory speeches.  Officials warn that if protesters, quote, storm the Capitol, as some have pledged, they will be arrested.  So we see here that Capitol Police know that there are some plans to storm the Capitol.  And they have pledged to arrest people if they plan to do it.  And they're confident they can stop any such assault.  Washington Post, again, a day before.  Pro-Trump forums erupt with violent threats ahead of Wednesday's rally against the 2020 election.  Now here you see protesters talking about what weapons to bring, how to stay concealed.  Here you see more of the planning.  Post saying that protesters should be armed with a rifle, handgun, two knives, and as much ammo as they can carry.  You can see this.  good luck, Patriots.  The eyes are rolled upon you now.  Now, again, this is the Washington Post doing simple research, looking online, seeing what these right-wing extremist groups do.  But now you can also make the point that, hey, just because some people are saying this online doesn't mean it's going to actualize.  How do you know this threat is serious?  How do you know this is a credible threat?  Well, it seems like the D.C.  mayor took it seriously because the D.C.  mayor calls in the National Guard ahead of these protests.  And in another article, the news media actually went online and showcased all of the plans, everything that these groups were saying, everything that these groups were doing, and how they were going to do it.  It was an astonishing piece of journalism that these news media organizations can go and to literally lay out the plans for the storming of the Capitol event.  And this local newspaper, the Washingtonian, They actually made fun of the plot, MAGA genius' plot to take over the U.S.  Capitol.  In this article, they talk about how on all these pro-Trump websites and blogs that protesters have discussed ways they may occupy and storm the U.S.  Capitol and make citizens the rest of lawmakers who hold old-fashioned views like honoring state-certified elections.  Again, they are mocking these insurrectionists who are planning to storm the building.  They're mocking their plans.  They even told the Capitol Police, hey, look, we found these plans.  We found these maps, right?  This is what they're talking about.  They're talking about storming your building.  And the Capitol Police spokesperson declined to comment on MAGAFAN's what they called thought experiments.  Quote, while we do not discuss the means, methods, and specific resources used to carry out our protective responsibility, the U.S.  Capitol Police has a comprehensive security plan in place and will continuously monitor and access new and emerging threats with the overall goal of keeping those within the Capitol complex safe and secure.  So now, just to be clear, The U.S.  Capitol Police have the exact plans that these people are going to use to attack the building.  And at this point, you think, well, how specific are these plans?  Are they saying we're just going to attack the building?  Well, on these pro-Trump websites, they go into pretty good detail.  They have maps.  They have charts.  They also say this.  They talk about the Capitol complex system of pedestrian tunnels originally built to protect delicate lawmakers from Washington weather.  In one discussion titled, If We Occupy the Capitol Building, there will be no vote.  Again, that's the plan, to occupy the Capitol building so there won't be a vote.  For instance, commenters bat around the idea while taking into consideration the doors were built like castle walls, barricades, and law enforcement.  Here it also talks about how the tunnels were a big discussion, about how to get through the tunnel complex.  They were even sharing maps of the tunnel complex in the Capitol building.  in the news media went through painstaking detail.  You would think the Capitol Police would have been able to both stop this event and repel any type of storming of the Capitol.  They knew it was coming.  And they knew how it was coming.  So in the aftermath, the US Capitol Police chief resigned.  And so did the chief law enforcement officer of the Senate, the sergeant of arms.  They're supposed to protect the Senate and the building.  Now, again, I don't want to delve into the realm of conspiracy theorists.  I think with the evidence that we have in front of us, this was a planned assault on the Capitol.  This was a planned insurrection.  They wanted to forcibly stop Congress from certifying the vote.  That technically is domestic terrorism.  I don't think you can get around that.  Now, for those people who stood outside and who watched the events and who went to a rally that was permitted by the city, you can't say that those people were going to an insurrection or going to planned domestic terror.  Those people were there at an event.  And I'll even say this.  Some of the people who actually went into the building probably just were going with the flow.  You even see protesters taking selfies with cops.  And in some places, even the Capitol Police let them in the building, which, again, makes you think that something here seems to be off.  Something just does not seem right.  Understanding the information that I just showed you, the information that they knew was going to happen, the fact that it was even mocked in the media, that people were even planning to do this.  Just something just doesn't seem right here.  I'm sorry, just something just doesn't seem right.  Now, some people are making the comparison that the treatment of the Black Lives Matter protests when they came to Washington and heavy security, as you can see from the pictures, versus the police preparation for this event.  But I do think there is a question here on perception.  Maybe the local law enforcement and the Capitol Police got wrapped up in a perception, because the perception is that Black Lives Matter rallies are these violent insurrections that are going to come and try to take over government buildings, where 93% of Black Lives Matter rallies have been peaceful and have been nonviolent.  As a matter of fact, they call them overwhelmingly peaceful.  So you do have a small percentage that are violent.  Just look at Portland, for instance.  But the vast majority of them, and I mean the vast majority of them, 93%, have been peaceful.  And the same for Trump rallies.  The vast majority of them have been peaceful events.  So I am going to ask you in the comment section, what do you think the disparity is?  Why do you think the Capitol Police would be so prepared for Black Lives Matter in the sense of, you know, with riot gear, with thousands of officers to protect the Capitol and protect their assets, but when it came to this Trump rally where they knew what was going to happen, they had the plans of them storming the building, they know what the soft targets were and what they thought they were going to do.  And they knew how they were going to take over the building.  These people said, this is what we're going to do.  Police said, we know what they're going to do.  And the news media laughed at the attempt.  And then they actually did it.  What do you think about that?  I honestly want to know, because I'm really conflicted.  And I know, I put this, I promoted this, as was Trump's setup.  And the reason why I'm saying that is that yesterday, drinking my coffee in the morning, I thought, this is just something weird.  It's just so convenient that all of this stuff happened at this time, right?  Trump loses the election.  Then you have protesters that you know are coming.  You have cops who are letting them in the building.  You have cops taking selfies with them.  You have cops who are not in riot gear but bicycle, you know, these are bicycle cops.  That's a bicycle helmet this guy's wearing.  When these things happen, It's now just, you know, he incited violence, these people were bad, throw him out of office, he's being impeached a second time, he's been thrown off all social media.  But those things don't happen if the storming of the Capitol is prevented, right?  Let's just be clear.  If the storming of the Capitol is prevented, then none of those other ancillary things happen.  So the question to you is, with the information that you now know, do you think the storming of the Capitol was preventable?  And to which percentage?  Do you think it was 100% preventable?  Or do you think the Capitol Police couldn't have done anything?
