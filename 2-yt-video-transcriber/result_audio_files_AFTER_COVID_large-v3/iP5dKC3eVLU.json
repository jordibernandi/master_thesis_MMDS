Tomorrow's not promised to us, so tomorrow doesn't count.  Today does.  But you know what that also means?  Today is a day we can acquire what we need from the Lord.  If he said tomorrow's promised to no man, right?  And whatever he has for us, he has for us right now, today, not tomorrow.  And that's an awesome thought.  And I live my life that way because I have to be careful not to get caught up in the many things that I know about.  Because even if I'm not careful, you can be lost in some of these things.  that you see and are exposed to.  But I'm grateful because I have this day.  And today is the only day that a person truly has.  Yesterday is gone.  Tomorrow does not exist, which leaves today.  Today is the only day we have.  And if a person should pass today, Pastor Paul, then where they are right now is all they have. ",

I mean, truly, truly amen to that.  Mike, we want to also, besides the coronavirus, we got to talk about incoming asteroids and debris fields.  April 29th, NASA has now told us we definitely have a 144-foot-wide asteroid that's going to enter into our atmosphere.  um earth's orbit it's it's making its way around the sun.  it will it'll come around the sun at some point and on april 29th it will near miss the earth now.  they originally told us three months ago that it was going to miss us by six million miles so i didn't even care about it.  Now they've recalculated due to the speed of this asteroid and its debris field, it is scheduled to miss the Earth by only 584,000 miles.  That is a huge difference.  So NASA is saying, look, we've got a little warning here.  I'm not going to say it's going to hit us, but then again, there's debris with it.  so my question to you you've been talking about May 12th is a telling date.  you've been talking about the debris and fireballs and that we're gonna start seeing more and more of this.  is there in any info here on this April 12th?  I mean this April 29th date or besides that? ",

Which means now these clusters, they appear to be one big foggy object by optics in the distance when they're far away.  As they get closer, each element in that cluster is defined as a bunch of rocks, right? ",

Per their array system, how they see space, they can see the smallest details in space, but they can only cover a certain percentage of the sky and focus on that point.  Normally what happens is when they're focused on one point, they notice something at a different point, right?  Now, if they did this all day, they would never have a report on anything.  They would just be overwhelmed with information.  So when they give you this, when they give you these objects, And they say, oh, it's 6 million miles apart, right?  People should take note that, wait a minute, don't focus on the object so much, right?  But focus, when they say that word debris, when they start changing trajectories and they give some excuse for their calculations being off or so on and so forth, that means they're dealing with costers.  And so as they get closer, they can find each object in that cluster, giving some better data in there.  We're dealing with clusters inbound.  I mean, many clusters inbound and the frequency of these things.  is going to be such that they'll become quite, they'll be worse than coronaviruses.  Now, you know how everybody fears the coronavirus.  They didn't quite know how to react to it.  We're going to have to entertain something similar to that with this inbound debris.  We're going to have to deal with fires.  We're going to have to deal with the idea that anything on Earth within a certain portion of the hemisphere can be hit.  And these are going to be very uncomfortable days.  Sure, we can get through them, but we're going to experience these things, clusters after cluster, you know.  but they're on the way and this is just one element of a lot a lot of those clusters coming.

Any time they start talking about something passing close, people should take note that when a rock is like that in these days, it's not traveling by itself.  It's traveling with debris around it.  That debris could be from one mile, right, to one million miles.  That's how far the debris can be.  So this planet, this not planet, but this planet, element is passing six seven hundred thousand miles away from the earth.  right this uh that could be.  it's debris can be a million miles out or dead center to earth.  so chances are the closer it is like that.  um we're gonna catch some sort of debris from this thing.  we're gonna have some effects from this thing but that's not the only one.  that's the only one being reported but it's not the only one.  and i'll say this if something were they would tell anybody about it.  they would divert and point your attention to something else that you would look at something else.  while they prepared uh to protect themselves to get themselves underground or or in protected areas they would not announce to the public that an asteroid is about to hit.  that would be ludicrous.  people can barely contain themselves with news.  They have to wash the language when they talk about the virus because of the fear factor involved.  I mean, for crying out loud, everybody went out and bought up all the toilet paper when they heard about the coronavirus.  What would they do if they found out about an impact? ",
