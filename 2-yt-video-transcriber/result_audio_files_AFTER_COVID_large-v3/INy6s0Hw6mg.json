            "text": "their honours.  Well, I think it's working.  We're raising awareness of this subject, of what's going on on the channel, and the consequences of all these people arriving.  YouGov poll out this morning showing 73% of people are concerned, or very concerned, about people coming to the UK across the channel.  Interestingly, amongst Conservative voters, that figure reaches 97%.  So people are aware of what's going on.  Today is day 11. of migrants coming into Dover.  That's a record for continuous days.  Looks like since last Tuesday, Wednesday, about 1,000 people perhaps, although the Home Office are very reluctant now to give us any daily figures whatsoever.  Leading the charge for the government in terms of criticism of all of this is, of course, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel.  She has said what is happening in the Channel isn't just unacceptable, she said that it's shameful.  She, earlier this week, announcing that the big RAF plane would be at Machal, that the Royal Navy was being called in.  She's appointed a new guy, a former Royal Marine, to take charge of the whole thing.  He's head of clandestine operations.  And yet, every day, we're seeing these little dinghies landing on our beaches in Kent.  They're getting all the way through some of them.  But what may cause pretty much a problem... isn't just that the tough talk is leading to, at the moment, no action and no change at all.  But I think she may be about to get some criticism from her own constituents.  I'm here in Essex today.  We're in the Witham constituency, which, of course, is Priti Patel's constituency in Parliament.  And I was given a tip-off overnight that the Rivenhall Hotel here a hotel that had been closed during COVID, but on its website announced it was reopening on the 3rd of August.  And yet, earlier on, I tried to book a room.  They're full.  not full just for now, they're full for the rest of the year.  So what it looks like is not just the Midlands and the North anymore, but because the sheer volume of people we're having to accommodate, increasingly it looks like hotels in the southern part of England are also filling up.  And this one appears to be in Priti Patel's own constituency.  If we're about to find out that that is correct, if we do find out that is correct, she's going to have some real questions, I suspect, to answer to her own constituents, because this could prove a massive embarrassment for the Home Secretary.  And there we are, the Riven Hall Hotel.  Non-residents welcome.  Yeah, go on.  OK, so the hotel is full.  But you can see there's a lot of people here.  An awful lot of people here.  There's a manager.  He spotted me.  Hello.  You all right?  Good, good.  We were told it was closed.  It looks full.  Can we get in?  There's nobody about.  Hello.  Hello.  So you reopened on the 3rd of August.  Well, your website says you reopened on the 3rd.  Yes, sir.  But you're now completely full.  Yes, sir.  When's the earliest available room?  At the moment, the end of the month.  Next month.  The end of next month?  End of September.  OK.  All right.  Well, we'll try and book then.  OK.  I'm going to go online right now and have a go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They're expecting us, aren't they?  Yeah, they've cleared them out.  Come on, we're going to go.  Yeah, I know, but they're on us.  It's private property, boss.  Please leave.  Please, because it's private property.  Thank you.  Well, the management there were not very pleased to see us, were they?  The chap ushering us out and slamming the door.  And I just asked, you know, when was the next available date?  She said after the end of September.  So I've had a go here.  And the Rivenhall Hotel website says, sorry, we don't know when this property is available next.  So, you know, not only are they told not to talk to us, but when they do talk to us, they're not telling us the truth.  And yeah, I really did think to begin with it was the Midlands and the North because that was where all the information came in from, from the public.  And now we can see it's now happening in Leafy, Essex, in Pretty Patel, the Home Secretary's own constituency.  The person has been the most vocal and the most critical of what is going on in the English Channel.  And yet here it is on her doorstep, but more significantly on her constituents' doorstep.  So we'll now go out and try and talk to one or two of them.  Now this hotel has been filled up very, very recently and so not many residents here in Whittam know about it.  But I found a man who does know about it.  Mark, when did you find out about this? ",

You know, I think once this gets out here in Wissam and all the villages around, I think she's going to have some real pressure on her.  Oh, definitely, yeah.  I really do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.  Well, once again, our investigation has shown that members of the public are telling us the truth when they send in their emails.  So please, please, please keep sending in your stories.  This one, I think, has got a bit more significance because it is Priti Patel's own constituency.  I'm absolutely certain many of her constituents will not be happy about this at all.  I'm doing my best to get the truth out, to get a proper debate going in this country.  So please, please share this video. ",
