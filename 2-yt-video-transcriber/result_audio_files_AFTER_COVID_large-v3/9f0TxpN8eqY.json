There was no evidence that I owned a dog or that one was off leash that I was responsible for, but it took six Santa Clara County law enforcement officers and an hour and a half to give me that violation.  And when I signed the ticket, many of you thought that was a fail.  It wasn't a fail, because now it means that we're going to go to court, and that I'm going to have to represent myself just as I had to do in family court.  But now I know how to subpoena for the police reports, the body cams, the calls for service, the radio, the training, and the licenses of all the people involved, including the attorneys.  and I have a right to subpoena attorneys, sheriffs, and even judges if I need to.  And one of the people that I'm going to subpoena is Deputy Oliveri, who happened to be a bailiff in my family court case before Judge Towery.  He was also present at a holiday luncheon, where I'm aware that a number of false police reports were written, and he was the deputy who sent other Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies to into the court file room on the day that my hand was broken, and these were the events that took place.

So how then did we get the audio on the video that you just saw?  the answer would be that when deputy gomez broke my hand and illegally seized my phone he also turned on my phone and he was the one that made that illegal recording.  and yet when i went to internal affairs about that issue they did nothing and said he was not at fault.  the district attorney then decided to prosecute me for recording the police and he's been prosecuting me for three years for violating a single court rule that i was never served and that i didn't know existed on this day.  So if you're asking yourself, how can this be?  This is the kind of stuff that goes on in family court every day, but we don't have cameras watching.  Deputy Oliveri did spend over four years watching my divorce hearing.  He watched the lawyers talk about me when I didn't have a lawyer myself.  And he also heard the testimony of a real estate agent by the name of Patty Felice, who testified that she was a licensed agent from Montero Real Estate.  When it turns out, after I posted a video about her, we discovered that she probably didn't have a license when she told the court that she did.  And when Attorney Bradford Baugh wrote all the declarations for her to sell my homes and have me evicted from them as well. ",

I heard something about.  you're going to make an apology or something.  I am.  What's your name?  Deputy Spade.  And what's your badge number?  1907.  I want you to give this message to Deputy Oliveri.  Okay.  Will you tell Deputy Alvarez this for me?  Will you tell him that I apologize, that he was falsely accused of some things that was actually the responsibility of a realtor who did not have her license by the name of Patty Felice?  And I'm gonna explain it more.  but i know deputy oliveri he's been the bailiff in my courtroom for a long time and so was his wife.  they showed me their wedding pictures and their friend who was a bridesmaid was actually in my house one time.  and i know you guys are good guys and i don't want anyone to ever say that i said otherwise about deputy oliveri.  okay okay my name is susan bassi.

Hi Jerry, this is Susan Bassey, and I came into your office today.  I'm a former client.  I'm also the former publisher of My Out and About magazine, and I'm migrating from print to a visual journalism magazine.  And I also am investigating some issues related to some real estate with Intero that I had personal dealings with.  And previously I purchased a home at 16498 Los Gatos Almaden Road in Los Gatos.  My agent was Tracy Pena.  I now understand she is with Colwell Banker.  And she, for that purchase, gave a referral fee to Patty Felice of the Morgan Hill Intero office.  And I can't find any paperwork on that, and I understood that that would be on the seller's paperwork, but there should be something related to that referral fee and that your office did the appropriate paperwork.  We are investigating whether or not Ms.  Felice had an active Intero broker associate's license at that time. ",

But I want to remind you that it was a lawyer at the beginning and the end of this video who didn't appear to know the law about recording in public.  and his attitude about being recorded in public and how he viewed that as harassment is very indicative of how lawyers behave in family court where they make a lot of money.  and i also want to let you know that i'm going to work very hard in this traffic court case to show you exactly what we need to do to get a fair hearing Because I want to make sure at the end of the day, if Patty Felice is found to have engaged in criminal conduct by not having a license and committing perjury and filing false documents, as well as obstructing justice in a divorce case, that she is assured every possibility of due process and a fair hearing.  Because I want to make sure that if she's ever convicted by a jury, that that conviction stands. ",
