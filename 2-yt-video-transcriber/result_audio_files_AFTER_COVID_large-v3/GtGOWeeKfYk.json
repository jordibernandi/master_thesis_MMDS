            "text": "Dancing is the closest thing to having sex with a woman, except for cuddling, but who wants to cuddle nowadays?  It's more like scoot your ass over here so my dick can poke you.  A lot of women nowadays look at how you dance and compare that to how sex is going to be with you.  Yeah, some of you city boys who don't belong at the honky tonks knew that.  You'd stop acting like you're having a seizure on the dance floor with whoever you're dancing with.  So in this video, I'm going to teach you how to dance like you halfway know what you're doing so you can get laid every time you go to a honky tonk or rodeo or a mud bog or a wedding or your friend's sister's bar mitzvah.  Number one, make sure she's halfway good looking.  Yeah, I know they make the lighting in these honky tonks darker than your morning coffee, but why do you think they made flashlights on your phones?  Use that shit.  How you doing, my name's Dan.  Hi Dan, I'm Sequisha.  Good to meet you, Sequisha.  Hang on one sec.  Okay, we're good.  All right, let's go dance.  You know the reason why they make it so dark in there is so all the fat chicks have a chance, but you don't need to wake up next to one of them.  Do your due diligence, use the flashlight on your phone, and shine it in their face like it's a beam of light coming down from Jesus.  Here to explain.  the second one is Ruff Bodon from the other Heavy Duty Country channel.  Drop.  What the hell are you wearing, man?  Subscribe to my fucking channel.  It's not that hard, it's right up there.  Before I start, I'd just like to make it a point.  That I think all women should wear stuff like this at the bar.  You know what I mean?  Free the nipples.  Number two, this isn't high school anymore.  Where all the guys sit on one side of the bar and all the girls sit on the other side like there's a damn Red Sea in the middle of it.  Pull your balls out of your ass.  Go over there and ask one of them to dance with you or tell them.  better yet look i know the only women that you talk to in your life is your mom your sister and your co-worker that works with you at water burger.  but you can't keep rubbing up to your sister your whole life.  you'll do prison time trust me.  i know did about 16 years back in 98 got out five years ago been slaying it ever since though You better be fixing to get out of your turtle shell, throw out the tighty-whities, and grab the sluttiest woman at the dance hall.  I don't care what women say.  If you're dressed like you need a dick in you, that's probably what you're thinking.  Oh, oh, you... Okay, you've got a boyfriend.  Well, he's probably got no dick game because you're over there deep-throating your straw on your drink while you're looking up at me.  Reminds me of my third wife, Debra.  Could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.  Yeah, this old man's still got game, even dressed like this.  Still got the morning stew on it.  Number three, if you don't know how to dance, go up to a guy in the bar who looks like he knows what he's doing and ask for help.  Look, in most parts of life, winging it can work pretty well.  Dancing is not one of them.  Why do you think there are so many families out there who have surprise babies?  Because the guy was like, fuck it, I don't need a condom this time.  Two-stepping is pretty simple, but you need to be smooth, just like the gentle curve of this woman's ass is.  So stop dancing like your chicken in the yard.  got into your pre-work powder and learn a few things.  It's two steps to the left, one to the right.  Kind of like a dick in the V and sometimes the B. Do you like anal?  What?  Like, anal?  Yeah, I'm here for a good time and a long time.  Are you okay?  Your heart's racing.  Yeah, I'm okay.  I just got the boner.  Number four, drop the serious attitude and act like you're having some fun.  Look, man, I know you lift every day, wear grunt-style t-shirts, and look like the Hulk with SpongeBob legs, but the only thing you're attracting when you look like you want to kill someone at the bar is that gay security guard over there.  Women like a man who's smiling and having a good time.  Why?  Because women go out to have a good time and sometimes for cocaine.  You got something.  Oh boy.  So if you look like you're having a good time, most likely girls are gonna wanna flock towards you and have a good time with you and dance with you and hopefully by the end of the night bury their face in your $5 foot long with extra ranch dressing.  Number five, leave the pool tables and the darts alone.  What is the goal of going out?  To get laid.  And guess what?  Chicks don't give a fuck about pool or darts.  unless it's a Monday night and she wants a guy to see how far he can stick his pool cue up her ass.  How far do you think we can get this thing in?  In where?  It's Monday.  Let's get weird.  So play that shit on your own time.  Right now, it's get your ass in the game and take one of those milfs home time.  Thank you for watching my video.  Subscribe, like, enjoy.  So here's what I want you to do.  I want you to go under these and just shake them.  I didn't see you, but yeah.  Hi, I'm Dan.  Hi.  Hi, my name's Dan.  I don't know why I said my name like that.  Do you like anal?  Do you not anal?  Anal?  Do you not... I mean, I'm here for a good time, not a long time, so... Flip your hair again.  That's perfect, and then... Yeah, we need that one.  We need that one for like anal.  What?  I don't know how else to say it.  Are you okay?  Your heart started racing.  Yeah, I have a boner.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Side piece on my head in case it gets heavy.  Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names.  John Wayne. ",
