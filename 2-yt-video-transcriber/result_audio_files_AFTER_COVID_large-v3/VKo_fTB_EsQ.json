            "text": "What the hell was that all about, right?  Holy shit, I don't know how to feel.  Because on the one hand, the violent insurrection attempted by the worst our nation's basements have to offer was a nigh comical farce and abject failure.  But on the other hand, They attempted a goddamn violent insurrection.  What the fuck?  Yes, yesterday, legions of our dimmest and mayonnaise-iest citizens stormed the Capitol in D.C.  And they got all the way in because Capitol Police put up very little resistance.  Yeah, it's almost starting to seem like there's a double standard in this country where law enforcement is concerned.  Yeah, if you're a black man, you better stay out of trouble in high school and keep your goddamn hands out of your pockets.  You're basically begging to get shot in public.  But if you're an Indiana neckbeard draped in a snake flag and some ninji stars from the mall, well, welcome to Congress, sir.  Come right on in.  No, shit in any chamber you want.  It's fine.  I'll see you on the internet later.  What a fucking disgrace.  Not that anyone was surprised by that, of course, least of all the insurgents.  You could just tell they had every expectation of showing up, doing whatever the hell they wanted.  Complete entitlement.  Like, for example, Elizabeth from Knoxville.  I was just trying to storm the Capitol building as part of a violent revolution, and they were so mean to me.  Like, yeah, no shit, you fucking fence post.  That's how it works.  It's like my mama always said, play stupid games, get maced in the fucking eyeballs, you dumb bitch.  I hope Elizabeth realizes it could have been a lot worse.  Another woman got shot in the neck and died.  Fun fact, one of the only things I have in common with President Trump is that I, too, have already forgotten her name because I didn't give a shit about what happened to her in the first place.  I hope it was worth it, lady.  Not that Trump was absent from all this, though.  Of course not.  He stoked the fires to begin with.  He refused to call in the National Guard.  He even went so far as to tell these idiots that he, quote, loves them and thinks they're very special.  Meanwhile, Eric Trump's in the back like, I thought you didn't know those words.  I hope that little message from Daddy is enough to sustain them because they didn't accomplish shit else yesterday.  You know, that's the one constant source of reassurance we have.  Their dogged devotion to being completely... utterly incompetent.  They were in the goddamn Capitol building for three hours and all they got to show for it is a body count on their side and some proof of felony selfies.  It was the classic dog catches car moment.  They had no fucking clue what to do with it when they did.  They're just like, I don't know.  I didn't expect to get this far.  Did you expect to get this far?  I don't know.  Show that old paint in your dick or something.  I don't know.  They have no plan.  They have no organization.  They don't even know what the fuck they want.  But don't get me wrong, they should be held accountable.  Of course, them and every spineless Republican politician who helped to initiate this edition of treason for dummies yesterday.  Some of them have changed their stance on it after the assault happened.  It's funny how Republicans can do a complete 180 on the issue whenever it affects them personally for the very first time.  Wish we could, like, shoot them with a gay minority poverty ray or something and make them be less shitty about all the other things in the world, but whatever.  I guess I'll take it.  I'll take it because it's all we're going to get right now, and we know it, all right?  Trump, Cruz, Hawley, and all the sentient goatees who participated yesterday should be held accountable, but I'll believe that shit when I see it.  And either way, those of us still on the side of sanity need to do two things.  Number one, make it through a couple more weeks.  Number two, start treating these Trumpers like the terrorists they are.  Never forget the bullshit they pulled and do everything in our power to ensure they can't win.  Love y'all.  We're going to be okay. ",
