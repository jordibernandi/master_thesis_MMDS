            "text": "Can I ask you something tricky?  In this scene, does consent exist?  Here we have Joy, a holographic girlfriend programmed to love you, but who cannot touch you, and Mariette, a replicant sex worker programmed to fuck you, but who has no strong feelings about it.  Put them together, and you have almost an entire lover.  Now, I imagine the value of a replicant sex worker is the same as with any automation.  A mechanized warehouse never takes a bathroom break, a self-driving rideshare won't refuse you service for acting inappropriately, and an automated sex worker never turns down a john.  Or maybe she can.  It's unclear.  Part of the premise of Blade Runner 2049 is that modern replicants don't break the rules.  I don't retire my own kind because we don't run.  And yet the movie is full of replicants breaking the rules.  They have some latitude.  But the whole reason synthetic laborers exist is because, though the rules may be bent or broken, they constrain replicants in ways they do not constrain humans.  Mariette is told by her Madame to go home with Joe and plant a tracker on him.  that will become important later in the movie.  So maybe she can say no to Joe?  But can she say no to Madame?  Both are open questions.  And then there's Joy.  Joy loves her man with all her heart, because that's what she's built to do.  She is an operating system whose primary function is to love the user.  She has no choice in the matter.  But then, who does?  None of us decide whom we fall in love with.  That is something everyone who's ever lived has shared with Joy.  The difference between her and us is, in Joy's case, someone else decided for her.  So I ask again, can either of these women consent?  Or was consent granted on their behalf the moment they came into existence?  Now, say Mariette can't say no.  How different is she, really, from a human sex worker who goes home with a John she'd rather turn down, or, for that matter, an office worker who goes to work when she should be taking a sick day, because it's a lean month and she needs the money?  That ain't trafficking.  It's just capitalism.  The Amazon worker who pees in a bottle, the Lyft driver who doesn't kick you out for being a creep, they live by the same law.  Give your employers as good as an automaton would, or maybe don't get paid.  And do what we say or don't eat is technically a choice, but I wouldn't call it agency.  And did any of us consent to this system?  Or was consent granted on our behalf when we were born into it?  I think about agency a lot at the movies, because all the screenwriting and story structure books stressed that agency is the line that divides subject from object.  There are a few ways a story communicates who the point of view characters are.  Whose eyes does the camera most often see through?  Whose perspective are the flashbacks from?  A big one is, who has plot agency?  A plot is a sequence of events.  where event one causes event two causes event three.  A chain from beginning to end connected by therefore and but.  Searching for the missing child of a replicant woman, Joe finds a date carved on the tree where she was buried after dying in childbirth.  Therefore, he searches the birth records for that date and finds anomalous entries.  Therefore, he goes to the orphanage where the anomalous child was sent.  But the orphanage's data for that year is missing.  Therefore, he investigates the premises and finds a hidden toy with the date carved on it.  which he has a memory of having hidden himself.  But replicant memories are usually artificial, so it might be an implant.  Therefore, he meets with the woman who designs artificial memories.  But she says the memory is real.  Therefore, he concludes that he is the missing child.  and so on.  The things Joe does in one event are causal to the events that follow.  Had he done something different, the story would have gone someplace else.  The plot bends around the actions he takes, which means this is, in part, his story.  That makes him a subject.  Joy has her own sequence of events.  that has to do with her arc as a character, but by and large, they do not affect the overall plot.  She is there as a barometer of Joe's feelings and to say out loud what he's thinking.  The one pairing of therefore and but she can lay claim to is she invites Mariette into the apartment.  Therefore, Mariette plants the tracker on Joe.  Later, Joe is left to die in Las Vegas, but the Replicant Freedom Force saves him by following the signal.  It is the only time where had Joy done something different, it would change the shape of the narrative.  And it's an accident.  She dies not knowing she's done it.  The plot acts on her without her acting on it.  She's part of the story, but it belongs to someone else.  That makes her an object.  All stories have and need subjects and objects.  But the tendency for subjects to be men, with women serving in largely reactive or thematic roles, is a thing to be questioned.  And the tendency for these women to be young, sexy, and sometimes naked often bridges the gap from object to objectified.  In truth, of all the central characters, you could most easily write joy out of the script without seriously changing the story.  But that would be a far inferior movie, because Blade Runner 2049 is less plot-driven than driven by ideas.  And joy is everything the film is about.  Beyond being a narrative or sexual object, joy is a literal object.  The biggest decision she makes is to accompany Joe on his journey, staying by her man's side and keeping him safe despite the risk, because she loves him.  And yes, her love exists solely because it makes a few dollars for someone neither will ever meet, and they both know this.  But that makes it no less real.  She dies for that love, stamped out in an act of petty cruelty, and, in dying, encapsulates the Replicant Uprising's philosophy before it's even uttered.  Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.  This is what the film has to say about living in a world that gives you few options.  The only real choice she ever had was when and how she would die, and on whose terms.  That may seem like a lot of symbolic heft to put on a character who is, no matter how you slice it, yet another powerless woman whose tragic death makes a man's story more interesting.  And I'm with you in that.  Given the preponderance of women in this movie with nothing to do except die dramatically to underline a sentence, and the Blade Runner franchise's already dubious notions of consent and female agency, I can't argue that Joy is a brilliant subversion who escapes the baggage of her tropes.  But I still feel this... ambivalence.  Conventional wisdom is that objects can be likable, admirable, but not relatable.  They are viewed from without.  Real empathy is reserved for characters with agency.  And since agency has historically been so unevenly distributed between genders, there's this reflex to treat it as an absolute good, to see a female character who lacks agency as prima facie bad writing.  But as an elder millennial with no money in a broken democracy with a pitiless economy on a dying rock in space, I feel agency is in short supply.  And I know there are lots of people in this world with far less than I have, and I hate to think that makes us all unfit to be protagonists.  I am so rarely the thing that acts, rather than the thing that is acted on.  Joy speaks to me more than anyone else in the movie.  Characters who direct the stories of their lives make for great wish fulfillment, but sometimes I think that makes them less relatable.  I don't know that that makes the screenwriter's treatment of joy defensible, but it is, perhaps, revealing?  And maybe it's worth questioning why agency should be the gold standard for relatability.  Because if we can't relate to characters with little control over their lives, how could we ever tell stories about capitalism?  Thank you. ",
