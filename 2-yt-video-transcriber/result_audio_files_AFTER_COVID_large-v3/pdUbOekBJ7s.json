First, Biden is looking off to the side, waiting for someone to signal him.  Then he puts his hand on the mask as if he's not sure he's supposed to take it off yet.  He then tries to smoothly remove the mask with one hand, but it gets snagged on his ear, and then he has to use both hands.  Womp womp.  And they couldn't redo it because for some reason they just had to make this an exclusive.  now this news live stream instead of a simple pre-recorded address.  And this begs the question, what are they going to make Biden do for the next video?  I'm guessing they'll make him wear both a mask and sunglasses.  And then there's the pen.  Why does he have a pen in his hand?  He's reading a speech off a teleprompter.  He doesn't need to be holding a pen.  It's not like he's taking notes.  On top of that, he's forced to hold onto the mask and pen for the entire video.  Maybe the logic here is that by holding a mask and pen, it'll make him look more presidential or something.  I don't know.  But then there are campaign videos that try to make Biden look, well, more relatable.  Like this one featuring Keegan-Michael Key of Key & Peele fam. ",
