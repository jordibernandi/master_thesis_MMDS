These corporate registration documents from Venezuela show the Venezuelan government owned 28% of the stock of another company they started, Bizta, which adapted voting software for the Smartmatic machines in the 2004 elections.  The same document shows a Chavez government minister, Omar Montillo, was on the board of directors.  The Chavez government gave Bizta, Smartmatic, and another company a $91 million contract to run voting machines for the 2004 election.  The next year, the owners of Smartmatic, primarily owned by Venezuelan businessmen, bought Sequoia, one of the top electronic voting system companies in the United States, for sixteen million dollars.  Smartmatic is a labyrinth of international holding companies owned by Venezuelan businessmen.  Smartmatic Group NV of Cura\u00e7ao, Netherlands and Tilly's owns Smartmatic International BV of Amsterdam, Netherlands, owns Smartmatic Corporation of Florida, which bought Sequoia Voting Systems of California, USA.  When Smartmatic bought the US voting machine companies, the US government did not review the sale.  Many experts say those voting machines were manipulated in Venezuela to give President Hugo Chavez a victory. ",

They can't survive it.  Here's the truth from my view is that bogus reporting has gone all the way back to the days of Gilgamesh on the Epic of Gilgamesh and further back than that, the days of Nimrod, the Tower of Babel.  I'm praying and I ask you to pray with me that all of this gets sorted out.  I'm also praying for this election in Georgia.  Pray with me.  All of you in Georgia, go out and vote.  Your country is on the line.  In the meantime, you can come over to God in a nutshell where we have got entire streams at this point, lots of documentaries on all sorts of cool stuff to take your mind.  I think you know what went on in this election.  Even CNN knows what went on in this election.  They did the reporting on it.  Over at Gordon and I Show, we have whole streams of films for you to watch immediately, pre-flood.  I'm working on the film Exodus and the film Nimrod.  I'm hoping and I believe that just like the books, that they'll be the best in the world.  They'll be the best in the world because of God in a nutshell.  There's stuff over there that you can trust from reliable sources.  I'm Trey Smith of God in a nutshell.  God bless every last one of you and your families on the other side of the screen. ",
