Which is why Sean Hannity seemed woefully unprepared when the Shark Tank star began systematically debunking his talking points.  All Hannity can do throughout this entire segment is bounce from one Trump talking point to the next, only to see every single one discredited by Mark Cuban.  He claims that Obama had a higher deficit than every single one of his predecessors without acknowledging that Trump has had an even higher deficit than Obama.  When Cuban brings that up, Hannity says, Yeah, well Trump had a pandemic to contend with.  Without acknowledging that the disastrous effects of this pandemic were Donald Trump's fault.  The reason we're not reopened like South Korea and Germany and Canada and Australia and New Zealand is because our government didn't take any steps to stop it.  So it's not that the recession we're in has happened in spite of Trump, it happened because of Trump.  Kennedy even tries to claim that NATO is giving us more money because of Trump.  Just so we're clear, that's not how NATO payments work.  Getting NATO countries to pay 2% of their annual GDP doesn't mean we get the money, like Hannity's claiming, it means that those countries are spending that money on their own defense.  The problem with these right-wing talking points is that they don't even know what the things they're saying actually mean.  And nothing shows the extent to which Hannity is doing Trump's bidding as much as the fact that the guy is still, still attacking the ACA.  He's still parroting the same talking points that Republicans were spouting ten years ago.  But here's the thing.  The American people support Obamacare, and now, in 2020, it is more popular than it's ever been, with 55% of Americans in favor of the law.  Even when Mark Cuban asks him point blank what voters say with regards to the ACA, all Hannity can do is fall back on showing his screen with his tired talking points.  Because just like Donald Trump, he has only one move.  To attack Obama or any other Democrat they can point the finger at.  The truth is that it's Trump who's hellbent on dismantling Obamacare.  Why?  Because it's named after his predecessor, and he's predicated his presidency on destroying Obama's legacy.  That's it.  That's why even in the middle of a global pandemic, where 130,000 Americans have died, Trump's priority is not to expand healthcare coverage, but to rip it away from the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA.  All because he's insecure.  But the most telling moment is Cuban calling Trump out for not even being able to answer the simplest softball question.  Only days ago, Hannity posed the question to Trump, what will you do in a second term?  And all Trump could conjure up was an almost minute-long diatribe where, for some reason, he starts talking about how many times he slept over in Washington. ",

And so his goal isn't to stick to any facts, it's just to throw a bunch of spaghetti against the wall and hope that something sticks.  It's right out of the Trump playbook of just lying so much that hopefully the truth will be unrecognizable.  The only problem being that when someone is able to actually push back, then it makes it abundantly clear what a con people like Sean Hannity are running.  And luckily, it happened on his own show.
