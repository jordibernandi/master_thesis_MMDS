Also, this idiot captured This cat is a local drill rapper.  He got a whole video out there.  He kills two little teen boys.  Kills two little teen boys for absolutely nothing.  His parents cannot, their parents cannot figure out why this dude leaves a convenience store and just kill him.  One of the young boys you're gonna see, Charles Riley, he's only 16.  The other young brother is Jason Francis, 17.  This happened on the 7900 block of Luella in a South Shore neighborhood.
