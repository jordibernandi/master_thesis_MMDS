I need both hands for my air quotes, Steph.  At least the leadership of the Department of Justice, because, you know, Mike Flynn, as we all know, got caught talking dirty on the phone to the Russians, right, talking about sanctions, had no right talking about that.  lied to the vice president, lied to the FBI, walked into court, raised his right hand, took a note to tell the truth and and told Judge Emmett Sullivan, I lied to the FBI.  I knew it was a crime.  I had no defense.  I did it knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.  I knew lying to the FBI was a crime.  And judge, I am guilty and I hereby plead guilty.  And now Bill Barr and his acolyte, the lackey he installed as the acting U.S.  attorney in  D.C.,  Tim Shea, walk in and say, Judge Sullivan, disregard all that.  We don't really think he was guilty.  So we want you to give the president's man a pass.  That, Steph, is insanity. ",

You were talking about, people have asked if Judge Sullivan has any discretion regarding DOJ's attempt to kill the Flynn case.  Here's the breakdown.  DOJ can file a motion to dismiss the case, but Judge Sullivan can deny that motion, though that would be extremely unusual.  Stay tuned.  So talk to us about that.

            "text": "So here's the silver lining.  You know, we... Bill Barr is this enormous pitch black cloud hanging over the Department of Justice.  But when you file a motion to dismiss a case, particularly a case where the defendant has already pled guilty, that is the court's case.  It's not the prosecutor's case.  It doesn't belong to Bill Barr.  He has to request that Emmett Sullivan grant the motion to dismiss under Rule 48A.  Here's the thing.  Judge Abbott Sullivan has a couple of decisions to make.  He can, one, order a hearing.  And at that hearing, he can demand answers like, okay, Bill Barr or whatever representative you bring before me, why is it that at the time of Flynn's guilty plea, Flynn swore under oath, and the prosecutors told me that Flynn was guilty, that he knew he lied, that it was during an ongoing investigation, and that it was a material matter to that investigation.  It was relevant.  It really impeded the investigation.  All of that stuff was put in writing before Judge Sullivan and was signed by the prosecutors and by Mike Flynn and his attorneys.  Why Bill Barr?  Are you now filing this 20 page long motion full of garbage that says none of that stuff was accurate or true?  I mean, that's the government talking out of both sides of their mouth.  And Steph, Judge Sullivan is a lion.  and he is a legend in DC criminal justice circles, and the man is aggressively intolerant of government misconduct.  I've had cases in front of him.  My office has had cases in front of him, and he was a taskmaster in all the right ways.  He can smell BS a mile away, and I predict he is not going to shrink from this challenge.  He's not gonna go along and let the Department of Justice and Bill Barr pull this garbage.  he's going to call them to the carpet.  he's going to demand answers.  and steph he might say i deny your motion to to to tank this case.  we're going to sentencing and mike flynn you are hereby sentenced to x numbers number of months in prison.  judge solomon could do that.  the other thing he could do is he could have this long hearing.  he could rip everybody a new one.  he could grant the motion to dismiss the case but a little bit more silver lining steph.  If he grants the motion to dismiss, it will be what's called without prejudice.  What that means is in January, this dang case can be rebrought and Flynn can be prosecuted anew in the interest of justice. ",
