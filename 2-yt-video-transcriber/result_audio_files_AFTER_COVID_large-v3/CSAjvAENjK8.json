Well, the problem is, like, it might be true, but, like, the reason why we're so mixed today is because we can travel at rates that are, like, unprecedented.  So it's kind of a stupid, it's, like, a pointless thing to say.  So, like, for instance, like, no nation has ever survived that's had the internet in its country for more than 40 years.  Like, what am I supposed to do with that statement?  Like, yeah, true, I guess, but, like.  Wait, is that really true?  Probably.  I don't think the internet's existed for more than 30 years or whatever, right?  Or 20 years?  I mean, like, the ability to travel around the world.  the way that we do today, like, hasn't existed for... Too long.  Good one, dude.  So we're trying to convince people that Nick is a Nazi behind closed doors.  It looked rhetorically ineffective.  Well, to really do it, you need to, like, show clips and stuff.  Like, you need to have, like, stuff, like, on hand.  There is some website.  There's some page that, like, documents some of this.  But, like, if you can actually get him to... If you actually, like, start showing people, like, enough clips, you can do it.  Because a lot of these become, like, pretty hard to defend.  Like, taken in the totality. ",

Moreover, if you look at the soil texture, it's really not deep enough for mass cookie storage underground.  Um, and so there's a lot of things, you know, in the cookie kitchen, they say that the ovens are, uh, wooden and they have windows on them and they're not totally secure.  And the ovens that they use, they, they actually did sort of an ad hoc use of that particular kind of oven, even though they made a perfectly good design for ovens for a different purpose for delousing.
