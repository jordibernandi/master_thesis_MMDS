Now, I don't know if the YouTube algorithm is just trying to stir the pot, trying to get me back in the mix or what, but they recommended the latest video from DE Marble talking about the moon landing.  And like I said, I was bored, so I watched it.  And I'll be damned, that boy hasn't learned a damn thing over the last few years.  His video is called Why Apollo 11's Earthrise Picture is a Huge Red Flag.  And it has so many examples of flawed thinking that I don't think I can cover them all.  But let's see what he brings this time.  He starts off saying he wants to build his case in components, which sounds great.  He's going to lay out the different elements to show how they come together and prove his point.  Now, the components themselves have to be valid in order to build a valid case, so here's hoping he does it well.  The first thing he talks about is the moon and how he thinks it's kind of odd that he can zoom in with his P900 and get so much detail. ",

We're not reading license plates on the surface of the moon here.  Now, he then talks about how in a previous video, he tried to look at a couple of trees a couple miles down the road, but there was so much atmospheric distortion, the trees weren't clear.  Yet, he was able to tilt the camera up and see the moon with better detail than the trees. ",

            "text": "Again, he says he found that odd.  Even though mere seconds prior, he mentions that looking down the road, he had atmospheric distortion.  He still found it odd that looking upwards in a direction without the atmospheric distortion was different.  When I point out that globe deniers and moon landing deniers show an inability to think, this is what I mean.  Now, I have no issue with initially thinking that it was odd, but in thinking it was odd, you should then be spurred to think about it for a bit.  And if you thought about it for a little bit, you would say, okay, we have denser atmosphere at the lower levels, and My entire view was at that lower, denser atmospheric level.  The whole two miles or so is through this distortion level with more particulate and vapor and things causing distortion.  The entire length of my view.  But if I look up, then maybe the small local area of 100 feet or so has that distorted atmosphere in it.  But after that, it's clear skies and then space.  Of course, it's going to be different.  Now seeing the moon through his P900 is the first thing he brought up, and I'm genuinely wondering what that has to do with the Earthrise on the moon, because I have no idea why he brought that up.  So next he moves on to why we only see one side of the moon.  He describes tidal locking in a fairly condescending tone. ",
