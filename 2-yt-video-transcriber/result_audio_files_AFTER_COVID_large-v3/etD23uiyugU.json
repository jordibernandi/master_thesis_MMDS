            "text": "The carnivore diet's overly simple message of eat meat and drink water has sent many people in a downward spiral of health issues including weight gain, low sex drive, histamine intolerance, iron overload, insomnia, the list goes on and on.  It's unfortunate as a properly done carnivore diet will make you feel the best you ever have.  That's why I'm giving away a carnivore diet meal plan you will receive when you sign up for the newsletter on frank-tefano.com.  Maybe you felt a little better on the carnivore diet because of the removal of inflammatory foods, but you aren't experiencing the true benefits of what should be the most nutritious diet there is.  With the basis of high quality animal foods, nothing matches a properly done carnivore diet.  If you only focus on eating meat, you're ignoring macronutrients, fat to protein ratio, as well as micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids.  The meal plan has tier lists for both macronutrients and micronutrients.  For macronutrients, there is tier 1 through tier 4, depending on what foods you have access to, separated into fat and protein.  This is a very easy guideline to picking the best foods that you have access to in order to meet the optimal fat and protein amounts.  The micronutrients have tier 1 through tier 3.  Again, tier 1 is the best, but you may not have access to all of those foods.  It is separated into vitamin A, K2, and omega fatty acids.  as if you achieve these nutrients, you will be close to achieving overall nutrient density.  Most importantly, there is a summary answering common carnivore questions.  What ratios of raw, cooked, and fermented foods should you be consuming?  Is dairy beneficial on the carnivore diet?  Is it necessary for meat to supplement on this diet?  do i have to eat fish for omega-3 now?  i should probably be charging money for such clear and concise information that no one else has put together.  because of this i request that you guys share this video and recommend my youtube channel on your social media and to anyone interested.  If you enjoy this carnivore diet meal plan, definitely check out my book, The Ancestral Indigenous Diet, for a more extensive summary of my dietary ideas.  You can also check out Frankie's Syringe Meat, Frankie's Naturals, as well as frank-stefano.com for a one-on-one fitness and diet consulting.
