So there are serious holes in this project.  I've been discussing, some of them.  It seems to me that the basic premise of the 1619 Project is what the Pulitzer Committee was rewarding here, not the essay that was... graced with a 500-word correction.  The basic premise of the 1619 Project, having read the entire thing, was that American history was founded in evil, and basically that evil has infused the entire body politic in every aspect of American life.  Do you think that's a fair assessment of the project? ",

I've suggested that this is basically the latest in a long line of historical revisionist attempts to cast the American founding in the darkest possible light, going all the way back to Charles Beard, suggesting that the American founders were mainly concerned with protecting their own property interests and moving forward through the pseudo history of Howard Zinn.  The fact that this is now becoming not just a counter narrative to to, I suppose, counter the the.  jingoistic or whitewashed history of the United States, but an actual counter history that is now being taught as the establishment history is pretty dangerous.

And I think specifically the 1619 Project has a few, let's call it targets of its own, apart from the overall idea of let's get rid of the idea of the United States as an experiment in liberty dedicated to a proposition that all men are created equal.  first thing that the 1619 project really would like to do is to teach school children because that's really what's aimed at is that capitalism is a form of totalitarianism.  that the one uh essay the second essay in the 1619 project says this pretty plainly slavery is the model for modern american entrepreneurial capitalism.  second goal we should pay reparations for slavery.  They don't say this in the 1619 Project, but the lead editor of the 1619 Project, Nicole Hannah-Jones, has said this in other places.  As though to reverse Lincoln's formula, that every drop of blood drawn by the lash had not been paid for by one drawn by the sword in the Civil War.  Third thing, history, according to the 1619 Project, is nothing more than a web of narratives and interpretations.  That means any connection of history to historical facts, can be conveniently ignored. ",

            "text": "So, some of the errors that are involved in the 1619 Project are pretty egregious.  Nicole Hannah Jones's prize-winning essay included the astounding claim that the American Revolution was fought on behalf of the preservation of slavery, which is astounding for a couple of reasons that I've mentioned.  One, the original draft of the Declaration of Independence actually included a clause blaming King George for bringing slavery to the American colonies.  And number two, the British Empire did not actually abolish slavery in its colonies until 1833.  So, I guess the American colonists must have been fighting back 50 years early against the British Empire attempting to abolish slavery. ",

            "text": "Well, as many American historians, including the dean of historians of the American Revolution, Gordon Wood, have pointed out, there is not a shred of evidence that the American revolutionaries ever said that they were fighting to protect slavery.  In fact, if you look at the way the British conducted the war, they were slaveholders to slavery.  And they manipulated slaves, they manipulated black people to their ends, and when the American Revolution was over, they took the slaves who had fled to the British Army for some kind of protection and either sold them to the West Indies or exiled them to colonies like Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone.  So the idea that somehow the American Revolution is a march against black freedom Now, what does that put the British as?  Well, no, I'm sorry.  None of that works.  And there's not a reputable historian who believes that that's the case. ",

And so my kids learn a little bit of bad history and then they listen to shows like this one and then they hear the counter history.  Why does it matter what kind of history people learn?  Why is it that there's been this push from the left to take over American history in this way? ",

We identify ourselves around a proposition.  This is what Lincoln said at Gettysburg.  We're conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  That's what makes us Americans.  And the thing... which teaches us that is our history.  Take our history, turn it upside down and empty it, and we lose any sense of what we have as an American identity.  In fact, in the larger sense, the great Russian dissident, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, said the first step that a tyrant takes when a tyrant wants to completely enslave people is to take away their history.  Because if you take away people's past, they have nothing to compare the present to.  So take it on both of those premises, Lincoln's and Solzhenitsyn's.  Holding on to our history, keeping our history right and straight and accurate, that is a work of momentous consequences for Americans. ",

And how should public school administrators look to sort of protect against this sort of stuff?  It's pretty obvious.  the Pulitzer Prize Committee is attempting to really just shoehorn this into schools.  That is the goal here, is to backfill the fact that the 1619 Project is filled with holes and rooted in nonsense, and then just sort of give it the gloss, the patina of accuracy, and then throw it into public schools.

In fact, your listeners really ought to ask their own school districts, are you using the 1619 Project?  And I think a rather large percentage of them would be surprised to find that's the case.  There are entire school districts, Buffalo, for instance, Washington,  D.C.,  Chicago, Detroit, which have adopted the 1619 Project and at various degrees have mandated its use.  So in a sense, this is already happening.  And people need to look carefully at what is going on all around them with the education of their children because it's already there. ",
