            "text": "No, I actually was interested in some of the other stuff that's going on at the Department of Justice, which we have oversight over while we're here together.  The first is that it turns out the attorney general has fired U.S.  Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  Doesn't seem to be any reason for it.  None was stated.  It seems to have been pretty rash in that the Department of Justice seemed to have forgotten that Mr.  Berman was a judicial appointment, not a Department of Justice or presidential appointment.  So when they tried to fire him, they ran into a problem that gave him leverage to impose that his deputy would be his successor and not the attorney general from New Jersey, which alone is a bizarre circumstance.  The US attorney from New Jersey, nothing against New Jersey, but if you're the sovereign district of New York and suddenly you're told that you're going to be run by the US attorney from New Jersey as a part-time effort, something bizarre is going on.  When you haven't figured out that Mr.  Berman is a judicial appointee, something bizarre is going on.  When you haven't figured out That this committee still enforces its blue slip on U.S.  attorney nominees?  So you think you're going to put Jay Taylor in without realizing you have to go through Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand to get there?  I mean, this is fire-the-associate quality preparation.  Something weird happened in the Department of Justice to cause knucklehead stumble-bum errors like that to be done by the Attorney General of the United States.  And I submit we'd be better off spending our time looking into what that was.  And here's another one.  We had Mr.  Delrahim, the head of the Antitrust Division, here for a hearing.  We asked questions about a patently preposterous antitrust investigation that he had launched.  that happened to align extremely well with the political interests of President Trump and of Marathon Petroleum, which was trying to bust up the California fuel efficiency standards.  So we got nothing in the way of serious answers at the hearing.  So I followed up with QFRs.  And as you all know, questions for the record have been, I think, as a matter of policy, ignored by the Department of Justice, whether they come from my side or your side.  So we got no answers to our QFRs.  So we sent a follow-up letter saying, what's up with the QFRs?  No answer to that.  So I put a hold on a bill.  that the department wanted, and suddenly I got a little bit of their attention, and I brought it to the chairman's attention, and to his credit, he brought the deputy attorney general over to sit down and talk through what the heck is going on with all the questions for the record and all the letters that the Department of Justice isn't answering.  I mean, by the dozen.  This is a pattern.  This is a practice.  Well, why would they be avoiding answering questions about this antitrust thing.  While we're doing this, they're having a hearing over in House Judiciary right now on what's going on in the Department of Justice.  And here is the New York Times reporting from just minutes ago about the whistleblower from the antitrust division.  And the report is, Mr.  Elias' statement also portrayed an antitrust review.  the one we talked about of a deal struck by four major automakers with the state of California to voluntarily continue to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions on new cars despite the Trump administration's rollback of federal standards as politically motivated rather than grounded in the facts and the law.  Mr.  Trump had attacked the deal on Twitter And the division began its review without going through normal procedures, Mr.  Elias said.  Quote, the day after the tweets, antitrust division political leadership, the guys who sat right there and wouldn't answer our questions, instructed staff to initiate an investigation that day, he wrote.  Something is very wrong at the Department of Justice, whether it's Mr.  Delrahim and his antitrust division that is running political errands, or whether it's U.S.  attorneys who are investigating.  Trump associates being fired without apparent reason in such a cluster mess that they managed to overlook that he was a judicial appointment, managed to overlook that there's a blue slip, managed to lie twice, Either Barr or Berman is lying about whether there was an agreement Berman would resign.  And either Barr or Trump is lying about whether Trump ordered the firing.  Trump said, I had nothing to do with this after Barr put it right on Trump's shoulders.  So you've got two lies floating around out there that haven't been assigned to the individual liar.  You got to admit, guys, this is weird.  This is not the Department of Justice that America counts on.  And my time has expired.  I apologize for going over a minute.  But you got to admit, this is weird. ",

            "text": "I want to ask about unemployment insurance.  But before I do, I have to react to Mr.  Hughes, your statement about your policy for answering letters.  I don't know what is going on over at the department, but I detect a policy of not answering questions for the record from this committee... and not answering letters from this committee.  When we had Mr.  Rosenstein down in the hot seat there a few days ago, I pointed out that in 17, I think it was, hearings with Department of Justice witnesses, not one question for the record from a senator was answered afterwards.  Not one.  That's not a coincidence.  That's a policy.  When we get questions for the record answered, it's because it's a nomination hearing, and the nominee doesn't go forward until the QFRs are answered.  Outside of that, the policy seems to be we, the Department of Justice, don't answer committee questions for the record.  I have a similar problem with letters, so I don't believe what you have said about there being a responsible policy for getting letters answered.  We have letter after letter after letter to DOJ and FBI that have gone completely unanswered.  We finally got a letter out of the antitrust division recently by putting a hold on a piece of legislation that the antitrust division wanted.  And the answer we got from the antitrust division was a blow off.  It was a nonsense answer.  It did not answer the actual questions.  So I would ask you to take back to the department what the heck is going on.  because this exceeds the partisanship that I see out of the department.  This is a persistent failure of response to oversight, and it is not always going to be a Republican attorney general.  It's not always going to be a Republican chairman.  Something is wrong.  There is a policy someplace about not answering QFRs and not answering letters, and I am sick to death of it.  So please take that back.  And I see the chairman nodding his head over there.  So this is a bipartisan concern.  The letter that was raised was from Chairman Grassley.  This is a bipartisan concern.  This is not the time to get into this.  We're going to get into this further.  But somewhere there is a policy, and I want it rooted out because it is a wrong policy.  Now, on unemployment insurance, Mr.  Shivers, in your testimony, in the headings of the different elements of your testimony, you don't even mention unemployment insurance.  It's not one of the topic areas.  Mr.  Ambrosio mentioned briefly unemployment insurance in his testimony, but described it as just simple fraud.  I don't know that that's accurate, gentlemen.  Just in Rhode Island, we've had 3,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance applications.  Our US attorney is looking into it after the Rhode Island State Police began an investigation because they seem to be coordinated.  The damages could be in the billions.  The theft could be in the billions of dollars.  IP information links entities to common fraudulent claims and also to fraudulent common claims in the state of Massachusetts, in the state of Connecticut, in the state of Washington.  I think you need to step back and take a look at this as a very significant common scheme, very likely a foreign-led common scheme, and take a much harder look at this unemployment insurance fraud than you appear to be undertaking from your testimony here today.  I think we are dealing with what may prove to be the crime of the decade, if not the crime of the century, in terms of the amount of money that was stolen through a common scheme run very likely by foreign crooks.  And I would ask you also to take the message back that it would be really helpful if the Department of Justice and the FBI would support the bill the Treasury supports, that former Chairman Grassley and Chairman Graham support, that will peel back the ability of foreign entities to hide behind shell corporations in America.  Because what happens, as I think you know, is that they steal billions of dollars through these schemes, and then they launder the proceeds through shell corporations.  We've seen it over and over and over again.  The Department, the FBI, the Secret Service have all testified about the role of American shell corporations in hiding criminal assets.  And when you look at the extent of the theft from our states through this unemployment insurance problem into which federal money was poured in abundance as part of the COVID response, I think it's a better bet than not that at the end of the day, those proceeds of theft end up behind shell corporations where it's harder for you to root them out and run them down.  So I'd be eager to have any response to the point about unemployment insurance and what you're planning to do to ramp up your response to this.  Senator, there was no ill intent in not mentioning unemployment insurance.  I'm sorry.  It's on.  I'll pull it closer.  All right.  There was no ill intent in not mentioning the unemployment insurance.  Just with the limited amount of time, I wanted to give an overview of some of the questions. ",

            "text": "There you go.  That feels better.  Thank you.  Now let's make sure that these agencies respond according to that and not to the not mentioning it or calling it just like simple fraud.  Because it was potentially billions of dollars in fraud.  I'm not going to speak at length because I've made this point repeatedly.  But the Washington Post has reported that there is a multi-hundred million dollar network funded by anonymous donors at work trying to manipulate the makeup of our federal courts.  When we faced the Merrick Garland versus Judge Gorsuch contest and then the problems with Judge Kavanaugh, political campaigns Against Garland, for Gorsuch, and for Kavanaugh were run by an organization that were paid for with $35 million in two anonymous donations.  There's every reason to believe that the two anonymous donations came from the same donor.  There's certainly no reason not to believe that.  So what you have is somebody who spent $35 million to influence the makeup of the United States Supreme Court, and we don't know who they are, and we don't know what business they had before the court.  We see repeat performers who are funded by anonymous donors bringing cases before the court, and in cases of political import, We see choruses of amici turn up who, upon investigation, turn out to have common funding by anonymous donor groups.  The extent to which our courts are now admired in dark money is unprecedented.  And if I could, I heard very clearly the chairman's argument yesterday, his belief that in this matter, Were the political polls reversed, our democratic hair would be on fire to get to the bottom of what the hell happened in Crossfire Hurricane.  Well, I assert the same argument here.  If anonymous donors on our side were picking Supreme Court judges, were funding political campaigns for their nominations, were bringing cases before the court and were flocking in little flotillas of amici to the court to make arguments in chorus.  for whatever the donor interests are behind this scheme, your hair would be equally on fire.  There is no precedent for this kind of dark money around the Supreme Court.  We've seen the mischief of dark money in our politics.  That's bad enough.  We should have common cause to clean that rot out of our political system.  But when it starts to creep into our judiciary, something has gone badly, badly wrong.  And I'll close with a connection between this and the matter that we're about to discuss.  Because I believe very deeply that if the shoe were on the other foot, the Republicans on this committee would have no hesitancy asking the group that ran the political campaigns and received $35 million in two donations to fund those campaigns, who the hell was behind those campaigns?  That's a very simple question.  It goes to the heart of the integrity of the judiciary.  And we can't even begin to get an answer to that.  That is the backdrop of lack of oversight.  My questions yesterday about QFRs were the same.  The letters that have gone into the same bin with our QFRs are the same.  And so if we're going to do oversight, by God, I hope we'll do fair oversight and oversight into questions that are different than the questions that the Trump campaign wants us to ask.  If all the oversight we do is the oversight that is congruent with the Trump political campaign's interests, that is not a good place for this committee to be. ",
