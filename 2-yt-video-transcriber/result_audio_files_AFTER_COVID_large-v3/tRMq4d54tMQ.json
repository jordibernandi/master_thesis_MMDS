            "text": "I mean, this is the truth show.  Oh, yes.  Now this was a heavy requested video and I know I'm so freaking late and I hate that the original video has been pulled, but I gathered what I could.  With that said, it seems that my original theory of some cover up is true.  I remember when I said that she was a sacrifice for monetary gain, not to mention no more child support for Sean Combs to pay.  But there was something else.  A long time rumor.  Okay.  Supposed to have been a long time rumor of Kim Porter writing a tell-all book about Sean Combs.  And the reason I didn't believe it was because why bite the mouth that fed you?  And not to mention the family pics they took together and so on.  I told you social media pictures and videos and things of that nature can fool you, and I'll get into that a little later.  However, getting back to the rumor of Porter writing the tell-all book, I ran across some information on this site called, I'm assuming this is kind of like an abbreviation for a fuck, yeah, yeah.  on the website, she or he says this.  When Al B. Shore first questioned how Kim Porter died, I looked into some reasons why Puffy wants Kim dead.  I found this interview with the woman spoke about why Kim's death is suspicious.  She goes on to say that she's sorry, but I can't remember where I found this interview.  I tried to search on YouTube and can't find it right now.  Something in my spirit told me to not delete these.  and I'm so glad I did not.  I managed to download it.  Take a look. ",

And it said that Kim was writing a tomorrow book.  And in the book, that she would be exposing Diddy and his, um, his homosexual affairs with other artists and a bunch of other stuff that was not publicly known.  Now, it's no secret, especially within the industry, that Nitti has been bisexual for quite some time.  In fact, this was the reason that Wendy got fired way back in the day.  Wendy Williams was fired from Kiss because she exposed pictures of him having a homosexual affair in Mexico. ",

            "text": "Yes, they fired her, she got blacklisted, and then she went to years, within a couple of years, she was back on the radio in Philadelphia, And then she made her way back to New York via WVLS, and then as time went by, she was able to get reestablished in New York.  But she had a website way back then in the 90s where she had posted up this picture of Goody with a young Mexican boy servicing him on a beach in Mexico.  But the thing about it was that during that time and even up to this day, you have a lot of these things in terms of the cover-up and helping Biddy to get the power that he wields today through his association with Christ.  So she was writing this book, and in the post that was sent to me, It also said that it was not reported that on the day she died, two laptops were stolen from her house, which supposedly contained the manuscript of the book, and the theft was never reported.  They just sort of disappeared.  And so that led me to believe that there might, in fact, be some merit to this claim.  But then as I looked deeper, I noticed that at the funeral... She was in the Promethean casket.  And I had did a video a few months ago on Aretha Franklin's passing and the funeral.  I noticed that at the funeral, she was in the Promethean casket.  And I had did a video a few months ago on Aretha Franklin's passing and the funeral.  And I researched the Cromathy in casket, which is this 24-karat gold-plated casket that James Brown was buried in, Michael Jackson was buried in.  And so I found out something that really, well, I had known this, and I reported this to people that didn't know, that the casket takes two weeks to make.  So, and it involves a lot, if you go on their site, it involves a lot of polishing and certain weatherproofing on the inside.  There's just a whole bunch of stuff, and this is a very expensive casket. ",

And I remember that in Aretha's case, one of the reasons she was above ground for two weeks is because they were waiting for the damn thing to get made.  Because in black culture, we usually put our people on the ground pretty quickly.  Not as quick as the Jews, but pretty quickly in terms of you don't keep no dead body up for two weeks.  And that's extreme in our culture.  And so I'm like, they're waiting for this damn thing to get made.  So my thinking in terms of Kim is, who ordered this damn thing two weeks before she died? ",

            "text": "Because.  I know, crazy, right?  And I told you, it's the small bloggers and websites that have the truest and the most revealing details.  You guys need to stop chasing numbers.  Anyway, however, this lady verifies everything I said about the porter's death.  That video, I had a video series actually pertaining to the different scenarios and suspicious incidents.  Things that I noticed around her death, but it's been flagged and it's now my picture now so you can check it out in there.  But in the video, I did speak about all of my suspicions about Jay-Z and Sean Combs and how they covered up many deaths, many suspicious things, affairs and things of that nature.  And I heard a lot of prostitution ring they had going on as well.  And of course, we know about Kathy White and so on.  Also, it was what Kim had posted prior to her death and people who claimed to have spoken to her before her death.  She wasn't complaining about her being sick or and there weren't any signs of her having pneumonia to the point of her dying days later.  You know how people look when they're about to have this terrible death and pneumonia.  I know you have walking pneumonia and I know, but there are still some kind of signs and no one said that she looked like that at all.  not even fatigue or tired or anything of that nature.  and being fatigued and tired doesn't always coincide with pneumonia.  I mean she was a mother of three kids and she had a lot going on.  I think her son was was modeling overseas or something like that.  so I think she was flying back and forth down there as well so she could have a little jet lag.  but anyway well I do remember a lot of you mentioning the casket and how It takes time for a cast stick like that to be made.  I don't know if I put that in the video or not because the reason I didn't put it in the video, I'm like, okay, money talks.  Maybe he just probably threw another 10, 15, 20,000 to have it made.  I don't know.  But I did think that was suspicious as well.  I thought that was really, really suspicious, but I don't know.  I mean, you gotta understand, Sean Combs is a very good actor.  You do know that, right?  He played in movies.  So the man can act his ass off.  And not to mention, as I said in the bio that I did about him, He has a temper, too.  So he's known to have a really bad temper.  That was one of the reasons Jennifer Lopez stopped messing around with him, aside from the shootout and all the drama that surrounded him.  And she, you know, wanted to pretty much distance herself from black men in general.  And she kind of have done that since him, to be frank.  Anyway, but apparently... We're not the only ones who had suspicions here is what I'll be sure had said on his social media.  He said the morning of the Soul Train Awards at BET production, Jesse Collinson, hashtag I'll be around the world.  I just found this footage from this morning.  This is from, I'll be sure.  Who is him?  Talking to type only this.  Anyway, I just found this footage from this morning.  I learned of Kim Porter's, a.k.a.  Kim Porter's murder and how it ripped the soul from my physical body.  I was on my way to Femme, the pre-show packages for the BET Awards with Tisha Cameron Martin and Tashina Arnold.  When I received the call from Kim, pr icon queenie donaldson asking me if i was okay and did i hear the news.  i had no clue.  i do know very clearly that kimberly didn't just check out all of a sudden over pneumonia.  that's some bull.  you know really this is where i get in trouble.  we just celebrated our son's quincy new deal and christmas special with at netflix and she was in fantastic health.  as well As laughing, seeing me and Diddy's mutual exchange at the theater, I'm going to leave it here.  Don't let the love songs fool you.  That's what he said.  Man, that was hard to read.  This man is how old again? ",

Don't let social media fool you.  Don't let innocent faces fool you.  People who portray the most innocent and sweetest face and they're always no train, they're always there for you are the most conniving, backstabbing, evilest people.  I had to learn that the hard way, honestly.  And it's really, really something.  Once you see the true colors, you just, you become astounded.  Like, oh my gosh, you're supposed to be the sweetest person ever.  You evil as hell.  So do note that.  And I tried to tell you about certain people.  Some of you are so brainwashed.  I mean, I think everyone is good.  So what did P.D.D.  do?  Did P.D.D.  and maybe even with the help of his ex-girlfriend Cassie, who seemed to have checked out quickly after uh... kim porters death?  but we don't even know if that could have been some kind of arrangement.  you know what i mean.  it could have been some kind of arrangement like i need you need you and i to separate for like two three years or so and then we can get back together.  whatever i mean you never know.  they do do these things to cover murder so you never know.  well unfortunately we would never find out because he really buried her very very quickly.  i mean you want her in the ground like quickly so I don't know.  But as you should know, Sean Combs is going to take this and his true sexuality to his grave and anyone who threatens to expose it right along with him to their grave.  I mean, he does have his entire image to think of and his money and his brand to think of when it comes to his sexuality.  For some reason, he feel if he comes out as a gay man, his financial world will crumble as if we would give a shit.  But whatever.  Well, that's it.  Let me know what you all think below.  Tell me your conspiracies and theories below.  On that note, don't forget to subscribe, share, and like.  And hit that bell so you get notifications when I do post more videos.  See y'all later.
