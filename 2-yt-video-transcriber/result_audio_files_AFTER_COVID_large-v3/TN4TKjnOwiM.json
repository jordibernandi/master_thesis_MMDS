            "text": "No, Joe Biden did not fall asleep in a recent television interview.  There's a clip going around on conservative spaces on Twitter and Facebook and on other sites of Joe Biden apparently falling asleep.  in an interview and then the journalist is trying to wake him up basically yelling at him through her microphone to his feed at his basement studio and she's trying to like you know cover for him as he's clearly snoring.  But it's fake.  And you might think, because I'm going to show it to you, that it's really obviously a bad fake.  But it's being shared by official White House sources like Dan Scavino, who's a deputy chief of staff of communication in the White House.  This is not just something going around a few people.  This is something that a lot of conservatives are sharing as quote unquote evidence of Biden's dementia and cognitive decline that he's literally sleepy Joe Biden.  I'm going to play that for you.  Joining us live this morning from New York.  Hey, good morning.  Wake up.  Wake up, wake up.  So as you can see, it's not very good, it's not very convincing, but for people that maybe have low internet literacy, maybe it's more convincing if they don't understand how tech and editing work.  If they don't understand that, those are clearly edited in snoring noises.  That's clearly a major, major issue because a lot of people are going to believe this.  And if even a few people believe it, it's distorting the will of the electorate.  It's misinforming them.  It's disinforming them.  Here's the thing.  The journalist was reacting to somebody falling asleep in an interview, and it was Harry Belafonte, the famous actor who fell asleep when she was about to interview him back in the early 2010s.  Now, I'm going to play you the clip again, and this is the real one.  Harry Belafonte joining us live this morning from New York.  Hey, good morning, Harry.  Harry, wake up.  Harry, wake up, wake up.  This is your wake up call, Harry.  Okay, I'll tell you what.  We are going, yeah, he's meditating.  He's having, he's taking a little nap.  Taking a little nap.  We might wake, he's okay, he is okay.  Daylight.  So you can see that all they did was they took the cutout of the screen where Belafonte was, where the actor was sleeping before his interview that he must have dozed off while he was waiting to be interviewed.  And they spliced in a clip of Joe Biden where Biden is clearly reading something.  He's clearly reading something on the bottom there.  Now, look, I on this channel have made videos talking honestly and frankly about how I agree that Joe Biden has exhibited certain signs of cognitive decline and dementia.  So I'm not the sort of person to just paper over things like this if they're accurate.  But this just plain isn't accurate.  And I think this shows how the Trump campaign in their desperation to focus on sleepy Joe Biden go way overboard in some cases.  But they often open themselves up to criticism because in recent weeks and recent months, there's been just as much focus on how Donald Trump himself has exhibited cognitive decline, dementia, physical weakness, depression.  not being able to walk up a ramp or down a ramp, not being able to hold a glass of water with one hand, not being able to do a lot of things that Joe Biden can do.  Him bragging to Chris Wallace that he knows what an elephant is.  Him bragging to Chris Wallace that he knows how to count numbers down.  Chris Wallace basically saying, look, I took the test, sir.  It's not that hard.  And he's bragging about it.  If anything, all of this focus on Joe Biden, cognitive decline, sleepy Joe Biden, dementia.  Joe Biden has just shown the spotlight on Donald Trump.  So just if you have a relative, because I know a lot of boomers, I don't want to typecast, but I know a lot of older folks.  Maybe they're conservative.  Maybe they're anti Biden from a progressive perspective.  They're going to share this clip.  Let them know that it's fake.  You know, there are plenty of other instances of Biden on camera.  Basically looking like he doesn't know where he is or what he's talking about.  But this isn't one of them.  If you're going to do memes, if you're going to do videos about them, at least be honest.  I'm going to do my best to call out blatant lies like this. ",
