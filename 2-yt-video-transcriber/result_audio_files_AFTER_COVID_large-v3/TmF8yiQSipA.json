            "text": "This is a very important update on our YouTube channel.  First of all, I do appreciate over 500,000 people that have subscribed to the channel.  We do about two new updates a week.  And with our program, we actually have three updates a week that come on.  And we appreciate the time that you take to join us.  We try to make these as brief as possible so that the information can be brief and yet to the point.  I'm going to be discussing for the next few moments a subject called America, the coming earthquake and tsunami.  We do know if we read two references in Scripture and then we combine them with other references from the apocalypse, that there will be two things that will happen in the future.  Now, one is very clearly earthquakes, and that's in Matthew chapter 24 and verse 7.  Part of the signs of Christ's return are earthquakes in diverse, that's a King James word, or different places.  We do know THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BOOK OF REVELATION, THERE ARE SEVEN INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS A GREAT QUAKE OR AN EARTHQUAKE, AND IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED A MEGAQUAKE IN GREEK, THAT BEGINS TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE TIME KNOWN AS THE GREAT TRIBULATION.  SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THEM IS PROBABLY FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVEN-YEAR TRIBULATION TOWARD THE LATTER PART.  IT SAYS IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION THAT THIS MEGAQUAKE TAKES PLACE and the cities of the nations fell.  Now, excuse me, having read that, FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, I'M AWARE THAT THE RING OF FIRE, WHICH IS CALLED THE PACIFIC RING OF FIRE, IS ACTUALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE COASTAL AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH AMERICA AND JAPAN AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ARE PART OF WHAT IS CALLED THE RING OF FIRE, MANY OF THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE WORLD WITH THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS ARE RIGHT OFF THE COASTAL AREAS.  of that ring of fire, you know, Japan and over the edge of Alaska, three big cities or four big cities actually on the coast of California.  California is part of this very famous ring of fire.  And so I do believe that when you read the book of Revelation where the cities of the nation fell.  That is, it is probably more in the area of the Ring of Fire due to the volcanic activity and the earthquake activity, seismic zones, the plates under the ocean,  etc.,  that are very sensitive in that part of the world, on our globe.  In the Midwest, we have Yellowstone, which has been called by scientists a super volcano.  And while they're saying that Yellowstone will never blow in the next 50, 100, 200, 300 years, and that's their speculation, of course, if it ever did, the ash from Yellowstone would affect practically all, I should say, of the Midwestern part of the United States because of the flow of the jet stream.  breadbasket of America.  And so we have all these things that are mentioned there.  Now, we do know that there are three zones in the United States of danger.  One is the West Coast.  The San Andreas fault line is the most famous, but there are several others that are as large and as dangerous.  One even connects to that one on the West Coast, all the way from the area of Washington State through Southern California.  In the Midwest is the famous New Madrid Fault Line that runs through five different states, which is approximately, well, it's several hundred miles long.  I don't have my exact numbers in front of me.  And then there were actually some very small, minor fault lines on the East Coast, but more in the Midwest and more, of course, in the West Coast than any other location.  So at any given time, the state of California has been told that a big one is coming, not if it comes, but when it comes, which leads me to the second part of what I want to share with you, which is tsunamis.  The word tsunami comes from the Japanese word which means harbor and wave.  Tsu is harbor and the second part means wave.  So it's a harbor wave.  And the word was first created, I guess you could say, in the 19th century with some tsunamis that began to strike the coastal area of Japan.  Most of you know what a tsunami is.  especially when several years ago we saw the Indonesian tsunami that struck, and it was an earthquake under the sea that took place, and the plates shifted, and when it shifted, it caused a wave to be created in the middle of the ocean, and that wave spread in two different directions, but Indonesia was the hardest hit, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that were injured and killed.  so many buildings I don't even know if they actually got the total count of all the homes and buildings that were tens and tens of thousands affected by a tidal wave that actually carried entire ships in to the coastal line placing them on buildings crushing them to the ground cars and homes and so many terrible devastating things that happen now.  If you're looking for the word tsunami in the New Testament, it's not there because it is a modern word.  If you're looking for the impact of a tsunami in the New Testament, you can find it.  It's in Luke chapter 21, 24 through 26.  And here's what it says.  Now the nations would be in perplexity.  One translation says the nations would be in distress not knowing the way out of their future troubles or the things that are going to happen in the near future.  When it says here that the sea and the waves are roaring, I did a little Greek word study here.  And the word roaring there is the Greek word for echo.  And it would say it this way if we were retranslating it into modern vernacular.  There will be a sound of an echo that would be heard from the sea and the waves.  And so when you talk to people who have survived a tsunami, or you can actually go on blogs under the Indonesian tsunami and find where people made comments of what it was like.  They all described that if they saw what was happening, that the water receded.  A lot of them didn't know what was happening, of course, at that time.  We now know when water recedes at an ocean, you better run and get to a hot place.  And the second thing was an echo roaring.  The exact word that several people used back on Christmas Day in the Indonesian tsunami was that they heard a roaring sound coming from the sea.  Now, I believe that when it says here, the sea and the waves roaring, that it is alluding to what we would call a tsunami taking place.  SO IF THE WATER IN THE PACIFIC OR ATLANTIC OCEAN OR ANY OCEAN FOR THAT MATTER, IF THERE WERE TO BE AN UNDERWATER MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE, IT WOULD CREATE A WAVE WHICH COULD DEVASTATE ISLANDS, BUT ALSO WOULD EVENTUALLY HIT, AS IT DID IN JAPAN AND INDONESIA, INLAND on the shores in the coastal areas and the wave would go in for many many miles devastating businesses and homes and buildings and you can see a lot of footage.  when I was up offer about 30 days doing research I just begin to view the Japanese in the Indonesian tsunamis and it was just unbelievable.  the water how it damaged the the buildings and the homes and the businesses.  in the days of Noah There was, according to Scripture, that the windows of heaven were opened and it rained.  And then it tells us in Genesis that the fountains of the deep were also broken up.  The fountains of the deep would be underwater earthquakes taking place where the plates under the sea are broken because everything connects by these plates and they were breaking.  And as they were breaking, it was sending massive waves.  So you had water coming from the heavens and you had water coming up from under the ground.  The Tehom or the deep, the waters under the ground were coming out with the waters above.  Now, our parallel of that today would be, again, a tsunami.  And another parallel would be a hurricane of which it causes the water, of course, the wind stirs and the water comes from the heavens, just pours down inches and inches and sometimes several feet of water.  So when we see hurricanes and tsunamis, we could compare it to the days of Noah, of the great flood.  And as it was in the days of Noah, again, the Bible says it will be at the time of the coming of the Son of Man.  In Lot's day, and I'll be talking about this on another presentation on our channel, there was a volcanic eruption, according to many Israeli geologists, that destroyed the four cities of the plain in Lot's day.  And I won't really talk about that in such detail, but the part that I do want to mention to you, and I want to be... Very careful doing this.  If you know me and many of you are becoming very familiar with our ministry, some of you have been keeping up with our ministry for 5, 10, 20 and some 30, 35.  And there's a few folks been with me 45 years and have been faithful to stand with us and pray for us and hear the words that the Spirit of God gives us for your teaching edification and for, of course, the prophetic warnings as well.  What has stirred me is the other night once again, and I cannot tell you how many times this has now happened.  I've actually lost count over the past, let's say, four years, maybe even five years if we total it up.  I had another dream of being in a building and the earth began to shake.  and And as I looked up in this building out a window, and it was full-color, three-dimensional, just like I'm looking at my studio here, I saw a wave.  Now, it was not the 100-foot waves that I've seen in the past or even 50 feet, but it was a wave nonetheless.  And I heard somebody yell, tsunami, tsunami.  And this wave was coming in after an earthquake.  And I'm very careful.  Two things that you will probably not see me see or see me do unless I absolutely 1000% know.  One is to say, God told me to tell you.  Now if I ever tell you that the Holy Spirit has given me something to tell you, you can bank it down.  I don't play games with this.  I'm not a YouTube prophet.  I don't come on every two days, urgent word, urgent word, urgent dream, urgent dream.  I just don't do that.  If other people are having that, God bless them, time will tell if what they're saying is accurate, and time will tell about this as well.  I'm not telling you that this is soon.  I'm not telling you it's even this year.  I'm telling you, though, it's going to come at some point.  There will be a crack and a fissure that's going to come, I guess I said that word right, that's going to come in the ocean, but it will be an earthquake, and it will be so large that it's going to create a massive wave that's going to move through an entire coastal area.  Now, I've seen one come from the south.  I've seen one come from the east coast.  Actually, in very, very clear, vivid, and this was several years ago, but the burden I'm feeling now because I see so much mockery of God, persecution of the righteous on the West Coast of the United States.  West Coast, I'm being very serious.  I'm getting very, very, very concerned about the possibilities of natural disasters being unleashed.  And, you know, I don't, necessarily see that God's up there taking his fist and pounding the earth trying to get rid of people.  that is not.  there's so much of a misrepresentation and a misconception of what the judgment of God actually is.  the judgment of the Lord is actually.  when God lifts his hedge of protection and then anything can happen.  natural laws go crazy nature goes crazy people can go crazy when God lifts his protective hedge.  you can read about that in Job chapter 1 and chapter 2 and we're not here to talk about that today.  but But I will tell you that this is what I, well, let me just say it this way.  This is what I want to tell you.  This is what I want to talk to you about for just a moment.  And that is this.  I believe that in seeing these that we're getting a warning.  I believe that I'm getting a warning of something that's going to happen nationally.  I don't take this as a spiritual thing.  I don't take this as, you know, the tsunami outpouring of the Holy Spirit because this is very dangerous and very fearful in the dream.  If it was an outpouring of the Spirit, it would be very joyful and I would see people in it swimming around having a good time.  At least that's what I would think I would see.  But I want you as, if you live in a coastal area, just a very simple word, just honestly, a very simple word for you that I want you to hear and that is this.  I think it would be in order for you to begin to ask the Lord for any kind of a confirmation, word confirmation dream, if something is going to happen to warn you in advance the way he did Lot and the family.  And Lot and the family escaped the destruction of the city and actually were safe on a mountain and later moved to a very small city in a rural area named Zoar.  And it may require at some point for you to pack up the family and say, you know, we need to go.  We just need to go to a different area.  The cities are getting crazy.  People are getting crazy.  These extreme left are going nuts.  They're passing all kinds of laws against Christianity, harassing people, you know, saying we need to do away with the Bible.  Get out of those areas and find a place somewhere.  If you can, I'm saying if the Lord tells you to do this and finds you a place that still believes in the word of God.  I'm going to say something here and I may get a lot of.  YOU KNOW, NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON THIS, BUT I HAVE LIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS, THE RURAL MOUNTAINS ALL OF MY LIFE, VIRGINIA, WEST VIRGINIA.  YOU KNOW, WE KNOW ABOUT KENTUCKY HERE IN TENNESSEE.  AND THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE GOOD OLD PEOPLE.  A LOT OF THEM, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BELIEVERS LIKE YOU AND I ARE, OF COURSE, BUT THEY LOVE THEIR NEIGHBOR.  THEY TRY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE.  THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY.  And a lot of them who aren't even followers of the Lord believe there is a God in heaven that needs to be respected.  And I am thankful for being able to live in an area.  And let me brag on Tennessee.  I live in the state of Tennessee, which a recent survey said that in the state of Tennessee... that three of the most ten Bible-centered, Christian church-centered states, cities, cities in America, three out of ten are in the state of Tennessee.  And I just want to say thank the Lord for that.  That is special to me.  So the point I want to make is there are some things that's going to happen, but the Lord will warn you in advance.  He will let you know.  He will open up a door for you.  He will place things in your heart as to not be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  I was talking the other day in Ohio about 9-11, and there was one church.  WHERE A MEMBER TOLD ME YEARS AGO IN NEW YORK WHERE 200 MEMBERS FELT LED THAT DAY NOT TO GO TO WORK AT THE TRADE CENTER, AND THOSE 200 PEOPLE WERE SPARED FROM DEATH BECAUSE THEY MORE THAN LIKELY WOULD HAVE DIED THAT DAY.  WHEN MY GRANDPARENT, MY GRANDFATHER WAS WORKING IN A COAL MINE YEARS AGO, BARTLEY NUMBER ONE, And it exploded that day and no one knew it was going to.  Two preachers were in prayer that morning and the Lord said, call in and just don't go to work.  Tell them you won't be coming in today.  And they would have died in that.  My point is that the Lord knows how to send an angel to protect you.  He knows that through your prayers he can speak to your spirit.  He knows that he can also give you prophetic warnings.  And the reason I'm sharing this with you is that some big things are going to happen.  There's going to be some things happen in the future that we won't be able to control.  It's just going to take place.  And some will be cosmic signs and disasters, and some will be natural disasters.  But the real thing that you need to know is this.  Be close to the Lord.  Get close to Jesus.  Don't gossip about people.  Don't criticize.  You know, I see people almost rebuking people for going to church who are Christians.  Come on, folks.  We're not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.  You know, my mother's 84.  She's not coming to church right now because of the possibility of COVID.  We totally understand that.  But don't be anti-going to church, for goodness sakes, and fight against what God told us that we should be doing.  Don't do that, even though you may have to stay out for a while or something of that nature.  Be supportive of our freedom.  Be supportive.  If we start getting to the point where we start acting like the world and we act like these left-wing nuts that are out there, we're going to be in serious trouble.  We'll never get our country back.  It'll go into an area and a realm that we've never seen before.  You don't want that.  I don't want that for my kids or grandkids.  Even though I may not be here forever, I don't want it for them.  They've got to grow up in this country as well.  So I want you to just remember these things are going to happen.  It's all a part of the signs of the time of the end.  But always remember to stay close to the Lord because you can't threaten a believer with going to heaven.  If we were to go to heaven, we've lost nothing because we're going to come back here and rule and reign with Christ on this earth for a thousand years and then live with him for eternity here.  So we can't lose either way with whatever happens.  Anyway, I wanted to share this with you, my concern.  I'll be agreeing with you in prayer.  I'll be asking the Lord, speak to people, God, direct them in 2021.  If they're in the right place, let them stay there and help them and bless them.  But God, if they should get out of the zone that they're in to another location, open up the door.  Don't just pack up and go somewhere and not have work or not know what you're doing.  Don't do that.  That's called lack of wisdom.  But pray that God will open the door.  And you know what?  I've been around the Lord a long time.  He knows how to open doors and shut doors.  I hope that something here will cause you to, you know, to turn your faith to him, turn your heart to him.  And most of all, do not fear and do not be afraid.  We're living in the last days.  And the good news is down the road, somewhere in the future, our Lord is coming back to earth again.  And we get to be a part of it.  Thank you.  Don't forget to subscribe to our channel.
