            "text": "Hey, Bill O'Reilly here.  This is the No Spin News for Wednesday, August 12th, 2020.  Stand up for your country.  Okay, pen and paper, I hope you have it.  We're going to tell you who exactly is hurting the country and why.  I'm going to name names.  But first, we're going to start our campaign coverage today on August 12th because both tickets are in place.  You should know I am not going to cover this campaign the way the networks and the cable news operations and the newspapers do.  That gives you nothing.  I'm not running meaningless soundbites, propaganda.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm going to tell you what is happening, why it is happening, and what, in my opinion, is good for the country.  That's what you're going to get here until Election Day on November 3rd.  If you want all the propaganda, you've got plenty of outlets to get it.  So I'm not going to run any soundbites from the Biden-Harris news conference today.  Not going to do it.  But it's the same thing with President Trump and Mike Pence.  You know, they're going to call Harris, well, they're already calling her a phony.  I'm not going to run that soundbite.  I'm not going to do that.  I mean, why?  It gets us nowhere.  You can assume that Trump supporters despise Kamala Harris.  That's how you say her name.  Kamala, like comma.  All right.  You can just assume they despise her and vice versa.  That anyone who would support the nomination of Senator Harris, anyone who would support that, who would like that, hates Trump and Pence.  Because Senator Harris is the third most liberal senator on Capitol Hill.  Only behind Bernie Sanders, a self-admitted socialist, and Elizabeth Warren, who is a socialist but couches it, but she is.  So Kamala Harris is third.  And therefore... when Joe Biden picked her as VP, it became the most liberal ticket in the history of this country.  There is nobody even close.  So, if Americans want hardcore liberalism in charge of this country, then they will vote for the Biden-Harris ticket.  It's as simple as that.  Now, Donald Trump is not a doctrinaire conservative.  He's all over the place.  But he is primarily a man who is governing in a traditional way.  So the status quo is okay with Donald Trump.  He wants to get better deals, better economy, all of that, withdraw troops from abroad.  But basically the status quo is what he's going to do.  Not Biden and Harris.  They're going to blow it all up if they get elected.  So let's get into Ms.  Harris.  Interesting woman.  Skin color doesn't matter.  This is not a skin color play.  All right.  She identifies as black.  She went to Howard University.  Fine.  Her father was a Jamaican.  Her mother is an Indian American, two immigrants.  Okay.  She was born Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris.  on October 20th, 1964 in Oakland, California.  So that would put her 56 years old this coming October.  She had a very affluent upbringing.  Her parents were professionals.  They were immigrants to this country.  They did very well.  Okay?  She was deprived of nothing.  She wasn't the little girl looking out the window being bused into a tough school.  That's what she wants you to think.  That's really not what happened.  Yes, she was caught up in the busing.  That's true.  But this wasn't some kind of a ghetto situation where she was being bused to better herself.  No.  She had two very professional and successful parents.  Kamala Harris is a machine politician.  She's not a populist.  She's not a socialist.  Not any of that.  She's a machine politician.  And the machine in California is far, far left.  We all know That's who she is.  So she decides after just being a senator for less than three years to run for president.  She gets nowhere.  She tops out at 15 percent support among Democrats in the primary system.  The campaign was dull.  She looked befuddled.  not as befuddled as Mr.  Biden, but confused.  She changed her positions on a lot of different things.  Really, nobody could get a handle on who she is.  So what the deuce are San Francisco values?  Well, as I said on the radio this morning on the O'Reilly Update, and I hope you check that out on BillOReilly.com.  We post every day if you don't get it in your town.  Here is the rundown of San Francisco values.  Okay, avoidance of religion, secularism rules, inclusion is everything, lax border enforcement, free citizenship, amnesty for all undocumented here, and a fast track to vote.  That's very important.  So if you give citizenship to all the undocumented in the United States, about 15 to 20 million people, and you fast-track them to the boat, the Republican Party pretty much disappears.  We become a one-party country if that happens.  No due process.  This is my beef with Kamala Harris.  She does not believe in due process.  All accusations are convictions in her mind, and we'll prove that in a minute.  Low crime enforcement.  Now, from a DA and an attorney general, He doesn't want to incarcerate.  He doesn't want to do any of that.  Me too?  Absolutely.  Political correctness?  Okay, fine.  Green New Deal?  We love it.  These are all San Francisco values, and she's in 100%.  There is nothing about Senator Harris.  that goes against the far-left orthodoxy.  Nothing.  She has no dissenting opinions.  Now, why would Joe Biden... who has a record of being a moderate.  He's not any longer.  Joe Biden is what the far left tells him to be.  That's who he is now.  Why would he select her?  Two reasons that Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris.  Now, you'll hear from the right that Biden wasn't involved in a decision.  They just told him what to do.  That's not true.  Biden was involved with the decision.  There was debate in his crew.  The older guys like Chris Dodd, these people didn't want Harris, but the younger people did and the minorities did.  They favored her.  So she got it.  She was chosen for one primary reason, to attack Donald Trump.  She is considered the most vicious of all the Democratic politicians in contention for VP.  Whitmer is pretty vicious in the governor of Michigan, but Whitmer isn't a person of color.  So Harris basically checked off this box.  So her job in the next two and a half months is to attack Trump in unprecedented ways.  Remember, Donald Trump's still the president of the United States.  Well, you're gonna see going to be unbelievable.  And the second reason she was chosen was because in response, it is difficult to kick back at Senator Harris.  And when Trump does, and the Trump supporters do, they will be branded racists and misogynists.  That label, no matter what the counterattack is on Ms.  Harris, racist, misogynist, and you say anything negative about her, bring up her voting record, you say anything bad, that's what you are.  Okay.  Will it work?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay. ",

Here's what Harris said in March of 2020.  Quote.  Tara Reid has a right to tell her story and she shouldn't face any repercussions for that.  But the Joe Biden I know is somebody that really has fought for women and empowerment of women and women's equality and rights.  Unquote.  Well, that's a little bit different than 2019 when Harris was running against Biden, is it not?  We had a little thunder action here in New York City.  Don't get scared.  I'm all right.  OK, so what happened?  Well, she knew.  that she was being considered for VP.  So Kamala Harris believed all the women in 2019, but not so much in 2020.

Because there are not enough wealthy, affluent people in the country to pay for it.  And corporations are going to move overseas.  They're already starting.  It's already started.  Because a lot of people think Biden-Harris is going to win.  Say goodbye.  They're leaving.  Not going to pay it.  what the Democrats want to tax in the corporate realm.  All right, finally, another sound bite.  I mean, I know you know.  I know you know.  But I think this is all instructive to get on the record.  So my main beef with Kamala Harris is that she does not believe in due process.  In this country, you are innocent until proven guilty.  Proven guilty.  Just because somebody lodges an allegation doesn't mean you did it or you're guilty.  but not to Kamala Harris, who was the Attorney General of California.  She believes all accusations from women, all of them.  She didn't check out the eight women who attacked Biden, but she said she believed all of them.  Every one of the eight Kamala Harris believed.  But now she doesn't believe them because she's running with Joe Biden.  On Brett Kavanaugh, Kamala Harris was out Outrageous.  Roll tape. ",

And the GoFundMe stuff.  And her own radical left attorney said that one of the reasons Ms.  Ford went after Brett Kavanaugh is because of abortion.  Said it.  So, let's sum it up.  Senator Harris, third most liberal on Capitol Hill.  Third.  Skin color means nothing.  wasn't chosen for her skin color.  Gender means a little bit, but not a lot.  Chosen because she will attack Trump in a vicious way.  And if you go back at her, then the left and the Democratic Party will label you a bigot, a racist, and a misogynist.  What they'll do, all right?  So she's got this kind of protective shield around her.  The most important thing for you as an American citizen to remember is that there is a chance, and I hope it doesn't happen, that Joe Biden will not make it.  Will not make it in his four years if he wins.  All right, for a variety of reasons.  Do you want Kamala Harris?  Really, even you liberal Democrats, and I know you listen to what I say, you really want her?  Because she would demolish the United States of America as we know it.
