Who waits on hold to say, I don't believe in a God, but I can debunk atheism.  Right.  And atheism is a religion based on blind assumptions about a God that I don't believe in, that I think babies conceive of, but they can't because they can conceive of or they can understand God, but they can't understand a concept.
