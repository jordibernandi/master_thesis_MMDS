            "text": "Thank you.  The amount of people who can vote by mail has gone up to 62 million thanks to efforts by states who expand access to mail-in voting as a safe alternative to in-person voting.  Thanks to this new playing field, Republicans are hell-bent on sowing mistrust in voting by mail.  At a Wilmington, North Carolina rally for Trump, the racist rapist advised his cultists to vote twice if necessary, once by mail and once in person, aka voter fraud.  The North Carolina State Board of Elections released a statement advising people not to follow the president's advice.  Among likely and registered voters, Trump has a 43.9% approval rating.  During the middle of a failed pandemic response, high unemployment rates, and an endless list of scandals, that number seems pretty damned high.  Depending on who you ask, Biden's less than total lead over Trump is due to a lack of excitement for the current Democratic platform.  While the Republican Party's platform is laughably non-existent, the Democrats' platform doesn't endorse Medicare for All, doesn't call to defund the police or abolish ICE or fracking, doesn't support legal weed, and doesn't back free college for all.  Instead, the Democratic platform calls for increasing the supply of affordable housing, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, increasing the child tax credit, eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035, decriminalizing weed and giving states the option to fully legalize, making DC a state, and giving Puerto Rico the option.  Also, making public colleges and universities free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 a year.  Remember in a past episode of Lectual Says when I noted that most Americans are not as radical as social media makes our population appear to be?  No Democrat who wants to run for president and win will be able to call for the abolishing or even the defunding of police in this time period.  This is not me being negative or a centrist, but pragmatic and rational.  Polls and surveys and my own conversations with people as well as scrolling internet forums and comment sections has told me that most Americans do not fuck with abolishing the police.  Don't yell at me.  Accept this shit.  Please.  Do we deal with this and we think of solutions or do we ignore it?  There are limits to what can be done inside of electoral politics as well as outside of them.  How many of our fellow Americans are dedicated to either electoral or grassroots politics?  The Democrats party platform is admirable to some liberals and doesn't go far enough for most radical leftists.  For any of it to become implemented, legislation would need to pass through the House and the Senate.  For those of us who forget that progressive legislation is often halted by Republicans and a handful of moderate Democrats, let this serve as a sobering reminder.  Democrats must take over the Senate and abolish the filibuster, a regular tool abused by Republicans to stall and kill legislation.  Otherwise, we will continue moving towards a right-wing government supported by ex-democrats who think the party that actually tries to be progressive is worse than the party that relies on racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and voter suppression to stay in power.  Do we want to stay in the same position?  move forward a tiny bit, or let the right wing completely engulf us.  Four more years of a Trump presidency means more conservative judges appointed for life, and that's bad enough.  But if Biden is elected and we still end up with six more years of a Republican-controlled Senate, there is no fighting chance for any kind of progressive legislation for women, for minorities, or for the environment.  In four years from now, people will again act like the Democrats are worse than Republicans.  Many of those same people will probably be branded card-carrying members of QAnon, whose influence is only growing and becoming more mainstream.  Wealthy Republican donors are helping elect QAnon conspiracy theorists like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to Congress.  These wealthy donors include the chairman of the board of the Heritage Foundation and groups connected to the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and his wife.  At the time of me filming this video, it's just been announced that Greene's Democratic opponent has just dropped out of the race, making her road to Congress basically guaranteed.  Marjorie Taylor Greene has compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK, said Muslims shouldn't work in the government, and pushes the absolutely baseless theory that Trump, Trump is battling against pedophilic child trafficking Democrats and celebrities.  In the coming months, there will be more people, especially black ones, falling into QAnon conspiracies, ignoring that the internet cult's declaration to save the children was born in racist Nazi chat rooms.  I can't predict exactly how this will play out in politics, but I expect it to embolden more black conservatives to push regressive economic policies that benefit the wealthy while they act like anybody against doing so are at best, wet ass pussy sex workers work deviants, or at worst, pedophiles and traffickers of children.  If they won't address how their calls for business deregulations and rounding up undocumented citizens worsens sex trafficking and contributes to the even more common condition of labor trafficking, they'll blame the gays and the whores and the liberals.  And going back to that thing I just said about Democrat candidates not calling for abolishing the police, you can bet your fucking bottom dollar that the moment they do, Republicans who hate Black Lives Matter protesters and QAnon adherents who believe Democrats endorse pedophilia will swarm.  Centrists, easily won over by misinformation and conspiracies, God, that's a lot of people, will join the Republicans in droves.  In short, expect the sexual abuse of children, often ignored or excused in familial settings or religious groups like Mormons, the Amish, and Evangelicals, to become another tool of the culture war that lends to the power of the conservative right.  So what is the reality we have to face?  Centrist Democrats are either malevolent or playing by the rules of the political game by compromising with those across the aisle.  Progressive Democrats are damned to demand things that will be misconstrued and weaponized, but they also have to play along with the political game to maintain their position, while also always at risk of being discarded as traitors by constituents who don't feel they are radical or moderate enough.  Meanwhile, actual calls for revolution and a destruction of the binary political parties will continue to fall on deaf ears because many people do not care about classism, or they are too invested in conspiracy theories, religious order, racism, and misogyny.  All the while, Republicans who suck wholeheartedly will lie, steal elections, and promote bigotry and poverty because its constituents will never hold the parties to the same standards that say leftists do to potential allies or representatives.  Some of those same leftists would rather put up with another four years of Trump and the ensuing consequences rather than concede a victory to the moderate Biden.  I really fear for the future if right-wing power continues to grow, and at this rate, it will.  mainly in the arenas of housing, cost of living, women's rights, and climate change.  My head hurts and I'm tired.  I don't want to say we're doomed, but we might be doomed.  No matter what happens in November, shit is about to be contentious.  If Trump wins, people are going to be pissed.  If Trump loses, people are going to be pissed.  No matter what happens, I'm just, I'm not ready.  So enjoy this time we got now, because shit's about to be kicked in overdrive.  First of all, the sheer amount of misinformation, in addition to the dissenting opinions within the radical left, makes these two words mean different things for different people.  Somebody somewhere will be upset with my interpretation of these ideologies, but here we go anyways.  Those who are calling for dismantling the police like their more radical peers, the abolitionists, believe that reforms such as consent decrees and department investigations aren't working.  And as I explained through the mafia that are police unions, this is true.  Reforms are regularly rendered ineffective or ultimately pointless.  Some police unions even encourage their members to ignore rules, knowing that they won't be held accountable.  Dismantlers and abolishers also point out that many cops spend most of their time issuing traffic citations, responding to noise complaints and misdemeanors, and hitting ticket or arrest quotas, not solving actual crimes.  The FBI found that with the current police force, you have a nearly 40 to 50% chance of getting away with murder or assault.  and only 35% of rape cases are solved a year.  Cops are also responsible for a large amount of sexual violence themselves, with 35 states not explicitly defining sex between officers and detainees as non-consensual.  By the way, no cop should be allowed to have sex with detainees ever because it's an abuse of power and gives cops the incentive to ignore any notion of consent.  So dismantlers want to delegate cops' tasks to others, like community care workers for mental health checks and changing the function of police departments.  For example, many have touted the story of Camden, New Jersey, where the police force was dismantled and rebuilt.  The new police force is larger than the older one, but police violence and crime are down, and cops are directed to distribute warnings instead of tickets.  Cops there are also supposed to de-escalate peacefully rather than immediately resorting to deadly force.  This basically sounds like reform to me and hardened abolitionists, but hey, the dismantlers love the Camden example.  Eugene, Oregon has a team called CAHOOTS, who designate medics and crisis workers to respond to mental health emergency situations instead of cops.  In 2018, CAHOOTS responded to 23,000 calls on less than 1% of the Eugene Police Department's budget.  And nobody died.  So the abolitionists are made up of two groups that agree on the problems, but not on a definite solution.  They are not the people who say abolish police hyperbolically to make the most contentious reform proposals seem less extreme to the mainstream.  There's the faction that is all about abolishing the current police model and rebuilding with a leaner police force for limited purposes.  Then there's the other faction who believe that we literally do not need police because they protect racist and classist interests and have historically done so.  It's true that southern slave patrols morphed into southern police departments and the first 19th century northern municipal police departments came about to keep the increasingly radical labor class in check.  So police abolitionism in its purest goals aims to make police obsolete by providing community resources and tools that staunch violence and crime while also addressing and eradicating the racist and classist systems that make police valuable tools of oppression.  Police abolitionists, like other leftist camps, want the decriminalization of nonviolent offenses, but unlike some other leftist camps, many abolitionists also advocate for the abolition of prisons completely.  This is important.  I've seen tweets dragging people for questioning where rapists, pedophiles, and murderers will go, and they're told they need to imagine a world where we are set up to deal with these problems with multiple solutions.  As Angela Davis wrote in Our Prisons Obsolete, let go of the desire to discover one single alternative system of punishment that would occupy the same footprint of the prison system.  She goes on to say that, quote, alternatives that fail to address racism, male dominance, homophobia, class bias, and other structures of domination will not, in the final analysis, lead to decarceration and will not advance the goal of abolition.  This is why I haven't personally advocated for abolishing police or prison in the way that most radical thinkers espouse these ideologies, because I haven't yet heard or read a sound response as to how we tackle the thousands of years of misogyny, toxic patriarchy, and rape culture that makes sexual abuse so common in our society, while simultaneously abolishing police and prisons.  Abolitionists can of course point out that only 35% of rape cases are cleared and less than 1% of rapes in America lead to felony convictions.  Scores of women are imprisoned for killing or fighting back against an abusive partner, spouse, or kidnapper.  The rapists who do end up in prison usually are right back out on the streets with zero therapy, rehabilitation, or life skills in three to 10 years.  I acknowledge this and therefore believe more police money and justice system resources should be directed towards testing rape kits, supporting abuse survivors, and tackling rapists and abusers who I do not believe can be rehabilitated.  But this is where abolitionists and I again diverge.  Leading voices from the anti-prison police abolitionist faction Advocate for a world where there are unarmed meditation and interruption teams who prevent violence but respond to it when necessary.  A world where schools aren't policed and foster joy of learning and offer resources instead of criminalizing youth.  This is a promising source of decarceration.  For example, in Connecticut, a key change to the reduction of their prison population from 2007 to 2015 was reducing school suspension and expulsions and otherwise reducing youth contact with the criminal justice system.  Prison abolitionists also envision a world where the mentally ill are treated, not harmed and imprisoned.  A world where people enter America without documents or permission are treated as citizens and humans, not targeted and locked up in cages.  Experts like Ruth Wilson Gilmore also acknowledge that it's a myth that most prison inmates are there for nonviolent drug offenses and that the prison population is more complicated than that.  So when you sort out the people in prison for violent crimes of survival or crimes for mental illness, illness or being undocumented, or victimless offenses like owning a non-registered gun, who remains?  Prison abolitionists envision a world where rapists, pedophiles, and murderous criminals are decreased because of a more informed and equitable society.  A society that threatens wrongdoers not within humane punishment, but with restorative justice, financial retribution, and community accountability.  I agree that inhumane punishment is not the answer, but despite my research, these concepts still sound vague and idealistic, and I'm not the only one.  When I have said that I believe rapists should be executed, self-styled abolitionists have agreed with me, despite the prison abolitionist movement's close ties with death penalty abolition.  When a prison abolitionist says that a repeating sex offender in an ideal prisonless community would be exiled, I wonder where they would be exiled to.  If there is a system that monitors them from relocating and beginning another cycle of abuse and so forth.  Like with all politics, there's a lack of consensus that makes things a bit more confusing to Americans who are casually hearing about these ideologies.  Abolitionist talk is alienating to most average people across the political spectrum, and I'm sure these ideas sound the least appetizing to people who aren't worried about class issues the way they care about clear, cut and dry events, like the police murder of a black man caught on camera.  And for those who don't even give a single damn about racism or police brutality, The conservatives.  Abolitionist talk hardens and radicalizes opposition.  Despite the shifting of the Overton window, I expect beefed up police unions, more copaganda media, vigilantes, and a flood of donations to moderate and conservative candidates saying, see, these crazy radicals want to destroy our nation, getting votes from those who don't understand the goals.  I also see a move towards private police and security forces in incorporated towns, cities, or neighborhoods.  if progressive Democrat areas actually were to ever succeed in defunding, dismantling, or the outright abolition of police.  As recently as 2015, it was reported that private police outnumber public police 3 to 1.  In New Orleans, local hotels already fund a private police force through a local occupancy tax.  Though primarily concerned with armed robberies of tourists, as of 2018, a spokesperson mentioned an uptick in, quote, enforcement sweeps for aggressive panhandling, AKA they're targeting the homeless.  We can also look to Baltimore for proof of the growing private police sector.  In 2015, after the Baltimore protests for Freddie Gray, the number of private security guards and businesses in neighborhoods seeking them rose.  There were 23,000 in 2013, and by 2018, there were 28,000.  That's nearly double the amount of sworn police officers in Maryland, by the way.  Some are armed and some are unarmed, but they serve as visible deterrents and call cops for backup, serving as lookouts on the streets.  We can also consider the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2012, who was killed not by a cop, but by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, quote, in contrast to the slow growth rate of law enforcement employment, by 2022, The security industry is poised to grow by 130,200 jobs, 12%.  To me, white America and wealthy people of color will respond to a decreased public police force with private ones or armed neighborhood watch programs.  I say this not to silence abolitionists or dismantlers who are so necessary for shifting public discourse away from meaningless modes of reform that we're so used to, but to be realistic about the beast that we're facing.  Various populations who are committed to white supremacy and or class inequality, in addition to people who are afraid of those who may abuse a restorative justice model because they simply enjoy chaotic violence and or sexual assault.  And this additionally means taking a long, hard look at the complex web of religious culture that has been growing since america's puritanical roots and questioning or even intervening on the values parents instill in their children before they arrive to school.  if they aren't homeschooled that is but those are different videos for another day.  despite a lack of consensus and clarity on what the ideal post-police or post-prison america would look like Abolitionists, of course, recognize that intermediate steps must be made before any of that.  Prison abolition isn't just about closing prisons, but also radically changing America.  The primary strategy for prison abolition is decarceration, or reducing the number of prisoners and therefore the needs for prisons by decriminalizing various things from sex work to drug use.  This overlaps with police abolitionists, whose goals include abolishing police unions, overturning law enforcement, bill of rights in those 16 states I mentioned earlier, and disarming the police, educating the public about the futility of reform, and instructing them to imagine a world without police.  Lastly, they want to reduce the number of police officers on the street.  As police and prison abolitionist Mariam Kaba, aka Prison Culture, wrote for the New York Times, quote, whether you want to get rid of the police or simply to make them less violent, here's an immediate demand we can all make.  Cut the number of police in half and cut their budget in half. ",
