Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders just wrapped up their first head to head debate under pretty unusual circumstances.  There is, of course, a growing pandemic that has changed all of our lives in the span of a week.  And that was the focus of the first half hour of the two hour debate.  And then things move on to many other topics.  And Biden and Sanders got pretty pretty feisty.  So we're going to talk about what happened.  And I'll mention that.  last week I said that we were testing our remote capabilities.  We tested them.  We are still working to improve them, but we are going to be continuing to use our remote capabilities for the foreseeable future, like a lot of people around the country.  So bear with us and we're going to get better with time.  Anyway, here with me to discuss our editor in chief, Nate Silver.  How's it going, Nate?  Hey there. ",

I think looking back now, you know, I'm not sure, you know, Sanders pushing Biden to the left on policy doesn't look that different than Sanders attacking Biden because he wants to win the primary.  So looking back, maybe we shouldn't have expected that much of a difference.  That said, though, I think Sanders.  There were a couple moments where Sanders went after Biden, not in a way that suggested, oh, I want this person to hew to these policies once they're the nominee, but just in a way of like, hey, I'm trying to win this campaign.

So you end up with the most liberal Democratic nominee possible.  It doesn't make a ton of sense to go after him on issues where he's already shifted to the left.  Now, maybe a lot of that is simply just like you're on the debate stage.  You have to react in real time.  You sort of revert to what you know.  So I'm not sure how much I would read into it.

I'm skipping a lot of detail there.  But like, that's not how it works in like actual debates where like, You know, OK, let's say that Biden at some points on the Senate floor talked about potential cuts to Social Security with respect to balanced budgets or whatever, not, you know, some grand compromise, whatever, not, you know, voters don't think he generally today stands for cutting Social Security.  And whether he said that on the Senate floor at some point or not probably doesn't matter as much as what voters think about his overall position on Social Security given eight years of his tenure as VP.

And he's going to say, look, I'm way ahead.  This thing should be over.  Bernie can do whatever the hell he wants, but I'm going to start campaigning for the general election.

Before tonight, I thought he would drop out relatively soon, given the speech he made, maybe soon after this debate and the voting on Tuesday.  But I don't know.

I mean, think of Trump, how many positions he flip-flopped on.  Think of Mitt Romney, right?  He got tagged as a flip-flopper in 2008, didn't win that nomination, won in 2012.

It doesn't leave room for much else, although certainly I think people remember if this is indeed what happens, and I think it will be, that this was the moment when, this was the time period when Biden wrapped up the nomination.  But it's just worth saying, and we were talking about this a bit on the live blog, that like, it is amazing and I think speaks to how big of a story coronavirus is.  Think about how big this field was.  This was a field of how, I think we had 26 or 27 major candidates at one point by our criteria.  And we finally get down to two people, two candidates on the debate stage.  And no one cares.  And I think you guys are right.  No, likely no one will remember much of this at all. ",

There are scenarios where people are hunkered down for weeks, where maybe things seem to be stabilizing, and where people are paying a lot of attention to various diversions, including politics.  So if I hear myself say that now, I'm kind of like, okay... But at this moment right now, at the very least, the only thing people care about is how their day-to-day lives are changing or about to change, about how bad this will be, coronavirus.  And I don't think this debate will be remembered very much.  But yeah, I mean, like a scenario where Biden doesn't emerge or someone doesn't emerge as a clear frontrunner on Super Tuesday, where you don't have someone at 98% or 99%, right, then that's a gigantic problem because there's no doubt at the margin that you know, pushing the calendar around could affect things, right?  Turnout could be affected in somewhat unpredictable ways.  And all that stuff could matter.  I mean, the other issue Sanders has is like, let's say that Biden wins these four states on Tuesday.  And then weird results start to happen, right?  When no one's turning out.  Like, that wouldn't really be a legitimate argument for the nomination anyway.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, that's the other problem he has.  Like, you know, is he going to convince him if it gets close enough?  By the way, Bernie's more likely to actually, if he does win, it's more likely to be at a contested convention.  Because it's even harder for him to actually get to a majority, right?  So at this convention, are people going to say, okay, well, Biden was winning everything until America became the apocalypse and no one turned out for two months, right?  And then Bernie real awesome wins there.  Are they going to be like, let's hand the nomination to Bernie now?  And prediction markets actually have Hillary Clinton as being a more likely nominee than Bernie right now, which I don't know if I believe, but that has reflected some type of thinking about, is there some giant unexpected thing that happens, even if there is, Then you might be in a case where even though Biden does have a majority plenary of delegates, it's someone apart from Biden and Bernie becomes the nominee.  I don't know. ",
