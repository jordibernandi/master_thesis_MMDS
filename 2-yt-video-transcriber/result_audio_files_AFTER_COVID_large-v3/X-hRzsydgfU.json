And then on the right side, they would say, on the right side, here's the radical things conservatives want.  Um... we want uh we want uh uh fairer taxes to secure our traditions and culture and freedom for everyone.  and then they would do it.  but instead what they did instead what they did was at the beginning they preempted the idea that the far right wants like a white ethnostate and then when but then when they got to the end they ignored that and they i don't know.  this is a really weird video.  i don't have anything else to say about it honestly ",
