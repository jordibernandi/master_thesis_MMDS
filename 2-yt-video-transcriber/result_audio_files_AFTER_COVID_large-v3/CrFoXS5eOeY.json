            "text": "hi beautiful souls of the world welcome back to my channel.  um i was contemplating on whether or not i should make this video but i think it's important to share my knowledge although it would be very hard to sum up all that i've learned in my lifetime um in just a youtube video.  this is a long conversation but This video is going to be about the coronavirus, but it's going to be a different take on the coronavirus.  I'm not here to, um... Spread fear or panic.  I'm actually completely against it.  I think it's terrible.  I do think that everybody should follow the precaution of just being safe washing your hands doing normal things But I don't think that the world needs to flip out and go insane.  I'm here to honestly spread love Knowledge and wisdom with you guys.  and have you understand more what's behind the scenes of what's actually happening in the world right now?  And have you have a little bit of a different level of awareness?  I do want to state that throughout my life I have studied so many different things.  And so, like I said earlier, it's really hard to sum up all that I know.  I've spent years on years on years on educating myself on, but just to sum things up, I've taken sociology, psychology, anthropology classes.  I know so much about government.  I know so much about frequencies and energies, about the law of attraction, about your immune system, the way your brain works, the way survival mode works.  how control works, different levels of frequencies.  I've taken so many seminars.  I've watched so many documentaries.  I've read so many books.  And that's honestly like my passion.  This is beyond the travel blogging.  That's what I do on my free time is educate myself on things that I think are actually truly meaningful and impactful to me and the universe.  So with that being said, let's get started.  There's so many things that I wanna explain to you and hope that you understand.  I want to start off by saying that you become what you consume.  What does that mean?  That means that if you surround yourself with bad people, you're going to end up kind of having lower morals and having a negative outlook on the world.  If you surround yourself with positivity and light, your life would be magical.  Whether it is really in reality or isn't, that doesn't even matter.  You create your own reality.  You become what you consume.  It's whatever you project, you become.  I've said this before in my Instagram stories.  The news is not there to be a positive life force into your life.  The news is literally negative energy.  It is created to control you and create fear and panic between humanity, when was the last time you, like sum up like an hour of the news.  When was the last time you watched the news and like 90% of it was positive?  It's always about this person getting murdered, this girl getting kidnapped, this robbery, this world natural disaster.  It's just, it's terrible.  There's nothing uplifting about the news.  The worst thing that the news have done is create this ridiculous chaos around the coronavirus.  I think it's horrible and disgusting.  I think what's super important at this time of world crisis, which I believe that the coronavirus is real.  What I don't believe is real is the hype behind this, the PR behind this, the madness behind this, the end of the world at Costco and at Walmart and no water and toilet paper.  I think it's psychotic.  I literally think it's psychotic.  It's beyond.  And I think that the news is a thousand percent responsible for all of it.  It also makes sense to me.  It makes sense to me.  I know a thousand percent that the coronavirus, and I've said this since day one, that the coronavirus was actually released on purpose to control people.  The foundation of government has always been control and power.  That is why governments exist.  When governments don't feel empowerment, that's when they start to fear.  And when the government starts to fear because they fear that they're losing control, they have to create some sort of disease, some kind of natural disaster, some sort of something to gain the power back into their lane.  It is very obvious to me, manipulative, evil, whatever you wanna call it, but it's very obvious to me.  There is a reason why a very small percent of the world has all the money, has all the power.  There's a system that is built to control humanity and people and leave people at a lower frequency.  So right over here, we're gonna have a graph of frequency.  This is like, I would say, a personality frequency, but also a universal frequency.  You can use this graph to measure humanity's frequencies or your own frequencies.  But as you see here, fear is a very low frequency.  It's probably one of the lowest.  It's just, it's not a good one.  As opposed to love, peace, enlightenment, those are high vibrational frequencies of energy.  Now this will all make sense in a minute because In most recent years, humanity's frequencies and vibration has been rising.  We have been doing a lot of very good things.  There's been gay right movements, transgender movements, women's right, me too movements, eco-friendly, save the animals.  There's been a lot of changes.  And when the universe, when the universe, when humanity is together as one in a place of love, enlightenment, and in peace, That's great for humanity.  It is not great for the people that are running the show or think that they're running the show at the top of the chart.  Because when people are in a higher vibrational frequency, it scares the governments that there will be an uprising, there will be a revolution, that there will be... And time has been passing by faster.  I don't know if you guys have been noticing that a lot of things are happening really fast as far as changes go.  you know, Me Too movement, like in a couple months, like all these stories came out, all these things came out, the world changed in like just a short amount of time.  Throughout history, people have been scared of their governments.  And in reality, it's a known fact, and it's a famous quote from one of my favorite movies, V for Vendetta.  If you have not watched it, watch it.  Super relatable to what we're going through right now.  But V says to Evie, people should never be afraid of their government.  Their government should be afraid of their people.  And once the government is afraid of their people, they have to create some kind of virus, some kind of something to create panic and fear to bring people in humanity's frequency down to the bottom so that they have the control.  Because when people are at a lower frequency, they feel helpless and hopeless.  And they're looking for the answers.  and who are they gonna look to the answers for?  Okay, God, but also the government.  They're gonna look over to their presidents and the people that are running their country and their government for help.  They're gonna feel helpless.  That is a very crucial thing that I want you guys to understand.  I also want you guys to understand that the panic and fear is just terrible for your body and your immune system.  I know a lot about your immune system and what it's like to be in survival mode and what your brain frequencies create.  And just so you know, when your body goes into survival mode, you know what?  Give me one second.  Talk about being in survival mode for a second.  And I'm going to use a reference of Becoming Supernatural by Dr.  Joe Dispencil.  who talks about how to heal your body from different diseases, from all diseases, honestly, and what happens when you're in survival mode.  In the book, he talks about your stress hormone.  I literally knew exactly where it was because when I read this, it was very mind-blowing to me.  It's at the bottom, page two.  But I knew that it was like somewhere here.  Anyways, my point is that when you're on survival mode, your body creates energy, right?  I mean, we... We eat and we sleep to create energy so that we're alive and we have energy to speak and do everything that we're supposed to do.  When your body goes in survival mode and the stress hormone is released, it literally takes scientifically.  This guy's a scientist, by the way.  He's a doctor, but he's also a scientist.  It literally takes an immense amount of power from your body, an immense amount of energy.  When you're in survival mode, you can see better, you can run, you can do crazy things that you never thought you would, right?  Like if you're in the jungles and there's a tiger chasing you, if you've never ran in your life and all of a sudden you realize that you can run faster and you can see better and you're just, all your senses are heightened, your adrenaline's flowing, everything, you're just at a whole other level.  For your body to create that energy, it takes so much.  And you need to rest afterwards to allow your body to recharge itself and heal itself from the, you know, recharge, recreate energy from the amounts of energy that it just projected out.  But being in survival mode actually takes the most amount of energy that your body can actually produce.  And when you're repeatedly on survival mode constantly, you literally create diseases and you make your immune system weak.  Literally my favorite book on planet earth, Genius, he explains how to heal yourself from different diseases all diseases how to be aligned how to be present Um and have mystical experiences, but he also explains the science of it.  And he also explains what actually happens to your body when you are in survival mode.  But I want you to understand that you are what you consume.  So if you sit at home and repeatedly continuously watch these I don't know these news covers from morning till night.  You will become depressed You will your immune system will be weak.  It is a fact.  You'll be stressed.  You'll be on survival mode, which are things that are terrible for you.  because if you know anything about how you get a cold and how you get diseases, it's when your immune system is weak.  Immune system is weak normally because of a lack of sleep, stress, survival mode, and not eating healthy and clean.  When some of those combinations are put together, Your immune system is weak.  Therefore, you're most likely and more likely to catch a flu or a disease.  I'm not saying don't follow the precautions.  Like fine, you wanna stay at home, go for it.  You wanna wash your hands, good.  You should be washing your hands regardless.  I'm a huge hygienic freak, so I get it.  But what I don't get is the PR behind this disease.  It is absurd.  It is beyond me.  I don't even understand.  It is, it's almost, it's not funny.  It's not funny that people are dying, but at the same time, it's almost funny to me, the ridiculousness level of where this thing has gone from.  There are so many insane diseases that happen all around the world.  What happened to AIDS and HIV?  And like people are dying left and right from cancer.  No one's buying like endless waters because people are dying from freaking cancer.  I'm just saying you guys, 200,000 people every year die from the flu and no one's like this.  hysteria doesn't happen.  It doesn't happen.  So with all that being said, um, now we are at a lower frequency as humanity freaking out thinking it's the dawn of day.  Like the world is going to end buying waters, being insane, fighting with each other.  It's just, it's, it's beyond me.  It's insane.  Um, so I'm here to shed some positive light also to shed this intelligence.  Um, do not let the media run you, run your life, run your truth.  Do your own research.  Look at the statistics.  Have you guys read the statistics?  Most of the people that are actually dying are 80 years old.  Did you know that?  Like now people know that more, but in the beginning, nobody even talks about that.  And I'm not saying that 4,000 people isn't a lot of people that have died, but we've had worser diseases and worser situations.  You know how many people die a year from smoking and from cancer per day and from suicide?  Veterans?  I mean, why doesn't anybody talk about these things?  I just, I can't.  But anyways, so right now, humanity is at lower frequencies and It's upsetting to me.  That's upsetting to me.  It's upsetting to me that so many people fall for the trap of what the news is there to do anyways.  But I just want you to remember that you are what you consume.  You are what you consume.  If you consume negative energy, you will become negative energy.  If you consume positive energy and light and beauty and positivity, you will become that.  It's just a choice.  It is a choice.  You can turn off the TV.  You can not go on Facebook and look at all those horrible notifications and stuff.  It's a choice.  Go outside.  Go outside.  The world is beautiful.  You don't have to go into a concert setting right now, but go on a hike.  Go to the beach.  Go for a drive with the windows down.  Get some fresh air.  Do something uplifting for your mind, body, and soul.  My personal suggestions for the world right now is to stay calm.  I know that's hard, but it's really not that hard.  Saying it's hard is an excuse.  You just need to do it.  It just needs to be done.  It needs to be a choice that you take upon yourself and decide and follow through with it.  Have integrity for yourself.  Make a decision that you are not going to let this virus dictate you.  My personal suggestion for anybody who is in quarantine at home, can't leave their house, this is... a beautiful time, like look for the good and the positivity in any and every situation in your life and literally your world will change.  This is a great time to sit at home, to spend some valuable time with your family.  It's a time to read that book that you said you're always going to read.  It's a time to organize your house, organize your shelves, clean a little bit, be in a positive energy, clean, take out all that negative energy out.  You know, it's a time to start that project that you always said you were going to do or you wanted to do or write that book.  you always wanted to write or make that music, that song.  You play an instrument, play an instrument.  You create art, create art.  This is such a beautiful time that the universe is giving you in return to be in alignment with your heart, soul, body, and mind.  to just do things that are uplifting for your soul.  Don't look at this time as a time to stay at home and freak out and think that the world is going to end.  Look at it as a beautiful blessing.  Screw what's happening outside.  It doesn't matter.  It matters what's going on in here, in your world, in your universe.  Create a home that has positivity in it, you know?  Watch that show you've said that you're gonna watch, those movies that you said you were gonna watch.  Do you spend your time doing beautiful things?  Meditate, pray for humanity.  I really believe in the power of prayer.  Prayers are super powerful.  They're also vibrations and frequencies.  They uplift humanity.  And I just saw that Donald Trump announced that on Sunday, there's tomorrow, he's dedicated March 15th as national prayers day.  And I think that's such a beautiful and powerful thing.  I think that if all of humanity, just like in, um, what is it called?  An avatar, all of humanity sat down and took a moment to prayer for humanity.  It would uplift the frequencies of the world.  Um, I really do believe that pray for humanity, pray for the older people that have a harder time.  Use this time to connect with yourself, meditate, write journal, make a gratitude list.  i have so many things like.  there's so much you can do in this beautiful time.  i know people think it's not a beautiful time but it is a beautiful time.  it's forcing you to look deeper into yourself and utilize this time to do something productive for yourself.  you know my mom always says i don't have time.  i don't have time.  i don't have time for anything.  i tell her go watch this movie go watch this.  read this no i don't have time.  i don't have time.  She has time now.  You have time now.  You know, I'm sure you've been like all this crazy new stuff has been freaking people out.  People putting people into rather mode.  Go take a nap.  Make yourself a healthy green meal.  Be vegan for a little bit.  Eat clean.  Take care of your immune system and you don't have to worry about this disease.  Everything is going to be okay.  We're all going to be fine.  We're all going to be fine.  You guys.  Just have faith in the universe and humanity, in yourself, that everything is going to work out.  The world is crazy sometimes.  We're in a crazy time.  Sometimes life is great.  Sometimes life is lower.  But when life isn't amazing as we had hoped, it's a perfect time to reflect within yourself and find truth and find peace and find happiness and dig deep and ask yourself questions that you might have not asked yourself had this tragedy not happened.  Without darkness, we don't have light.  We wouldn't know what light is.  So I really hope that this video gave you a little bit of light, a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of awareness.  Try to avoid negative conversation.  Seriously, seriously, surround yourself with positivity.  I'm going to the beach in a couple of minutes.  I'm just saying, I'm in Miami, it's 80 degrees.  I'm not gonna stay at home and like cry my life away.  Like, what do you mean?  life is so short?  What if I die tomorrow?  Let's like just live a happy, peaceful, good, fulfilled life and just never take life for granted.  Do what you love, work on what you love.  This is a perfect time, like I said, to spend time with your loved ones at home.  Work on those things that you've said you wanted to do.  See those movies.  Play that music.  Create that art that you said that you've always wanted to do and never had the time to do.  This is a perfect freaking time to do it.  I love you guys so much.  I wish everybody a healthy, positive day.  Week and month ahead of you.  Um, I hope you enjoyed this video and my mission is always to inspire the world So I hope that I did that for you guys.  If you don't agree with me, that's totally fine.  I don't take it personally.  I just wanted to share my happiness my life my positivity with you guys.  Um And that's it.  I love you so much. ",
