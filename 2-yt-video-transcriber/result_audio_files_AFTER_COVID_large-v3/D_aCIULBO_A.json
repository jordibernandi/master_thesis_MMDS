We got two non-bootleggers and a sheriff that's just trespassed.  taking the chain off the gate, opened the gate, driven in to investigate an abandoned car that wasn't even on this property, was down the street at the school.  At no time did we get any information that it was even tied to this property.  So this guy is going around trespassing on people's property, and he doesn't even know if the people have anything to do with it.  No evidence whatsoever.  He gets upset.  He doesn't lose it, but he gets upset that he had just run across two non-boot-licking people, and one of them is kind of upset that he's trespassing on his property.  As far as I'm concerned, you don't get to come on somebody's property without some kind of evidence that there's something going on there.  And this guy is mad, this sheriff deputy is mad because he ran across somebody that's not happy with it.  And that's part of the problem with police in this day and age, in the current climate.  Cops think they can do whatever the heck they want, trespass whenever they want, without any evidence of any wrongdoing.  All right, so let's get on with the video. ",
