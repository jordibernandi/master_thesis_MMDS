            "text": "Welcome to Hive Minds, this is the speaker.  This is just a quick video on what is happening with our channel at the moment.  As some of you might know if you follow us on other accounts such as Twitter or Parler, you'd know that we have had a couple of strikes from YouTube for the most ridiculous things ever.  It's pretty clear at this point that they really don't want us here.  So if that's the case, We will start building on other platforms.  We have started building on other platforms.  BitChute being the largest one to date.  I do plan this week to start a Rumble account, which we will move some of the Hive Moan videos over to that.  But of course, this is a crazy week.  We've got the election going on.  It's madness.  So I don't know if we're going to be able to do that this week, but definitely by next week.  We will have that up.  So in the meantime, please, for everyone that follows us here, it's really, really important for you to go and start a BitChute account because that's going to be the most prominent video sharing site that we'll have on.  We also have our website that we'll link underneath.  And all our links from all, everything will be underneath.  If not underneath here, then just go to our website, go to the social media page, and it will have everything there.  And of course, we will continue to build on that slowly in time.  So I just wanted to let you all know that because it is really hard to get messages out, especially when you are banned or you do have a strike because they don't let you communicate at all.  So I couldn't write back the comments.  I couldn't do anything.  This week, we do have an exclusive on BitChute that we're not posting on YouTube because, well, hey, we can be a little bit more open on BitChute.  And this one, of course, is about the Biden suit.  I'll put that link underneath.  Tune in, watch that.  From this week, we will just start again posting on Mondays until as long as we can.  So thank you for all sticking with us.  Thank you for anyone that's going from here, going to Bishu, starting an account, because old tech at the moment is so important and we really, really need it.  So appreciate every single one of you.  Thank you.  Love you all.  Have a good week.  Trump 2020. ",
