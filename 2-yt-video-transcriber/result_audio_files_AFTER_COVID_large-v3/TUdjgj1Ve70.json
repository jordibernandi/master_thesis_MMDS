They are still on duty in Buffalo.  The only thing missing from this tape is the hooded capes.  Totally, totally racial and planned.  And you can tell this isn't the first time they've done this.  Watch this.  Write down the police officers' names.  There are on the streets in Buffalo, New York, right now, patrolling the streets.  This is a much watched video.  Sorry about my voice.  I'm still recovering from surgery.  But this is a much watched video and any cop watchers in Buffalo, New York, you need to write down these cops' names and keep an eye on them while they're on the street.  The only thing missing here, guys, are the hoods.  And the capes. ",

            "text": "It's so graphic, Ashley.  And we've described this assault that sent former jail attendant Matthew Descola to prison in detail in a lot of our newscasts.  But I have to say it's a lot tougher to watch.  and fought for the release of this tape by joining a lawsuit that was first filed by the Buffalo News.  But now we can show you what happened that night.  It was May 2016 that led the city to reach a $300,000 settlement with the inmate.  That happened just yesterday.  Okay, we're gonna take you to the video right now.  You see here Officer Anthony D'Agostino walk in, followed by Sean Porter.  You see him facing the wall there.  And then you can see Officer Joshua Craig right here follows right behind him.  Now take a look.  This is Matthew Discula.  He is the city lockup attendant.  Close that door, and he makes sure that it's locked behind him.  This is where it all starts.  You see Discula grab Porter, toss him into this room.  His shoulder busts through that door, and you see Officer Craig follow behind, laughing and smiling.  Watch these toss to the ground right here, and dragged by his arms behind his back into a room.  He's dragged feet throughout city lockup into another holding cell, and you can see here, we're going to show you another angle.  As he's dragged into that holding cell, look at his head hit the door.  look at the blood you can see on the bottom right hand corner of your screen there as his face hits that wall.  all right he's being dragged into the cell.  now you can see Jaskula start to pat him down as they start to remove his pants.  they toss his shoes out one by one into the hallway again.  you see that pile of blood on the corner and now he starts to pat him down.  watch look at him standing in his blood here.  you see that from when he was dragged into the room on his face.  They remove his pants next and now they unhandcuff him.  Look at them.  He places his hands up on the wall in this holding cell before they put a separate set of handcuffs on him.  and they're restraining him here.  You see no fight.  They're putting what looks like a spit guard over his mouth.  You can see a little bit of blood.  If you look at the top left-hand corner, a little bit of blood on that spit guard.  That's so that he can't spit at any officers.  They drag him backwards out and sit him here.  Look as they toss him down into this restraint chair.  And now they're strapping his shoulders in one by one into this chair.  that's meant to hold them.  And now they're working on his ankles, restraining his ankles in this chair.  Again, he's sitting there, arms behind his back.  Next, he's dragged to a different holding cell, and that chair is restrained in this holding cell.  Now, court documents show he was left here for over an hour.  No medical attention, just sitting there.  And now we're going to watch on a different angle.  You can see as he's sitting in this room, you see one, two, three, four, five separate attendants and officers sitting there playing with their phones.  Now he's being brought back out.  You can see again, no shoes, no pants on him.  But I do want to show you one exchange here.  Watch as he's headed out.  They're taking the ECMC here.  You see an exchange in the room.  This woman, the top center of your screen, you can see her shaking her head.  There's some sort of exchange.  Officer Craig follows in closely behind.  You see them exchange some words.  She shakes her head as they take him out.  And now court documents show they're walking him out here to go to ECMC finally for treatment.  Our attorney that worked for more than two years to get this video released calls this a victory for the First Amendment.  This is a public record. ",
