            "text": "This is going to be a quick video about the election results in Slovakia.  I made a previous video with Peter where we discussed some of the parties, so if you want more information about the various political parties of Slovakia, check out that video.  I'll post a link to it below.  Also, I have a lot of material about other topics in the community section of this YouTube channel, so if you haven't seen that, Check out the community section and I have stuff about the ongoing situation in Turkey and Syria and whatnot.  Now, here's what happened in the general election in Slovakia.  So, the first big takeaway is the progressive party was completely humiliated.  So this was a big question.  Early 2019, Slovakia had a presidential election.  This blind woman, Zuzana Cepunova, I'm probably saying that totally wrong.  She comes out of nowhere, no one knows who she is.  She's using this English language term, progressive, that a lot of people don't even know what it means.  She tweets in English instead of Slovakian.  and for whatever reason she ends up winning.  However, president of Slovakia doesn't actually mean very much and voter turnout isn't very high either.  So here you have progressive Slovakia and then this is the Together Party.  Now immediately after the presidential election these two run as a coalition for the EU election and they only get twenty percent of the vote.  well this time they got seven percent.  now the minimum threshold is five percent but if you run as a coalition the minimum threshold automatically doubles to ten.  so running as a two-party coalition in a Slovakian general election doesn't even make any sense.  but they did it.  and Progressive Slovakia completely screwed themselves because they got 7%, zero seats.  The total parliament is 150 seats.  There was a whole bunch of other parties that did not make the minimum threshold.  28.5% voted for a party that didn't win any seats.  In my video with Peter, we talked about most hid a Hungarian minority party.  and the Slovakia National Party, which is a conservative party.  Both of those parties were part of the previous ruling coalition.  Neither one of them even made the 5% threshold, so they didn't win any seats either.  But there was a huge amount of parties running.  So the party that has dominated for the past 15 years was the social democrats.  smear and they're way down and this is the lowest percentage they've gotten in a long time.  now they are allied with a bunch with the social democrat parties of germany and scandinavia and the labor party of england except Whereas those parties are more interested in culture war, cultural Marxism, social justice.  They're still a more old school Social Democrat party where they actually are primarily concerned with socialism and a lot of their members are pretty conservative on social issues.  So things like gay marriage, abortion, immigration, they're actually conservative.  But the party has also gained a reputation of being the party of corruption in the establishment, and they've been going downhill.  So the Socialist Party got 18.3%.  Every other party that one seats is more or less on the right.  So the big winner is Ordinary People up here.  Now, Ordinary People ran as a coalition with three or four other smaller center-right parties.  They are part of the EPP.  Now, how conservative they are depends on who you ask.  However, Slovakia is a very conservative country compared to Western Europe, North America, and Scandinavia.  And then you've got, so the Socialist Party came in second.  Then you've got We Are Family, Shmi Rodina, 8.2%.  Now, this party is a nationalist populist party.  It's part of Matteo Salvini's alliance.  Then you've got CodeLabor with another 8%, which is an extremely hardline nationalist party.  Now, they actually got, I think, 14% in the EU election.  Basically, you could say that it's along the same lines of Golden Dawn, very hardline nationalist.  Then this is Solidarity.  They're basically a libertarian party.  Some of the members are conservative.  Now, I talked about SAS in a previous video about efforts.  by the EU to punish Poland and Hungary for supposedly violating EU core values.  And SAS actually stabbed their ally, the Polish Law and Justice Party, in the back and voted for it.  But I hear mixed things from people who actually live in Central Europe.  Some say they're conservative, some say they're not.  This is a brand new party.  that got 5.8% and it's basically a party started by the former president and it's basically a weak center-right party.  so basically you had the Socialist Party getting 38 out of 150 seats and even then the Socialist Party is fairly conservative on social issues And then you've got all the other seats being won by parties that are more or less on the right.  So the fact that a candidate from progressive Slovakia won the presidency last year, I think it was a flash in the pan.  And when the media was celebrating Slovakia's shift to the left, I think that was pretty premature.  Alright, once again, check out the community section of this YouTube channel for some more news.
