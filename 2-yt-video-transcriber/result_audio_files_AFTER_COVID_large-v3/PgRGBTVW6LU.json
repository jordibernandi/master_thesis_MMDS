There is no racism against white foreigners.  But there is a lot of racism against blacks.  And we need to stop this thing right now.  We need to stop it.  If we don't stop it, this may end up a very big cost on this Deutschland.  This may end up a very, very big cost on this Deutschland from God.  God will punish all of us.  God will punish all of us.  I have said it.  I have said it now.  And God is already there doing it.  Why is it that this virus is just attacking us?  It's not attacking blacks like that.  It's only attacking the whites.  Because of what?  God is punishing us.  Wake up.  Love one another.  Love one another.  For you have to know that blacks are the first creature of God.  And if anyone deals with them, God will deal with you.  May God bless us all.  Bye-bye. ",
