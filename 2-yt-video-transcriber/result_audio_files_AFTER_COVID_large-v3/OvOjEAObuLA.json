            "text": "We talk excitement, enthusiasm, all of that a lot when it comes to this particular election, these particular candidates.  You've got President Donald Trump, who's got perhaps the most epic following and passionate followers that we've seen of any political candidate or political figure in a long, long time, if not ever.  And then we've got Joe, who's very sleepy.  perhaps unaware of where he is.  And literally, the contrast is crazy.  He's the exact opposite of Trump.  There's no excitement for him within his party or on the outside of his party.  But this was Trump.  Both candidates are on the campaign trail.  This was Trump rolling down the strip like a boss in Vegas.  Got his caravan there.  which obviously any president is going to have that caravan.  It's the Secret Service.  But he rolls right down.  Everyone's excited.  This was when he was out there, the line just to get into his Trump rally, which extends forever.  I mean, you can see it.  And we cut the audio because it's got music that we're not licensed to use.  But the line goes on forever.  And they wait there.  Nevada, not a cool state either, by the way.  They wait there to get in to see President Trump because, again, there is unmatched, unrivaled enthusiasm and passion for who he is, what he has done for this country.  Is he the perfect communicator?  Is he the most traditionally presidential guy?  No.  Is he who America elected?  Yes.  Is he who I think America is going to elect again?  Yes.  Yeah.  Because, again, you look at that excitement.  You can look at whatever polls you want out there.  Check out one of these rallies.  Check out the footage from one of these rallies even before, such as we just showed you there.  And you will see why.  conservatives should feel good.  they shouldn't feel complacent.  people need to get out and vote and people need to be aware of what's going on and the garbage that the mainstream media and the democrats are feeding you.  but that scares the democrats.  you know why?  because on the other side they have this.  this was a biden latinos for biden parade getting ready to ramp up in in vegas and this is about as ramped up as it got.  You can see a sparse, for those of you listening to the podcast, sparse parking lot.  And it's kind of the cameras panning right to left like the Trump crowd did that just kept going forever.  You kind of think that's maybe going to be the case.  You're like, all right, maybe the cars are just socially distanced.  No, it just ends.  There's no excitement.  There's no excitement.  And you know why?  There's no excitement because he continues to give everyone reasons not to be excited.  He continues to do stuff like this.  This was him in Michigan. ",

But again, I'm not running for president.  Big difference.  Very, very big difference.  But he stumbled through the whole thing.  But not only did he stumble through it in terms of stepping on himself, he got all of his data wrong.  There weren't over 100,000 cases in the military.  There are not 6,000 deaths in the military.  There are 7,000. seven deaths in the military from COVID, which are seven too many.  We don't know whether they were complications, whether it was really a different death that the person also had COVID like we see so many other times.  It's seven too many regardless.  But seven is not 6,000, Joe.  Those are very different numbers.  I don't know if you're aware of that, but they're very different numbers.  And the number of cases that you talk about, very, very different numbers.  And I guess the campaign came out later and said, well, he accidentally mixed up the Michigan numbers and the military numbers.  Well, that's not encouraging.  That's not encouraging.  This is someone who should be briefed on this stuff, who should know this stuff on a daily basis, because he is trying to not only craft what his policies will be based on the information that he has available to him, but to share what those policies will be with the American public.  And instead, he keeps stumbling all over himself.  And he has notes.  You have notes in front of you.  Just read the notes, Joe.  Read the notes.  But He continues to have these moments.  And again, I don't wish the man ill.  I know there's some of you who do.  That's okay.  You do you.  I wouldn't encourage that.  I think he's the wrong guy.  I think it's abusive behavior, what the Democrats are doing, carting him around, asking him to fulfill this role.  And if they had a strong VP candidate, maybe not, because I know there's the talk out there about he's just a Trojan horse to get in all this other stuff.  I do think he's a Trojan horse to get leftist progressive socialist policies in place and moving in the right direction.  But I don't think he's a Trojan horse for Kamala.  No one likes her.  The Democrats don't like her.  She's phony.  She's unlikable.  Her likability numbers are awful.  She did nothing in the primaries.  So Trojan horse for policies, yes, maybe.  But not just so.  they can appoint Kamala to be president shortly after a victory should it happen, which it's not.  It's not going to happen.  You see the lines.  You see the enthusiasm for one side.  You see how this guy is literally a gaffe machine.  And the only way that those guys win is if there's fraudulent activity, if they cheat, if they figure out something they can do, because that's not what America wants.  That's not what America wants.  But he stumbles through these numbers and makes these mistakes, says all the wrong data, scares people into thinking, oh my gosh, the military is being ravished by COVID deaths.  No, no, they're not.  And we've seen all these other times where he's out, like where he was in Pennsylvania the other day sitting outside with these people wearing masks.  And he had notes right there on what to say, what questions to ask.  It was the most awkward conversational style type event ever.  But he needed notes.  And we saw this, which you probably saw over the weekend.  This was Brett Baer talking to someone from his campaign who looks like he is 12.  Defending and not even defending, just not answering whether or not Joe has a teleprompter, which we've seen several instances.  that would prove that he likely does when he's doing these interviews, these Q&As with people.  But this was that exchange rule five. ",

But he wouldn't answer it saying that, you know, basically Fox is a mouthpiece for Trump, which if you've been watching Fox News lately, even you Democrats should see that.  That's not the case.  In the evening, yes.  Is Hannity all about Trump?  Yes.  Is Tucker... A staunch conservative, yes.  Laura, yes.  The evening programs are traditional Fox conservative values.  Fox and Friends still tends that way too, but there's lots of stuff in between and there's lots of people that Fox forces even no-shows to bring on who push a very different message.  And Fox has been changing.  But they wouldn't answer the question because they know the answer is yes.  And they know how damning that is for someone who is running to be president of the United States, leader of the free world, and can't even make it through a simple Q&A without some sort of notes or a prompter.  But what was interesting about it is that exchange happened.  And you had that kid get flustered, not answer, which again, I think makes everything look worse than it already did.
