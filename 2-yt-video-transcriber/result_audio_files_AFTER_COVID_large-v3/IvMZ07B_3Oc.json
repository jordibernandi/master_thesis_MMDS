And that's on gang, let's get it.  Hey, move one, two, three into the fold.  Snoop Dogg, you ain't been high since 2004.  I ain't your normal conservative because I'm without smoke.  And they go for any rapper.  Make your luck on me to go.  Keep trying to reinvent yourself.  You in the Snoop line.  That's ironic.  Every time I hear you talk, Snoop line.  Then somebody got to do it.  Hold on, let me get them.  How we saying Trump?  is racist but was taking pictures with him said america ain't done nothing for you.  okay but i swear that you went from gang banging to a multi-millionaire teaching kids they beat them.  don't tell them how music got you here.  capitalism is the why united states is the where.  when did trump become racist?  was it before after you was shaking hands with him?  well it really don't matter.  either you was fake didn't know that mean you fake now or that mean you want attention because you thought you strike laws and ask who behind it.  look at crime bill joe and then maybe you find it in the culture out of order.  right now it need realignment.  i'm a cone for supporting trump.  okay it's lit but you support rappers that praise murder and that make no sense.  and you do it too.  and to say i'm good i must admit but i'm here destroy it all until it don't exist.  think about the kids the future what we did in their minds telling dope having sex and talking illegal nines doing drugs having baby mamas committing crimes in the house of balls.  and right now it's the time and let's talk about family about god about country how y'all not oppressed robbers were able to get some money.  more recent 99 percent of white folk in this planet.  you can't play me like you was beating them because i'm not a dummy.  y'all imagine telling people they won't make it out of hood saying if it wasn't for the white man then they could.  i say if it wasn't for that monster then they could.  if If it wasn't for that monster, then they could.  Y'all have mentioned telling people they won't make it out of the hood.  I'm telling them, if it wasn't for that monster, then they would.  That's okay.  I'm with all the smoke.  You see me in my MAGA hat, I dare you to try to take mine off.  That's what that 2A for.  The second amendment is just in case that first one don't work. ",
