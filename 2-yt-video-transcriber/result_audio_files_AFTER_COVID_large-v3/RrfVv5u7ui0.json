Would I give him information that he didn't have before I talked to him?  Could I give him counsel and wisdom that he lacked before I talked to him?  You and I both know that we are not God's guidance counselors and we don't change his mind.  But if we don't change his mind, why pray?  Well, first of all, because he commands us to pray.  And second of all, through the instrument of prayer, we enter into communion and dialogue with our Heavenly Father, and it is an unspeakable privilege to be able to pray and to let him know our burdens and what's on our mind.  Now, again, he knows what we're going to ask before we ask it.  And yet He encourages us to ask Him.  Again, not for His benefit, but for ours. ",

            "text": "Right.  And then you have other parts of the Scripture that we call didactic, where they're not historical narrative, but they're teaching.  And in those, we're told God is not a man, that He should repent.  And so how do you square that with these narrative passages where it describes God as relenting or repenting?  Again, the way we handle that is that we talk about that the Bible uses, and here's a $5 word, what we call phenomenological language.  That is, it uses descriptive language from the perspective that we have.  It talks about the sun moving across the sky.  And we know the sun doesn't move across the sky, but the Bible describes it according to the phenomena, how it appears to us.  And in these saints in the Old Testament, it seemed to them that God relented or repented.  And so there's a condescension whereby God uses our own language and our own perception to describe what is going on here.  and yet at the same time tells us in the didactic passage to be careful.  I'm speaking over here in a certain sense, in a metaphorical sense, in a human sense, but in reality over here we're told he doesn't repent and he doesn't relent.  So obviously God can't repent of anything. ",
