            "text": "Yeah, I probably had quite an atypical upbringing to a lot of infantry training.  that we'd end up joining the infantry.  I had quite a troubled upbringing, so my original dad had been an alcoholic, had left at quite a young age.  My mum had been quite violent.  My stepdad was really violent.  And so I had the NSPCC and stuff, RSPCC in and out the house, children's panels, supervision orders, all that sort of stuff.  And I was quite close to going to home.  And thankfully for me, my sisters came along, my little brother.  And so it was a sort of string that kept me attached to the family unit.  And so I didn't eventually go to a home.  I stayed in.  But I had to get special permission to join the army at quite a young age.  I was only 15.  And I think you had to be 16 to join the army.  But my mum wrote a letter to say I could join the army.  And off I went, I joined the infantry and I didn't, I wasn't really, I didn't want to join the army when I was young.  I wasn't a boy.  that army was my natural sort of calling.  I, it was the sort of, my mum dragged me down to the careers office and I did that tick test they had at the time.  And I think, I think I equaled the highest they had in Bathgate, which probably isn't saying much.  And they said, you can join anything you want.  And I remember looking around the office, And there was a picture of a guy in short sleeve, a blue shirt.  He was all tanned and he was abseiling down a radar dish in Hong Kong.  And I said, I want to be that guy.  And I still remember it now.  It was a telecommunications systems analyst operator.  It was a big title and I remembered the title.  And I went home like thinking about this title that I was going to be.  And they said, no, it's a year's waiting list and then it's two years training.  And it was an RAF job.  And my mum said, no, he's got to be out of the house by the time he's 16.  So I joined the infantry two weeks later and I was only about 15 and a half, which would have been probably one of the youngest soldiers to have joined the British Army.  When I first joined, I was too young even to go to Germany.  And I was too young to go out to the Gulf, the first Gulf, when it first started.  and I was rear party for the regiment at that time.  And of course in those days, you could go to Ireland at 17, but you weren't old enough to drink.  which always makes me think that it's always, it's put me in this sort of bubble that, you know, we're only, we're sort of used to the environment that we're around.  We're products of our environment.  And at that age, I was sort of 17 and I could go away to Ireland, but, you know, I wasn't old enough to drink alcohol.  But it was strange times.  But yeah, I made the best of it, you know. ",

And they called me in for my interview and went, sorry, we don't think you'll stick the training.  And at that point, little did I know I was going to go down the Marines recruiting office about a year later and join the Marines.  And they obviously didn't have a problem with me.  So just shows you the sort of scallywag they'll let in the Royal Marines. ",

Well, you know, it's every F's loss and I just think that sometimes we have a weird, you'll always have times in your life where you'll hit these crossroads and it's so easy to go one way or another and it can have quite an impact on your life and I've certainly had a few of them.  and it it's not necessarily around your own fault or choosing, you know, and I've had a few times where I've had either doors slammed in my face or rejections or failures and you end up taking a different turn and that ends up where you end up becoming in life.  But yeah, I had one recently with the territorial army.  I thought I'll join the reserves.  I thought, because I'll try and keep my hand in and get experience.  This was a few years ago.  And I went up to Dundee and two, three, I think it was, that were up there.  And I knew some of the guys up there.  And they said, yeah, you just need to do this weekend at Glencourse.  And then, you know, we'll go up the fan, and then, you know, that will be you, like.  And I went to Glencourse, and they didn't really know what to do with me, but I got through the weekend.  But at the end of the weekend, you had a medical.  And in the medical, the GP says, just duck waddle to the door.  And when I did it, he said, you've got flat feet.  I said, I can't have flat feet.  I've just come out the reds.  I've just come out 2-2.  He went, no, you've got flat feet, and you can't get in the reserve.  So not only did I fail getting in the RAF, I failed getting in the TAs. ",
