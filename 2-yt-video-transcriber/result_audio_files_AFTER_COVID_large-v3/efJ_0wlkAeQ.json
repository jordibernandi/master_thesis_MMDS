            "text": "Our nation's founders fought a war to get rid of a king.  So when they wrote our constitution, they designed a government in which everybody, even the president, must obey the law.  And they created checks and balances to make sure that whenever any one branch of government goes too far, the others reign it in.  They made everyone in the government accountable to someone else.  But President Trump thinks our constitutional system doesn't apply to him.  He's playing a dangerous shell game to avoid any accountability whatsoever.  When in court, he tells judges that he's accountable to Congress.  But at the same time, he stonewalls legitimate congressional oversight, telling them that he can ignore their requests for documents and testimony and that they have to go to court.  And he says that he has an absolute right to do whatever he wants with law enforcement. ",

Now he's even telling the Supreme Court that he can block criminal investigations completely, a privilege no other president has ever claimed.  That's not how it's supposed to work in America.  No one is above the law, and no one gets special treatment.  Not even the president.  If President Trump is telling both the courts and Congress that they can't hold him accountable, then who can?  Only you.  Thank you. ",
