            "text": "That was crazy.  It looks awesome.  Okay.  So I am down here in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone also known as CHAZ and the mood here is completely peaceful.  You can see over here We've got people grilling some food.  And over here, we also have free pizza, some drinks, water, all types of snacks.  We've got people handing out bags with masks and hand sanitizer, literally everything you can think of.  And over here, is the memorial that is set up to all of the people that we've lost during the George Floyd rebellion, as they're calling it.  That's what the wall says over there.  There's like a constant 24-hour vigil.  People can light candles and say their prayers, just hang out and just give their thoughts and take a moment of silence for everyone that we've lost during the rebellion and also at the hands of the police.  And here is the entrance.  This is the west entrance to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.  Back there we have the precinct, which is where most of the violence was enacted by the police for the last few nights, the last week or so.  this is where most of the stuff happened where the you know the tear gas and the pepper spray uh and the all of the like pictures of people with umbrellas there are.  there were four.  there are still four main barricade points and inside is the autonomous zone.  and uh What?  How old is it?  She's like four months.  Oh my god.  They're getting like haircuts in the house.  Haircuts that look like babies.  Or you're just old.  Or you're a pet.  So people are anticipating on staying as long as possible.  There have been several tents that have already been set up.  People are preparing to stay overnight.  People have been staying overnight the last two nights since the autonomous zone was created.  And as far as long-term goals, tomorrow at 3  p.m.,  people are meeting down here to get together into breakout groups to discuss what's next.  You know, right now, for tonight, people are just kind of enjoying themselves, having, you know, different discussions with people that they, you know, friends, family, people that are just meeting for, you know, the first time.  It just is kind of a... jovial atmosphere but at the same time still making sure that we you know keep a focus on what it is that we're here for and so after tomorrow I can have more for you on what it is that people are going to do moving forward and what people's long-term goals are.  and However, the main goal I would say that I could say right now is that people are calling for the defunding of police nationwide.  We've seen this Minneapolis City Council already completely disband or vote to disband the Minneapolis police.  We're calling for the same thing here in Seattle.  We're calling for a complete defunding of the police.  a complete reallocation into black and brown communities where it's needed the most.  And so that is definitely a goal of people.  I would say the number one goal for right now.  There are a whole other list of demands and I can link you to some of the pages if you would like.  wow wow.  So as someone that took part in Occupy Wall Street in New York, as well as several other Occupy movements throughout the country, I absolutely am reminded of the Occupy movement.  Actually, before I filmed this video, I had just posted about being down here at CHAZ and how much it reminded me of Occupy and being in Zuccotti Park.  the with the free pizza with the the mutual aid the medics you know everybody just like looking out for each other.  you know literally an autonomous zone.  there are no police around here.  everything is extremely peaceful.  people are talking having conversations they're learning.  um you know a lot for a lot of people especially a lot of white people right now it's uh learning about defunding the police or abolishing the police is like something brand new to them.  they don't understand they've never you know heard of the concept and they think it's impossible.  and a lot of people still believe that the police are you know our friends.  they protect us and you know.  for some people they do you know but for most of us they do not.  showing people statistics about how the police really don't do a lot to protect us.  They're given all of this funding, and the funding itself is just mind blowing.  The NYPD alone gets a $6 billion a year budget.  And here in Seattle, we have a $400 million budget which is outrageous.  it is literally half of our general fund.  it is half of Seattle's budget.  and when we're breaking it down to people and letting them know you know all of this funding you know it's like you're literally creating a world where you need police.  you know if you were to take that funding from the police and put it into communities that really need it.  you know for de-escalation for medical services, hospitals, education, the list goes on and on.  There really is no need for a police.  We can police ourselves and that's one of the biggest concepts of this autonomous zone is letting people know that we can peacefully work together and we can.  We don't need a police force.  We just don't need them.  We can do it all on our own and it is difficult.  It doesn't happen overnight.  But that was a lot of the things that Occupy Wall Street was talking about.  And the defunding of of Wall Street and a lot of issues that we had with them.  But this particular movement is based around the police and police brutality and defunding the police.  So while police brutality was only a small faction of Occupy Wall Street, so it differs in that respect.  It is still very much like Occupy down here, very much reminiscent of Zuccotti Park days where people are calling in and sending pizzas our way.  And I just had a couple of slices myself.  And yeah, I have a bottle of water here.  I literally don't have to bring anything with me when I come down here because it's all provided.  Yeah, and it's a beautiful thing seeing everybody come together, but it's also, it's work.  Right now we are having just a jovial time, a good time because we have had a lot of stress this week.  We've been hit with tear gas, we've been hit with pepper spray, flashbangs.  We have seen all types of violence provoked by the police.  We even had a lunatic literally drive his car.  tried to drive his car into the protest the other day and thankfully he was.  he was stopped before he did that but then in in his panic he went to get out and he ended up shooting.  somebody had a gun.  he shot somebody in the arm.  so there is.  you know we've had a lot of trauma this last week and so we're trying to get together and overcome that trauma.  for you know a little while just be very peaceful and then you know we're gonna get to work.  because this it doesn't stop here.  this is honestly like a For the police to abandon that precinct, they're still stationed in several locations around this area.  So it's not like they gave up and retreated.  They just decided to let us have this area for right now and they're regrouping and deciding what they're going to do next.  best believe they're coming back for that precinct you know.  so um just like uh they did with us with zuccotti park and they you know they told us that we had to you know take everything down and get out of the park because they had to sanitize the place.  like something like that is likely going to happen here you know.  uh they're going to give some excuse and they're going to come out of nowhere probably in the middle of night just like they did when they raided uh zuccotti park.  uh just like when the nypd surrounded Zuccotti Park and like violently evicted all of the protesters.  So yeah, we we have a lot of work to do.  We have a lot of conversations to have but that's what all that's.  what all of this is about is coming together and learning from each other and learning about each other's experiences and talking about how we can move forward together for a better more just world.  Nobody talks to you.  My ex-girlfriend. ",
