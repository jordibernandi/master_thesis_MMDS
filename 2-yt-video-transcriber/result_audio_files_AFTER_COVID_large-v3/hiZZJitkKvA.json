            "text": "Right now guns and ammo are flying off the shelves like never before.  It was another busy day at gun effects and cloud nine fishing in the city of industry as fears about the effects of the coronavirus continue to swirl.  Normally we're a pretty busy store but I think this made it like really really crazy.  Look at the crowds people waiting to get their hands on guns and ammunition.  The I-team rolling inside the Stonewall gun shop and range blame this on the coronavirus.  What we're seeing right now is a five-fold increase in sales, maybe more, throughout the country.  A lot of stores are running out of the 9mm and basic ammunition and the most popular guns.  Across the United States tonight, several cities have shut down, closing schools, restaurants and implementing curfews.  One of the more sinister sights, queues of customers lining up to panic buy weapons, fearing civil unrest and riot.  I know some of you all are thinking, there goes all those crazy gun nut folks buying up all the guns and ammo again.  Well, first of all, we prefer the moniker ammo sexual.  Second, we already have guns and ammo for self protection.  We only panic buy when anti-gun politicians try to ban certain guns and ammo that we might want to buy more of in the future.  The people panic buying now are mainly first time gun owners and anti-gun hypocrites.  Anthony Gordon among dozens waiting for hours outside this gun store in Los Angeles.  I've always been on the fence about owning a gun but we had a family discussion about it and thought it was the right move at this time.  Lynn says some people buying now were already on the fence about whether to buy a gun anyway.  I think this coronavirus was really like a tipping point for everybody.  People that were on the edge about, hey, should I get a gun or should I not get a gun, you know what I mean?  There's people buying guns that don't have any experience whatsoever because they're that afraid.  They're buying handguns, rifles, shotguns.  They're buying it all.  A lot of first time buyers.  So that's a 20 gauge single shot.  As for the first time gun owners who were on the fence, please, by all means, exercise your second amendment right.  Buy as many guns, as much guns and ammo as your heart desires, but be sure to learn to use and own that gun responsibly.  Gun ranges are still open.  Take advantage of the people there who are willing to teach you how to operate your guns safely and effectively.  If you can, buy some defensive ammo for your guns because the cheaper full metal jacket ammo is designed for practice, where jacketed hollow points are specifically designed for self-defense and to minimize over penetration.  As for the anti-gunners who now all of a sudden want to buy guns because they realize how vulnerable they truly are.  to be a hypocrite.  These are the same people who just a few months ago were standing on their soapbox of virtue signaling, demanding common sense gun measures, crying for waiting periods to buy guns, begging for a license requirement to buy guns, yelling about ending online gun sales, and there's no reason anyone should have an AR-14 assault weapon rifle bazooka.  But now that the beer flu is wrecking havoc on our country and forcing American cities to go on lockdown, these same anti-gun people are now flocking to every gun store they can find trying to buy guns and ammo.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Keep that same energy you had when you were calling gun owners lunatics for not wanting an assault weapons ban or any other moronic so-called common sense gun measure you all so desperately cried for.  What happened?  I thought those gun laws were supposed to keep you safe.  Instead, they're literally preventing you from buying a gun when you feel you need them the most.  So many people are finding out the hard way that gun control laws don't hurt criminals, they hurt you.  All the anti-gun people in California or hurry up and buy guns now?  Can't because, well, there's a 10-day waiting period.  God forbid if you live in New Jersey and want to buy a gun for the first time, you can't.  You have to have a permit just to purchase a gun in New Jersey.  And you can't get a permit because, well, the city is essentially shut down.  So... A lot of these people are now trying to find a way to buy these guns online, only to realize that they can't.  Not to mention, places like California have specific guns that you're allowed to buy, and all of those guns are pretty much sold out.  And even if they are able to get those guns, their state won't let them carry it.  And you know what?  I don't feel sorry for you because you voted for these laws.  You thought you didn't need a gun and that the government would be there to protect you.  But the moment you see a glimpse of vulnerability in your almighty government, you're running to the gun stores like crackheads trying to buy guns you know nothing about because you never took the time to learn about the thing you hated but now want because you realize you're the only one responsible for your safety.  Now, I'm not so petty as to say I told you so.  Wait, who am I kidding?  I'm petty noir.  I told you so.  But all jokes aside, now that you understand that your safety is your responsibility and you finally see the utility of firearms, please, please go get some training.  Learn about the gun.  Learn about the effects that these laws have on your ability to protect yourself.  And for the sake of all things holy, do not go back to your old way of thinking when things return to normal.  Remember these days.  Examine your memory so that the next time you go to vote, you remember that gun control does not keep you safe from criminals.  Gun control keeps criminals safe from you.
