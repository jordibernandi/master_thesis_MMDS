            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim.  It has been a crazy busy day for me.  Among other things, I had the opportunity to minister and see eight men come to faith in Yeshua, Jesus, and are born again.  And then several are sending me clips of revival.  that is happening in Chicago, Illinois, right now.  I can't tell you who, where, but I have seen the clips and family members are reporting this.  Even police, they say, that went to break it up.  Some are getting saved, born again.  Hallelujah.  We say, but God, in the midst of chaos, look what God is doing.  I want to encourage all believers everywhere to pray.  And if you don't know what I'm talking about, about being born again.  We believe in the eternally self-existing God, in the persons of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  God the Son, the Son of God, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Messiah, left glory, laid down his glory, was born of a virgin, wrapped in flesh, lived a perfect life, never sinned, and shed his precious blood on the cross.  paying the debt for our sins, past, present, and future, once and for all.  The gospel is 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  Christ died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead, the nanosecond you believe.  Salvation, being born again, is an event, the nanosecond you believe on the Son of God and his finished work.  On the cross.  He shed his precious blood.  To pay the debt for our sins.  When you believe on him.  His death, burial and resurrection.  You are born again.  And dwelt with Holy Spirit.  Heaven bound and rapture ready.  The ABC's of salvation is in the description box.  I just want to give you a blessing before I let you go.  I am rejoicing.  I'm rejoicing that people are getting saved.  Hallelujah.  They're hearing the gospel and believing on the son of God and his finished work on the cross at Calvary, his death, burial, resurrection.  They are heaven bound and rapture ready.  Well, may the Lord bless you and keep you.  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  May his countenance be lifted on you and his shalom, his peace, perfect, whole, complete, nothing lacking, nothing missing, be yours in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Jesus Messiah.  I pray and I bless you.  Remember, God loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  Shalom, shalom.  Shalom Aleichem.  And have an awesome rest of your day. ",
