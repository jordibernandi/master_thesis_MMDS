            "text": "The world stinks, right?  Climate change is going to flood the coast, and justice doesn't really exist, and there's an election this year and I don't know how it's going to go, and even if it goes exactly like I want, is that going to be enough?  Electoral politics alone won't save us, and maybe it's too late, but you know what?  You know what's good?  You know what's been keeping me afloat in 2020?  Harley Quinn, a streaming series I had no interest in whatsoever or even knew existed until someone posted the first minute of it on Twitter.  It's very funny and engages with our modern world in a way that some other adult cartoons don't.  The series is not about whether or not life is meaningless, nor does it promote apathy as an equal substitute for principles.  It stars villains, but it's really just about the importance of friendship as the best defense against powerful entities that will make our world worse.  It's a show about relationships.  I could do a deep dive about the series.  That would be the obvious thing to do on this channel.  But I really just want to talk about how much I love it and why I love it.  Is that okay?  If it's not, it's fine.  I mean, it's not fine, but it's like, it's fine.  But I'm definitely going to anyway.  By the way, this is overflowing with spoilers.  And even though you should expect that when clicking on a video about a piece of media, I want to be perfectly clear about what this is.  One thing I was not expecting from a streaming series on DC Universe is that for a show with lots of unnecessary cussing and bloodshed, it also has a lot of heart.  The series is surprisingly touching in a way that is often absent from the adult-swim style of cartoons for not-children.  Harley goes through serious changes throughout the first 13 episodes.  She begins in a toxic relationship with the Joker, but quickly dumps him after she finally realizes that he's no good.  But like in many real-world cases, she relapses and falls for his trickery and deceit, and it is so... Sad.  Harley Quinn falling to her doom curling up into the fetal position after being pushed out of a helicopter by the man she loves is heartbreaking.  Her moments of connection with Batman, both immediately after said helicopter scene and in an earlier scene about how Batman needs to be there for his friend Jim Gordon, are reminiscent of the famous Batman the Animated Series episode in which the Caped Crusader shows how much he empathizes with her.  Harley's relationship with Poison Ivy is the center of the series, not her relationship with the Joker, as is often the case with media about Harley Quinn.  Harley and Ivy are close friends who have each other's backs, and two-thirds of the way through the first season, when Ivy loses faith in Harley, it is devastating.  When Ivy seemingly dies in Harley's arms, it is a tragedy.  One complaint about the series is that Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy are friends and not a romantic couple.  Some media portrays them one way and some media portrays them the other.  It should be noted, however, that interviews by the creators of the series and hints within the series itself suggest that that is the trajectory of the relationship.  It's only season one and the series may be building to that.  The complaint is certainly valid, but I personally think Harley spending season one getting over her ex and Ivy having an at-first uncomfortable but then loving relationship with Kite Man were both good choices for the first season.  Harley's relationship with her not-so-great parents is full of conflict.  that terrible feeling of desperately wanting approval from people who may not really deserve your love.  Her relationship with her crew, Dr.  Psycho, Clayface, and King Shark, is formed only from necessity but then becomes her real family, a family who will protect her instead of turn on her.  Characters learn that they are stronger together throughout the season and learn who they can and cannot trust.  Harley learns she can't trust the Joker, but she can trust Poison Ivy and her crew.  Ivy's central conflict throughout the season is her greatest fear \u2013 allowing herself to trust someone.  After rightfully becoming an outcast for being a misogynist, Dr.  Psycho learns to trust Harley as his leader and comes to rely on her.  Even when the crew is temporarily disbanded, he steps up to save Poison Ivy.  Dr.  Psycho's behavior is never portrayed as correct.  always the opposite and consistently admonished by the other characters.  Psycho's misogyny exists only to be proven wrong.  The series is good about staying on the right side of showing but not endorsing.  Clayface and King Shark don't have the trust issues that the others have as they enthusiastically join Harley.  King Shark has different issues.  He feels compelled to put a positive spin on everything because of his insecurities that make him think that this version of himself is the one that people will love, but near the end of the season he recognizes that.  Clayface is shockingly well-adjusted and helpful and stands tall as a great what's-on-the-inside-that-counts example in the series.  I thought they were going to go with Clayface always being other people to hide the fact that he doesn't like himself, but nope, he just loves acting and the crimes he commits related to his acting are irrelevant.  Kite Man's character development over the course of only a handful of episodes shows how his macho, dude-bro exterior is only a defense mechanism to protect his big heart.  And this more real version of Kite Man is the man Ivy can fall for.  Hell yeah!  One complaint about the series is that a character, Cy Borgman, exhibits Jewish stereotypes, but a quick glance at the writers, creators, and executive producers of the series suggest that these jokes and gags were all written by Jewish people themselves with a self-deprecating sense of humor.  The writing credit on most episodes has a common Jewish last name, and the character getting all the attention is enthusiastically played by Jewish actor Jason Alexander.  It's not really my place to tell marginalized people that they can't poke gentle fun at themselves, so maybe I should just stay in my lane on this one.  Harley follows the classic character arc in the first season, a conflict between what she wants and what she needs.  She wants respect.  Respect from the Joker, respect from her supervillain peers, and respect from the Legion of Doom.  She spends most of the season trying to impress the LOD, because that will show up the Joker.  But once she gets in the LOD, she finds that they really aren't her kind of people, and that her crew that helped her get there are her kind of people.  What she wants is respect, but what she needs is love.  I have friends that love and care about me.  I'm moving on with my life with the people that matter!  And that ain't you, puddin'!  She confused the two because Joker never gave her either of those things and they got mixed up in her mind.  Plus, her crew comes to respect her anyway, so she gets both of those things from the people who really matter.  God, I love this show!  It is so beautiful and everyone should watch it.  The show is also extremely funny and its politics are on point.  I especially appreciate how it goes for funny politics, basically stating the explicit opinion of the series, sometimes directly to the audience, in a way that the sincerity of how it's said is itself part of the joke.  That's just a poor person bank!  We robbed a real one with a vault and money and predatory lending practices! ",

            "text": "I love where the series plants its flag, you know?  The upside-down universe of Harley Quinn always makes it clear that while Harley is a bad guy, she's a good person.  The structure of their society is that supervillainy and superheroism are two sides of the same coin, put together by talent agencies and phone apps, not unlike the structure of the villainy in The Venture Brothers, where it's really more of an arrangement.  I don't want to spend several seasons cheering for bad people to win or to watch a show where bad people are the smart ones and the good people are the fools.  Both the structure and the tone of the show allow for an experience devoid of toxicity and lets Harley Quinn be a regular pleasure instead of a guilty one.  Some bad guys in the series, however, are just bad people, like the Joker and Queen of Fables, but Harley has a line she won't cross and makes it clear that she won't kill innocent people.  Frankly, when she crushes the leg of this pharma-bro looking guy, I passed absolutely no judgement on her.  That's it.  Wow.  A whole week where I'm not a total Cassandra about the end being extremely nigh.  It feels good.  Tune in next week when I definitely return to status quo.  You're not my dad.  That is contrary to what she said.  You two stole my family jewels.  Your balls.  Oh, grow up, Sinestro.  I know that was you.  You have no proof.  Hello, Arthur.  David, it's not always about you.  But it's not not about me either. ",
