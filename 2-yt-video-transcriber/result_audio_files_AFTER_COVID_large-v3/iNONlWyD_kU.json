So she's going to create a male account and then she's going to have the experience of trying to get women on that app to date her.  Sada is a smart girl and she's pretty sympathetic to male struggles.  So she probably appreciates on a cognitive level that this is not going to be easy.  That being a man on one of these dating apps is not easy.  But I'm curious to see her journey as she actually goes through the experience of being in a man's shoes and trying to chat up women.  All right, let's go ahead and give her a call.  Hi Sada, how are you doing? ",
