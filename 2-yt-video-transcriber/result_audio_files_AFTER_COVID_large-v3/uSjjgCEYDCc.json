            "text": "Yesterday evening, right after our first Diem25TV event, my phone rang.  It was Julian, from prison.  It wasn't the first time that he honoured me with one of the few phone calls that are allowed to him.  Immer wenn ich seine Stimme erkenne, \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigen mich starke Emotionen.  Vor allem Schuldgef\u00fchle aufgrund der Vorstellung, dass er, nach dem Auflegen, an diesem d\u00fcsteren Ort bleiben wird.  Und dies wegen seiner Entscheidung, uns dar\u00fcber zu informieren, was die M\u00e4chtigen in unserem Namen ohne unser Wissen oder unsere Zustimmung getan haben.  Julian wanted to talk about the effects of Covid-19 on the world in which we live and of course also about his case.  He noticed that Jeremy Corbyn's election manifesto, which the establishment had described as too radical, now appears incredibly moderate.  We laughed about the indifference of those who said to the people in Great Britain that it was irresponsible to provide a few dozen billion for an appropriate financing of the NHS, social care for everyone, broadband, internet access for the public, the transfer of rail traffic into public possession so that it works in accordance with the law.  After all, they were the same people who now, where big business and capitalism in general are in serious trouble, have apparently discovered a money tree and announce that billions should be pumped into the economy.  Julian did not know, how should he know, if the prison authorities deny him access to the newspapers, the internet and even BBC Radio 4, that Boris Johnson had announced the upcoming nationalization of the railway lines yesterday, since private individuals in the midst of a national emergency can never perform a decent service.  After a few minutes in which we were allowed to indulge ourselves in the waterloo of the neoliberals, in the hands of an RNA with which this system simply could not cope without letting go of all its previously considered safe conditions, we discussed what this would mean for our future.  Julian said quite rightly that this new phase of the crisis makes it at least clear to us that everything is possible.  And I added that everything, however, is enough from the best possible to the worst possible developments.  Whether the epidemic is used to form a better or worse society will of course depend on us, whether it manages to connect with the progressive.  Because if we fail, the bankers, the SPIVs, the oligarchs and the neo-fascists will prove again, just like in 2008, that they are the ones who know how to use a crisis.  Will we succeed?  Julian had a hopeful remark about this.  At least transnational organizations like Wikileaks and DiEM25 have refined the digital tools for online debates and campaigns, long before Covid-19 hit the plan.  In a way, we are better prepared than others.  Then we talked about his case.  His imprisonment conditions are worsening.  Now that the visits have been set up, the isolation is worse.  His lawyers are in the process of applying for a release against Kaution at court.  If the health of a prisoner in the high-security prison Belmarsh is endangered by a Covid-19 infection, then that of Julian.  Will the court give him a caution?  That is unlikely.  Will the new crisis change the chances of its delivery?  We agreed that the answer to the last question is probably, but only minimally, now that the national security complex in the USA and in Great Britain has things to fear that did not play a role a few weeks ago.  Our conversation lasted ten minutes and one second.  Then the prison director interrupted the line.  The man who knows the dangers and pains of isolation better than all of us, reported to me to give me, us, a ten-minute lesson on how to remain in mind despite being locked up.  Don't be deceived, dear readers.  Julian is fighting to keep his abilities, not to lose his mind.  Every day he struggles for hours in loneliness, against darkness and despair.  If he sounds clear and funny on the phone, then because he has worked for 20 hours for the moment in which he can convey his side of the story, his thoughts to the outside world.  No one should have to live like that.  And so it is that Julian's emergency, his views, and now that we are all in a certain state of isolation, we have to commit ourselves to staying inside and to discover in ourselves the strength and solidarity that is necessary to ensure that this crisis is not wasted, that the sick and corrupt powers that exist will not be used again.
