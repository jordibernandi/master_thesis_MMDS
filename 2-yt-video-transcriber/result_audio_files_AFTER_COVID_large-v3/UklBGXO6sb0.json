            "text": "Hello beautiful ladies and welcome to today's video where we're going to be talking about modesty, why it's important, and why it doesn't mean looking like garbage.  Modesty.  It's a concept that some women truly hate.  It's also a concept that a lot of women embrace.  First off, what is it?  Modesty is dressing in a way that doesn't sexualize your body.  I get the appeal of not wanting to dress modestly all the time.  Even for those of us who do dress modestly, sometimes it's hard.  It's fun to dress in a way that makes you desirable.  It's fun to be noticed.  But the question is, who do you want to be desirable to?  And do you want to be noticed for being beautiful or being sexy?  Modesty is about treating your body with respect.  It's about recognizing reality.  That men are visual creatures, not emotional ones.  It's about leaving things to the imagination.  It's about dressing beautifully and attractively, but not garishly.  It's about embracing femininity.  And it's about dressing in public in a way that's appropriate for everyone, from children to grandparents to moms and dads.  Modesty is a way for you to respect yourself and respect others.  When you go to the park and you're surrounded by families with children, is it fair to dress in a way that's distracting?  No.  Instead, dress in a way that's appropriate for the occasion.  When you meet a guy and immediately have a connection, you have one chance to make an impression.  Do you want him to leave having your body at the forefront of his mind or you as a person?  If you are wearing something incredibly revealing, it will be difficult for him to focus on your personality.  Instead, he might be focusing on your physical appeal.  Of course there are men who will look at you this way no matter what.  But more men will think of you as a sex object if you dress like one than if you dress like a lady.  Does that mean you should look like garbage when you meet someone?  Absolutely not.  You should look attractive.  But if you're dressing immodestly, you're not leaving anything to his imagination.  And you're not giving him an opportunity to get to know you.  I'm guessing you don't want to attract the kind of man who is only looking to spend one night with you.  But when you dress immodestly, men are wired to have one thing on the brain.  When you go to a work meeting, do you want to have cleavage and legs showing?  No.  You want the people there to listen to you and engage with your ideas, not your sexuality.  Dressing modestly is such a feminine thing to do because it accentuates your figure instead of revealing it.  And here's the thing.  You can dress modestly and beautifully.  There are so many examples of this.  Look at Kate Middleton, Michelle Obama, and Ivanka Trump.  Nobody looks at them and thinks, wow, they're frumpy.  But in today's day and age, where everything goes, it's hard to know what's modest and what's not.  Women like JLo and Shakira dancing in sparkly leotards and being praised for their bodies doesn't really help either.  Because at 50 years old, do you want to be trying to be praised for your body or praised for your family?  For your body or for your wisdom?  Treating your sexiness like it's your best feature is a losing battle because time always wins.  And now you're competing with other women too.  So what's the difference between beauty and sexiness?  Beauty is both inside and out.  It's about how your soul shines through your eyes and through your smile.  It's about how your external features complement your personality.  Sexiness is just about your body.  Modesty reminds us what's important.  Of course, it's amazing to keep in shape.  It's amazing to work out and stay fit.  But I hope that when I'm 50, people are talking about my accomplishments as a mother, as a wife, and as a woman with values, not my muscle tone.  So what does modesty really mean?  It means not wearing something that shows off every curve and crevice of your body when it might be better off left in the bedroom.  It means not wearing something that could easily be mistaken for lingerie.  It means not wearing something you'd be embarrassed to see your family in.  I get the pull toward wanting to dress immodestly and I'm not criticizing anyone for it.  I'm just offering you an alternative.  So ladies, let's be classic and let's dress like the ladies we are.  I'm hoping to do some more videos on how to dress modestly and fashionably, what the difference is between beauty and sexiness, and why making everything about sexiness isn't good for society as a whole.
