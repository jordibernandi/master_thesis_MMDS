            "text": "Hey y'all, so I figured since my face is starting to look like a Guy Fawkes mask, I should talk about some internet dumb shit.  You know, dumb shit's in right now.  It's a big year for dumb shit.  So it checks out that the dumbest fucking shit in the history of stupidity has emerged this year, QAnon.  Now, if you never heard of QAnon, basically an anonymous message board poster named Q had a bunch of critical information about the sinister machinations behind the scenes in this country and determined that the best thing to do with said information would be to distribute it piecemeal to a bunch of idiots on the internet.  Yeah, as you can see, this is just dumb up top.  This is stupid right out the gate.  And I haven't even gotten to the claims yet.  And believe it or not, it gets so much more dumb.  You ready?  Here goes.  Q's followers believe that there exists a global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophilic cannibals.  who capture, traffic, and feed upon children in order to maintain their youth and power.  Now, right about now, you might be thinking, that was just a heavy metal mad lib.  And you're right.  It's like they just drew randomly from a big old sack of things that piss off dumb moms.  But there's more.  This cabal of Jewish sex vampires or whatever, they run the world, see?  And they always have, but it's okay.  There's hope.  And that hope's name is Donald J. Trump.  According to Q, Trump is engaged in a secret war against these shadowy diddlers.  In an effort to save us and our country.  And there you have it.  Someone killed me.  No, look, there is just so, so much more.  And it is all, every single bit of it, just absolutely dumber than shit.  But that's the gist of it.  And look, this type of thing by itself, it ain't new.  You know, a few hundred years ago, if people caught a woman dancing in the woods, they'd burn her on a stick.  Imagine if them motherfuckers had 4chan.  Like, we'd bein' dumb.  Well, what makes this a problem is how mainstream it's becoming.  Like, a lot of people fully believe this shit.  And if you happen to suggest to one of these people that just maybe they are not actually an enlightened truth seeker who has awoken to the harsh reality of the world, but rather instead they are a fucking potato, they get really upset and defensive about it.  They start screaming at you about researching.  Do your research.  I've been researching this for months.  Dicking around on the worst parts of the internet and watching YouTube with your mouth open.  ain't fucking research, you fingerling.  That's not what research is.  Y'all wanna know what constitutes research for these people?  I'm a masochist, so I watch some of it myself, and it's not just the content that's stupid and bad.  The production value is like if you took a middle school Alex Jones, hit him in the head with a hammer, and told him to make a PowerPoint.  It is fucking terrible.  Here's a clip to illustrate my point. ",

Y'all, this kooky Dutch bitch just sits around circling cartoon decks and putting speech bubbles on shitty pictures of Jesus and people are like, verily she is a prophet of the truth.  I say again, nothing is dumber than this shit.  Nothing.  But it would just be stupid people doing stupid people shit if not for how much traction it is gaining.  Donald Trump is this fucking close to fully endorsing QAnon as the truth.  He's already throwing out little conspiracy tidbits here and there about Antifa and stuff.  Side note, abort Operation Chowder Mace.  He's on to us.  But no, I totally expect him to go full on conspiracy nut at some point.  And when he does, the fake news crowd will continue their assault on facts and reason.  They scream at us for ignoring the truth and then refuse to wear a mask in the middle of a goddamn pandemic.  You want some facts?  Here's some facts.  There have been over 6 million coronavirus cases in the  U.S.,  And so far, over 185,000 Americans have died, died.  America represents 4% of the world's population and 25% of its COVID cases.  The CDC says the pandemic could be under control in as little as four weeks if people started wearing masks right now.  There is a very, very real global threat playing out right in front of your slack-jawed, uncovered faces.  And you don't care because you're too busy accusing America's sweetheart Tom Hanks of being a black magic bloodsucker.  And you cannot, you will not see how fucking dumb that is.  But yeah, we're the sheep. ",
