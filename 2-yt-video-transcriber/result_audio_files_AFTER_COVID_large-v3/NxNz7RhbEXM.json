            "text": "Hey there internet, my name is Luxander.  I just got out of the shower, my tea gel is freshly applied, hair is looking like a mess, and I just wanted to spend hopefully a couple of minutes talking about the inauguration, the election, and how I feel basically as a trans person who is critical of Joe Biden and his history, and you know Kamala Harris also, but also very like feeling very relieved.  So I guess I just want to talk about sort of the juxtaposition of those things.  I'm also super digging the lines on my face from when I was wearing goggles earlier doing electrical work on my sister's house.  Anyway, I didn't make any videos about the coup because that was a little bit overwhelming.  I didn't really know what to say.  I wasn't sure how things were going to develop after the coup.  So I was talking about Calvin-Garrett discourse, which is typically not what I want to do.  I am generally the kind of person who wants to focus on bigger picture things, rather than, you know, zooming in on the discourse a lot of the time.  Obviously my content doesn't necessarily reflect that, because I don't\u2014I don't say something on a subject unless I'm\u2014I feel like I have something, like, to contribute, you know?  All that to say, I didn't have a lot to say about the coup.  I still really don't have a lot to say.  Mostly I will just say that I have some reservations about the ongoing situation.  Like, I don't necessarily think that we're in the clear 100% with Donald Trump and his base, and I am wary about Mike Pence choosing to attend the inauguration.  Like, yes, it was what is expected, but also I think that the man is trying to set himself up to run next time, which I'm not comfortable with.  However, I do have an ongoing concern that You know, there was a period of time in between when Hitler first started doing his bullshit, and then like 10 years later when he actually successfully, like, you know, overthrew the German government.  I don't know the details of that timeline, I just know that there was a gap there, right?  So it's entirely possible that we could still not be in the clear, right?  That this could continue to be a developing situation.  it will be interesting to see how the next four years go.  Basically what I want to make a video about, like why I'm here to talk to you, is that I want to express that for people in this country who have been targeted by the previous four years, um, the administration of the previous four years, it was really stressful.  even if, you know, the political situation was not presently on my mind.  at all times, like, you know, I work a trade, sometimes you have to really focus on what you're doing, it's not there consciously all the time, but it is this, like, background radiation that really chips away at your sense of safety and your sense of security.  Obviously this country's history is not.  It doesn't have a glowing record.  This may have been the first time in my lifetime that my particular demographic was so explicitly targeted.  It's like at the very least, you know, the most intense thing that's happened in my awareness.  Because this stress has been so ongoing, And it's been years.  And, you know, it's not just my group also.  Like, I have a pretty extreme feeling of empathy towards other people's stories.  And other groups.  being targeted has been really difficult for me as well.  Like, for me, it's a collective struggle.  I feel like kinship with other groups who are marginalized.  I do try to do what I can to be an ally to those groups.  It's just been really scary.  to watch other people who I care about being targeted, and people in my own group, and like, people who I do care about within my own group also, just all having to deal with this constant worry, and like, we're not sure what's going to happen, we are trying to see if we have our paperwork in order, if we will need to seek asylum somewhere, or if asylum is not being offered, like, at least have passports and stuff in order.  It's been really, really difficult.  So, I was listening to the inauguration mostly, I just had my little earbud in while I was doing stuff around the house, and it was really emotionally affecting.  I did cry a couple of moments there, you know, Kamala Harris being sworn in, that's a really big deal.  It's not, like, the biggest deal because she obviously, like, has policy issues that I don't agree with, or, like, history of decisions that she's made, but it is something to note that a woman is in this position a Black woman, an Asian woman, you know, this trio of kind of firsts for our country.  And then obviously Joe Biden himself has issues.  I do think that it is important to remember that there were sexual assault allegations.  The woman's name was Tara Reid, let us not forget.  And I think that that's worth remembering.  And it's worth remembering that comments that he's made about race in the past, you know, it is important to remember those things and to hold him accountable to what the current standard is and hopefully to continue to bring further left, more progressive politics in and, like, pull the Democratic Party to the left.  I don't necessarily\u2014I'm not saying that that is going to happen, right?  What I'm saying is that that's significantly more likely to happen under a Biden presidency than it would have been under the four additional years of Trump, and who knows how much longer that would have gone on.  Like, this does make me feel like a little bit better about our country.  I feel confident that, you know, we had this insurrection attempt in the Capitol, and there are officers who did care about, like, specifically countering the white nationalist aspect of it, the white supremacist aspect of it.  There were security guards within the facility that made it so that, you know, senators were safe.  Just an obvious shout-out aside to Eugene Goodman, who's a fucking hero.  Obviously the things that Trump did are not going to necessarily be resolved overnight.  There will have to be laws that are passed.  Executive orders have already started happening, I see, which I'm grateful for.  I know that there was a inclusion of anti-LGBTQ discrimination, which is really cool.  And it's like such a huge shift, like, the difference between having this fear that you're gradually going to lose your rights, that, you know, maybe one day I'm going to get in a car accident and the EMTs will be religiously exempt from taking care of me and I will die.  Like, those are things that you have to think about, unfortunately, because that was where the conversation was at several points during this past presidency.  And to go from that to having a transgender woman appointed to, like, an assistant cabinet position or whatever that was, and having executive orders come out on day one, basically, about protecting queer people, like, there\u2014it really can't be overstated.  how much of a relief that is to a lot of people.  to myself especially, like, I'm just conveying that to you.  There is obviously still work to be done.  We obviously are going to have to put pressure on and attempt to work collaboratively with the democratic establishment for the time being.  We have to work on being effective.  That is something that I do guess, I guess I do want to touch on, is that it's important to be effective with how you are interacting with the liberal establishment in order to actually have them listen to you.  It is probably not going to be helpful to use harsh attacking language when you're responding to Biden's tweets, right?  It is probably going to be more effective if we try to be, like, calm when we're talking about uh talking about these issues when we're talking to people who are less critically supportive of joe biden and kamala harris.  you don't really convince people by attacking them.  is what i'm trying to say.  if we are like.  obviously we're experiencing this period of relief and we are preparing to continue to work with slash against this current administration to get them to do what we want like universal health care and things like that.  it is important to consider what is going to actually be effective in swaying public opinion, in swaying the opinions of these politicians.  So just continue to be thoughtful in how you approach those things.  They're at least somewhat amenable to our demands, right?  So, like, save your ire and your vitriol for the white nationalists and the white supremacists who are, you know, still going to be present as we continue to move forward as this administration tries to bring the country back together, you know?  Just keep in mind that valid criticisms are valid, right?  But don't, like, treat them as the enemy, because they're going to start acting like we are their enemy.  if you do that, I guess is basically it.  So that is more or less all.  I just wanted to express that you should let people take a minute to just be happy about this.  I just needed a minute to be like, yeah, this is really good.  and maybe take a few days before you go really hard against, you know what I'm saying?  I see some people being critical of people expressing relief, and I wish that we could allow ourselves the space to experience that emotion before going hard in, because the last four years have been really dramatic, they've been really traumatic, People have lost their lives, and that's just important to keep in mind as we move forward.
