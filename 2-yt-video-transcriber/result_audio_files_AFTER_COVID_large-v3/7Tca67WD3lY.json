            "text": "So the first article I wanted to look at is entitled, Pastor, After God Overturns the Election Results, Atheists Will Finally Convert.  This is on the Friendly Atheist website by Hemant Mehta.  So let's give the article a read and see what it says.  Pastor Todd Coconato is a Christian member of the MAGA cult who routinely interviews the kind of evangelicals who surround Donald Trump.  In recent weeks, he's spoken with John MacArthur.  That's another one I forgot to mention earlier in my list of pastors that are complete fucking nutcases.  John MacArthur, Paula White, and Michelle Bachman.  That's why it's worth listening to his recent delusion he offered while filming in his car, because a bunch of other Trump cultists take him seriously.  Couldn't agree more.  Could not agree more with Hemant Mehta.  We have to talk about these people.  We have no option.  We have to talk about these nutcases.  Even if they seem fringe, they're not.  They are not fringe.  This guy talks to congressmen.  Seriously, we have to pay attention to these people.  It's a problem.  So let's listen to his video and see what he had to say. ",

Should we accept our defeat and move on to the next thing?  He says, absolutely not.  Opposite.  Pray, pray, pray.  Pray without ceasing. ",

How do we tell the difference?  Do you know the criteria required to diagnose somebody as schizophrenic?  Some of the criteria include audible or visual hallucinations.  I think more than three per month or something like that.  How do we know this guy isn't just schizophrenic?  Or more specifically, how does he know he's not schizophrenic?  How do we make that determination?  Now, I wouldn't give a shit.  If this was some nobody, he can work out his own mental health issues between himself and his therapist.

Like God performed some massive miracle, Old Testament God, and the non-believers saw this amazing miracle and said to themselves, I know I've been worshiping, I don't know, Ra or whatever other fucking bizarre God that they worshiped back then.  But my God couldn't do that.  I mean, I can physically talk to my God, but their God could blah, blah, blah.  That's what this sounds like.  So I'm leaving my God and going over to your God because your God is more powerful than mine.  That's what this sounds like, seriously.  That's not the world we live in.  I don't think this dude knows what an atheist is.  We straight up don't fucking believe in your God.  I haven't seen a lick of evidence that any God exists.  Any God.  Let alone your one very specific God.  The moment I see evidence, I'll believe it.  Period.  The fact that God himself has not been able to provide evidence for me... should be a sign.  Why not?  Why isn't he just sending a message to everybody in their heads just right now?  Hey guys, I'm God.  I'm real.  I exist.  Believe in me and worship me now.  Why doesn't he do that?  Why is he playing hide and fucking seek?  There is a problem in this country that is going to have to be dealt with.  These people are brainwashed, to a degree I didn't know was possible.  And we're going to have to figure out how to reverse that. ",

If he came down from heaven right now and stood in front of me and said, hey, I'm God, and then performed a miracle to prove it, if he arranged the stars in the sky to say I exist or something like that, I would believe it instantly.  I have never seen a lick of evidence that would ever imply that God is real.  Not one bit.  And honestly, with that being said... God knows who I am, right?  He knows my psychology.  He knows exactly what it would take to convince me that he's real, and he would be able to do it because he's all-knowing.  So why doesn't he just fucking do it?  Why all of this hide-and-seek shit?  Seriously.  Let's keep reading the article.  This is Hemant Mehta speaking.  If the election results are overturned, it won't be a sign from God.  It'll be a sign of our broken democracy and Republican leaders' inability to put country ahead of their own party and ego.  But so far, even Republicans haven't been willing to overturn the results to prop up a sinking ship.  That news hasn't reached members of the Maga cult, though.  These people are a lost cause.  The more pressing question is how many of their followers will eventually accept that they're being played by these same religious leaders.  Well said, Hemant Mehta.  I completely agree with that.  It's like.  I think only 23 out of hundreds of Republican leaders in D.C.  have acknowledged Biden's victory.  I don't even know what to do with that information.  It's so fucking disappointing to me.  I mean, we've been watching for weeks people talk about overturning and destroying democracy.  For weeks we've been listening to pastors.  who previously were all about the Constitution, how much they love the Constitution, constitutional rights, and this and that, and Second Amendment, and the First Amendment, and every other fucking amendment, unless it disagrees with them.  Suddenly, they are anti-Constitution.  They want to rip it up and install a fucking dictator.  They suddenly don't like democracy anymore when they think that the dictator that may rise to power will be on their side.  This is stranger than the alternate reality that I could have imagined. ",
