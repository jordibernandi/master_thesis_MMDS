Good to talk to you, sir.  What is the president's and their team's best path as it stands right now? ",

And to do that, look, they've got to produce enough evidence to convince a judge that the results of the election were compromised.  And when you've got vote margins of as much as 60,000, over 60,000 votes, for example, in Pennsylvania, you've got to have real evidence that some kind of wrongdoing occurred that affected that many ballots.  They say they've got that kind of evidence.  They're going to have to produce it in court and convince a judge that it's worth overturning an election.  That's very hard to do. ",

One, all absentee ballots that were received after Election Day, which was the deadline set by state law, which was overturned by the state Supreme Court, that those should not be counted.  They're also claiming that absentee ballots in the two big cities, Pittsburgh and Philly, where they should have been rejected because they didn't comply with state law, but instead election officials gave voters a chance to cure them.  But those should also be thrown out because other voters across the state didn't have that opportunity.  But so far, the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it's going to step in and accept the case. ",
