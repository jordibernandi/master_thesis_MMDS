            "text": "Hey, and welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  We have talked a great deal lately about some of the difficult or dangerous movements out there and some of the confusion regarding finding a biblical church or whether or not you're actually at a biblical church.  So we want to help you, and this episode will answer that question.  How do I find a biblical church?  This would assume that we're not talking about Islam, Mormonism, the Catholic Church, or something else where They would do things a lot different, believe different things about the Trinity or Jesus.  This assumes that you are an evangelical and the water gets a little muddy for you and you're wondering, okay, I really need a proper church.  How do I find one?  So, John, we think as a group, certainly people should go to a church that teaches the Bible, right?  Text driven.  So number one, go to a church that teaches the Bible.  A lot of people say they teach the Bible.  What's the difference and what would it come down to in your mind? ",

            "text": "I think the bottom line is how does the man in the pulpit or behind the circular table, how does he use the Bible?  Does he use the Bible to teach his message or does the Bible use him to teach its message?  Well said.  The point of the sermon needs to be the point of the passage.  And then you apply it to other people in the 21st century.  And so those are two critically important discernment things that every Christian needs as they're looking for a biblical church. ",

            "text": "Brilliant.  Number two, we said reverence for the ordinances.  What does reverence look like when we're talking about baptism and we're talking about communion, Kyle? ",

            "text": "Yeah, so we're not talking about capitalizing on the moment to either push the church or to claim a certain number of converts or anything like that.  That baptism is saved for post-conversion, a public profession of faith in obedience to Christ.  Because Christians are commanded to repent, believe, and be baptized.  And so that's the order.  It doesn't grant salvation, and any church that teaches so should be rejected.  And then the same thing with communion.  It's not something that's offered freely to the world.  It is something that is done in celebration of the death and resurrection of Christ for the forgiveness of sins.  So a church that practices the ordinance as well does so out of reverence and does so out of protection of the ordinances from unbelievers. ",

            "text": "That's really well said.  You see sometimes churches nowadays will just get to communion time and go, hey, we're going to do some communion.  Bread and juice are in the back.  Do it as you feel led, whatever.  And there's really no reverence for it.  People don't know what they're doing or why.  And then again, to your point, baptism can be turned into a bit of a show.  Sort of the planned spontaneity idea of like, hey, let's drop the mic and let's just do whatever and then produce it, put it out there to look great.  And granted, many people get saved in many different contexts in different ways, and the Lord moves mightily.  But if we're maturing and growing, we want to have a good understanding of the ordinances and the why.  That's a great point.  Third, Dale, we've said before, and we'll say it again, go to a church, teaches the Bible, has reverence for the ordinances, and is led by qualified leaders.  What does that mean?  What does it look like? ",

            "text": "So let's just go to the text on that.  In Titus chapter one, starting in verse six, namely, what's a qualified leader?  Namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion, For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed.  John spoke about that.  Not quick tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not found of sword gain, but a hospitable and loving and loving what is good, sensible, just, devout.  self-controlled, holding fast the faithful word, which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able to both exhort in sound doctrine and refute those who contradict.

Is that what was going to come off your tongue?  Another topic, another time.  Yeah, let's stick to the essentials here, everybody.  That's really funny.  Zero to hero culture is another thing we've talked about.  John, talk to us about zero to hero culture.  In other words, find a church or get to a church that has enough sensitivity and discipleship for new believers but then you don't have to leave to go find what you really need down the road.  Speak to what our effort is even here at Redeemer to take people from sort of the beach entrance, shallow into the pool, into the deep end and see men grow into eldership and leading their homes. ",

            "text": "Yeah, could somebody at the church go from being a brand new convert, never heard anything about the Bible, to being an elder and being qualified like we just saw there?  Is there an environment or are there multiple environments where that can happen?  In many places, unfortunately, there's just niches.  And we'll grow you up to this far, and then that's it.  And then you've got to go to a church that's more like high school.  We're elementary school.  And while men are going to do what they believe God wants them to do at the end of the day, for us, we're going, is it the kind of church that you can grow at?  That's really, this is not like which are the faithful churches and which are the heretical churches.  This is a conversation between what is good, better, and best, right? ",

Praise God if he's bringing the numbers and you're being faithful.  Love that.  This gentleman said, where do you pastor?  And my friend said the name of his church.  And he said, oh, wonderful.  That's where we send our people when they need more.  And of course, we know what the man meant.  He meant that people hit a ceiling at his church, and then they go to this other.  And I love the unity.  I commend the charitable spirit.  But I really agree with you, John.  For us, our conviction is that people don't grow here and then eventually hit a ceiling and go, you know, now I need to go get mature.  So it's been a great time here in the kiddie pool.  I need to go get deeper.  We want a church that's growing deeper and where people can put down roots and be healthy.  So yeah, please. ",

We don't, we want to shepherd everyone from, from birth to the grave and, We get that from Hebrews 6.  That's right.  And Hebrews 6 commands us, therefore, as Christians, let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity.  Not that we abandon the gospel, we grow in maturity.  Not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God and of instruction about washings and laying on of hands and the resurrection of dead and eternal judgment.  These are things every Christian should know and it should be built into their foundation.  And then we as pastors are to shepherd them towards maturity.  And that's not a call to specific local churches.  That's a call to the ministry of the gospel. ",

            "text": "Amen.  I couldn't have said it better myself.  There's just really nothing to add.  I would just... I get excited wanting to just say, yeah, the gospel is for everyone.  It's for every day.  And then we ask, okay, well now what?  What are we going to do about it?  And some of our small group leaders have been asking these two questions.  Are we marveling yet?  Are we excited about God, the basics, the gospel?  Am I even just showing an interest in the Lord?  Am I marveling?  And then after you're marveling, that's awesome.  You should love God and be enthralled in him and be excited to be a part of the church.  Well, then we ask the big question, are we moving yet?  What are you doing?  Are you serving?  Are you giving?  Are you growing?  Are you loving?  Are you preserving the unity of the saints?  Are you receiving the teaching?  Are you coming and attending and joining in the body and the life and purpose that God has?  So are we marveling?  Are we moving?  The gospel is a transformation of the heart, which leads to a transformation of life.  So four things to recap.  Teach the Bible.  It's text-driven, like John said.  Reverence for the ordinances, qualified church leaders, and a zero-to-hero culture, somewhere you can go and stay and put down roots.  I hope that helps.  If you don't have a faithful church in your area or you're having trouble finding one, send us an email at info at RedeemerAZ.org.  There are some helpful church finder blogs out there.  We can point you to those as well.  Or we do have a vision long-term for planting churches one day as the Lord would lead.  And so let us know where there's an area of Christians that you really feel a work should be erupting, and we'll see if we can be a part of that and if the Lord would allow us to do that.  Thank you guys as always for your wisdom and we are praying for you and trusting the Lord as he leads you to a biblical church. ",
