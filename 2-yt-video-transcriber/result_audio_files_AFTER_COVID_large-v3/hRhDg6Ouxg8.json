She eats less than skinny people, but she's still overweight.  That's not what she said.  She said that she eats less than her skinny guy friends.  One, men have a higher metabolism than women.  Welcome to science.  Two, she could be five foot one and her skinny guy friends could be six foot three.  So of course they can eat more than you.  This is not about her having a slow metabolism, but that's how you manipulate people.  Do I believe that she actually eats less than her skinny guy friends?  No.  At her size, unless she is really short, she definitely eats more than the average skinny guy.  Obesity is an addiction, and addicts lie all the time.  Sure, she might go out to eat with her friends and order a salad, but on the drive home, when no one is watching, she is ordering five cheeseburgers from McDonald's.  News corporations like BuzzFeed, who promote fat acceptance, always want you to believe that being overweight is just bad luck or bad genetics.  Look, all these people eat is half a sandwich with an avocado and a tomato.  They eat less than you do.  No they don't.  Allow me to show you a picture from a Dr.  Phil video where he goes over just how much a morbidly obese person eats who is not that much bigger than these people who claim they only eat half a sandwich and are still overweight.  We have four to five donuts, a seven egg omelet with a cup and a half of cheese, a full bell pepper, a full onion, and a full package of ham inside of it.  four potatoes worth of hash browns with a second full pepper and onion, four corn dogs dipped in nacho cheese, a full-sized bag of potato chips, a few strawberries, three sandwiches with ham, cheese, mayo, tomato, cucumber, avocado, croutons, bacon bits, and ranch, a large pepperoni pizza, two bowls of ice cream with caramel and whipped cream, a hand-sized bag of M&Ms, two bacon cheeseburgers, one box of mac and cheese and three bananas, six avocados, one full-sized bag of tortilla chips, ten fish tacos with rice and beans, a full box of honey buns, a full box of Hot Pocket-loaded potatoes, a bag of pepperoni, one gallon of sweet tea, and six candy bars.  My God, this woman eats more calories for breakfast than I eat in two or three days.  Not to say that every obese person eats that much, but certainly they aren't eating salad all day and doing three-hour workouts. ",

Also, Buzzfeed saying that these feminists don't shame people for being thin is ridiculous.  What about the fitness mom, Maria Kang?  What about the, are you beach body ready, weight loss ad?  What about the Peloton bike chick?  These fat acceptance activists never miss a chance to shame a thin woman who is proud of being thin.  And let's be clear, when it comes to fat acceptance, I'm talking about women.  I understand that there are men in the original video, but nobody cares about a man being fat.  Where are all you feminists shouting about how male fitness models create an unrealistic body image for men to uphold?  Or how about this?  I went to a local Target store a few months ago, and I just so happened to notice that the female clothes section was full of plus-sized models mixed in with thin models.  However, when I went to the men's section of the store, all of the models were fit and muscular.  Not one of them was fat or obese.  Try this at your local clothes store.  I have been to plenty of them, and I have never seen an obese model in the male section.  We know that fat acceptance is about fat women, not fat people.  Most of the people in these fat acceptance promos are women.  Most of the people getting mad are women.  And I defy you to find a male activist group who shames a thin woman for portraying unrealistic standards of beauty like the feminist groups do.  I don't see any male activist groups shaming other men for being thin either.  Feminists keep trying to push the idea that obesity is sexy.  That's because they know it's unattractive and men don't shovel a bunch of free stuff in front of unattractive women.  That's what this is all about.  Jealousy and resources.  Being obese is not sexy.  Tell me, is this sexy?  Okay. ",

If you want to lose weight, then you need to eat less.  However, it's not entirely that simple.  I'll get to why, but first, let me tell you about this video's sponsor, Dr.  B Real and his book, Surviving Fourth Wave Feminism.  Surviving Fourth Wave Feminism is a great insight into how feminism operates and how it is taking control over Western politics.  If you want to go into depth on how their tactics work, then Dr.  Be Real has made it easy for you.  This book is concise, it uses real-life examples, and it's entertaining throughout.  You can purchase your copy of Surviving Fourth Wave Feminism Volumes 1 and 2 on Amazon.com by following the links below in the description.  Alright, so yes, weight loss does come down to calories, but for people who are obese, calories are not the root cause of the problem.  Until the root cause is resolved, they will never be able to control how much they eat.  The reality is that if someone is obese or morbidly obese, then they have psychological problems that are causing them to overeat.  Here's how bad it can be.  This next clip is with Boogie2988 on the H3H3 podcast talking about someone who had just recently undergone gastric bypass surgery. ",

Basically, there's holes in the surgical lining.  um of his stomach and so he's literally he eats.  when he eats he's dumping stomach juices and food so he's almost worse off right.  so like the chance of him dying any day is like happening and i'm like i'm learning from him.  i'm like how do you how do you why are you doing that?  because i don't know.

He knows it's bad for him, but he still can't stop.  Knowing that cigarettes put holes in his stomach does nothing, even though it's the right answer to keep him from dying.  The reason this smoker can't stop smoking is because he's using that to manage negative emotions.  Until he does some thinking and figures out what causes those negative emotions and then learns healthy ways to manage them, he is going to keep smoking uncontrollably.  Unfortunately for him, it sounds like he was too late.  But it's the same thing with food.  Some sort of negative stress is occurring in your life, you don't like the negativity, so you use food to manage that emotion.  Until you deal with the source of that negativity, all of your diets will fail long term.  The way you start figuring some of this stuff out is by going to things like Overeaters Anonymous or by going to therapy.  It's not a food problem, it's an emotions problem.  The real evil here is that there are a whole slew of psychological problems that the fat acceptance movement is telling people to ignore.  For example, a common reason that women become morbidly obese is because they were molested as children.  They got sexual attention as children that they didn't want, so their brain says, how can I make it so that I never get unwanted attention again?  I know, I'll overeat.  The overeating solves two problems.  It helps them avoid their memories of their past trauma by numbing the negative emotions, and it prevents the trauma from happening.  So great, both problems are solved.  People come to these conclusions because they fix the problem and they're effective.  They aren't the best way of solving the problem, but they do work.  So their obesity could be for that reason or a number of psychological problems.  It can even be a suicidal wish like it was in Boogie's case. ",

But no, instead, it's, this is just the shape of my body and there's nothing I can do about it.  Not to mention how inconsiderate that is to the rest of the population who are paying your medical bills.  They are either paying extra because of you through socialized medicine, or they are paying extra because of you through increased insurance rates.  It costs way more to take care of an obese person in a hospital than it does a thin person.  They require things like expensive special double-wide KCI beds.  Their skin folds have to be washed frequently or they will get an infection.  and they have to be moved more frequently than other patients so they don't get bed sores.  Speaking of which, moving fat people is a very common cause of injury to nurses.  My mother is a nurse and she has been injured so many times from moving 800 pound obese people that her shoulder is permanently damaged.  Obesity is not a wonderful thing.  But maybe this will help.  Before I end this video, allow me to introduce to you David Goggins.  David Goggins is a guy who went through three Navy SEAL hell weeks in one year.  He did 4,000 pull-ups in 17 hours, and most impressively, he ran 101 miles in 19 hours with zero conditioning.  Then, two weeks later, after destroying his body in the 100-mile run, he ran the Las Vegas Marathon in 3 hours and 8 minutes.  This guy has an incredible amount of mental resolve.  The best part is, though, that he was a complete loser at 24 before he started.  He was a victim of severe child abuse, he was a liar, he was a cheater, and an all-around terrible guy.  One thing you hear a lot from what causes motivated people to do amazing things like lose an incredible amount of weight is that they become completely disgusted with how they are.  They start to hate the things that make them weak. ",

He turns around and sees this guy getting up, and it was the face of Apollo Creed that changed my life.  The face of Apollo Creed.

When you can't put it into words, your brain will cause you to idolize people who have solved the same problem that you have.  That being said, pay attention to the people you look up to or the heroes you like when you watch TV or read books.  I bet those people have problems that are similar to yours and their story describes how they solved it.  Rocky was a loser.  He was 30.  He lived in a shitty apartment in the bad part of town.  He failed his dreams to become a professional boxer.  But when he finally gets a shot at being a professional boxer, he succeeds because he never gives up.  even though he lost the fight with Apollo.  David Goggins was able to figure out the answer to his problems because of that story.  David was a guy who quit at everything, who became someone who quits at nothing.  He took it to the extreme, and now he's doing all kinds of ridiculous things.  Even though he has no idea what he's doing, he jumps in and figures it out.  He isn't lying around waiting for the perfect moment.  There is no perfect moment.  Start now and figure it out as you go.  Failures wait to be successful.  Successful people jump in and deal with the problems as they come. ",
