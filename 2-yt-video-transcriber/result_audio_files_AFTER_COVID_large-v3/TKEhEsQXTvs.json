Not to walk down the road with a sign out.  I have the right to protest.  You have all the rights to protest in your life if you want to.  Listen, stop for one minute.  Go ahead.  I'm not trying to argue it here.  You're trying to stop me from conducting legal activity.  Can you listen?  No, Sergeant.  Can you listen?  No, Sergeant.  Am I being detained?  Right now, yes, you are.  For what?  Right now, I don't know if you need to go to mental health. ",

He was accosted by police officers for allegedly violating Executive Order 107 put in place by the Governor of New Jersey.  He's visibly and reasonably upset for being unlawfully detained by these officers and then they even try to 5150 him.  Personally, I feel he did a great job handling this because wouldn't you be a little angry if your freedom was disrupted for no good reason?  Watch the video and please go subscribe to NJ Watchman.  His link is in the description. ",

No, why am I being stuck?  Why am I being stuck?  I have a legitimate purpose.  I have a legitimate purpose.  Whether you believe it or not, I do.  I am protesting.  I have the right to protest.  I have no other information to provide at this time.  Get me a lawyer if you want to ask me any more questions.  Isn't this so French?  I am allowed to be on a public highway.  I am not conducting anything illegal under Executive Order 107.  I am allowed to conduct outdoor activities.  Why are you having me get stopped?  I told you.  What is your problem?  Again, under Executive Order 107, which is your claim to be stopping me, I'm not allowed to conduct outdoor activities.  No, that's not why we're stopping you.  That's what he claimed.  And I wasn't holding anything up.  I saw you.  I wasn't holding anything up.  Do you have it on camera?  I saw you.  Do you have it on camera?  Yeah.  My question is, do you have a camera?  No, because again, I am not doing anything illegal.  I am allowed to stand on here with a sign.  I am not doing anything illegal.  Listen.  So why are you being detained?  Listen, why don't you listen for a minute?  No, because I want to know why.  No, why don't you listen for a minute?  Why am I being detained?  Why don't you listen?  Why don't you listen for a moment?  What's your man's number, Sergeant?  43.  Why don't you listen for a minute?  By all means, sir.  Okay.  You have all the rights to protest in your life if you want to.  Listen, stop for one minute.  Go ahead.  I'm not trying to argue it here.  You're trying to stop me from conducting legal activity.  Listen, you've got to calm down.  No, you're stopping me from conducting legal activity.  You have to calm down.  You have to calm down.  Why am I being stopped?  Because you're irrational.  Why am I being stopped?  Listen, you're being a total... Am I being irrational because you're stopping me from something illegal?  You're not listening.  You're stopping me for something illegal.  You cannot be walking up to the desk.  I'm angry because you're stopping me for something illegal.  You claim that I'm being stopped for executive order 107.  Just listen.  Can you listen?  No, Sergeant.  Can you listen?  No, Sergeant.  Listen.  No, officer.  Listen.  No, officer.  You're not listening.  No, officer.  You're detaining me?  Am I being detained?  Listen, right now.  Am I being detained?  Right now, yes, you are.  For what?  Right now, I don't know if you need to go to mental health.  You might need to go to mental health.  I think your erratic behavior, your erratic behavior, you might be a threat to the public.  You might be a threat to the public and might need to go to a hospital.  Well, listen, you have nothing rational to be screaming at.  You have nothing to be in control with.  I hope you have.  So I'm just trying to talk to you to figure out what's going on if you need help.  I don't want to be a part of this investigation any longer.  I don't want to be a part of this investigation any longer.  I am going to call mental health and have you done if you need to.  You're not acting normal.  I don't need mental health, sir.  I don't want to be a part of this investigation any longer.  I am being told by you, Sergeant, that you're stopping me for Executive Order 107.  You have no legitimate person being out here doing it all.  And again, I am conducting outdoor activities.  What outdoor activities are you conducting?  I am conducting outdoor activities.  You're walking around with signs holding them up.  And I'm protesting.  I'm allowed to do so.  What are you protesting?  I am protesting.  I'm allowed to do so.  What does your side say?  It's irrelevant.  What does the back of the side say?  I am not being a part of your investigation any longer.  Okay, stop, sir.  I'm telling you.  No, I'm not stopping.  You're stopping a law that's not relevant.  Executive Order 107 clearly states I am allowed to protest and I am allowed to conduct outdoor activities by myself.  I have a mask on, which is social distancing, and you decided to come to me.  So again... I am not doing anything illegal.  Listen, you are not acting rational.  You are not acting rational.  You're acting like probably someone has psychological issues that needs treatment.  Again, because you stopped me for executive order 107.  What am I being detained for?  Why?  Community Welfare!  You walked away again, I'm gonna lock you up!  Right now you have an issue, you're a psychological problem!  You're a threat to this society!  You're a threat to this society!  Walk away again, and you're gonna get locked up.  Stay there.  I'm in the area of Country Gold Road.  He has some fear psychological problems.  I guess Rita's now.  He's working there.  He has Rita's shirt on.  He's serving no legitimate purpose.  He's just wandering around aimlessly.  Well, I saw him.  What side is it?  He turned him face and trapped him.  Want to call Sweeney and see?  I tried calling him.  He won't answer.  What's the sign? ",

So I'm asking you, because you're in a law enforcement office, not a place, focus.  I don't care.  Thank you.  It's almost like a mental health evaluation.  He's out of control.  His eyes are pimping.  ... ... ... He's allowed to go to and from work.  He's allowed to leave work.  He's going, you know, he's taking an air, he's going and going.  Let's talk to him.  Don't?  Like, where do you come from?  Look kindly like you mean it, sir.  Will you stop?  I haven't even spoken to you.  Stop.  Lieutenant, I would like to know why I'm being detained.  I have... Well, again, you have had time to talk to your sergeant.  I'd like to know why am I being detained.  All right, listen.  Let me ask you a question.  I don't choose to answer any more questions.  Are you coming from work?  Yes.  Okay.  That's all I needed to know.  So, again, why am I being stopped?  No.  I'm choosing to stay here now.  Well, that's said.  Okay.  But if you hold that sign up to the public, I am allowed to do so.  No, you're not.  Under what law?  Under what law?  Under what law, Sergeant Lieutenant?  DeRusso, under what law?  Let's go.  Under what law?  I'm not going to argue with you.  I'm not arguing.  This is a question.  You showed up to ask me a question.  Why can't I ask you one?  You're disrupting the public.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not, because there has not been a call against my time.  Understand that, Lieutenant.  Enjoy.  72.  He gave me a finger.  You see him giving the middle finger view of the public.  Yeah.  We're just going to mail him a complaint.  All right. ",
