            "text": "The American philosopher John Rawls was one of the most influential political thinkers of the late 20th century.  Born in 1921 and died in 2002, he is responsible for a renaissance in political philosophy.  A Theory of Justice, his magnum opus, was published in 1971 and is a philosophy of what a just and fair society would look like.  before rules the dominant political philosophy for at least the previous one hundred years had been utilitarianism.  there were and are many different forms of utilitarianism but they all have their foundations in a simple premise the greatest good for the greatest number.  in political philosophy this translates into something like a just society organizes its institutions norms and laws so as to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.  imagine you're a civil servant.  you're tasked with mapping a bus route through several villages.  By which principles do you map the root so that it can pick up the greatest number?  This is the utilitarian approach.  But critics of utilitarianism saw a problem. ",
