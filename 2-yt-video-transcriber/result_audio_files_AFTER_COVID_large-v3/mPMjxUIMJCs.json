            "text": "Trade and expansion which morphed his kingdom and in turn himself into a true symbol of elitism.  Following his reign, Mansa Musa left behind a legacy of opulence.  Now, nearly a millennium later, others have stuffed their treasure chests, yet no modern man comes close to the former wealth of this long gone ruler.  Let's dive into this ancient kingdom then, shall we?  Monsa Musa was often known by an alternate title, Musa I of Mali.  Put two and two together and his kingdom was, yep, Mali.  The great Musa looked over the empire from 1312 to 1337, so about 25 years.  In our modern world, Mali is the eighth largest country in Africa, with a population of just under 20 million people.  But 700 years ago, it looked unrecognizably different.  In the Musa era, Mali was utterly enormous, it spanned across what we know today as Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso.  Oh, and the modern nation of Mali too, of course.  This meant that at the time, Mansa Musa's empire was geographically one of the largest in the world.  If you had tried to walk from one end to the other, It's reported that you would have been on your feet for an entire year.  Told you it was big.  The empire itself lasted hundreds of years, from 1235 to 1670.  But it was the efforts of Mansa Musa in his short reign that truly etched this centuries-old civilization into the history books.  But why exactly is that the case?  What separated Mansa Musa's leaders from that of the other rulers which came before and after?  While even though his time as ruler may have been relatively short, his influence was profound.  Musa came to power in 1312 and hit the ground running, quickly laying the groundwork to develop cultural centers.  He imported famous architects from all across the Middle East and Africa and paid them to design focal points in what would soon become booming cultural and economical hotspots. ",

            "text": "He expanded the city of Gao, which stands today in Mali.  The Gao Mosque was constructed with burnt bricks, a material that had never been used before in the region.  This was just one of many examples of Musa's innovations, the Hall of Audience in Miani being another.  However, his most famous development was undoubtedly the infamous city of Timbuktu.  He commissioned mosques and residential buildings, and most notably, the foundations for what would later transition into the University of Sankara.  By the end of Mansa Musa's reign, the university would become fully staffed, showcasing the largest collections of books in all of Africa.  These projects, as well as his willingness to facilitate trade and fuel the fire to a functioning economy, allowed Musa to transform the kingdom of Mali into a cosmopolitan cultural and learning beacon for the Islamic world.  At the heart of this world was Timbuktu, which served as one of the most important spiritual and trade centers in northern Africa at the time.  Its learning hub, the beautiful Jingeribere Mosque, still stands today.  Amazing, isn't it?  Despite all of his success and progress, Musa's role as leader wasn't actually planned.  The only reason he took the top position was that the previous king, Abu Bakr II, mysteriously disappeared at sea after setting out on a large fleet to explore the Atlantic Ocean.  Sure, Mansa Musa built up the cities and powered a civilization, but that's not why he remains so famous.  While the Musa name was already familiar to millions of locals thanks to his position as king, one particular event multiplied his fame substantially, his pilgrimage.  As a devout Muslim, in the 17th year of his reign, Musa set off on his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, passing through cities like Cairo and Medina along the way.  He ventured for more than a year, but he wasn't alone.  While on horseback himself, he was leading some 60,000 men on foot, all inspired by Musa's dedication, power, and wealth.  12,000 of those men were carrying four-pound bars of solid gold, while wielding golden staffs and dressed in high-quality silks and brocades.  On top of that, some 80 camels were lugging heavy bags full to the brim with gold dust, some weighing as much as 300 pounds.  Just to put that into perspective, based on the resources valued today, each camel would have been holding the equivalent of $9 million worth.  Crazy, right?  While they journeyed, Musa recruited teachers and leaders in the hope of spreading the learnings of his faith.  However, that's not all he was up to.  He also gave out gold freely along the way, and he didn't hold back with his generosity.  It's said that specifically because of Musa's freewheeling nature to hand out gold, his massive spending and selfless donations caused hyperinflation in every place that he visited, sparked a massive decade-long gold recession.  Realizing that he'd made a mistake by giving so much away, upon his return to Mali, he borrowed it all back, and as a result, directly controlled the price of gold in the Mediterranean region.  Well, allegedly.  Okay.  So, we know that Musa was hoarding all the gold he could find, but how did he find himself in a position to acquire such enormous wealth in the first place?  The majority of his riches spurred from an activity that's continued to bring stacks of cash to plenty of people to this day.  Take a guess.  Yep, mining.  The Mali kingdom was booming with significant salt and gold deposits.  And who reaped the rewards of those resources?  Musa, of course.  Not only did he trade and spend the gold, but in true elite fashion, he even wore it.  Besides the mining revenue back then, the sale of elephant ivory was also a major source of income for him.  How much exactly are we talking?  Well, we don't have an exact dollar figure.  However, historians have come to a rather narrowed conclusion.  And it's a lot of money.  Ready for this?  Boasting a caravan of gold-carrying camels and undisputed power, Monsa Musa's net worth has been valued by modern-day scholars to be up to $415 billion.  Yes, billion with a B. Nearly half a trillion.  That's more than the... ",
