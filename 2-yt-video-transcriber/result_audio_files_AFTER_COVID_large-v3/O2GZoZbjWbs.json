You know, what Senator Sanders is fighting for, just plain and simple, and people want to call it democratic, he calls himself a democratic socialist, People want to make this a bad word, but the last time I checked, when President FDR was standing up for folks in the 1930s, he had to fight against the elites of his day as well.

As we know, before he was assassinated, he indicted this country.  Materialism, militarism, poverty.  racism.  He said, we need to do a self check.

He never once said that the government should take over the production of all goods and services in this country.  But the only thing that he is saying is that there are millions of people in this country who are suffering.  And isn't it time that we call out Wall Street?

            "text": "Wow, is there a lot to talk about there?  There truly is a lot to talk about.  So Nina's point there is actually true and it's correct.  And her point is basically labels are useless because when you go based on policy positions, they differ so much from people's labels.  This is backed by a lot of numbers which show that despite there not being that majority of the country identifying as liberal, when you go issue by issue, the people of the United States are overwhelmingly left.  wing slash liberal.  so whether you go to you know medicare for all numbers are raising through the roof and that's like a really in the united states.  that's a hard line position and that's like a majority in a lot of polls now.  but imagine the public option probably be even higher right?  that's a liberal policy right.  um And you talk about raising taxes on the wealthy, free college education, all of this different stuff, raising the minimum wage.  These are incredibly popular positions.  And so, you know, polling can be manipulated in so many ways.  So, for example, like when people were asked whether or not, you know, their approval of the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act had a higher approvability than Obamacare.  Because people hear the Affordable Care Act, they don't know what's going on.  And they're like, oh, yeah, I like the Affordable Care Act.  It sounds cool.  Or less.  people said they dislike it.  Right.  Because how do you dislike the Affordable Care Act?  Right.  Especially if you don't know what it is.  Then you hear Obamacare and you're like, what?  I don't like Obama.  So I'm just going to be against this.  And so that's the problem.  Polling can be manipulated as well.  But she's right on the money about that, about, dude, literally that same poll that she's citing.  Bernie's winning by a fat margin and he's literally leading that poll.  and so the question you should be asking yourself is basically huh I mean there's no question really to be asked.  the question you ask is okay.  how is he leading a poll in which two-thirds of the country says they don't.  they don't feel comfortable supporting a Dem Soc.  the obvious reason is because policy and labels are different.  now I'm on the record.  now we'll continue to state this 100%.  I will not back away from this.  I don't think that Bernie should use the term dem social because he's not a dem social.  as you guys know democratic socialism is still socialism.  all right there's no different literally none whatsoever.  Bernard is a social Democrat.  Bernie is somebody who wants a system like that that exists in Scandinavia and other European nations.  any of them literally choose your pick take your pick but uh any of those countries whatsoever.  so he's a social democrat.  he's not a democratic socialist and so we could save ourselves all the hoopla and all this garbage amount of time.  and then you see cnn and brooke baldwin trying to trying to basically trap her into saying what they want her to say.  and it's like We can be over all this crap if he had just used the term Social Democrat, and I know some of you guys are going to disagree, mostly probably because you're a socialist and you want that term to be normalized more, but you're wrong.  He definitely should not have used that term, but I guess it is what it is.  But CNN, clearly, what they're trying to do is they're trying to, you know, do this propaganda where they get Nina Turner.  To make statements that they want her to say.  Because then it makes their candidate look a certain way.  And honestly.  It's not new.  It's not cool.  It's not funny.  We see this nonsense over and over again at this point.  Every news outlet is doing this non-stop.  Seriously.  And.  I really love how Nina Turner said Bernie Sanders is the antithesis of Donald Trump.  Bernie Sanders is the antithesis of Donald Trump.  He is the kryptonite to Donald Trump.  So he's the antithesis of Donald Trump.  He's the opposite.  As she says, Bernie tells the truth.  Trump lies.  He's his kryptonite.  He's the real populist.  Trump is the faux populist.  So that's how all of that good stuff works.  And then on the whole topic of, oh, they didn't trash Trump enough.  Dude, literally the worst strategy you can employ in this election is orange man bad.  Orange man bad would be the stupidest way, especially when you're talking about Trump determining who your party leader nominee is going to be and then you're just like oh look at how shitty the other candidates you know.  you know a dumb of a process that is to you know really choose who your nominee is.  you need to energize the base.  you need to energize human beings real living beings.  okay to go vote For the Democratic nominee and the only way you actually energize people is by offering something to them and so that's why you offer them popular ideas that are going to energize them.  That's what Bernie Sanders does obviously and so no they need to criticize Trump barely at all because it's a waste of time.  it doesn't add to anything.  And we already know how horrible Donald Trump is.  And so it's a waste of time to just basically pander to the crowd about Donald Trump.  It's a complete waste.  And then at the end, where Brooke Baldwin says it's against the rules to allow, like, against the majority or the person with the most delegates or the popular vote or whatever, the will of the people standing, you know.  The rules are bogus, dude.  The rules are really, really bogus.  There should be no such thing as a super delegate.  There should be no, no, no such thing as a super delegate.  The fact that something like that exists, that solely exists to override the will of the people in the Democratic Party is something that... the dem party should be ashamed about and ashamed of to be quite frank with you because they're supposed to be the ones who are all about the popular vote and the ec and are against gerrymandering and voter suppression and all this stuff.  and it's like dude you're doing the same thing in your own party and then you wonder why you lose and allow other parties to do like dude.  the rules are bullshit.  I don't know how else to put it.  I just have to use that word, you know?  It's just what it is.  Because the rules are unjust, and that is why they need to be changed.  Now... thank the Lord that we got superdelegates on the second ballot because if they were on the first ballot I don't know if Bernie would be able to win this election because the propaganda that all these news outlets would be going with is that one of the centrist candidates has a five trillion delegate lead after Nevada or after Iowa or after New Hampshire and so it's just really embarrassing.  but Nina Turner did a good job of holding her own here and really pushing back and yeah she gave some pretty legit explanations if i do say so myself but she always does a great job.
