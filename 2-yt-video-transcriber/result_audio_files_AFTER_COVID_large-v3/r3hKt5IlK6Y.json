            "text": "Having a beard was one of the most important things to me at the start of transitioning.  I couldn't wait when I started the hormones.  I was checking my face every day for like a new hair coming through.  And it was a bit of an obsession.  A lot of the time I say to people, I never really looked like a girl before.  I kind of just looked more like a young boy.  And I felt like I was waiting to go through the puberty that I needed to become a man.  So from a boy to a man, basically, rather than saying from a girl to a man, that just kind of sounded wrong.  After about a year on testosterone, I had a full beard.  So from one side of my face to the other, I can't imagine my face without a beard anymore.  It just feels like it's part of me, obviously, at this stage in my transition.  There's absolutely no question of whether I pass or not.  Not that that's even an important thing in transitioning anyway.  So the beard at this stage really is just, I suppose you'd call it maybe a fashion choice.  I don't know.  I feel like my face looks a lot better with a beard.  It really suits having a beard.  Another worry I did have was trying to look older to get into the clubs and I felt like a beard would help that.  Whereas now that I'm 25, I'm constantly worried about looking too old.  So there's a few reasons why I want to shave my beard off, and one of those reasons is that I'm just intrigued to see how my face looks because I think that the beard has been the most... the main change since starting the hormones.  By that logic, you'd think that perhaps I would look more androgynous, I don't know, maybe more feminine without the beard, but I know that's not going to be the case, so then it leaves the question of okay, how has my face physically changed apart from the beard?  The second reason is satisfaction of how it's gonna feel to shave it all off and have this really smooth skin underneath that can moisturize and watch it grow back.  It might even grow back thicker than this.  And I guess the final reason is that with me wanting to go to more acting auditions, I can give people the choice of how I'd look with and without the beard.  So I'll get my girlfriend Sophie to take some head shots of me without the beard.  if I look semi-decent and I can use that to show people and say look you know I can look hopefully maybe younger without the beard.  so yeah I guess I'll just see what I look like and I am quite scared but I'm gonna do it.  there's no going back now after filming this pre-interview so let's wait and see.
