            "text": "Well, it's actually an air shaft for one of the coal mines, for one we were looking at a little bit earlier.  But the top of that air shaft has collapsed, so we can see some of the rocks above it.  And we're seeing some things we've already seen before.  Right up here, you see some fossil logs.  But they're not in sandstone like we saw it before.  They're actually in shale.  And if we look a little further above it, we've actually got a coal seam right up there that runs right over our heads and on from there.  And notice an interesting thing about this coal seam is the very flat top.  So when the coal has fallen out, it's left a very, very flat surface.  That's one of the characteristics of coal.  It's got a flat top.  Almost every coal seam has an incredibly flat top and a flat bottom.  I can see this in the other side of the exposure.  So two of the features of coal can be seen here.  And another thing that can't really be seen unless you look at it under a microscope, Steve Austin studied coal for his PhD dissertation.  And looking at it in a microscope, he could identify plant parts in the coal, specifically bark in the coal.  So the question is, why is coral made of bark?  And the idea is, we've got these logs.  Ultimately, what Steve did was propose that there was a log mat floating on a body of water.  Logs are floating on the surface.  And they're lycopod logs.  They're logs that are of trees that are hollow.  They've got bark, but they do not have any internal secondary wood.  While they're floating on the water, they roll against one another, peeling the bark off.  The bark gets waterlogged and falls down to the bottom.  So as the water, as the log mat floats about, it drops this layer of bark. ",

But what that allows is if you already have a flat surface, the bark falls on a flat surface producing a flat bottom to that pile of bark.  And then when the log mat floats out of that region, it leaves a flat top on the pile of bark.  Then later the bark can be coalified into coal.  And that would explain the coal seams, the fact that they're made of layers of bark, of pieces of bark, the fact that they're flat-topped and flat-bottomed.  And those are difficult, actually, basically impossible to explain any other way. ",

            "text": "No, that's not what we're seeing.  If it was a swamp, several things would be true of what we're looking at.  First of all, if it's a swamp, you've got trees growing rooted in soil.  So you would expect to see roots in the material underneath the coal.  And what do you see?  You see logs.  I don't see any roots in here.  And underneath modern swamps, you've got lots of roots all over the place.  So we don't see that.  Plus, think of the bottom of the swamp.  Do you think the bottom of the swamp is nice and flat?  No, it's not.  It's as uneven as the surface would be with all these trees sticking up in it.  We don't have trees growing through the coal down into the material underneath.  We've got this flat surface.  All of a sudden, we've got coal.  And in a swamp, if you dig up the stuff in the swamp to see what kinds of plant material, there's lots of plant material in there.  But if you pick it up, it's, well, Steve would describe it as coffee grounds.  It's a good description.  The roots growing through this stuff messes it up, bioturbates it is what we call it, and destroys the structure.  You can't find pieces of bark in there.  They're not recognizable.  They're tiny little fragments.  You can't find branches.  They've been broken up and they're unrecognizable.  Leaves are unrecognizable.  So if that's what coal was formed from, you wouldn't find pieces of bark in it.  But that's what Steve was finding in his coal seam.  chunks of bark.  So he's got a flat bottom, chunks of bark, and then a flat top.  You've got a forest growing there.  How do you shave the forest off flat So that the coal stops all of a sudden, and it allows you to get a very, very flat surface.  How does that make any sense?  So the conventional explanation with a swamp over long periods of time just didn't work.  As a matter of fact, what Steve did is he was interested in doing a dissertation on coal.  went to an institution famous for studying coal, Penn State, and then asked, okay, of all the coal seams that you're familiar with in the United States, what's the best example of a marsh-produced coal?  And they directed him to the Kentucky 12 coal, and that's what he did his dissertation on.  But when he looked at it, he found a flat base, a flat top, and besides that, even seats in it.  Thin layers of shale in the middle of the coal with flat bottoms and tops to even those thin layers and pieces of bark in the coal.  And he concluded, I can't explain this in that model.  So what he did was develop for his dissertation a new model.  If this log mat blew away, you could have a layer of bark, and then a layer of mud could come in, an inch of mud could come in place and cover the bark that's already there.  Then the log mat can float in, deposit more coal, float back out again, get another thin layer of mud, and he could repeat this any number of times.  Perhaps as much as the 120 times you got coal seams in the Illinois Basin, for example, as you float this back and forth.  And he defended this interpretation of the Kentucky 12 coal seam for his PhD dissertation, and it was accepted.  And of course the comment was something like, well, we just, I guess, we just happened to find the one coal that has those characteristics. ",

Well, I think he's already talked to you about the nautiloid bed.  Well, the nautiloids are in a lime mud.  And the idea there is that that's a mud flow that flowed over the surface of the bottom of a body of water.  Mm-hmm.  And it hydroplanes.  It's going so fast that there's a layer of water between it and the substance underneath and just shoots right across.  Well, it doesn't deform when it's hydroplaning.  Like if you hydroplane on your vehicle, on the car.  It doesn't leave any skid marks.  It doesn't mess up the surface because you're not on the surface.  You're on water.

And then somehow after this deposit was made, a new forest grew without disturbing that one inch thick layer.  How do you grow trees in the mud layer now?  This makes no sense.  However, if you've got the concept of this floating log mat, Then the log mat can drop a pile of bark in, can float off, be blown off to another area.  You can have marine mud or non-marine mud, whatever.  I mean, you can come in and deposit.  Then the log mat floats back over the area, deposits more bark, and then floats away.

I had the opportunity when I was at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate to work in the high-energy, high-temperature, high-pressure physics lab.  Geophysics lab, sorry.  And we made rocks.  It was a really cool job.  Usually we were making metamorphic rocks, which would be, we've got a metamorphic mineral of some sort, that's a mineral that's been changed from some previous rock.  We have a theory about what rocks were changed to produce this.  So the idea was to grind up the rocks we thought they were made from, mixed them together, put them in a little capsule, a little gold capsule, put them in a thermos, in a heater, which goes up to a temperature we think would form that mineral, and then put pressure on it that we think was necessary, and wait whatever period of time it takes for the chemical reactions to occur, take it out, x-ray it, see if we got the mineral we hypothesized.  So I shouldn't say I was doing it.  I was just an undergraduate just doing the stuff.  And it was really cool.  We made all sorts of rocks.  And it was interesting to me that those rocks didn't take long to form.  In fact, most of the time, the rocks we were dealing with at high temperatures only took minutes.  I could run this in an hour for almost all rocks.  Now, when you're dealing with rocks that are made at lower temperatures, cooler temperatures, it took longer.  And the slowest forming rock that I ever formed was in fact coal.  And we made coal.  uh and and it took forever.  it took three or four weeks oh my goodness to form coal.  it was and and that's instantaneous.  i mean it's crazy.  i thought you know it takes a long time but that's the longest.  that's when you're basically about the boiling point of of water.  so it's really low temperature compared to the temperature of most rocks and it took a long time.  what's interesting too here?  this is cool.  i just can't resist this.  uh the If you just put plant material into the oven, it'd never form coal.  You'd just sit it there and nothing would happen.  But if you added a catalyst, The thing happened quickly.  It would happen in the three weeks.  And so the catalyst, of course, a catalyst in general is some substance that you add to a chemical reaction.  It doesn't change the catalyst, but the catalyst speeds the reaction up.  So this catalyst would make it possible to form coal very rapidly.  And the catalyst, we experiment with all sorts of things.  And it turns out that a whole bunch of clay minerals, mountain or illamite and so on, if you put it into the plant material, it acted as a catalyst and the thing goes to coal very quickly.  Now think about this.  If you burn coal, you get an ash that results that is unburnable.  It is the catalyst.  So coal is full of the catalyst.  And guess where the Mount Merlinite and all that stuff comes from?  It's volcanic ash.  It actually falls down from the sky from volcanic eruptions.  So all you need are volcanic eruptions, which are occurring all the time during this whole thing, raining down this volcanic ash, and you've got what you need to form coal in a matter of three or four weeks.
