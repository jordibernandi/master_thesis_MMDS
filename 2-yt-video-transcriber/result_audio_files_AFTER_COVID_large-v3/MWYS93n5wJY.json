            "text": "All right, everyone, I just got done watching the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.  So here's my analysis and reaction.  It might be a little bit of a long video here because there's actually quite a bit to say.  First, let me say that the predictable happened, which is that Chris Wallace spent most of his time as moderator sparring largely with Trump, but at times even with Biden.  It was very combative.  And I don't know that the average independent or undecided voter really got anything out of this.  Cuz basically, it's sort of formulaic cuz you sort of knew what Trump and Biden were gonna be saying and talking about anyway.  And so for people, it's basically just a rehash of things that they've been saying on the campaign trail.  more from Trump than from Biden because Biden's not really campaigning.  I thought that the biggest flub for Trump was definitely on the white supremacy thing, but not because of a refusal to disavow Nazis, which he's already done multiple times, but because he didn't follow through on the Charlottesville thing.  Chris Wallace explicitly brought up Trump's comments on Charlottesville, the great people on both sides or whatever he said about it.  That is an out of context debunked quote that has been repeated by every single Democrat on the campaign trail, which is portrayed as Trump encouraging Nazis.  That is literally never what he has said.  He was referring to liberal college kids and the 99% of people that were there that were neither carrying tiki torches nor belonged to Antifa.  He was talking about liberal counter protesters both for and against the Confederate memorials that were there to the exclusion of these other groups.  If you repeat the next two sentences that Trump said, that is conspicuously clear.  Did Trump follow through on this?  No, and here is my biggest problem with Trump as a debater.  Ultimately, this is a lukewarm mild win for Trump, but a mild win for Trump in this debate is almost a loss.  I'll get into that too.  My biggest problem with Trump as a debater, and he did this at all three debates with Hillary as well.  So this isn't a new thing and I fully predicted this and I expected it.  he has trouble following through.  If his train of thought were a little bit less bombastic, he could follow through with haymakers all night and he would have crushed Joe Biden.  Biden left open so many opportunities to attack that were not fully fleshed out and taken care of by Trump, even when the debate moderator wasn't interrupting him.  At times when Wallace was just sitting there quietly, Trump had, I counted, probably two dozen opportunities for proper attack, both based on questions he had been asked and statements Biden made.  Never once did he fully follow through.  He starts meandering into the topic and you think, well, he's gonna do it, he's gonna follow through.  And then 10 seconds later, he veers off into another line of reasoning.  Meanwhile, with Joe Biden, one big problem with what Joe Biden is doing is that he refused specifically, this was the big takeaway in the early part of the debate.  Biden refused explicitly to answer whether he would stack the Supreme Court.  This is deliberate, he can't answer.  If he says that he will stack the Supreme Court, Well, the moderates aren't gonna like that.  If he says that he's not, the leftists won't like him.  It's funny because Trump didn't really go after him on that either.  Wallace went after him, I think more on the SCOTUS issue.  He refused to answer it because he can't.  my own thoughts are.  He's already tacitly answered it many months ago before the RBG slot opened up and he's nervously hoping that nobody remembers this.  He already explicitly ruled out stacking the core.  Moderates take heed, Biden is not going to expand SCOTUS according to his own statements.  Leftists, he's not going to help you magically usurp that extra seat that Trump is going to fill in the next few weeks.  Keep that in mind.  Overall, I'd say this is like a 55-45 win for Trump.  But that's again, as I said, basically a loss.  Here's the problem.  Trump had reasonably high expectations going into the debate.  Biden had none.  A large minority, almost, I think it was like what in polling, was it 44% or something of Democrats didn't even think Biden would be physically capable of debating Trump.  The fact that he managed not to get completely crushed or make any extreme errors, at least beyond the partisan ones that his own fans don't care about, is technically a win for Joe Biden.  You gotta acknowledge that.  It's not like with Hillary Clinton.  With Hillary Clinton, she was never reckoned as the world's greatest speaker or debater, but she was ranked higher than fucking Joe Biden.  So if Trump manages to skate by on a mediocre win, well, it's still a win.  If he only manages to eke out a lukewarm sort of I did better than my opponent in a vague sense win against somebody like Joe Biden.  That's a problem now.  Here's the good part, Trump fans, don't worry too much.  The fact that Trump was underwhelming, at times at least, against Biden, the man who often struggles to put together a sentence with a teleprompter and did make plenty of verbal errors during the debate, but nothing significant.  Don't worry too much, why?  One of the greatest debaters of modern presidential history.  You can say whatever you want about his policies, his politics, his character.  He's a good speaker, Barack Obama.  When he was running for reelection against Mitt Romney during the first debate, what happened?  It was famous at the time.  it was in Denver and so there was altitude sickness to worry about.  Obama completely screwed it.  He lost against Mitt Romney, who's not exactly the world's greatest speaker debater.  Incumbents typically when they're running for reelection do very poorly at the first debate.  The fact that Trump managed to carry a lukewarm win, even against an opponent, let's face it, is nowhere near as good as Obama or Romney or any of these other people.  One of the worst debaters in modern presidential politics is a good sign for the next two debates.  So this doesn't knock Biden out.  It also doesn't knock Trump out.  And I don't know that it's gonna move any metrics at all because a lot of the debate devolved into these two going off subject so much.  Trump being arguably too energetic, Biden being marble-mouthed and scramble-brained at times.  Largely it devolved into talking about personal shit like Hunter Biden or whatever.  that had absolutely nothing to do with the questions that were even being asked.  We still don't have fully fleshed out info on basically any of their proposals for the most part.  You get a few vague things.  Biden told a bald faced lie with regards to his environmental plan, but he still managed to technically win on the climate change issue simply because he was more coherent in his response to the question.  He seemed almost sejasus at that point.  Trump, I think, wins on the economy.  And when Biden, one of the biggest problems Biden had was trying to bring up the fiscal record of the Obama era, take credit for what worked, and then match himself up to the Trump economy, dude.  Americans, even at this point where Trump's approval is mediocre, it's at 45, largely approve of the economic job Trump is doing.  On jobs in the economy, overwhelmingly, it's a significant majority favor Trump over Biden.  That's not a good place to wander into and Biden spent plenty of time there.  That hurt him.  Because of that, it tips things in favor of Trump, I think.  Because at the end of the day, it's the money, stupid.  The economy is the supreme issue right now.  On coronavirus, it's really either or.  Again, Trump could have followed through with his thoughts.  And he did meander into this at times and said, look, you didn't wanna lock things down.  I passed travel restrictions on China and then on Europe.  I saved a bunch of lives, Fauci agrees, which is Fact check, that is true.  But he didn't follow through.  Again, he should have hammered that home.  He should have, by the way, brought up Nancy Pelosi and her go party in Chinatown comments, which were late February.  China was already freaking out.  Nancy Pelosi was pretending it was no big deal.  Trump acted.  Biden didn't want him to.  It was funny.  CNN fact checking.  They're like, well, it's misleading.  when Trump claimed that Biden called him xenophobic for his travel ban.  Yes, he did.  You can't possibly construe the comments that Biden and other Democrats made towards the idea of a Chinese travel ban as anything other than a claim that Trump was being xenophobic.  And that's really the biggest loss of the night is the American people having to deal with all the fucking fact checkers.  And by the way, if you look at debate polls, in most of them, the lamestream media polls, Biden comes out ahead.  Did you expect anything other from the CNN viewing audience?  I'm surprised that Trump even broke into the double digits considering how hyper politicized it is.  So yeah, Trump scores a win on the economy.  kind of on the coronavirus response, and in general, I think did fairly well.  The problem is that he's, it seems structurally incapable of delivering a knockout punch.  He's the one that dances around constantly jabbing, but never really follows through.  Biden attempted to knock him out.  What did you see with his Beau Biden comments?  Trump to his credit, managed to defend properly against that because he immediately said, I'm not talking about Beau Biden, I'm talking about Hunter Biden.  Biden then went off into la la land talking about, well, yeah, my son had a coke addiction, but he got over it and I'm proud of my son.  But he never once, despite being queried, I think four different times during the debate, including three different times had nothing to do with this issue.  Never actually answered to the three and a half million dollars that provably were given to Hunter Biden by the former wife of the mayor of Moscow.  Never answered the question.  Ain't that telling?  I would say, unfortunately, though, I mean, the corporate media is not gonna report widely on that.  Biden repeatedly fails to answer what the fuck happened with Burisma.  instead simply saying that it's been discredited.  I don't see the fact checkers fact checking him and saying it's false.  It hasn't been discredited, Joe.  That's the point.  But if you don't push the issue, it doesn't really matter.  I think I saw a poll and among Spanish watchers on Telemundo, they favored Trump heavily.  If I remember, if I was reading it correctly, it could have been, of course, a glitch or something.  Maybe they reversed Trump and Biden on the tweet or something.  But I think that particular poll was heavily in favor of Trump.  It's probably on the issue of law and order.  And here's another place where Trump kind of wins, but he could have won by a huge margin.  Biden refused to call out Antifa.  Wallace was harassing Trump basically.  Well, sir, you won't call out white supremacists.  You won't call out the Proud Boys, which are by and large not white supremacists, but never mind.  Trump could have followed through and said, look, you're calling these groups far right.  I'm saying most of the violence is far left.  You have never once pressed Biden to disavow Antifa.  and another big loss for Biden.  I think should be the biggest one, but most people won't even notice it.  When asked about Antifa, he said, well, Antifa is not even a group, man.  Come on, man.  It's just an idea.  You are wrong.  It does not matter if the leader of the FBI apparently believes Antifa doesn't exist.  If you're looking at Antifa as the term anti-fascism, yeah, it's an ideal.  If you are looking at the semi-organized gang that comprises what is known as Antifa, spoken of as Antifa, self-describes as Antifa, and releases literature under the banner of Antifa, you are talking about a far-left paramilitary group.  That's the reality.  That's the fact.  It's just like with BLM.  BLM is an organization.  Black Lives Matter is a slogan, an ideal.  But you can't conflate the two because they're not the fucking same thing.  It's just linguistic mind games.  Trump should have pointed that out.  He largely didn't.  He let Biden skate on not disavowing Antifa.  He only followed through in a meager fashion and then immediately pivoted away, I think, to talk about the economy.  So it was kind of a wash of a debate.  It's almost not even worth watching the whole thing.  It wasn't as comfy as the Hillary debates were, but Trump did come out swinging.  I think had the upper hand through most of the debate.  The only problem is some people are saying, well, it was bad optically for Trump because he looked like he was being obnoxious.  Not a single Trump fan cares if he insults Joe Biden's son.  Not a single Trump fan cares if he goes off the rails and starts yammering on about Biden breaking the law or something or interrupts him.  Nobody cares.  And independent voters by and large, what do you think they expect at the debate when you've got Donald Trump up on stage?  I think the biggest surprise for them will be the fact that Biden was able to carry on a coherent sentence more or less most of the time.  That will be a surprise.  He didn't look at.  Biden wins in the sense, and again, I can't wait to see the follow up on this.  Biden literally wins in one essence just by not fucking up too badly.  The standard for him is completely different.  The expectation for him is so goddamn god awfully low that people are congratulating him and declaring him a debate winner for not coming out with his pants around his ankles or something.  Keep that in mind as well.  So yeah, there's my debate analysis.  I'm hoping that the next one follows the same trajectory as like 2012.  Because keep in mind, there's an incumbent this time.  Debates, politics, and so forth, they're a little bit different in elections where there's an incumbent defending the seat, as opposed to 2016 where there's no incumbent.  Obama's outgoing, you got two people vying for the position, plus Gary Johnson, but nobody gives a shit about him.  He took his money and left, basically, along with Bill Weld, who briefly tried to run again as a Republican despite disowning the party several years prior because he's a goddamn sellout making lots and lots of cash.  Probably two, three million bucks.  That's a good capitalistic person.  Definitely very libertarian in the economic sense.  Not so much the social or diplomatic sense.  I'm hoping it follows the same trajectory that was 2012.  Which means that the next debate will be, number one, more fiery.  Trump will be probably more coherent and prepared.  And Biden, again, typically he'll underperform compared to the first debate.  The next one, I believe, will be much more heavily advantaged Trump.  I'd be surprised if not.  And again, Trump didn't perform badly.  It's just he has that annoying personality perk, and it is probably the worst thing about him.  He refuses to follow through on his commentary to the point where he can actually score a big win against his opponent.  His opponent almost has to blunder into a punch in order for it to be meaningful in some cases.  That's about all.  Peace out. ",
