Now Soccer Dog the movie is about a dog that plays football, right, which funnily enough reminds me of this article I seen the other day.  Sue Smith on online abuse.  Women in football shouldn't have to have a thick skin, she says.  Liverpool winger Renzola Babagiri and Crystal Palace goalkeeper Chloe Morgan tell the women's football show about their experiences with online trolls.  This is something women do quite a lot.  They claim that they're just as good as men.  They claim that they should get the same money as men.  And then they claim that they're weak victims.  You know, they do all the time, right?  All the time.  But let's hear some of the abuse that these women get, right?  It's got to be horrendous, right?  I mean, there's a video here.  Let me turn this up.  I've not watched this.  It's only a minute long anyway.  Let's hear it. ",

Let's no longer do that activity because I don't like it and I'm not good at it.  Let's change it to something else.  and then all the men leave and go to create their own wee space again, and then they go and invade that space and do the same shit all over again.

What will happen is when people aren't allowed to discuss women's football in any negative way, they'll just start using code words, you know.  Instead of saying that she's a great football player, they'll say, aye, she's a great football player.  They'll just do things like that.  They'll start to use codes, you know, because that's what you force people to do when they're not allowed to express their opinion.  It's like... You're not allowed to point out that she's shit at football.  Or rubbish at commentating or whatever the fuck she does.  I don't watch women's football, I don't know what she fucking does.  Sue Smith, she revealed, she's the victim of discriminatory messages on social media and insists women shouldn't have to have thick skin.  She was speaking at a women's football show.  Wait a minute, there's a women's football show?  Really?  Because the men don't even get their own show.  And I know you might be thinking, but it's men's football.  Yes, it's men's football.  But they've always got to shove a woman in there, whether she's on the sidelines doing the punditry or she's in the fucking commentator's box giving her opinions that nobody's fucking interested in, that we've all to pretend we value as much as the ex-football-playing man.  You know, we've all to pretend... You know, that when she's speaking, aye, she's dead interesting, aye, aye.  Please don't, please don't get me fired from my job.  She's the best commentator ever.  Honest.  Fucking hell, man.  So there's a women's football show.  Oh, how nice that you can have a women's football show named Women's Football Show.  How nice that you can have that.  Men can have that.  which launched a campaign against online hate and social media abuse this month.  And they get a women's football show, and what do they do?  They launch a campaign against online hate and social media abuse.  Oh, so you're going to focus on the online hate and abuse that the Celtic players get?  Oh, no, you're not, because they're men.  You're not going to give two fucking shits about that.  It's just the women.  All right, okay, okay.  Smith, who won 93 caps for England.  Honestly, never heard of her before this article.  I mean, when people get caps for England, you've usually heard of them.  I've never heard of this woman before I read this article.  Oh, 93 caps for England.  Fucking hell.  Oh, by the way, for those outside the... the football world, a cap is when you, you get a cap when you play for the international team, you know.  So she's played for England 93 times.  And as a Sky Sports pundit, says she has a support group that helps her deal with the abuse she receives, but that she worries for those who are not so fortunate.  We shouldn't have to have thick skin, as she said.  all that.  We still get those comments when we're talking about football, about going back to the kitchen.  I mean, it's like, It's like a dated comment anyway, but it's just a joke.  I mean, come on, it's just a fucking joke, you know.  At least they're not meaning it, you know, they're not being horrible, they're just joking.  They're not saying it in the same way that you would say men are toxic.  They're not saying it like that, you know, will you actually mean that?  No, they're just having a laugh, you know.  Pity you can't joke around women.  That's a pity, isn't it?  That you just can't joke around them without losing your job.  I remember Andy Gray lost his job.  He lost his job because... What was he did?  He was laughing.  He was laughing at a lineswoman and he got caught on camera saying that she wasn't attractive or something like that.  You know?  And it's like... So what?  You're just not allowed to have a negative opinion about women at all.  All your opinions must be positive, which leads to all of them being disingenuous.  Nobody's going to believe any opinion you have about women when you're forced to only have positive opinions about women.  You know, it's just... I'm lucky that I've got a support group.  The ten nice messages to one horrible one.  Imagine focusing on the one horrible one.  Ugh.  So there, she's talking about this guy.  Abusers know nothing about women's football.  Yep, you're absolutely right.  First of all, they're not abusers.  But you're right, they know nothing about women's football because women's football is fucking shite and nobody watches it.  It's as entertaining as women's basketball.  Liverpool winger, her, says she believes that those who abuse women at football do so despite not following the sport.  So they make jokes.  Oh, it's her there.  Oh, no, she's received a number of discriminatory comments from internet trolls.  Here we go.  I was saying the male players don't complain about it.  The black ones do when they want to play the race card.  They do that, but they don't complain about the abuse they get from the fans.  But unless they're black, what's she saying?

Trolls are trying to silence us.  No, they're not at all.  They're just trolling you.  It's in the name.  They're trolls.  It's in the name.  They're trolling you.  They are trolling you.  Crystal Palace goalkeeper Chloe Morgan says she feels those who troll her online are trying to silence her, but adds that she is encouraged by the organisations that are taking a stance against this form of abuse.  When you receive these kind of comments as an individual, you feel vulnerable.  You feel... Vulnerable.  The fuck?  Vulnerable.  The fuck are you, man? ",

Sky Sports is running an article on this.  That's how successful they have got under your skin.  You let them win, you're a loser.  This is kind of part of the reason why women's football is shit.  The attitude.  They don't have a winning attitude.  Because a winner would be like, what, back in the kitchen?  Whatever.  They wouldn't even give it a second thought.  You know, they wouldn't give a shit.  They wouldn't care.  What, you think I'm a bad goalkeeper?  I don't care.  You know, they wouldn't care, but they really deeply care, and that's why they're shit. ",

They're always the victims.  Now we have to have discussions about how they're... When they go to take a penalty, the opposing fans whistle and boo and shout miss, miss, miss and all that.  That should be banned.  We should ban that.  That's now hate speech, you know.  You're no longer allowed to call the ref a cunt when he makes a bad decision because that ref might be a woman and, you know... Therefore, it's probably rape or something.  Let's ban that as well.  Why don't we just ban football altogether?  Would you be happy then?  Would you be happy then when you've finally fucking destroyed everything that men enjoy?  You've destroyed James Bond now.  You know, is there anything else that men like that you want to destroy?  Anything?  Say, men like video games, don't you?  Yes, we do.  Why don't we destroy them then?  Why don't we make them all about women and trans rights or some shit like that?  Why don't we fucking ruin that as well?  Rather than just leaving us the fuck alone.  We leave you alone to get on with your fucking bullshit makeup stuff and all that crap.  We leave you alone.  You want to go shopping?  Fuck off and go shopping.  We don't care.  We're not going to interfere and say we demand to go shopping with you.  We demand to go with you and then make it all about us.  We don't do that.  Why can't you fucking leave us alone?  And another thing as well, doesn't it bother you that It's the men that are winding you up when it comes to this.  Does that mean that women aren't watching the football that you play?  Is that what you're telling me?  Oh my God, man.  it's just almost everything that they fucking do.  just makes you roll your eyes and think oh my god here we go again.  here we go again.  hey look men like fucking getting out a telescope and looking at the stars do they?  let's ruin that that star's patriotic or something or or or not patriotic?  um What do they call that?  Patriarchy, aye, patriarchy.  That's patriarchal, that star.  Let's get rid of that star.  Let's name it something vagina-related.  Let's ruin that as well, because men like it.  Let's fucking ruin everything.  Men like drinking tea.  Why don't we ruin that as well?  Why don't we say that drinking tea leads to rape?  Why don't we ruin that as well?  Why don't you just ruin everything?  Fucking hell, man.  It's so fucking obnoxious and annoying.  Everything's about you.  Everything makes you a fucking victim.  You're never fucking happy.  As I've said before, the only time you're fucking happy is when you get something to complain about.  It's so fucking annoying.  Anyway, it's so annoying that it's actually distracted me from a movie review.  I was talking about Soccer Dog, the movie.  Anyway... Soccer Dog the movie.  It's okay.  You know, if you like that kind of thing.  I suppose.  Anyway, thank you very much for watching my movie review of Soccer Dog.  I really hope you enjoyed it.  Until next time. ",
