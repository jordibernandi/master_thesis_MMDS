This video today is going to serve as proof of why fathers are so important in the home and why moms just don't have what it takes to discipline kids properly and keep them in line.  I come across this video on TikTok and these girls are in the doctor's office here with their mom And I can't play the music, of course, because of copyright bullshit, but they literally start twerking and shaking their asses.  And the mom just kind of looks over and just... Nothing.  So then I thought, well, maybe she yelled at him, like, right after this video, right?  Like, right after.  Because this is an issue.  This thottery of just, TikTok's insane.  It's literally insane.  You can do nothing, absolutely nothing, and just stand there with your tits hanging out and you'll get a shit ton of views.  Now this video of these two girls twerking and shaking their asses in front of their mom in front of it in a doctor's office has 1.3 million views like in the comment sections are just disgusting.  I mean it's it's all filled with.  well first off it's like oh mom passes the vibe check.  no mom passes the shitty mom who doesn't immediately stop this action and then say don't you fuck fucking dare.  post that up on social media where people can see you acting that way and me having to stand there and and and well just take it like a like a bitch.  but still a dad would never Never allow that to happen.  Never in a million years.  He wouldn't be there right now with them doing that, with them setting up the camera.  First off, as soon as they set up the camera, he'd be like, don't you dare set up that camera and film me in here, right?  And then second, the second they started twerking, he'd be grabbing those phones and throwing them out the window.  So then I look at her profile and we got another video.  Another video of them, I don't know what they're doing here, but let me ask you something.  What's up with this new thing?  with taking your shorts and wearing the shortest shorts possible and then pulling them up so far that just the entire knuckle shows?  What is up with that?  Like those... You wear those types of little shorts and booty shorts and stuff around the house.  That would be like me walking out of the house in a pair of boxer shorts.  And I'm sure women would be like, how dare you walk around in boxer shorts?  And I'd be like, how dare you look at me and treat me like a piece of meat?  You should just not look, right?  That's always.  their excuse is, I should be able to wear whatever I want.  That's what they're being taught.  You should be able to do whatever you want and nobody should care about it and nobody's gonna judge you.  And if they do judge you, they're horrible people.  People judge people.  People judge people based off of their looks, their actions, all kinds of things, okay?  We make snap judgments of people within seconds of meeting them.  Seconds of meeting them.  And this is the image that you put out into the world?  This girl's wearing jeans and I can see her knuckle through it.  Fucking jeans.  Parents, get your shit together.  Start parenting your children properly.  Or else we're fucked.  Because if you can't take care of the kids, it's where it all starts.  It starts with the kids.  The only good news is, from what I can tell, for the most part, this next generation that's coming through, these young kids that are in their teens right now that are moving through, There's a large portion of them that are not falling for the shit and that are going their own separate ways and doing their own things and thinking independently.  So that's a positive movement because hopefully that can grow.  But this shit?  This shit with taking your kids to the doctor's office and letting them film videos of them shaking their asses and twerking and just thottery.  And this is only gonna get worse, mom.  You think it's funny now or it's cute now?  They're 14 years old or 15 and they're goofing around at the doctor's office?  Right?  Yeah, just wait.  You just wait until she's 23, hammered drunk at a bar, acting the same way, and then the next day she's going home with some dude who's also hammered drunk, and then the next day it's, oh my god, mommy, I can't believe this happened.  And then the mom just goes, it's okay, sweetheart, you didn't know any better.  It's not your fault.  Yes, you're right.  It's not her fault.  It's yours, mom. ",
