I already posted a video about this the other day.  There's a group of people who have decided that I'm just a terrible coward who won't answer questions and is terribly afraid of all these Internet nobodies with no audience and no credentials while I'm having debates with scholars.  And so what they've decided to do is suggest that, oh, well, Matt's just a coward.  And so if I can just call in and ask Matt these very specific questions, I can prove God.  Well, the point of those questions, as sloppily phrased as they are, was to suggest that I believe something that I do not have a justification for.  And if he would have started the call by saying, Matt, are there things that you believe that you don't have a justification for?  I would have said, yes.  That's it.  The big trap that Mr.  Smarty Pants McSmarterton there was trying to get me in was to trap me into saying, yes, I have beliefs that are not justified.  Congratulations.  If you guys were smart enough to ask the right question, you could have had your answer instantly.  But instead, you had to tap dance around.  And when I wasn't following the script that Darth Dawkins gave you, you little puppet.  He's got his hand right up your ass, moving your mouth with whatever script you've got.  And it didn't go the way you wanted.  So now all of a sudden.  it's Matt's afraid of Darth.  Matt's not afraid of anybody.  What Matt's afraid of is wasting the audience's time.  So let's not. ",
