            "text": "hi everyone lisa haven here.  well as you're all already well aware the mainstream media has called the election for joe biden.  now as a quick reminder the mainstream media does not get to decide who wins the election.  they can make a projected calculation based off their mathematical formula right on who they think is going to win.  However, the election has not officially been called by our electoral college, by our Congress.  We have to wait for all of that to take place.  And we must remember that right now there are already recounts that are going to happen in Georgia and Wisconsin, not to mention all the lawsuits that President Trump has out in multiple states and everything going on with Pennsylvania.  By the way, we've been covering a lot of this over on RestrictedRepublic.com.  Justice Knight and myself, I want to encourage you, get subscribed over there because we don't know how much longer we're going to be on these platforms, especially if it all goes in the blue direction that it seems to be headed in.  So check us out at RestrictedRepublic.com.  But with that, in today's report, I've got so much I want to talk about Because the second that the mainstream media dubbed it for Joe Biden, then bang, like lightning bolt, all hell started to break loose from radical leftists literally calling for Trump supporters to be labeled on lists.  I have been talking about this for a long time here on YouTube and on Restricted Republic, and I've shown you guys a lot of the websites, but now it's literally exploding and gone straight up communism to the point where I'm seriously scared.  I mean, they're making a list.  I don't know how to say that the list has been created and it's and it's terrifying when you understand history and what happened under Stalin and how he attacked and labeled his political opposition.  Right.  But let's get into what's going on so you guys can see some of that.  Here's a tweet, and it's by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  And you can see this was written very recently on November 6th.  But here's what she says.  Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future?  I foresee decent probability of many deleted tweets and writings and photos in the future.  Then she expands a little bit right below that and she says, laugh out loud at the party of personal responsibility, being upset at the idea of being responsible for their behavior over the past four years.  Let me just pause right there, right?  So she's saying Trump supporters need to take responsibility for their actions.  What exactly is it that we did wrong?  Was it our stance on immigration?  Was it the stance on abortion?  Was it our stance because we're against certain taxes on the rich?  Is it because we're against socialism and communist principles that you've been trying to push?  Is that why we need to be called out and put on a list?  But yet AOC can push things like completely radicalizing our entire country through the new Green Deal.  that would literally put millions of people out of a job.  We wouldn't have transportation and all these things.  That's a radical idea.  Or getting rid of the electoral college like last year.  they were all screaming.  That's a radical idea.  Or subverting the Constitution, but yet you're going to say that we need to be held accountable for our... political responsibility for our behavior, but you're not held accountable?  And she's not the only one.  In fact, there's.  there's a lot of them.  Right.  Here's another one.  This is even McMullen.  You could see the executive director of Stand Up Republic.  He's a former CIA ops officer.  All of that is in that far right right section there that I piloted.  But he says we should keep and publish a list of everyone who assists Trump's frivolous and dangerous attacks on the election and name and shame them forever.  Really?  That's pretty radical.  I would never call for naming and shaming, even like a liberal.  I don't do that.  Why?  Because that's caused tension.  And that's akin to something that happened in, I don't know, countries like Nazi Germany and under Joseph Stalin.  Joseph Stalin literally labeled his political opposition schizophrenic, sluggish schizophrenia, and then sent them all to mental institutions or took them out.  But hey, there's no naming and shaming going on in America.  Right.  Here's this next one here.  Here's Jennifer.  Jennifer, count every vote.  And you can see she's a never Trump or a pro-democracy opinion writer at Washington Post, MSNBC contributor.  This is a woman who's contributing to your news, right?  Any Republican now promoting the rejection of an election or calling not to follow the will of the voters or making baseless allegations of fraud should never serve in an office, join a corporate board or find a facility position or be accepted into polite, society.  we have a list and they're actually referring to a list which i'm going to show you by the way but here here she is saying okay let's remember what msnbc in washington post said about russian election interference for the past four years.  they screamed it over and over and over again all discounted by the way president trump is interfering in the election.  all this stuff they were saying.  But if we say anything about election interference, we get censored, blacklisted, put on lists.  But it's OK for them to scream about election interference and Russia interfering in the election for years.  And then the whole Russia collusion hoax with the president not even proven to be true.  When they say it, they get pushed to the top of the feed.  If anybody who is a Republican says it, they get censored and blacklisted.  What?  And now we're being called, oh no, no, no, excuse me, we're being put on lists.  Not being called, we're being put on lists, right?  Here's another one here.  Ben here, if you hire someone who remained with the Trump administration after the election beyond notice, you will be held accountable by media's touch and we will ensure you're exposed.  Exposed for what, people?  Because of our political views, that's it.  That's it, that's it.  Right.  Moving on here.  Michael Simone.  Yes, we are the Trump Accountability Project.  And that's the one who is compiling a list.  Every administration staffer, campaign staffer, bundler, lawyer who represented every single one of them.  Here's another tweet.  Climate warrior.  Right.  And here's some information on him.  Right.  If you know anyone who supported Trump, please add their name to our database.  they will be dealt with in due course once the appropriate legal framework can be put in place.  What's this framework, right, that they're talking about?  Well, here it is, right?  This is the Trump Accountability Project.  And I've talked about this and it says right here in the very beginning, remember what they did, speaking of President Trump.  what Trump did, what those who financially backed him did.  And we must never forget those who furthered the Trump agenda.  And here's what they say.  We should welcome in our fellow Americans with whom we differ politically.  But, but, but those who took a paycheck from the Trump administration should not profit from their efforts to tear our democracy apart.  The world should never forget those who, when faced with a decision, choose to put their money, their time, and their reputations behind separating children from their families.  Wait, Obama did that.  Obama did that.  but his name's not on the list, encouraging racism that never happened and anti-Semitism that never happened and negatively causing the unnecessary life and economic devastation from our country's failed response to the COVID pandemic.  Are you going to hold every leader in the entire world accountable for their efforts because COVID-19 killed people in every country?  Every country.  What about Sweden, who didn't do any lockdowns?  You're going to go over there and hold their government accountable?  We got locked down, forced to wear a mask, and you tell me they didn't do a good enough job?  No, they did an Orwellian dictator job.  And I'm not happy with what President Trump did with COVID-19, by the way.  But nonetheless, because they can blame it on somebody.  But how come they're not blaming flu deaths?  on president or tuberculosis.  We lost 1.7 million people to tuberculosis.  I believe it was in 2017.  But hey, nobody's held accountable for that.  Who?  We should not allow the following groups of people to profit.  from their experience, those who elected him in, individuals who worked for Trump's campaign, Republican National Committee, and or affiliated PACs, those who staffed his government, and those who funded him, right?  How is this okay?  It really isn't.  I don't see us compiling lists of those on the left for their radical agendas and their communist principles and mentalities and the complete destruction of our country.  I mean, we can name all kinds of things about the left, right?  Just like you could name about anyone and anyone you wanted to.  right but to top it off here's something else i wanted to show you guys dictators like nicholas maduro right right now are actually happy and celebrating the idea that joe biden and kamala harris are in.  let me show you this tweet here.  this is his twitter page and it says and i've translated already i congratulate the american people on president-elect.  i also congratulate president-elect joe biden and vp kamala harris on their victory.  and then he goes on and here's another tweet here and i'm going to read this one and translate it venzuela the homeland of the liberator and he names the name.  there will always be ready for dialogue and understanding with the people and government of the united states.  so here is a dick tater A dictator, Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela, where people are starving to death and waiting in lines because of their socialist communist principles and values.  Don't worry, he's celebrating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris because they're on the same side.  And he hasn't even been officially called yet.  by the electoral college.  It hasn't even been called.  It's been called by the mainstream media.  But you know what the Mexico president did?  And I back him up on this.  This is on straighttimes.com.  Mexico's presidents won't congratulate Biden until the legal challenges are resolved.  Right.  Until everything has been resolved, that's when you can congratulate a president.  Meanwhile, they're getting rid of people who are exposing pretty much anything in regards to the election.  Check this out.  This is on the Raw story.  Fox News suspends Jeanine Pirro's show after spat over airing baseless voter fraud claims report.  You see, for years, like I said before, they were allowed to talk about Russia collusion and election interference and push to the top of the feed.  And then it got disproven, right?  President Trump, the collusion hoax, all proven false.  But if anyone on the right talks about voter fraud happening right now, you're taking off your show, you're not allowed to be aired, and you are censored.  We're already there, people.  We're already under communism.  Now, even with everything that's going on, the Trump's litigations, what's happening in Pennsylvania, the recounts, do I think that much is going to change?  I'm not so sure it is.  I think this election has been so... We're looking like a Venezuela election.  That's all I can say.  You want more information, you got to get on over to Restricted Republic.  But that said... I'm not so sure much is going to change and I'm just going to leave it at that.  I am hopeful that things do change and get different, but I'm also terrified for the state of our country that out in the open AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez literally right after and right around the time that Joe Biden was announced by MSN, then suddenly lots of emails, let's put them on or around the same time that they saw Joe Biden as the victor, right?  to clarify because it wasn't exact but it's all around the time that it looked like Joe Biden was winning.  then they go full communist and start saying name and shame and label.  and all of that was happening before but now we have it.  multiplied folks multiply.
