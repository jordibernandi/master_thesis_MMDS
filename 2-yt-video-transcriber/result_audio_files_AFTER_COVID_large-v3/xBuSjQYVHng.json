            "text": "Hey guys, today we're going to be talking about some more of the questions that you guys left on Instagram.  I fell in, not fell in, but sort of like accidentally put my hand in a cactus right before filming.  And I can't tell what's dry skin and what's cactus spikes because like coronavirus hand washing, my hand is bleeding.  Do you guys like how I changed the background a little bit?  Gave you different objects to look at from the last video.  Kind of keep it fresh.  So I'm gonna make like a YouTuber and dive right in.  First question is how to deal with receiving end of the world messages from Mormons.  Oh boy, I've seen a few of those going around on the internet and in group texts that I have with my friends and if you're receiving them I feel for you.  They are kind of funny and um you know, just really entertaining a lot of the time.  But I also imagine if it was my family sending me those things, I'd be like, oh God, because so many of them are just insane.  The last thing you want in a global pandemic where everyone's stressed and there's a lot of real stuff going on is having to deal with your highly religious family members sending you like apocalypse messaging.  So as we know, Mormonism is a doomsday religion, lest we forget.  And that rears its ugly head in times like this.  It rears its ugly head a lot.  But how could we expect Mormons to not be thinking along those lines right now?  I definitely saw a few Mormon mums posting like, you know, all the weather events and there's locusts in Africa and there's this pandemic and all this other stuff and we're saying like, Jesus is coming again.  And to me, that was frustrating because, you know, this girl, I think, votes for Trump.  So it's like, no, we're not having earthquakes and more extreme weather events and all that stuff because of the second coming.  We're having earthquakes more because of fracking, which you vote for, and then we're having extreme weather events more because of climate change which you don't believe in or care about.  so um i totally get the frustration of end of the world type stuff in terms of receiving those messages directly from your family members usually with some kind of like exhortation to like come back to church or you know that's like implied.  that's obviously what they want you to do.  they think that um you know, how clearly these prophecies are coming true is just gonna persuade you to come back.  But obviously, you probably know that that's not true.  So it can be difficult to navigate.  My advice would, again, as I kind of said a lot last video, not take it upon yourself to prove them wrong, like not feel like that's your responsibility.  I totally get the wanting to just like rip into him and be like, you idiot, here's what's actually happening.  That's definitely like a part of my nature that I've reformed from a lot over the years, but it's definitely still there.  It's frustrating receiving end of the world messages from your Mormon family members, especially if you're still sort of like processing leaving Mormonism.  Hi, Bernie.  And you know, you've got like your own shit you're working through.  It's just like an extra like, ugh, what do I have to do with this?  I personally believe you don't have to reply.  And I think my like default advice I would give for being in that situation is just Don't respond to it.  You don't owe someone anything, especially if they're sending you something like that.  You can choose to respond and argue with them if you feel like you have the mental strength.  I know there are a lot of times in my past where I would go guns blazing into conversations like that.  not realising that I don't have the ability to protect my mental peace and so it would always leave me feeling more upset and more frustrated and I think I used to think that not replying, not arguing was weakness but I actually think it's strength.  So it's kind of a, you know, every situation is going to be different.  What you can handle is going to be different.  So obviously reply if you want.  But main advice, don't feel responsible for changing their minds about anything.  And don't feel responsible for replying at all, really, because... Yeah, you don't have to, like, dignify stuff like that with an answer.  The next question that a lot of you guys have asked is how to deal with Mormons thinking you're unhappy even when you're not.  And this is, again, a really common frustration for people leaving Mormonism.  I think a lot of ex-Mormons find that their happiness actually increases a lot once they leave.  And if it doesn't, it's usually kind of for an initial period where they're grieving and, you know, processing the fact that they love to hide among religion and all that good stuff.  It's frustrating when you feel like you have this like new lease on life and you know you're really happy and your family members refuse to see it like are incapable of seeing it because their religious beliefs depend on having this narrative that you're unhappy because they.  it doesn't compute that you can leave the church and become happier.  and if you are happier then it's because like you know, Satan doesn't have to work as hard on you anymore.  or some bullshit.  You should be able to share your happiness with your family members and it's such a bummer when you can't and when you're being accused of being unhappy because, you know, in Mormonism happiness is like moralized which is concerning and it's all linked to prosperity gospel and i hate it.  but my advice for dealing with this is once again that it's not your responsibility it's not your responsibility to debunk their projections.  you are probably not going to be able to debunk their projections because if they need to believe that you're unhappy to maintain their narratives and to like you know not have cognitive dissonance about their faith then they're going to do that for as long as they need to do that.  um and i think trying to convince a member that you're happy is you know obviously quite futile.  the only way you can really show people that you're happy is by just being happy and some of them will see it and some of them unfortunately won't.  um and i know it's frustrating but i think when you are truly happy and at peace, you don't really care what other people think.  Like you might, it's like sad that your family members can't share in your happiness with you or can't like feel happy that you're happy.  And you know, that your relationship becomes this weird mix of like, you know, them needing to have all these narratives about you.  And it's just, it's weird and it's hard.  And it, again, this is like another thing where therapy might be useful, but that's great.  So if you are experiencing that problem, I'm sorry, it sucks.  But hopefully with time, your, you know, family's opinion of you will sort of become less and less important as you realise that, you know, they've their own stuff going on.  you know everyone's just looking at the world through their own lens and what lenses they have on depends on all these different factors all this different conditioning.  the next question was how to deal with unsupportive parents.  um all these questions are like basically the same thing kind of um but yeah unsupportive parents let's talk about it.  so once again it is hard not having your family members able to sort of share in your life in the way that a family member ideally should.  There is kind of a chasm, is that the word?  Chasm?  There's a gulf?  Why can't I come up with words?  There's distance that often comes between ex-Mormons and their family members after they leave the church and some people are able to navigate that you know change of relationship dynamics successfully over time and some people aren't and it's not necessarily their fault at all.  in fact it often isn't because you can't create a healthy relationship with someone who's not capable of having a healthy relationship.  you can't have one healthy person and an unhealthy person and have that relationship be healthy.  so it's difficult and I think a big thing a lot of ex-Mormons have to deal with is figuring out what degree of contact they want to have with their families.  and that can be so heartbreaking because you know when you left the woman church it wasn't because you wanted to be further away from your family or anything like that.  like you love your family um just as much as you ever did.  but but it is difficult with those different beliefs and like i said when when say your parents um ability to maintain their faith depends on them having these certain narratives about you that just aren't true.  All of that is just very difficult to navigate.  But if your parents are unsupportive, Again, you can't make them support you.  You can only sort of set and maintain your own boundaries, whatever that looks like, and offer what you're willing to offer to the relationship.  And so, you know, if it can't be reciprocated, you sort of have to determine the degree to which you're okay with it not being reciprocated.  Do you know what I mean?  A lot of people, Mormon or not, feel like their parents aren't really capable of understanding them.  I think that's just been a common thing throughout human history because of how much generations change.  And so a lot of the time it can be, when you're an adult with your parents, it can feel like, It can feel weird, like navigating that feeling like your parents are not capable of understanding you because of, you know, the lenses through which they see the world, blah, blah, blah.  I don't think getting angry or anything like that is ever that productive.  Not that I'm telling you that anger is a bad emotion to feel because that's a different thing.  I'm just saying that reacting in anger to your parents is not going to help.  I think there is something to be said for showing people the love that they're not able to give you and letting them learn through that love.  And it can be hard with Mormon parents because they might keep looking at you through this certain lens and sort of reject your love in a way because we can't love other people properly till we love ourselves.  And I would argue that Mormons don't love themselves, if they don't have love for themselves outside of this belief that there's a God who loves them, do you know what I mean?  There's a lot there.  I do think it's possible to improve your relationship with your parents by giving more than you receive, but obviously, again, you have to decide how much of doing that you're okay with and if you're not then that's totally understandable.  um and it is okay to distance yourself or maybe you find that.  um you know it does slowly pay off over time and it is kind of rewarding but obviously you have to be willing to give without expecting anything to necessarily change.  i don't know has any of the stuff i've said been helpful?  i cannot.  So last question that I'm gonna tackle today is a really chill, easy one.  And it's how to cope with the fear of death.  Coming to terms with our own mortality is a massive thing that humans throughout history have had to wrestle with.  And it's, in my experience, it's like a personal journey that we all have to take.  We all have to come to terms with our own death.  It is something that's naturally scary.  We fear the unknown.  But I will just share with you like the view that I've sort of arrived at with death.  Because I don't feel afraid of death because, you know, if I'm dead there's nothing to fear, you know, I'm gone.  A quote I heard once is like, don't fear death because where life is, death is not, and where death is, life is not.  Basically saying that like, you'll never know what it's like to be dead.  You'll only know what it's like to die.  I have taken a lot of comfort and got a lot of sort of insights and stuff from Buddhism when it comes to death.  I just finished Ram Dass's book, Conversations on Loving and Dying.  So if you're kind of in that space, you like that stuff, then I'd recommend that.  But basically, death is just, death is part of life.  Obviously, it's part of the bargain.  It's part of being here.  a thought I've had is that I don't want to live forever, like I think it would be horrible to live forever.  It is the impermanence of things in our world, in our lives, that makes stuff so meaningful and so beautiful.  And I know Mormons have this sort of backwards idea that unless something can be permanent forever, for eternity, then it's not meaningful.  But I completely disagree.  to use a pretty basic analogy, you know, spring flowers every year.  If they were there year round and, you know, forever, for eternity, would we appreciate them?  I don't know.  Probably not.  But when I go through a long winter and then I get to see flowers coming up in the spring, that is the best feeling ever.  And like, you know, you buy yourself flowers and you know they're going to die.  But like, it's just such a wonderful temporary experience.  And I sort of look at life like that, I think.  if things were forever, things would fall apart, like people would change too much to stay in relationships, all kinds of things.  I mean, I don't know how Mormons are thinking they're going to be with the same boring person for the rest of eternity, because that sounds hard.  Death is something I've meditated on a lot, thought about a lot.  I have, you know, read a lot, gained a lot of understanding about how psychedelics can help people cope with their own mortality.  So if you live in a state where that's possible, I'd recommend looking into maybe having an experience like that.  But basically, my ultimate presiding thought, theory on death, not even theory, is that all things are interconnected, energy can't be created or destroyed, only transferred from one source to another.  We are homo sapiens right now, but the energy that we're made up of has existed for billions and billions and billions and endless years because energy can't be created or destroyed.  we all want something else.  and now we're this and like we could absolutely turn into something better than this one day.  or you know like there's i don't think in the in the grand scheme of the cosmos there's like good and bad necessarily but um what i'm trying to say is that what am i trying to say?  just trying to distill all my thoughts on death into like a good sound bite for a video.  it's very chill.  i have found peace personally in feeling a stronger and stronger connection to nature and realizing that all things are ultimately one.  we sort of through necessity have to go through life seeing everything as separate labeling it in its own separate categories but nothing's truly separate because you know the planet we live on the universe we live on it's all just a constant exchange of energy and we as in our current forms right now are just one temporary tiny part of that And the energy we're made up of will continue to exist long after we're gone.  And that's just the way it is.  That's why we get to exist.  If the system was... different than single-celled organisms could have like just stayed single-celled organisms forever.  like it is the fact that we can die that helped us evolve because like that's what evolution is.  it's survival of the fittest like.  if there wasn't the fear of death there wouldn't be you know the necessity for animals which we are to mutate, to create different versions of themselves, to evolve, to like grow beyond our circumstances.  I'm like wording this really weird.  I hope some of that made sense.  I kind of like lost motivation to try and explain it.  So I feel very peaceful and fine with the fact that when I die, my, you know, I'll just go back into the oneness of everything.  It's a difficult one to talk about because there's not really anything someone can say to you that makes you not scared of death anymore except for like there's a god and you'll live forever in heaven in mansions.  i think it is a journey that we all need to take.  so if you haven't you know sort of explored your own death come to terms with it.  i really encourage you to do so maybe through you know reading certain books.  i'll leave some links in the description box.  meditation has been really big for me again.  i'm very into all the buddhist stuff and that's been incredibly powerful for me.  so I would recommend diving into Buddhism more.  But it's your own journey, so you've got to do what's right for you.  I hope that you enjoyed this video.  I'm kind of having fun doing these Q&As.
