            "text": "Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel.  In today's video, feminism is unfortunately back at it again with another radical feminist lending credence to the claim that modern day feminism isn't in fact about equality at all, but rather about wanting to destroy everything that's healthy and normal.  From decrying masculinity as toxic to labeling the traditional stay-at-home wife as a form of white supremacy, and now most recently calling to abolish the family.  We can't have a feminist future without abolishing the family.  The feminist thinker Sophie Lewis has a radical proposal for what comes next.  Apparently, men not wanting to date woke lefty women is a scandal worthy of international condemnation, but calling to abolish the family, the fundamental building block of our society, it's simply a radical proposal worthy of being supported by a positive puff piece.  The article from Vice promotes a book by the feminist thinker Sophie Lewis called Full Surrogacy Now, which is a polemic that calls for abolishing the family.  When Lewis demands full surrogacy now, she isn't talking about commercial surrogacy or surrogacy TM, as she puts it.  Instead, she uses the surrogacy industry to build the argument that all gestation is work because of the immense physical and emotional labor it requires of those who do it.  She often refers to pregnancy as an extreme sport.  If all forms of pregnancy count as work, we can take a clear-eyed look at our current working conditions.  It is a wonder we let fetuses inside us, she says at the start of her book, citing the roughly 1,000 people in the United States who still die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth each year, mostly poor women and women of color.  Yes, it's true that pregnancy is extremely difficult and that unfortunately, in some cases, women do die.  But saying that women shouldn't give birth because it's difficult and there are risks is kind of like saying that men shouldn't perform dangerous yet necessary jobs because every year there's between four and six thousand male workplace fatalities.  Also, it's not as if the nuclear family is solely responsible for certain women dying during pregnancy and that If we replaced this with a surrogacy industry, suddenly no women would ever again die during pregnancy.  No one is claiming that pregnancy is easy, that it's some kind of walk in the park.  It's a well-known fact that pregnancy can take an extraordinary toll on women's minds and bodies.  that things like childbirth and breastfeeding are indescribably painful.  But these enormous sacrifices are ones that many women choose to make of their own free will out of love for their children.  Lewis imagines a future where the labor of making new human beings is shared among all of us, mother no longer being a natural category, but instead something we can choose.  But it is something we can choose.  Nowadays, each and every one of us does have the choice, at least in the West, whether or not we would like to be mothers.  Also, Lewis incorrectly assumes that in a healthy nuclear family, the mother would have 100% of the responsibilities when it comes to raising the children.  While yes, the mother does do a lot of the work, when it comes to a nuclear family that's intact, she would generally also receive help from her husband and from her other children when they're old enough.  Many mothers also receive help from grandparents, aunts, and their friends.  There used to be a time when we had strong, tight-knit communities with a high level of trust among the residents.  In fact, I grew up in a community that was exactly like this.  So when my mom had to run some errands and didn't want to bring all the kids along because she had eight kids, that's, you know, quite a circus, she had absolutely no misgivings about leaving us with the neighbors for a few hours.  There's a saying that it takes a village to raise a family, and in some respects this is true.  But what happens when you can no longer trust the quote-unquote village that you live in, when your communities have become atomized and hostile?  when almost every child comes from a broken family.  The solution then becomes to focus on fixing the nuclear family and to rebuild the communities that have been damaged.  Not to scrap the entire system that's worked for us for so long and then to surrender all of our children to absolute strangers to be raised in God knows what way.  At this point, surrogacy becomes somewhat metaphorical.  Lewis isn't asking that we all agree to physically gestate fetuses that aren't biologically ours.  Her radical proposition is that we practice full surrogacy by abolishing the family.  That means caring for each other not in discrete private units, also known as nuclear households, but rather within larger systems of care that can provide us with the love and support we can't always get from blood relations, something Lewis knows all too well.  In Lewis's utopian future, the family as we know it no longer exists.  Everyone, regardless of gender, is a surrogate.  We mother each other.  There is a heck of a lot to say here, but first of all, I wouldn't call this future of Sophie Lewis's some kind of original vision.  It's been discussed by many people in the past, but what immediately comes to my mind is the very popular fiction book, Brave New World.  In Brave New World, the traditional family unit is non-existent.  In fact, there is no longer even any natural birth.  New people are instead engineered through artificial wounds.  There are no mothers, fathers, siblings, or relatives in the world state because familial loyalties and strong emotional bonds are considered to cause instability.  The citizens of the world state are also led to believe that everyone belongs to everyone and they should have numerous sectional partners, monogamy is discouraged.  I find it very interesting that Sophie Lewis's vision of the future, in which the family is abolished, is referred to as utopian.  It's clear that what people like Sophie Lewis are envisioning is a permanent happiness, something resembling a perfect life on Earth.  Of course, while we can strive for such a life, in reality, it's never going to happen.  We're never going to achieve a utopia simply because human nature is too flawed.  I genuinely am sorry for Sophie Lewis that she wasn't blessed with a healthy and happy childhood and family life.  But it's no excuse to try to destroy the entire system of the nuclear family simply because she believes that it failed her.  What's more, there are massive flaws in her utopian theory.  Firstly, there's never going to be complete equality because people aren't robots.  People are always going to naturally like some people more than they do others, and people are always going to naturally give some more love, attention, and care to some people more than they do others.  Even in a society where people equally share the responsibility of raising children, There's still going to exist favoritism and negligence, hatred and abuse of certain children.  There is no complete fix to this problem.  I actually found an article which goes over several examples regarding how, at least for the most part, the data reveals that being raised by both biological parents is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not a child will actually be safe and loved.  This is certainly not to say that a child raised by only one biological parent or that has been adopted won't be safe and loved.  The article is simply speaking in overall terms.  Furthermore, in Sophie Lewis's vision for the future, Children being raised in some kind of large and centralized system of care will make it much easier to indoctrinate them, to have power over very young children to make them all follow the same religion or lack thereof, to make them all have the same political beliefs, or to introduce them to things like drag queen story hour against their biological parents' wishes, or even to ostracize the few children who refuse to fall in line.  For the most part, everyone will end up being cut from the exact same cloth.  But maybe this is exactly what Sophie Lewis wants.  Once again, the best solution is not to replace the nuclear family, it's to fix it.  But before we can even start doing that, we as a society do need to return to a position where we actually regard the nuclear family as a positive thing, as something of importance that's worthy of incentivization and protection.  Otherwise, there's really nothing stopping feminists from destroying it in the exact same way that they're trying to destroy nearly every other sense of normalcy when it comes to relationships between men and women.
