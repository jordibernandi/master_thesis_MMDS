            "text": "Now we can shake our fists at this and say, how terrible.  Or perhaps can we make this a Pascalian moment and say, okay, I've got the opportunity now, it's a rare opportunity, to sit quietly in a room alone and wrestle with the deep questions of life.  Maybe this is a great spiritual opportunity.  That's what's been occurring to me.  The great 17th century French philosopher Blaise Pascal, who was one of my spiritual heroes, has a famous one-liner I've always savored.  He said, all of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.  Now, I know that sounds like an introvert's fantasy, but he's getting at something very interesting.  Namely, most of us spend most of our time diverting ourselves from the serious and important questions.  So Pascal talked a lot about divertissement in his French, diversions or distractions.  So instead of dealing with the great questions of, does God exist?  Who am I?  Why am I here?  Heaven and hell?  Where am I going?  The purpose of my life?  All the great questions.  What we do most of the time is we seek out divertissement, distractions.  Now Pascal, though he was one of the most brilliant men of his age, one of the pioneers of modern science, indeed one of the pioneers of computer sciences.  We wouldn't have computers were it not for Pascal.  So a brilliant man.  Died young, too.  Died, I think, the age of 39.  Nevertheless, he knew that he frittered a lot of his life away with divertissement.  He was famous for gambling, almost a gambling addiction.  So he said that's the tragedy for most people is that we don't have the ability to sit quietly by ourselves in a room alone and deal with the serious questions.  Okay, this little Pascalian mo, this Pascalian saying has been coming to my mind a lot.  as we've entered in now to this phase of the coronavirus crisis.  The whole society is shutting down.  Think of, I mean, from airports and restaurants and bars and, you know, the places that we go to do what?  To seek out fellowship in divertissement, right?  All the places we go to seek out diversions have now been taken away from us.  Now we can shake our fists at this and say, how terrible, or perhaps can we make this a Pascalian moment and say, okay, I've got the opportunity now, it's a rare opportunity, to sit quietly in a room alone and wrestle with the deep questions of life.  Maybe this is a great spiritual opportunity.  That's what's been occurring to me.  So can I make some recommendations as we're in now our little period of imposed monasticism, if you want?  How about recover the Bible?  So take out your Bibles.  Probably most people have a Bible in their home.  Is it gathering dust somewhere?  Is it in a drawer someplace?  Take it out.  Spend some real quality time with it.  I might recommend, especially to Catholics, read one of the Gospels in its entirety during this time.  Not that long.  I might recommend Matthew, which we're reading during this liturgical year.  Read it well, slowly, prayerfully, maybe with a good commentary.  Or pick another book, maybe a book of the Old Testament that you've always been sort of intrigued by or interested in or you've been ignoring it.  Well, all right.  Here's your time to be alone in a room with some of the deep questions.  Get back into the Bible.  Now, one of the ways to approach the Bible is to use this method which the last several popes have been recommending to us, namely Lectio Divina.  You know how that works?  It's a simple four-step process, Lectio Divina.  It's just Latin for divine reading, by the way.  Lectio Divina.  You take a passage from the Bible, so not the whole gospel, but maybe it's the gospel for the coming Sunday, or take a section that you like, or a couple paragraphs.  First step, Lectio, which means read it.  But don't just read it like you read your email.  No, no, read it slowly and prayerfully and carefully.  The second step is called meditatio, meditation.  Now, what happens there?  Find one phrase or one word or one basic idea from that passage that has jumped out at you, grabbed your attention.  Maybe it's something that you never noticed before.  You know, you've heard that passage many times, but, boy, I never noticed that word or that phrase.  Now, meditate on it.  And the medieval masters always compared it to the work of a ruminating animal.  That means an animal that chews its cud.  So the animal regurgitates the food and then chews on it and gets all the juices out of it.  And so meditation is like chewing on the cud of this passage.  So you're going to get all that you can out of this particular word or phrase.  Third step is called oratio, prayer.  So now I've read it, I've found a phrase, I've meditated upon it, and now prayer.  I'm going to speak to God out of that experience.  So what do I say to the Lord based on what I've heard from this scripture?  Speak, oratio.  Last step is called contemplatio, contemplation.  Now, having read, having meditated, having spoken, I now listen.  What is the Lord telling me in this passage that I just read, in that word or phrase I meditated upon?  What's he telling me in response to the prayer I've just made?  Much more we could say about Lectio Divina, but those four steps.  Here's your chance.  Here's your moment.  Coronavirus-imposed monasticism.  Here's a time to be alone in your room by yourself, and you can do some serious Lectio Divina.  Trust me when I tell you, everybody, the Bible will come to life.  If you take the time to do this method, the Bible will come to life for you.  Okay, what else can you do during this time of self-imposed exile?  Can I recommend This Is Your Moment to read one of the spiritual classics?  So maybe a lot of us, we've heard about these great texts and these great books, but we never read them.  See, mind you, prior to the Enlightenment, Most of the most brilliant people in the West gave themselves to philosophy, theology, and spirituality.  And they left behind this treasure trove of texts.  One of the problems of the Enlightenment is we look at math and science and physics and chemistry, and those are all great.  They're all great.  But we tend to overlook the spiritual richness of our tradition.  Well, here's your chance.  Here's your time.  Could I recommend a couple things?  Get a copy of St.  Augustine's Confessions.  There are a lot of good translations.  Maria Balding's is my favorite.  It's a contemporary translation.  It makes it read a bit like a novel.  Frank Sheed has a wonderful kind of classic translation of the Confessions.  But get St.  Augustine's Confessions.  Read especially the first nine books of it, where he tells the story of his life.  The miracle of that book is, though it's written in the fourth century, trust me, you'll recognize yourself in it.  It's the story of a soul that's hungry for God, that's thirsting for God.  And all of the different roads he went down and trials he faced and difficulties, Take the time during this little monastic period to read Augustine's Confessions.  Much shorter text, but man, influential as all get out.  St.  Benedict's rule that set the tone for the Benedictine monastic movement, which in turn influenced a lot of Western civilization after the fall of Rome.  Take out the rule.  Read especially the Twelve Steps of Humility.  I think you'll find a lot of spiritual richness there.  If you dare, the Spiritual Exercises of St.  Ignatius.  You don't so much read them, you do them.  Maybe if you can find a good director who doesn't have coronavirus, do the Ignatian exercises during this time.  Ignatius calls upon us to do a 30-day, a full month, but there are shorter versions, 8-day, and then there's a way of doing it when you're not away on retreat, kind of on your own.  Get out the Ignatian exercises.  Find a good director.  Here's your chance.  Take an 8-day Ignatian retreat during this time.  If any of that seems too difficult or too archaic, might I recommend one of my favorite books, Thomas Merton's Seven-Story Mountain.  So written by a 20th century figure, he just died in 1968.  But Merton tells this in compelling prose, a story of someone journeying from being a whirlwind, someone totally caught up in just the goods of this world, and the journey that brought him from that state to being a Trappist monk, like the most serious kind of monk you can be.  I read it when I was 16.  It changed my life.  No kidding.  Here's your chance.  Oh, it's too long.  It's 400 pages.  I don't have time for these spiritual books.  Yeah, you do, actually.  Here's your time.  You do have time.  So go to your room by yourself.  Here's a chance to wrestle with some of the deeper questions.  So try Merton's Seven-Story Mountain.  You know, here's something else.  I got the grace of living out here in Santa Barbara, California.  I've got mountains five minutes north of me.  I got the sea about seven minutes south of me.  I love hiking up in the mountains.  I love walking on the beach.  Whatever your version of that is, maybe it's the hillside, it's the country, it's the field, it's the, I don't know, riverfront, whatever you got, where you like to go just to be alone, go.  Do it.  Maybe you can't go to work.  Everything's shut down.  All right, go for that long walk.  Maybe while you're on that walk, take out your rosary.  Now, maybe Catholics say, oh gosh, the rosary.  I got one around somewhere.  It's gathering dust in a drawer.  Here's your time.  Here's your moment.  Take it out.  Rosary is a great prayer.  You meditate on the mysteries of Christ.  If you pray the whole thing 50 times, remind yourself of your own death.  Now that's very Paschalian, by the way, because at the end of that prayer, what do you say?  Now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.  Now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.  Now and at the hour of our death.  Fifty times.  You remind yourself of your own death.  and you invoke the most powerful intercessor on heaven or on earth.  It's not a bad way to spend 20 minutes.  Take out your rosary as you're going for your walk and spend some time alone.  You're not in a room, but you're alone on the mountainside or you're alone on the beach dealing with some of the big questions.  Might I recommend this to everybody?  Put away the iPhones.  It just drives me crazy when I'm out on the beach or something, or up in the mountains, and you're surrounded by this gorgeous countryside, and you've got people looking at their goofball iPhones.  Put it away.  Put your head up and look at God's creation.  Thank Him for it.  Gosh, maybe I haven't even noticed the beauty of nature around me.  I've been so caught up in all my divertissement, right?  All right, it's time to put away the divertissement, time to be alone by yourself in that room or out in the woods or whatever.  Good.  Here's the time to wrestle with the deep stuff.  So, can I urge everybody, don't simply think of this time as, oh, burden, or oh, what a terrible moment.  Remember what Jean-Pierre de Caussade said, that everything that happens is in some way the will of God, either actively or permissively.  Has God at least permitted this time to happen?  Yeah, clearly.  Okay.  Therefore, there's some reason for it.  Maybe this is it.  Maybe it's time for you to sit alone in a room by yourself and wrestle with the really deep questions.
