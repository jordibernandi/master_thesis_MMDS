            "text": "Hey, shalom, everyone.  This is Amir Tsarfati.  I'm here for breaking news.  I am not going to give my Middle East update today.  It's going to be a couple days from now.  But breaking news, President Trump just announced that Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco just agreed on a comprehensive peace deal that will include exchange of ambassadors, opening of embassies, and the full deal.  And that is due to President Trump's efforts to reach that agreement by ways of.  For the first time, America is recognizing Western Sahara, which is a region known as... I'll give you the exact definition.  It's a region that is known as a non-acknowledged area.  autonomous part.  but again this is something that since 1963 it's called United Nations list of non-self-governing territories, ladies and gentlemen non-self- governing territory of Western Sahara.  Of course, there are some militias that wants to control it.  Morocco claimed that area to be its territory for the longest time.  The Arab League approved that, the African countries over there did.  But there was no main country that actually acknowledged that.  As of today, America is the first country and you don't need more than that to acknowledge Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara.  And we're talking about the most populous territory on the list of non-self-governing territories of the United Nations.  Ladies and gentlemen, America paid.  for Israel to have peace with Morocco.  I hope you understand what I'm saying.  This is huge.  This is the fourth Muslim country that signed peace with Israel in the last three months.  That is unheard of.  Morocco has had a non-formal relationship with Israel for the longest time, but it never, ever recognized the State of Israel, never.  And what we see ever since the United Arab Emirates signed its first deal is that the new formula for the Arab world, the Muslim world is, although we may have some political differences with Israel, we can still collaborate with Israel on every other area.  In other words, they learn to put aside the Palestinian issue.  No longer it is the block, the stumbling block that will stop them from having peace with Israel.  And they can collaborate.  I mean the UAE already has trade deals with Israel in the hundreds of millions, if not the billions already.  And so ladies and gentlemen, big news, big news, President Trump just announced an hour ago that Israel and Morocco are going to have a peace deal that has been achieved already now, but they're going to sign it probably in the coming few weeks in the White House.  Listen to me, if President Trump is not going to win a Nobel Peace Prize, Then we... I'm not sure how to even relate to what... Look, I'm already fed up with the disappointments from institutions and establishments, but this is so... So obvious that he deserves that, so obvious that, hey, the establishment might not like it, but they will have to give it to him.  I'm telling you that there is no U.S.  president in history that brought so many peace deals in the Middle East between countries that were rivals for the longest time, for decades.  No president did that without firing a single shot and without having Israel paying with land.  We give nothing to Morocco.  We give nothing to the UAE.  We gave nothing to Sudan.  We gave nothing to Bahrain.  Ladies and gentlemen, and we are actually making, we're making more and more and more.  You know, we are creating more.  More deals, you know, while the Palestinians are fighting to boycott anything that comes from Judea and Samaria, vineyards and wineries from Samaria on the West Bank.  cut deals with restaurants and hotels in Dubai.  They're now serving wine from the mountains of Samaria.  And by the way, this is prophecy.  The Bible says that yet you will plant again vineyards in the mountains of Samaria, and you will drink the wine thereof.  Not only we, but we're exporting it to countries that up until five years ago, you would think it makes no sense.  Look, on one hand, we see a new Middle East.  We see the reality of hard work of diplomacy.  On the other hand, in Washington DC today, the Constitution of the United States of America is in stake.  today or in the coming days as they deal with that lawsuit of the state of Texas together with 17 more states.  At 3  p.m.,  by 3  p.m.,  the replies from the six states that are being sued, has to arrive in the Supreme Court.  And we'll see if SCOTUS is part of the solution or part of the problem.  All I can tell you is as Things are happening over there in Washington, D.C.  President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu are working tirelessly to bring peace to this area.  This peace is not a peace that is about the temple in Jerusalem.  It's not a peace that is about dividing Israel.  It's not a peace that is done by the Antichrist.  This is the peace that comes before the Ezekiel War.  This is the peace that makes Israel safe, secure, and prosperous.  We live in the days of Ezekiel.  God is using world leaders such as Netanyahu and Trump to bring about stuff that... I mean, look, we need to thank God that we... I just sang, we just light the first candles in Hanukkah.  I just rushed back to the office from my house.  We lit the first candle and we were singing.  Blessed are You, Father, the Lord, the Creator of the universe, that brought us forth, sustained us, and that gave us life, sustained us, and brought us forth to this very day.  The Lord gave us life.  The Lord sustained us, and the Lord brought us forth to this very day.  Here we are, the most blessed generation since the time of Jesus Christ.  We're watching on one hand prophecy being unfolded and being fulfilled in the Middle East.  And on the other hand, we see the world going crazy to try and bring about globalism, communism, Marxism, and a world system that will prepare the rain for the Antichrist.  We are watching both at the same time.  And here we are waiting, looking up because our redemption is drawing near.  Wow, listen, this is it.  I just wanted to tell you breaking news, peace deal between Israel and Morocco, brokered by President Trump.  All it took for America is to recognize Western Sahara as Moroccan territory, this place.  It has been disputed for the longest time.  Spain controlled it until the 20th century since the 1960s.  It's a non-recognized, I tell you, it's on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since 1963.  And Morocco demanded it.  The Arab League recognized it as Moroccan, and for the first time we see the United States of America recognizing it as Moroccan territory.  And that, of course, paved the way for Morocco to say, okay, if Israel made America recognizing that, then we will have peace with Israel.  And this is it, folks.  President Trump paid political price to stand for Israel and to bring peace for the state of Israel with another Arab Muslim country.  This is who this man is.  He actually participated in Hanukkah candle lighting ceremony yesterday at the White House.  And he looked great and he sounded great.  And he said, guys, we're gonna win.  So hey, the Lord is good.  Remember that.  And I anticipate wonderful things in the near future.  And for us, the believers, it's a win-win.  Either we win four more years to see great things happening here, or we're taking up to see great things happening there.  We should not grow weary.  We should not.  feel bad and depressed and tired and all of that.  No, no, this is the finish line.  Give everything you can to finish the race, to fight the fight, to keep the faith, and to stay faithful servant of God as He comes and sees you doing His business.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Listen, share this because, again, Facebook has been suppressing our page.  Let me tell you something, guys.  You want to know something?  Two months ago, before the election in America came to its height, we used to reach 12 million people on our Facebook page, Behold Israel.  Facebook suppressed us ever since the election started and I said what I said about the elections and about the virus.  Facebook in the last two months are after us and they suppressed us to the point that our page is now down to 1.5 million only because they suppress us.  They want to kill this page.  They want to kill my social media presence.  But he that is in us is much greater.  and stronger and better.  holier and mightier than he that is in this world.  So I'm not going to be intimidated, but please share this.  Share this peace deal between Israel and Morocco, prophecies fulfilled before our very eyes.  This is not the deal of the Antichrist.  This is the deal that will lead to the war of Ezekiel.  Israel again must be safe, secure, and prosperous.  This is exactly what we are watching right now.  Turkey is getting angry.  Iran is getting angry.  Russia is very confused.  what's going on here.  And we are making peace.  We are having peace.  And we're prospering therefrom.  This is amazing.  It is amazing.  I want to see four more years of that.  If not, I want to spend seven years up there while this world will be judged rightfully.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Shalom from Galilee.  Tomorrow I'm going to lead my son to the chuppah, to the wedding.  He's marrying his fiancee, Emilia.  And tomorrow is a very, very special day for us as a family.  Pray for us.  And thank you.  We love you.  God bless you.  Shalom from Galilee.  And please share this one.  God bless you.  Bye-bye. ",
