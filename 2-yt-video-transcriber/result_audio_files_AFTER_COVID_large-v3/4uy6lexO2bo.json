            "text": "Hey guys, have you ever been really interested in a girl and you're not really sure if she's interested in you or if she just likes you as a friend?  Well, and sometimes it can be a little challenging because you might not have actually asked her out officially.  So, you're kind of waiting for signs to see if she is or isn't interested in you.  So, these signs are mostly for if you are friends with a woman and you haven't actually declared your interest in her overtly.  So, she's now trying to give you hints that she's not interested in you as more than a friend.  because if she actually tells you that she's not interested in you as more than a friend then you might be offended or make it awkward by saying well, I never said I was interested in you.  Whereas, you know you are but you just haven't had the cojones to actually tell her.  And there is one thing that I will suggest that she will tell you if you actually have expressed a direct interest in her romantically.  So, we will get to that.  but the first thing to look for if she's only interested in you as a friend is that she doesn't reply quickly or sometimes at all to your messages.  So, you'll message her and she might take hours or even days to reply back.  The second thing is that she won't use flirty emojis.  So, some younger women or girls will use flirty emojis even if they're not really interested just because they're so used to using emojis for everything and they may be signs of affection friendship wise but not sexual wise.  So, that brings me to number three.  Third thing is that if you give her a compliment she says aww and then puts a smiley face.  Which brings me to the fourth thing which is that she doesn't reciprocate any kind of physical compliments to you and she certainly doesn't escalate anything in a sexual manner especially with compliments.  Fifth thing is she takes forever to reply when she actually does reply.  So, you might be in a conversation but you'll reply right away or send a message right away and then she takes literally hours to reply back or sometimes days and this goes on and on for an extended conversation.  So, she's just always putting you on the back burner as far as getting back to you with messages.  Which brings me to number six which is that she doesn't try to keep the conversation going.  Now, some women are just not very good at conversations but most of the time if they're interested.  they'll figure out some way to continuously try to engage with you to get to know you better.  If she just answers your questions fairly briefly and doesn't try to continue a conversation it's more likely that she just doesn't want to continue the conversation.  Seven, she is always too busy to see you.  So, that's pretty clear.  if you're always the one initiating trying to make plans and she just never has the time for you.  She might be busy but if you were a priority to her especially a romantic priority she would find the time for you.  Eight, she cancels plans with you to do things with other people.  And she may tell you that she's canceling to do things with other people or you may just find out that she's made plans with other people instead of committing to the plans that she's made with you.  So, you're just not a priority.  Nine, she doesn't include you in her world.  She won't try to invite you in with friends or really include you in the things that she does on a day-to-day basis.  Did I just say nine or ten?  Anyway, ten, she distances herself from you physically.  So, if you try to get into her you know, the what's that space called?  The intimate space you know, our intimate bubble where we get close with people.  If she is constantly kind of shuffling to be away from being too close to you then that's a really good sign that you are in the friend zone my friend.  Now, 11 is a little bit tricky because sometimes a girl will do this if she's interested in you because she's testing you to see how you handle it and sometimes she'll do it to try to make you uninterested in her.  And so, number 11 is picking fights.  So, she'll try to find something to argue with you about.  If she's not interested in you she's trying to distance herself and trying to find things that you don't have in common so that you will subconsciously or psychologically not like her.  So, you might realize that you're not compatible the way you think you are.  Now, the only way to tell between if this is a test to see how you actually react to being tested or teased or sort of poked at a little bit if she's interested in you romantically is to watch for all the other signs.  Because that'll tell you whether she's trying to push you away or if she's just trying to figure out your character.  Twelve, She never initiates conversation or very rarely initiates conversation and she never asks you to actually hang out.  Which kind of brings me to number 13 which is when she does actually ask you to hang out it's because she's bored and she doesn't have any other plans or if her other plans fall through.  So, same thing if she actually initiates a text it might be that it's a Friday night or a Saturday night and plans with Chad fell through and now she's bored and she wants to actually just chat with somebody.  So, if you're only getting messages from her or if she only initiates wanting to hang out you know, last minute then that's a pretty good sign that you're not a priority for her romantically, sorry.  Sorry, not chads.  Number 14 is that she talks about other guys she's interested in and even asks you your opinion about how she can get with them or she's basically treating you like a girlfriend.  So, if she's talking about other guys it could be that she's testing you to see how you react.  but if there's not a whole bunch of signs that she's actually interested in you romantically then it's more likely that she's trying to dissuade you from liking her by letting you know that she likes somebody else.  15, she avoids being seen with you or tagged with you in social media.  So, if you're out somewhere socially and there's a selfie or there's a picture taken with you she will try to put other people in the picture or she will try to stand further away from you or not be seen with you or tagged with you in the photo because she doesn't want to let the guys she's actually really interested in or the one guy she's actually interested in.  she doesn't want him to think that she's with you.  And even if there's no other guys right now she doesn't want any new potential guys to think that she's with you.  16 is that she's vague when you actually ask her out.  And this can just basically mean that she doesn't have other plans yet but she's waiting to see if something better comes up.  Again, you're not a priority.  you are the back burner guy.  17 is if you actually do nail down plans with her that she tries to reschedule and she does that as often as she can find other better things to do with other people.  She may even reschedule to spend time by herself because she'd rather be by herself than spend time with you.  I know that's not fun.  Okay, let's move on.  18 is she tries to avoid running into you in public.  Now, this might be hard for you to actually notice because if she's avoiding you in public then how are you going to know that she's avoiding you?  if she's successful at avoiding you?  But if you're in places where you know she's supposed to be and you know she's not there or maybe she's going at a different time like maybe you go to the same gym together and now she's going at a different time or maybe you go to the same cafeteria together at the same time and now she's going at a different time.  If it seems like she's trying to avoid you by doing things outside of times where you would normally see her then she probably is.  Because if she's actually interested in you she will contact you and say hey, I didn't see you at the cafeteria.  Hey, I didn't see you at the gym.  Hey, I've been busy and you know, I had this other appointment.  that's why I wasn't at the gym.  I'm sorry I missed you.  So, if she's trying to avoid you you will see it in your life because you won't see her as often as you normally do if you normally do see her.  19, another one is that she avoids being alone with you.  So, she will not maybe spend time with you at your place or in places where it might be construed that you could make a move on her or that maybe somebody will see you together and think you're a couple.  She will not want to make it seem like you're a couple and she will also want to not give you a chance to try and elevate or escalate the relationship in a sexual way.  So, she'll avoid being alone with you.  And that kind of brings me to number 20 which is that she'll avoid doing coupley things with you.  So, again, She might go to the movies with you, she doesn't think anybody's gonna see you there, but she'll avoid doing things one-on-one with you that could be construed by you or anybody else that you might be a couple.  Now, if you've been good friends for a long time, then you might be in the space where she will do that, But again, you just have to watch for all of these other signs that she's not interested in you.  And you can also watch the other video I did on signs that she is interested in you so that you can compare just because we're hanging out today in a public place where it could be construed that we're a couple.  If that's the only one thing that you've got out of this whole list then it's not really a solid foundation for thinking that she's actually into you, sorry.  Now, two bonus things that you can watch for which are also a little bit tricky to distinguish I guess would be one is if she always lets you pay but never reciprocates in any way then she could be just using you.  And two, the opposite of this is that she always insists on paying for herself no matter what.  If she's always letting you pay then she's just using you.  Yeah, well anyways, okay.  if she's never letting you pay then yeah, either she's a super feminist or she doesn't want to owe you anything.  So, those are the two bonus signs to watch for and again the only way to know you know, whether or not it's just because of her natural character or if she's trying to keep you in the friend zone by looking for all of the other signs.  So, the thing to remember is that she's trying not to hurt your feelings and if she's just being nice or kind but she's not actually saying hey, I'm really not into you.  It's because you haven't actually given her you know, something official to work with.  If you haven't expressed that you are interested in her then she's not going to be feeling comfortable enough to say look, I'm just not interested in you romantically because that would feel really weird, right?  Like, you don't just tell someone you're not interested in them if they haven't told you they're interested in you.  You just have to show them that you're not interested in them romantically.  And as I promised, what if you actually have indicated your interest in her romantically?  Now, what?  Well, the final thing that she might do to let you know that she's not interested in you is actually tell you she's not interested in you.  So, if you've declared your feelings for her or your interests or attraction to her and she says I just don't see you as more than a friend then don't think that she's asking you to try harder or that things are going to change down the road.  You have to take it at face value.  Maybe one day it would change but if you just hang around hoping for that then it's going to keep her away.  So what you persist resists, right?  So basically meaning that the more she feels the tension of you longing for her, the more she will have her guard up to keep you at bay, to keep your feelings at bay because she won't want to encourage you unless she's a see you next Tuesday, in which case you need to get the heck out of there because... She's not a good one, she's just a user.  So, have you seen any of these signs with someone that you were hoping would be romantically interested in you?  Let me know in the comments. ",
