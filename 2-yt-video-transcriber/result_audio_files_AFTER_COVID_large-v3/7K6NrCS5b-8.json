            "text": "I find it so synchronistic that so many people have asked me in the last two or three weeks specifically if I believe in God.  They've asked me if I believe in God and if I believe in Jesus Christ and I find this so interesting as a question because sometimes on the spiritual path we can lose track of how people view spirituality.  So I wanted to make this very quick, very candid message as I chill in this gorgeous oasis in Muskoka by the lake, by the beautiful lake, which is right ahead of me, that not only do I believe in God, but God is in every atom of my being.  God is in every molecule.  God is in my breath and I am from the soup of God, just like you are from the soup of God.  And I'll take it one step further.  If God has breathed, if our creator has breathed his essence into you and me, that makes you a God being just like it makes me a God being.  So it's very important to differentiate between spiritual teachers or spiritual people on the ascension path, getting a disconnect, feeling a disconnect with religion and confusing that with us not having a relationship or a a reverence for our Creator, far from it.  I've also said that Jesus Christ, Lord Sananda, is one of my guides.  It's one of my most beautiful guides.  So the way we look at God and the way we look at angels and the way we look at Ascended Masters is that you, me, the angels, the Ascended Masters, Jesus Christ, we're all serving the same purpose.  We're all made of God.  We're all serving our Creator.  We're all serving the universe.  We're all evolving.  we're all helping with the evolution of the universe and we're all God beings.  Meaning we can experience anything we choose to experience.  We are in a state of free will right now.  So as a God being, I can choose to experience whatever I want, whether it's fear, I can choose to experience joy.  I can choose to experience guilt.  I can use, choose to experience poverty.  I can choose to experience abundance.  So while we have this bond, this closeness, this reverence, this unity, this oneness with our creator, because we are so aware of our creator in every moment of our time and every breath we take, we're so aware of our creator that our creator is not outside of us, our creator is within us.  And we understand that religion was used as a tool to divide us.  Because we are all children of God.  And God does not divide based on color, on religion, on creed.  Does a mother do that?  Does a mother of, let's say, eight discriminate between her eight children?  So how could God do that to us?  So what I'm saying is that I have moved away from religion altogether as a practicing Hindu to a practicing Muslim.  I spent 18 years in Hinduism, 18 years in Islam.  And now I've never ever felt a stronger connection with God because unlike what religion or at least the modern day religions teach, God is not someone waiting up there in heaven to punish us or to, you know, Send us to hell or send us to burn in hellfire.  That's not what God is here to do.  God is in every single one of us in the sense that every experience that we wish to have as God beings is valid.  Every experience that we wish to have is valid because we are God's.  And with religion, it is so messed up because when I was in practicing religious family, it's just full of hypocrisies.  There's so much hypocrisy in religion, is there not?  So we have moved away from the conditioning of what we have been taught to believe.  God is or isn't.  And we are moving into behaving like the gods that we are and realizing that by raising our vibration, raising our vibrational frequency, we can enter the fifth dimensional consciousness and activate our God power, our God beingness, our godliness.  We can activate this.  A few minutes ago, about half an hour ago, I asked for rain.  And within three or four minutes, I saw the clouds moving here, clouds moving there.  And I thought to myself, the clouds are literally moving towards us to answer our call.  And it rained.  It was beautiful.  I took a video.  I might insert it here.  It was beautiful.  And as I watched this gorgeous rain, I thought to myself, This is the universe responding to our call.  This is the universe responding to our call.  Once you anchor fifth dimensional consciousness, you become the God being that you are.  And try teaching that to someone who is still extremely polarized in religion.  They just won't get it.  And I don't blame them because if you had told me that 15 years ago, I would have thought you're nuts.  I wouldn't have got it.  But as we evolve, as our soul evolves, we start to see the brilliance of how we all went through religion.  Many of us went through religion to understand how polarized it is, understand how screwed up it is.  So many hypocrisies, so many hypocrisies.  Even within religion, the Shias hate the Sunnis.  The Sunnis judge the Aga Khanis.  In Christians, it's the same thing.  Protestants and all kinds of bullshit.  And we have now freed ourselves and activated the template of how a connection with God is really developed.  It is not through fear.  It's not through programming.  It's not through guilt.  It's not through confessions.  It's not through going to church.  It's not through kneeling.  Nope.  It's through living your highest joy and your highest, keeping your body in the highest shape possible, keeping your emotional and mental state in the most thriving energies possible because you're God and you're giving God the experience of a lifetime with your incarnation here on this planet.  You're giving God the experience of a lifetime because God is experiencing earth through you right now.  So the more you activate your happiness, your bliss, your excitement, your power, your boundaries, your sovereignty, your expression of joy, your creativity, the more God you activate within yourself.  And that is what we say is merging with your higher self.  You're merging with the godly parts of you.  that were always there but that have been dulled and dumbed through the programming.  So whatever religious traditions, God does not expect us to do any of that stuff.  God does not expect us to pray.  God does not expect us to fast.  God does not expect us to do anything but Just treat each other well.  And even if you don't, God is all forgiving because he understands that you're here as a soul.  You're here as a soul to follow your own free will.  victim in this lifetime you might have been a perpetrator in your last lifetime and that is the evolution of a soul.  you go through these cycles.  you go through these cycles of being a victim and then a perpetrator a victim and a perpetrator until you realize and you come to the realization that your peace your sovereignty your word your integrity is all you got and that is your evolution.  so when you look at someone else who hasn't reached that there's no judgment.  There's no judgment because you were there in a lifetime not too long ago.  So God doesn't judge his children.  God doesn't judge.  Simply what happens is when we transition and when we leave this earth plane.  So in other words, when we die from this physical body, all we do is we leave this physical body and our soul is extracted.  Our soul is basically returned to home.  We have a few days of rest.  And then all we do is we have a meeting with our council of guides and we say, all right, what happened in this earth incarnation?  Let's recheck the checklist.  We went to practice this, this, this.  We went to help earth with this.  We went to help earth with the awakening.  We went to forgive.  We went to learn forgiveness.  We went to learn compassion.  Or it could be.  we went to feel what poverty is all about.  We went to feel how painful it is to be a victim of rape.  So when you go back, all you're doing is you're reviewing it and there's no judgment.  There is no hellfire.  There's no punishment.  The only time there is a consequence is what's happening right now with those of the dark who have broken universal laws of satanic pedophilia.  That's a totally different story.  I'm talking about people like you and me.  Divine God beings who are not harming anyone, but who are just learning through our lessons of polarity right now.  So I hope that helped.  I definitely... Hope that helped because it's a beautiful question.  Do you believe in God?  I just found that very interesting.  Thank you. ",
