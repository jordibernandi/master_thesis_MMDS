            "text": "what's up beautiful family.  hope that you guys are having a great afternoon.  so i wanted to come on here and just give you guys some encouragement today.  um i know a lot of people are discouraged because The Feast of Trumpets has came and passed.  However, this does not mean that the Lord is not coming.  I know that everybody gets really hyped up on high watch days and times.  However, that doesn't mean that we set a date.  That doesn't mean that the Lord definitely is coming on that day and time.  I want you guys to remember that even though there are high watch times, there Every day is a high watch time and it doesn't mean that the Lord is not coming or that anything has changed because we know that the Lord could literally come at any moment.  And he does tell us that we would know the times and the seasons.  Like I've told you guys numerous times, he says for the times and seasons, I don't even need to write you.  You will know perfectly why because you're children of the light.  His coming.  It will happen like a thief in the night.  And for those that are not watching.  It will take them like a thief in the night.  But for those who are watching.  He said it's not going to take you off guard.  Because you're children of the light.  And you will know.  So.  First of all, I have a scripture for the mockers and scoffers because they are heavy.  They are out right now.  And you know what?  You guys, whoever you are out there mocking and scoffing the rapture of the church, you You are fulfilling Bible prophecy right before our very eyes.  Shout out to y'all.  This one is for y'all.  2 Peter 3, verse 3-4 says, \"...knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming?  For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of  creation.\".  How many of y'all have been seeing these people who are literally mocking and saying, oh, you think, you know, Jesus is coming.  Look at you guys.  You think that you're, you know, going to get to escape soon.  Ha ha.  You know, your Lord, he didn't return on the fees of trumpets.  Look, ha, he's, he's not really coming.  Guys, there are so many people out right now who even look and seem like they have a zeal for God, like the Bible talks about.  they seem like they're you know like they love the lord and but it's these people do not belong to the lord like the bible talks about.  and you you see them.  they're everywhere.  they're out um like crazy right now literally mocking us um they are just laughing in our faces saying look you guys look so stupid.  The rapture of the church, it didn't happen.  When will you ever just realize that it's not going to happen?  Guys, they are everywhere.  So if you see them, they are literally fulfilling Bible prophecy right before our very eyes.  And he says... in the last days mockers and scoffers will come and they'll say where is the promise of his coming?  they are everywhere.  so when you see these people literally mocking and scoffing us um and saying that he's not coming be encouraged when you see these people because it's literally fulfilling Bible prophecy right before our very eyes.  so I want to give you guys just a couple scriptures to encourage you.  the Lord is still coming guys we are still.  we are in a high watch time right now just for the simple fact that we know we're in the season because he tells us all the things to look out for so that it wouldn't take us by surprise.  Revelation 22, 7 says, 1.  Thessalonians 4, verse 16 says, Then we, which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  And so shall we ever be with the Lord.  John 14 verse 3 says, And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me.  that you also may be where i am.  you know the way to the place where i am going.  james five seven.  be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord.  behold.  the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain.  So guys, just be patient with the Lord and know that his timing is perfect.  We are still in a very high watch time right now.  We've never seen the world how it is.  And this is just still a really, just a hot zone.  So I want to share something with you guys that is just absolutely crazy to me.  even i get discouraged sometimes and um yesterday i was just praying to the lord and i'm like lord you know.  can you just give me some kind of confirmation like let me know because even though he says that we'll know this the season and the times and i feel like we're in it right now and you guys do too.  we feel that urgency.  um we see it happening around us and when he's you know he says that when you see all these things look up for your redemption draws an eye And, um, just everything that people are receiving prophetically.  And so we know, but I still am just that type of person.  And I know that you guys can relate to this.  I'm just that type of person where I just, I need more confirmation from him and I just want to be reassured all the time.  That's just how I am.  and so i was talking to the lord yesterday.  i'm like lord.  can i just like have my own confirmation again?  like can you just show me something you know just being whiny because we're all so tired and we want to go home and we want to.  we want to be in this place that we've never even seen before.  and you know we're just yearning and we're longing for the lord.  and so i'm just talking.  i'm like please please just give me something.  so guys listen to this y'all crack up okay?  The other day, my second to last video that I made, I was in my office and I was talking in my video about everything prophetic and everything that I think is happening and how... I literally was... I think I was talking about... how they're planning or they have like uh the satellites.  uh the satellites are weaponized china and russia anyways and i started going into other things.  well i had no clue that when i was making that video that that song you dropped a bomb.  you dropped a bomb on me baby.  i had no idea that that was even playing or blasting up in uh in our office.  i had no idea.  i was tuning it out.  i was speaking to you guys so I had no idea that that was playing.  the same time.  I was talking about all these things, right?  And I didn't even realize it until I started reading all y'all's comments.  I'm like, dang, that's crazy.  Like, okay, you know.  wonder if that's something.  So I've been talking to the Lord, right?  Okay.  Y'all gonna trip out.  All right.  So I was out doing some things outside for work and I was standing out there by the road.  Okay.  I was like out there on the sidewalk part and like literally like a step down and I would have been out on like the main road.  It's not like quite a highway, but it's like a three lane or it's So I'm standing out there, right?  I kid y'all not.  This car, or this, it's like an SUV, comes, is coming down the road.  And I'm not, when I say this, guys, like, this car was blaring.  blaring the radio and i mean he must have had his vehicle customized for this type of thing because you can turn your car up all the way and it ain't going to blare like this man was blaring his music.  okay this was like i don't know like a vehicle.  you see i don't know.  it reminded me of like people that participate in like parades where they have speakers on the outside of their car and they're blaring.  i talking about it was this loud he must have had some kind of speakers in the back i don't know.  y'all okay but he came he was coming down the road and he was the only one coming down the road.  and i'm standing there and i'm watching and i hear this song coming from down the road because how you could hear it from my way and he's coming and as soon as he passed it comes right up by me.  he must have been going 45 miles an hour because it's not like a main highway and this song is playing and as soon as it passes by me he's saying it or the song's playing that part of the song.  you dropped a bomb on me baby you drop and i hurt.  and as he passed it i could still hear it and i'm like oh my gosh.  but this is a crazy part too.  As soon as he passed by, I like, it quickened me in my spirit.  Like I knew the Lord was telling me something right there because it's just so funny how the Lord will communicate with us and he'll use all kinds of different ways.  because I've been praying to him and I'm just like asking him.  But at the same time, I'm not the type of person who's like looking, like looking for license plates numbers or looking for like, as I pass by, oh, I just need to, you know, I'm not that type of person.  And it completely caught me off guard.  but when he passed by and that same thing was playing after praying when i was praying to the lord i realized right then that the lord is speaking.  he was speaking to me and he's telling me that the things that i've been seeing prophetically in my dream what other people are seeing too is really coming.  and i know it sounds silly to say that oh you just heard.  no like it could have been anybody just going down the road having their and i just maybe hearing it a little bit.  no this guy was coming down the road meaning business and this was blaring.  what i saw in my dream that i received?  i saw a huge thick gray smoke cloud coming up off the ground in the distance in like an eerie setting.  okay and as soon as i saw that plumbing up into the air i saw all this military personnel.  and as soon as i saw that i had that understanding that something had just went down.  but then i heard the trumpet blow and we were raptured up.  and the main message that i think the lord was trying to show me in that dream is that as soon as things go down we go right up.  so i'm i'm.  i really truly believe that we're gonna see something.  something is coming And he is trying to tell the church.  So I want to give you guys this because the Lord is still speaking and trying to show us the times that we are in.  And I really believe like what he was speaking to.  And I know it sounds silly, but I felt it in my spirit that the Lord was saying something is coming, some kind of attack, some kind of I don't know, nuclear attack.  I don't know.  P I have no idea.  but i'm telling you we're right there on the cup and the lord is literally just trying to show us like something's coming.  and so i want you guys to be encouraged because you guys know on this channel i believe in a pre-tribulation rapture.  nothing will ever move me on that but it doesn't mean we won't see something.  um we're not to fear.  Do I believe that some big, huge tsunami wave is going to come and wipe all of us out?  Or do I think that some big nuclear attack is going to happen on all of America and millions of people are going to die before the rapture of the church?  No, because if that were the case, that would just completely put us in fear no matter how much.  i told you guys not to fear like that would still put you in fear but i think we're gonna see something.  i just don't know what it is but i'm telling you from what that you can't take that as a coincidence.  you just you the way it happened.  it just was no coincidence at all.  i just think that the lord is showing us that we are in some very very serious times.  um we're in some exciting times.  it's exciting for us but it's not exciting for people who are not believers because what is coming upon this earth they're gonna be here for that when we go.  and so um just confirms like to me what the Lord has been showing me.  I think we're gonna see something I think it's gonna literally bud.  I mean right up to the rapture.  literally when things go down we're gonna go up.  so there is absolutely no reason to fear.  our trust is in the Lord.  he loves us he's got us we're in the palm of his hand and the Bible tells us and he tells us that we are not to fear.  there's no reason why we should fear.  Guys, I really just truly think that the Lord is being, he's so merciful.  If you like can even grasp just a little bit of his love and just, you know, your father, he's so merciful.  And the Bible literally tells us he doesn't want to see anyone perish.  And I could literally see him.  um waiting up until that very last moment to rapture his church.  um just because he loves he literally came and died for god so loved the world that he gave his only son.  um so that who?  uh so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.  i may have just put two different scriptures together but um Literally, he came to die for the whole world.  And whoever believes in him won't perish, but will have everlasting life.  And he loves everyone.  And he's just waiting for that last person to come to him.  So I could see him being super merciful and waiting up to that very last moment.  And if we are interpreting the fig tree parable correctly, we are that generation.  And I could definitely see him waiting up until the very end of 2021.  You know, I still think that that will still be in the time frame that we'll see the next Pentecost, I believe.  I've always thought that Pentecost... is a very uh.  it paints a perfect picture to me of when the lord would return because that's when the church was born and i it just makes sense to me that he would take the church out on pentecost.  but we just don't know it could be at any random time.  i don't know.  we just know we're in the season and y'all just need to keep looking up every day.  um but i really think that um the lord is just.  i know he just spoke to me and so that something is coming.  i don't know if it's some kind of um some kind of war i don't know.  i just know that we know what's going on with russia and china iran things are heating up with them.  guys we're right there okay so be encouraged.  all right i love you all.  i'm gonna go ahead and end this.  um i will talk to you soon see ya.
