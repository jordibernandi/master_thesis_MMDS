This is a peer-reviewed study in a medical journal that says they studied 10 different countries, and what they found is that the mandatory lockdowns did no better than voluntary suggestions.  So I've been saying this for a long time.  I don't think we've changed the trajectory of the virus at all.  with any of the things we're told to do, and they're never going to let up on this.  But what I tell people is use common sense.  If you've had the disease or you've been vaccinated and you're several weeks out from your second dose, throw your mask away and tell Dr.  Fauci to take a leap.  Because once you have immunity, you don't need to do this.  They will never let up.  There are doctors out there saying, well, we need to wear them after the vaccine and really we may need to wear them forever.  That is ridiculous and that defies the science.  So when you've had it and you have immunity or you've had a vaccine and you've had your second dose and you've got immunity, I say throw your mask away and tell these so-called experts who say lockdowns work, tell them to take a flying leap because there's no scientific evidence that the lockdowns have done anything to change the trajectory of this virus.

And now we're going to become a militarized zone.  And they're checking congressmen as they come in to see if they have a sharp pencil or a sharp pen.  So it's gotten ridiculous.  And so we'll see what happens and whether it's permanent.  Most people who write about civil liberties say that in times of war or in times of stress or in times of crisis, you lose your civil liberties very quickly, but it's very difficult to get them back because government, once it grows large, never wants to give up on this.  But yes, we have to resist this and we have to have security, obviously.  But I think living in a wartime state with, you know, we're now, we have troops in the Capitol, you know, they're staying in the Capitol.  They're platooning and camping in the Capitol.  So, you know, I understand.  Yeah, I understand, you know, the last week we weren't prepared and that was a real problem.  And I regret everything that happened last week with that.  But going forward this week, I think there's a danger of overreacting.  And, you know, they say they are going to have this sort of virtual inauguration.  So I've informed them I'm sending my hologram.  My hologram is going to be there.  If that hologram doesn't have a spot, I may send a cardboard cutout.  But it's going to be virtual.  I think I can go virtual, you know, so. ",

I think one of the questions with their crazy impeachment stuff that they're talking about is, are they going to strip President Trump of his security?  I mean, can you imagine being an ex-president and being stripped of your security?  So these people are bitter in the rancor and the bad taste they leave in the mouth.  I just don't understand how they can be moving forward with this.  And look, I'm not just saying I'm for everything President Trump has done.  I was for seating the electors because I think Congress shouldn't overturn the state electors.  But at the same time, the thing they're doing now is an overreaction.  And if they think they're going to have a positive feeling from the public when they're going to go through a partisan impeachment again, I think that's absolutely insane and wrong-headed. ",

They will destroy the Republican Party if leadership is complicit with an impeachment, or if leadership votes for an impeachment, they will destroy the party.  And like I say, I have opposed President Trump when I thought he was wrong.  I've been for him when he was right.  We did a lot of good things throughout the Trump presidency.  And impeachment is purely a partisan thing.  It's for these moral, oh, I'm so much better than you and you're a bad person because I'm so moral.  These are the kind of people that are going to do this.  Look, I didn't agree with the fight that happened last week.  I voted against overturning the election.  But at the same time, the impeachment is a wrongheaded partisan notion.  But if Republicans go along with it, it'll destroy the party.  A third of the Republicans will leave the party.  I mean, this isn't about whether it was a right or wrong debate.  Yeah.  This isn't about any more about the Electoral College.
