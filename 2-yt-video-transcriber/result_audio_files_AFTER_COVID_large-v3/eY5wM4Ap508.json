            "text": "We often hear Marxists use the term contradiction to describe the nature of some sort of phenomenon.  As with many terms used by Marx and his successors, the way contradiction is used is not always consistent or clear.  In some cases, contradiction is used in the most colloquial sense, that is, to indicate that on a logical level, there is some kind of inconsistency.  but in other cases we get these weird terms like internal contradiction or principal contradiction.  after reading some marx and perhaps some other thinkers after him we come to wonder what are the contradictions of capitalism?  This video will try to answer precisely this question, though perhaps not exhaustively, as we will find out there isn't a magical number of contradictions, no Ten Commandments, so to speak.  Let's first attempt to determine what we mean when we use the term contradiction.  For David Harvey, a contradiction is when two seemingly opposed forces are simultaneously present within a particular situation, an entity, a process, or an event.  contradictions are interconnected across various planes and spheres.  some contradictions for example are shaped and defined by larger contradictions.  other contradictions of similar size the term is used purely for visual effect are connected to each other through common mechanisms elements or origins.  for example certain contradictions stretch far beyond the era of capitalism as is the case with race and gender.  nevertheless those contradictions have come to shape and be shaped by capitalism in unique ways.  the process of capital accumulation was greatly dependent on the use of slave labor as well as free domestic labor provided by the subjugated gender.  In an even greater plane, one that stretches across most of known history, we have the contradiction between the forces of production and the relations of production.  In other words, the tension between how humans organize themselves for production on a societal level and how, on a technical level, production actually occurs.  These contradictions undoubtedly shape the contradictions that are peculiar to capitalism.  but equally so capitalism's contradictions act upon the larger one in a way that substantially alters them.  mouse suggests that there is one core contradiction which he calls the principal contradiction.  in the case of capitalism it is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.  all other contradictions are determined and influenced by the principal contradiction.  the core contradictions are not immutable and often change based on shifting circumstances.  but mao believes that at any given time there is only one such major paradigm the aspects within a contradiction do not exist on equal footing.  Rather, there is normally one aspect that is dominant, and another that is not.  More importantly, the gravity of each aspect and their relation to each other is in constant flux.  Thus, the principal aspect in the contradiction is the one that informs the contradiction for the most part.  When aspects change, such as when the principal aspect changes, the nature of the thing changes as well.  Mao argues that even contradictions that seem permanent, i.e.  productive forces versus relations of production, theory versus practice, base versus superstructure, can change.  There can be a temptation to view the concept of a contradiction as a reductive exercise in abstraction.  Can studying contradictions be a limitation to building an adequate understanding of how the world works?  Here it might be important to recall Althusser's overdetermination, in which the structure of the system is composed of countless overlapping and interconnected pieces, where each phenomenon or development is determined not by one contradiction or mechanism, but by a multitude of different contradictions and mechanisms.  When we choose to talk about the contradiction between the use value and exchange value, for instance, we are doing so for analytical purposes.  Firstly, we acknowledge that both use and exchange value are elements in the same piece, the commodity.  We hope to understand the commodity by assessing these two aspects which sometimes function at odds with one another, but also determine each other's continued existence.  Beyond that, we understand that the commodity simply cannot be understood as use value and exchange value.  It defines, and is defined by, larger contradictions and processes.  For example, the conflict between use and exchange value contributes to alienation and reification in capitalism, whereby social relations come to be dictated by exchange value.  To fortify our understanding of contradictions, let's consider some of the most pertinent examples.  Perhaps the most important example is the contradiction between use value and exchange value.  Every commodity contains at the same time a use value and an exchange value.  Use value is Marx's term for the actual function a commodity has for a given person.  The use value of a pencil is its function as a writing utensil.  As we can imagine, use values vary greatly from commodity to commodity.  Exchange value is reflected in the buying and selling price of a commodity, though we should note that price and exchange value are not synonymous.  when we say that x number of pencils equals y number of cars we are referring to exchange value.  the exchange value of a commodity in marxist economics is determined by the labor time it took to produce it.  for the sake of brevity we won't go into a discussion of the labor theory of value.  we also do not have time to talk about the so-called transformation problem which looks at how the value of a commodity comes to be represented by a price on the actual market.  A good way to think of the difference between use value and exchange value is that use value varies qualitatively, while exchange value varies quantitatively.  The function of a pencil differs from a car's qualitatively, while the values they exchange at differ only in quantity.  For example, 10,000 pencils to one car.  already we can see how these two aspects encounter each other as both connected and opposed to one another.  the tension between use and exchange value comes to the forefront with production and consumption.  customers are interested in the use value of commodities whereas producers are interested in the exchange value.  commodities are therefore produced not for use but for exchange.  the primary concern of the capitalist is to sell the commodity.  it is in the act of exchange that a capitalist can realize profits.  of course capitalists have to pay attention to what consumers seek in their use values in order to capture as much of the market as possible.  but even this consideration is informed by emphasis on exchange value.  the obvious consequence of this contradiction is a distribution of goods and services based on exchange which naturally cannot match need.  this is why the world produces more than enough food to feed everyone on the planet but roughly a billion people do not have access to enough food.  we can also trace the domination of exchange value in other areas that have recently become more and more commodified.  education for example now rests on the plane of the use value versus exchange value contradiction.  schools sell education as a packaged commodity resulting in the treatment of students and their families as consumers.  the corporatization of the internal structures of educational institutions has had a profound effect on the way schools are run and what kind of priorities they hold over others.  many schools push a specific and carefully cultivated brand in precisely the same way as clothing lines and food companies.  Another good example of a contradiction within capitalism is the contradiction between private property and the capitalist state.  Here's what Harvey has to say on this contradiction.  The centralized power of the state is used to protect a decentralized private property system.  The centralized power of the state is used to protect a decentralized private property system.  However, the extension of the status of personhood and juridical individual to powerful corporations and institutions obviously corrupts the bourgeois utopian dream of a perfected world of individual personal liberty for all on the basis of democratically dispersed ownership.  Private property, which we define as land, resources, technology,  etc.,  that is owned exclusively as opposed to publicly, and the capitalist state make up another important contradiction.  On the one hand, the supposedly decentralized private property system benefits from limited state interference in the market.  On the other hand, the very institution of private property appears to be unable to exist without the capitalist state.  after all what authoritative body reinforces the right to private property if not the state?  if the state was not around to prop up this right people would ceaselessly take advantage of land that has been marked as privately owned or in the modern example private assets like intellectual property.  moreover the very genesis of private property could not have been possible without the state.  The indigenous populations of North America, for example, had to be forcibly removed so that the land and resources that they considered to belong to no one could be claimed exclusively by private groups and persons.  The contradiction between the capitalist state and private property becomes openly antagonistic when the state is controlled, even partially, by parties who seek to regulate and limit the private sector.  Marx outlined another contradiction in the capitalist mode of production.  the workers are important for the market as buyers of commodities.  But as sellers of their commodity, labor power, capitalist society has a tendency to restrict them of their minimum price.  Further contradiction, the periods in which capitalist production exerts all its forces regularly show themselves to be periods of overproduction, because the limit to the application of productive powers is not simply the production of value, but also its realization.  however the sale of commodities the realization of consumer needs of society in general and thus surplus value as well is restricted not by the consumer needs of society in general but by consumer needs of a society in which the great majority are always poor and must always remain poor.  to put it another way while capitalists attempt to pay workers the smallest possible sum for their labor power they also rely on the workers to buy the commodities that are being produced.  The contradiction here is apparent.  Capitalism requires maximal consumption while compensating laborers minimally for their labor power.  In the end, these polar forces result in the eruption of crises unique to capitalism, in which goods that are produced cannot be turned into profit because consumers simply do not have the buying power.  capital has attempted to circumvent this tension by means of credit but boosting consumption with money that the consumer does not yet have produces its own problems as we saw in the recession of two thousand eight.  returning to the heart of the notion of contradictions We can contextualize our examples by realizing that the amount of contradictions in capitalism isn't definite.  If a contradiction is when two seemingly opposed forces are simultaneously present within a particular situation, an entity, a process, or an event, the number of instances of a contradiction are not limited by the structure that they are part of.  In fact, as we talked about earlier, contradictions overlap across space and time.  smaller contradictions are defined by and help define larger ones.  ultimately a contradiction is a specific territory within the totality of the system that we have chosen to abstract and understand.
