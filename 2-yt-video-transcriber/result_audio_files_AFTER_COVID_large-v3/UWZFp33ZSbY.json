Like, listen to just the sound of him going, just brown nosing this entire time.  It's so bad.  And everything he says is also stupid and full of shit.  But, okay, let's just go.  Ezra writes... This is the paradox of Hillary Clinton.  She has achieved something no one else in the history of the American politics has ever come close to doing, yet is widely considered an inept, flawed candidate.  These two things are not unrelated.  Twice now, we have thought it should be easy for Clinton to do what no one has ever done before.  Twice now, we have dismissed her as a weak candidate and a flawed leader for struggling to break a barrier no one else has ever come near to breaking.  America has hosted 56 presidential elections, 33 of them before women received the right of vote.  Exactly zero of those elections featured a female nominee from one of the two major American political parties until Hillary Clinton.  OK, so he's setting it up once again.  like that Hillary was as an underdog all over again.  And again, in 2008, just like now, Hillary Clinton was absolutely the favorite both times.  Okay, so Ezra continues.  There is something about Clinton that makes it hard to appreciate the magnitude of her achievement.  Or perhaps there is something about us that makes it hard to appreciate the magnitude of her achievement. ",

            "text": "Whether you like Hillary Clinton or hate her, and plenty of Americans hate her, it's time to admit that the reason Clinton was the one to break it is because Clinton is actually really good at politics.  She's just good at politics in a way we haven't learned to appreciate.  This is now.  the second part of the essay is called how presidential campaigns favor male traits.  And what is so good about this article is that like Ezra is so hyped.  He's so hyped up to explain to just appreciate the magnitude of a woman breaking the highest glass ceiling of all that he tries to and why we still can't appreciate it.  And like he tries to square that circle.  and like, you know, be just demonstrate for everyone, his feminist woke bona fides.  But what he actually does is, um, say a lot of shit that's actually really sexist.  Like he sort of, we'll get into that.  But, uh, Hillary Clinton has her flaws, of course, the email searcher server, the speeches to Goldman Sachs, and just look at her unfavorable numbers.  Uh, I'll notice, say, that in her flaws, Ezra doesn't mention her disastrous foreign policy.  He doesn't mention Libya or Iraq or Syria or Honduras or Haiti or any of that.  It's just the email server and Goldman Sachs.  Um... But what really defines coverage of Clinton is the confusion over how she's gotten so far without the animal charisma typical of politicians at her level.  Clinton employed a less masculine strategy to win.  She won the Democratic Party by spending years slowly and assiduously building relationships with the entire Democratic Party.  She relied on a more traditionally female approach to leadership, creating coalitions, finding common ground, and winning over allies.  Today, 208 members of Congress have endorsed Clinton, and only eight have endorsed Sanders.  This work is a grind.  It's not big speeches, it doesn't come with wide applause, but it requires an emotional toughness that most human beings can't summon.  Okay, this is what's so stupid and actually offensive about what Ezra's writing is this whole idea about male and female qualities in politics or what are, you know, a female strategy for, you know, winning at politics.  And what he describes is just actual politics.  There's nothing female about that.  If anything, what he's describing is the old machine style of politics.  Again, shout out to our good friend, Amber Lee Frost, who responded to this.  I think the best take on this is that the actually traditional female way of doing politics that Hillary Clinton did was marrying a president or leader.  Everything else Ezra describes in this article is just ascribing things like being nurturing or being a good listener as natural to women and embodying like.  this is Hillary Clinton's strategy for doing politics and not just the fact that, as you said, she's representing the interests of like the most powerful constituencies in the Democratic Party.

There are absolutely people who have a personal hatred of her, but I think a lot of what you saw in the actual election that has taken place so far is a large number of people who reject her policy choices throughout her career.  But because admitting that would allow that there are millions of people who are ameliorable to sort of a social democratic coalition...
