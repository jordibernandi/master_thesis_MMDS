            "text": "Hello, this is my first, frankly, in five from the last 22 days.  And I want to thank you for being with me.  I just wanted to share with you a couple of thank yous.  Not a couple, a lot of thank yous to everybody out there who has been praying for me.  I had a stroke.  I'm dealing with a lot of the different subjects that we deal with.  If you remember correctly, About a month ago, we were talking about the surface, the hidden, and the enhanced level.  Well, I think I touched all three in the past 21 days.  And I'm just glad that you're with me.  I want to thank you for all the prayers, all the comments.  Thank you for all the support from the Patreon to the to the YouTube donations.  And I just overwhelmed by the amount of people worldwide that have contacted my wife while I was in a coma.  And I just want to say thank you.  And so my first video back is a thank you video to each one of you out there watching.  And it's my intention to do the next few, frankly, in fives as I'm catching up and my health and my breath.  I don't have my voice back yet, and I don't have my what's about me yet.  I still can't see a lot on this side, so if you're sitting on this side, Oh, the video, I can't see you.  You've got to move over here.  So, that's a joke.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you.  I do have a couple things I want to share with you before I go.  I'm going to definitely keep this under five minutes.  Some things have happened to me at home while I was in the hospital, while I was in a coma.  My sheep, if you remember my sheep, Well, the third day I was in, my sheep died.  And my wife and family didn't want to tell me until I got home.  And I'm glad they waited.  But it's amazing how things happen.  No one expects death to come upon you so quickly.  And one thing I can share with you is that while I was in a coma and while I was dealing with what I was dealing with, I wasn't afraid.  I wasn't, if anything, I wanted to move forward to the other side.  And in the coma, you dream a lot and you dream weird dreams.  And so I didn't want to bore you with all those details, but just to say in those dreams, I wanted to go home where I wasn't going to be fooled, where I wasn't going to be distracted by the things that i see on this side.  and so i wasn't afraid.  i was ready to go and so but the lord said no not yet he says uh i'm going to take you to the edge so you can see that there's that enhanced level.  and when you go back and talk to all your YouTube friends.  You can let them know that it's real.  And so I just want to let everybody know that Jesus himself said that he is the resurrection and the life.  And no man comes to the Father but through him.  And it's the truth.  I was taken to a point where obviously I still dreamt.  But in those dreams, by being alive, I wasn't afraid at all.  And so I just want you to know that you don't have to be afraid either.  And so I'm back.  And my hope is that I'll have a lot more of these coming out soon.  I want to thank you again for all your support.  I want to thank you for reaching out to my family.  People who I have no clue who they are from all over the world.  Sweden, Australia, Scotland, England.  all over the place, the United States.  Amazing.  And so I just, you really helped my family while I was in a coma.  You really helped them get through this.  And you broke my wife out of her anti-video.  And so she, I was so happy that she updated everybody of what was going on.  Today is my First day out on a walk.  And so I'm picking the Ashokan Reservoir to do my first Frankly at Five video in front of everybody.  It's a great place to be up in upstate New York.  The water that you see here is what feeds New York City.  They're drinking water.  And it's just absolutely gorgeous.  So with that being said, I want to say thank you.  I'm looking forward to doing more future videos.  And don't be fooled.  21 days and still Tom Hanks, and he's still not around.  Him and a lot of other people.  You hopefully have been watching while I've been sleeping.  And we'll get into that a little later when I gain more strength.  But in that enhanced level, we're battling a real spiritual war.  And your prayers before God, before Christ, the true light, He heard them, and I'm still here.  So with that being said, have a great day.  God bless. ",
