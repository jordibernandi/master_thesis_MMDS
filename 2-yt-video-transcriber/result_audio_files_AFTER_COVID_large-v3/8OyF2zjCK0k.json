The Biden campaign was concerned that Kamala was gonna catch cooties from Mike Pence.  And they wouldn't do the debate unless the candidates were separated by these two gigantic plexiglass shields.  Which medical experts who are not on the liberal media industrial complex payroll said were entirely symbolic and a joke.  And as expected, the debate began with a question about the coronavirus, which Kamala Harris blamed entirely on President Trump and Vice President Pence.  And after she got done explaining what her and Joe Biden would do if, God forbid, they win, Mike Pence countered with this. ",

The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot, like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way.  And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine... It looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about.  And I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first, and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made.
