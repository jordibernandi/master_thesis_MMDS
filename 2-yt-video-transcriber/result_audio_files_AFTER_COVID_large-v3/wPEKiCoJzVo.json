            "text": "Hey, what's going on, guys?  James Madison Autz here.  We're in Kingsland, Georgia, and I noticed that they have a lot of police officers here.  Looks like Kingsland, St.  Mary's, a bunch of different ones, and they're all here, probably doing some training, it looks like.  Glen County, St.  Mary's, civilian car, a couple trucks over there, Sheriff, Camden County, And look at the tint on that car.  So pretty wild.  They do a lot of training here, apparently, it seems like, but one of those locations that you don't know.  And in the back here, there's a Tesla supercharging station in the back back there.  And you got a payment center drive-through.  Not sure what that's for, but maybe there's a bank here or something along those lines.  Two of the guys here, Camden County.  And that.  That's pretty wild.  So we're going to go inside.  I think it's a welcome center as well.  But training?  I don't know.  It's like a weird area.  There it is.  Kingsland Welcome Center.  This is Kingsland, Georgia.  Slippery when wet.  Of course, I didn't know that.  There it is.  Oh, I love dioramas and train sets.  That's pretty sweet.  I was just taking a look around.  Appreciate it.  There it is.  Look at that.  The train set going.  I want to put one of the Teslas.  I have some Teslas in there.  I should drop one in.  It's not the right scale though.  Couple different things here.  Rat snake shed.  And a couple different things for purchase.  Yeah, look at these.  They're so cool.  Especially when you get down here, like at this level.  So pretty awesome.  There we are.  Got some alligator skulls.  Got the coronavirus.  Keep your hands clean, people.  Yeah, it's like you can buy some stuff here.  Different honeys.  12 ounces, $10 plus tax.  Mayhall jellies.  Couple different laser engraved stuff.  Got the Air Force.  Awesome there.  But yeah, a fun little place to come into here.  No problem recording, and I don't know where all the police officers are, but they're probably upstairs.  We're gonna take a look.  All right, after a fun little tour inside there at the Welcome Center, looks to be like a pass.  We're gonna still walk around here.  Super awesome place.  Little train diorama in there and all that.  These guys are still in their cars and hanging out, so we'll see if we can see anything else.  He's got a dog in there.  That's what I hear barking.  Canine.  City of Kingsland.  Payment drop box services only.  Oh, I see.  So this is where you can come in and drop stuff.  Cash or money order.  That makes sense.  Okay.  And I'm wondering why this police officer decides he wants to park there.  That's the problem, we can't do that.  Pretty rude.  Hey, good afternoon.  Hey, how's it going?  I was going to see if you guys could have one of the police cars moved out of the charging stations.  It's just a Crown Vic, an older one.  I didn't check it out.  I think it's white and it's got orange and gold on it possibly.  It's hard.  It's hard to actually get.  You don't know what color it is?  I do not.  It looks your fault.  There's like 10 different cars out there.  Oh.  That's cagling.  I did get it right, orange and gold.  You got it.  He's coming.  2091, where's he at?  He's coming.  Basically, what we've got is, this is called icing.  In the Tesla world, this is called icing.  When an ICE vehicle, an internal combustion engine vehicle, parks in a Tesla charging spot, they block it.  We're going to get them to move it and get it out of here so that other people can charge.  And this is a very popular one.  So you got vehicle 2091 that doesn't know how to see the signs.  This is electric vehicle only.  And it's very hard.  I don't know if there's other parking.  There might be, but it looks like the last one.  It's one of the Kingsland police officers here.  What's your name, sir?  Sage Fallis.  All right, so cool.  Yeah, he's going to move it.  It's going to take care of it.  Get it out of here so everybody can get charged up and see how that goes.  So he's got it moved there.  That's pretty good.  So now we've got a spot open.  They've got theirs towing and we're going to head out of here.  So there we are.  Some training and education.  It is very hard with the Tesla owners here when these are blocked.  It sucks.  It really does.  Anyway, guys, thanks for watching.  Like and subscribe and hit that bell button.  I'll see you guys again soon, and we will see you then. ",
