            "text": "This is the most requested video I've had in the past three days.  Let's look at the case of Kyle Rittenhouse.  Self-defense or murder?  My name is Nate the Lawyer and welcome to my YouTube spot.  Now I'm a former prosecutor, former law enforcement officer, and I taught at a law school for the past two years.  Now if it's your first time here, hit that subscribe button and help me get to YouTube dominance.  Now today we talk about Kyle Rittenhouse.  Now he's a young man that shot three people at the Black Lives Matter protests in Wisconsin.  Now the internet is pretty divided on this one.  Half the people I talk to say it was self-defense, the other half say it was murder.  Now since we actually know that Kyle shot three people and killed two people because of the video.  Today, we're going to look at Kyle Rittenhouse's claim of self-defense.  Now, I'm going to show you the law, we're going to look at the facts, and I'm going to leave it to you decide whether Kyle has a viable claim of self-defense.  Now, because you're going to have the nuts out there, nothing in this video constitutes legal advice.  Let's just make that 100% clear.  I don't practice in Wisconsin.  This is not legal advice.  First, we look at the law.  What is self-defense in Wisconsin?  How is it judged?  How is it applied to certain situations?  Since you're the jury, I pulled the Wisconsin model jury instruction.  Now we're going to use these jury instructions to determine if Kyle has a viable claim of self-defense under Wisconsin law.  So for those of you who don't know what jury instructions are, what are jury instructions?  Well, they are instructions that are only guidance given to the jury to help them deliberate.  It's meant to keep the jury on track and help explain the law to them so they can understand what they're deciding.  Now, one of the biggest questions you'll get is that, hey, why do we need jury instructions, right?  Why not just give the law to the jury and then have them decide what the outcome is going to be?  So in Wisconsin, let's look at the law for self-defense.  Section 938.1 for self-defense and defense of others.  A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force against another for the purpose of preventing or terminating what the person reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference with his or her person by such other person.  The actor may intentionally use only such force or threat thereof as the actor reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference.  The actor may not intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself.  So just imagine giving that to a juror, right?  You'd be like, what the hell does all that mean?  You know, what do I have to do?  So that's what jury instructions do, as you're going to see in a second.  Jury instructions breaks that down.  So the jury knows exactly what they have to decide in a nice, easy to understand format.  now this jury instruction deals with self-defense force intended likely to cause death or great bodily injury.  and as you can see the section here is 939.48 the section that we just read and the statute.  so here is a step-by-step guide that's going to be read and given to the jury to help them understand what they have to decide.  so since you're the jurors let's go through that process.  So first things first, let's go to the burden of proof.  Who has the burden of proving what?  Model jury instruction says the state must prove by evidence, which satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not act lawfully in self-defense.  So this means clearly the defendant doesn't have to prove that they acted with self-defense.  It is on the prosecution to prove the defendant did not act lawfully in self-defense.  So Kyle doesn't have to prove anything.  It's the prosecutors that have to prove that Kyle wasn't able to employ self-defense legally.  Now, Wisconsin law allows the defendant to threaten or intentionally use force only if these three conditions are met.  First, that the defendant believed that there was an actual or imminent unlawful interference with the defendant's person.  and the defendant believed that the amount of force the defendant used or threatened to use was necessary to prevent or terminate the interference.  and lastly the defendant's belief were reasonable.  now the defendant may intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm Only if the defendant reasonably believed that the force used was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself.  So this lets us know.  you have to check three boxes.  if you're going to employ deadly physical force in this particular situation.  one you have to have this harm and that harm has to be reasonable.  two you have to use proportional force.  it can't be too much.  you cannot be excessive in the force that you employ.  and three your beliefs on the level of threat and your beliefs about the force used have to be reasonable.  now i've been saying the word reasonable a whole bunch of times But how do you determine if someone is being reasonable?  Well, the jury instructions tell us.  Determining whether beliefs were reasonable.  A belief may be reasonable even though mistaken.  In determining whether the defendant's beliefs were reasonable, the standard is what a person of ordinary intelligence and prudent would have believed in the defendant's position under the circumstances that existed at the time of the alleged defense.  Now, the reasonableness of the defendant's beliefs must be determined from the standpoint of the defendant at the time of the defendant's acts and not from the viewpoint of the jury now.  So this more or less tells the jury, you're looking at what would a regular person do in this position, right?  Ordinary intelligence, prudent.  That person that fake person, that reasonable person, we're going to put that person in the same position that the defendant was in and see if that person would act in the same way without the benefit of hindsight.  But what a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have thought at that time.  And the last thing we have to talk about is retreat.  Because whether the defendant retreated or not will also help us determine how reasonable the force that they were employing was used or how reasonable the threat was.  Because if you can retreat, then that kind of changes the dynamics.  Now for retreat, there is no duty to retreat in Wisconsin.  However, in determining whether defendant reasonably believed that the amount of force used was necessary to prevent or terminate the interference, you may consider whether defendant had the opportunity to retreat with safety whether such retreat was feasible, and whether the defendant knew of the opportunity to retreat.  If you're able to de-escalate the situation by retreating or by leaving, then you should do so.  And if you don't, and someone gets injured or someone gets hurt, then the jury can use that to see whether you are acting reasonable in not retreating.  Now we have a better understanding of the law.  the elements of self-defense what it means to be a reasonable person and what are the limits to that self-defense rule.  now let's look at the facts and see if we can apply what we know from the jury instructions to the actual events.  and again just to make this very clear this is not legal advice right.  this is not legal advice.  don't take it as such.  All right, so let's hit up the videotape.  But before we do that, let me introduce you to Kyle Rittenhouse.  This is the defendant, 17, from a neighboring state.  And this unidentified person we don't have a picture of is Richard McGinnis.  Now this is a key eyewitness and reporter to the events.  Now here is a video of Richard McGinnis actually interviewing Kyle Rittenhouse before the event started.  Check this out.  We're going in. ",

Now who you see in your screen now is Joseph Rosenbaum, the alleged victim who was shot and killed on this particular night.  Now I think it's extremely important to note how this victim and the defendant interacted together before the actual event, before the shooting.  So let's look at a clip of an interaction between Joseph Rosenbaum and Kyle Rittenhouse maybe 30 or 40 minutes before the actual shooting.  Fuck that!  Fuck that!  You here for me?  No, you ain't.  They want us to break down.  Now you as a jury have to look at that interaction and then determine what's reasonable for this interaction.  Who was the aggressor?  What was Kyle doing?  What was the victim doing at this time?  And these are the events that led up to the actual shooting.  Now, let's move to the next events on our timeline, the actual shooting events.  Now, every time we see forced use, we're going to ask whether the three elements of use of force in Wisconsin have been met and whether the person using the force is reasonable in their use of force.  Let's check it out. ",

            "text": "Two witnesses capture footage of a shooting about to unfold in this parking lot.  The first witness standing across the street captures a young man with a rifle running into the dealership parking lot.  He's being chased.  It's unclear what happened before this moment, but we do know that armed citizens were out in the streets guarding local shops.  A shirtless man throws what appears to be a plastic bag in the young man's direction.  A second witness captures the same man running after him.  The shirtless man falls.  The young man with the rifle has looped around the car to see that he is now lying on the ground.  It's unclear from this footage who fired the shots.  The young man takes out his phone and appears to make a phone call.  A man takes off his shirt to apply first aid.  In later footage, we see that the man on the ground has a visible head wound.  It's at this point that we can identify this individual, thanks to specific markers like the orange medical pack, green shirt, blue medical gloves, and a beige baseball cap.  NBC News has reviewed his social media profile, cross-referenced it with earlier videos of the same individual that day, and is confident that this is 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse.  He's seen running away from the scene.  The same young man with the rifle and the orange medical kit is seen moments later running north on Sheridan Road. ",

            "text": "So we've seen what happened.  Kyle was being chased, seems to have gotten cornered, and shot X amount of times, and killed Mr.  Rosenbach.  But our question here is, is there a viable claim for self-defense?  Let's look over the elements.  Since Kyle used the deadly physical force, remember state law in Wisconsin only allows you to use deadly physical force if deadly physical force is about to be used against you and it's imminent.  So let's go through the elements.  First, did we have an actual or imminent threat of deadly physical force from Mr.  Rosenbaum?  Second, was the force used by Kyle necessary to terminate the threat?  Was it excessive?  And third, were Kyle's beliefs reasonable?  Would a person of average intelligence have believed that either deadly physical force or serious bodily harm would have come to them from Mr.  Rosenbaum?  And the only way they could have avoided that was by using deadly physical force.  Again, that's your decision.  That's what the jury has to decide.  And let's not forget about retreat because Kyle was running from the victim.  So that should also go into your determination whether Kyle was being reasonable in both his belief of the threat and his use of force.  Let's continue with the videotape. ",

That is what the jury is going to have to decide.  And that's what I'm going to ask you to do in the comment section.  Let me know if you believe Kyle was justified each time.
