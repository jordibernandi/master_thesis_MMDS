            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  Today I'm going to be speaking to you about whose side are you on?  Because there's only two sides.  There's God's side, Yeshua, and there's the devil's side.  Whose side are you on?  And who is in charge of your life?  Let's turn our Bible to the book of Joshua, chapter 5, verse 13 to 15.  And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And Joshua went to him and said to him, Are you for us or for our adversaries?  So he said, No.  But a commander of the army of the Lord, I have now come.  And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshipped and said to him, What does my Lord say to his servant?  Then the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua, Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.  And Joshua did so.  There are two questions that need to be answered in order to help us understand who's in charge.  Number one, whose side are you on?  I want to give you a little background about this passage here.  Joshua has become the leader of the nation of Israel, which means he's also now the captain of the army.  and they're going into the promised land, and he's been given the task to take this land, but it's very important to realize that this land that he's going to take, it's a land of giants.  And this is the first city, it's Jericho.  So he goes out in the evening, and he looks at the city of Jericho from a hill, and he turns, and there is a man standing there with a sword in his hand.  So he asks the man a very relevant question, whose side are you on?  He's asking, are you for us or for our adversaries?  Now, I believe based on the scripture that the man with the sword is Yeshua, Jesus.  And when we read the passage, sometimes we miss the first thing that Jesus actually said to Joshua.  And I love the answer.  I'm going to read the answer again.  The end of verse 13.  And Joshua went to him and said to him, are you for us or for our adversaries?  So he said, no.  In Hebrew, lo.  No, neither one.  Here's what he was saying.  Joshua, you're asking the wrong question.  You're asking me whose side I'm on, but I want to ask you whose side are you on?  I'm not here to take sides.  I'm here to take over.  And if you want to win this battle, you better get on my side.  Because there's only two sides.  God's side, Yeshua, or the devil's side.  So whose side are you on, he asked Joshua.  I like this answer, no, because even if you're faced sometimes with two choices, the answer is no for both of them.  So that's what Jesus, Yeshua was saying, no, I'm not on your side, and I'm not on their side.  I'm here as the leader, and if you want to win, you better get on my side.  I remember one time here in Israel, I was doing some marriage counseling, and the two sides were getting into a deep conversation, an argument, and eventually the man turned to me and said, hey, wait a minute, whose side are you on?  And I said to the man, I'm on the Lord's side.  Whose side are you on?  And that is a very important question.  Because there are only two sides.  You know, they like to say there are two sides to every issue.  Well, there are.  God's side and the devil's side.  Those are the only two sides.  You could have two different perspectives.  Even if you have different perspectives, you better get on the same side, which is God's side.  So that's the very first thing here.  he's trying to settle with Joshua.  Whose side are you on?  It's amazing to see sometimes, even within the body, how many sides we have.  Now even if we don't exactly agree on the same issues, as long as it's not heresy, I don't break fellowship with people.  We can still disagree and have fellowship.  And many times I go to conferences and I'm asked a question about some speakers.  Do you agree on everything that they teach?  In essence, what are they asking me?  Whose side are you on?  I always answer, I'm on the Lord's side.  And it's time for us in the body of Yeshua to stop fighting and unite together and win souls for the kingdom.  Well, Joshua answers and said, I'm on your side.  What do you say to your servant?  And here's what Yeshua, Jesus said, is the first thing we're going to settle here is you need to take your shoes off.  Now, if you remember Yeshua, Jesus, through a burning bush, said this to Joshua's mentor, Moses Moshe.  As a matter of fact, it's the first time it's in the Bible.  He tells Moses, take off your sandals for you're standing on holy ground.  God shows up and Moses asks God, and I'm paraphrasing, what do you want to say to me?  And God tells him, the first thing we need to settle here is take off your sandals.  So the question is, what does that mean?  What is the spiritual meaning of taking off our shoes?  Because if we want to win the battle, If we want to be overcomers, if we want Yeshua to guide us in everything that we do, then we need to understand what it means to take our shoes off.  So remember the first question I asked you is whose side are you on?  Now here's another question.  Have you taken your shoes off?  Some of us have decided to be on the Lord's side.  but you haven't taken your shoes off.  And there's a spiritual meaning for this.  So we're going to, first of all, have a look at why did God tell Moses and Joshua to take their shoes off and what it represents.  And we're going to go through some scripture and see what it represented.  Because it has huge spiritual meanings in our walk in Yeshua the Messiah.  Let's turn our Bibles to the book of Ruth, chapter 4.  Let me give you the outline of the story and then we'll just read a few verses.  Naomi and her husband move to Moab.  They leave Israel and they move to Moab because there's a famine in Israel.  And when they moved, they sold their land to a relative.  So they did that and they had the money to move.  They go away and Naomi has two sons.  Her two sons marry two ladies and then her husband and her two sons die.  So then Naomi decides to come back to the land of Israel.  And Ruth, her new daughter-in-law, decides to go with her.  And then they come back, they have no money.  And Ruth begins to glean in the corners of the field.  So Ruth is gleaning in the fields of a very wealthy man named Boaz.  And Boaz takes notice of her.  And Ruth says to him, you can marry me, but you're not the nearest relative.  So there's someone before you that would have that right.  And then so Boaz calls all the elders of the city together.  And he says to the nearest relative, and he says, he asks him, do you want to marry Ruth?  The man says, yes.  And then he tells him, you need to know this.  If you want to marry her, you have to buy Naomi's land back.  That's what it's going to cost you to marry her.  And the guy's response was, I don't want to marry her.  So he says, I don't want to marry her.  You can marry her.  So here's where we pick up the story.  Let's turn to Ruth chapter 4, verse 7 and 8.  Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging to confirm anything.  Now it's very important when we read the Old Testament to understand the spiritual significance.  It's a true story that happened, but it all has spiritual significance.  This is why only with the power of the Holy Spirit can we understand the Scriptures.  In other words, redeeming, remember we were redeemed, and we exchanged our sin for His righteousness.  So we need to look at these Bible verses with spiritual eyes.  This is the custom for redeeming and exchanging.  Now when we say custom, we're not talking about a custom, man-made custom, we're talking about something in the Scriptures, something that's in the Old Testament, something that's in God's Word.  To confirm anything, one man took off his sandal and gave it to another.  And this was a confirmation in Israel.  Therefore, the close relative said to Boaz, buy it for yourself.  So he took off his sandal.  So notice it says it was a custom.  Well, where did the custom come from?  Well, let me read it to you.  Deuteronomy 25 7-10.  But if the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate.  Now this is talking about a man that dies and then the closest brother or the nearest relative is supposed to marry the woman if there's not an error.  If she doesn't have a son, that's what it means.  Deuteronomy 25, verse 7.  But if the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to the elders and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Israel.  He will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.  Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him.  But if he stands firm and says... I do not want to take her.  Then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, spit in his face and answer and say, so shall it be done to the man who will not build up his brother's house.  And his name shall be called in Israel the house of him who had his sandal removed.  Not only did his sister-in-law get to spit in his face, but he has to change his name.  Can you imagine how embarrassing this is?  What a disgrace it is to be called like that.  The house of him who had his sandal removed.  So here's the point.  What does this all mean spiritually?  This man has the right to marry his brother's wife, and he's giving up the right.  That's what it means.  And the sign that God came up with to confirm that you are giving up your right is to take your shoes off.  Do you see the spiritual meaning?  The confirmation that you're giving up your right is to take your shoes off.  The nearest relative to Boaz had the right to marry Ruth and to buy the land back, but he gave up his right and he took his shoes off.  So when God shows up to Moses and Moses says, Lord, what do you want me to do?  And he says, well, the first thing I want you to do is I want you to take off your shoes.  I want to be in charge.  And that's the only way this is going to work.  Now, we need to understand that Moses probably at that point didn't understand that.  But then God gave the Torah, God's word, as they were going through the wilderness.  So when Yeshua shows up on that hillside to Joshua, take your shoes off.  Joshua knew what it meant, and he gave up his right to be the leader.  By the way, this phrase, give up your right, I want to touch a little bit deeper on that, give up your right.  Again, another example from the ministry here in Israel, again from marriage counseling.  The man turns to me a different time, there's a different counseling session, and he says, Rabbi, Pastor, I'm right.  I said, yes, I'm asking you to give up your right to be right.  And I said to him, do you understand?  that's why we call it give up your right?  I didn't ask you to give up your wrong.  You're giving up your right.  Maybe you are right.  Will you give it up?  Will you forgive that person?  Will you give up your right?  Here's what happens when you give up your rights.  You say, God, Yeshua, you're in charge.  From now on, you're in charge, Yeshua.  I'm giving up my right.  And it's very important to realize that life doesn't work unless he's in charge.  Who is in charge of your decisions?  Who makes your decisions?  Who's in charge of your decisions?  Who's in charge of your health?  Who's in charge of your decisions?  Who's in charge of your finances?  Will you give up your rights?  Will you take off your sandals, your shoes?  What is the first thing Yeshua did at the Lord's table, that Passover meal?  He washed his disciples' feet.  And it's very important to realize, in order for Yeshua to wash their feet, they had to take their shoes off in order for him to wash their feet.  And he comes to one of the disciples, remember?  And I'm paraphrasing, and Peter says, you're not going to wash my feet.  John chapter 13, verse 8.  Peter said to him, you shall never wash my feet.  Jesus, Yeshua, answered him, if I do not wash you, you have no part with me.  Let's look at this closely.  He did not say, if I do not wash your feet, if I do not wash you.  He's the only one who has the power to wash away our sins.  Peter was right.  Did you know that?  A rabbi, a teacher, was never ever supposed to serve his students.  And Peter was saying, Lord, this isn't right.  And the Lord was saying, yes, will you give that up?  Are you going to do it my way?  Are you going to let me be in charge?  And that's what God is asking us.  Will you take off your shoes?  Are you going to let me be in charge?  Are you going to give up your right?  And the question is, who's in charge?  Whose side are you on?  Yeshua, Jesus, is our high priest.  And through him we become priests.  And in order for us to become priests, we need to take our shoes off.  This is the reason why the priests in the Old Testament, when they went into the temple, they went into the tabernacle, to the sanctuary, they had to take their shoes off.  Because in order to walk as a priest spiritually, you have to take your shoes off.  And at that Lord's table, that Passover meal, Yeshua, Jesus, was breaking his disciples into the priesthood.  And that's another reason they had to take their shoes off.  The significant meaning is to give up our right to let him be Lord on our life, to let him be in control, but also to walk, to function as a priest.  Isaiah 52, verse 7.  How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news and proclaim peace and bring good tidings.  who proclaim salvation and say to Zion, your God reigns.  How beautiful are the feet.  We function as a priest because he's our high priest.  And that's why the Bible says that he's coming back.  and his feet will land on the Mount of Olives.  Does that mean that we need to wash each other's feet?  Absolutely not.  When Jesus, Yeshua, told his disciples to wash each other's feet, what he meant was to go and make disciples, to break people into the priesthood.  It was a spiritual meaning.  Many times I see people having conferences and meetings and they start washing each other's feet.  That's not what it means.  Did Yeshua physically come down and wash our feet?  He didn't.  But spiritually, we take off our shoes, our sandals, and he washes our feet spiritually as we walk into the priesthood.  That's what it means.  Let's take our shoes off and walk as ambassadors for the kingdom, as priests.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat sending you blessings from Yerushalayim, from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Al Yehuda, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
