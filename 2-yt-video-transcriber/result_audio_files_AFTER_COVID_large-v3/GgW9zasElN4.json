            "text": "Good evening, people.  Watchman 65, Lisa Boyce here.  I'm going to give you the gospel.  It's in 1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4, that Christ died for our sins, past, present, and future, was buried, and rose again on the third day, according to scripture.  We're saved by grace through faith in Christ alone.  It's not of ourselves, least any man should boast.  My son is taking his driving test right now, taking his instructor driving ed class.  We're saved strictly by believing, people.  We're not saved.  We don't come to Christ saying what we've done or what we can do.  We come to Christ believing.  in what he's already done for us.  It is grace through faith in Christ alone.  We're not saved no other way.  And remember, we will never lose our salvation.  Once we come to Christ believing in what he's done and what he's already done, we will never lose our salvation.  No man can pluck us out of his hand.  We're saved and sealed until the day of redemption.  I wanted to, because a few things dropped in my spirit, and I actually had to write them down.  The title is The Anti-Crisis on Standby, and he is.  The American Dream, as we know it, is gone.  There's no more dream here.  This is not something that Trump, Biden, or any other political candidate can fix.  I have to piggyback on what Barry was talking about earlier, and he's absolutely right.  There's millions of people that are out of work, There's millions and millions of dollars in rent that have not been paid.  There's millions and millions of dollars in businesses in their rent that hasn't been paid.  They keep printing money and pretty soon the dollar is going to be worth nothing.  Now, I'm looking back on all of this, the riots, the viruses.  I'm looking at all of this and I'm like, it's still God's control.  God is still in control.  And he's allowing all this to happen.  The economic structure is gone.  The world awaits.  Listen to this.  I wrote this down.  This is from the Holy Spirit.  The world is waiting for one whom they think can fix this nation back to normal.  America as we know it is gone.  It's over.  I'm not saying I'm not me.  And you know what?  I love it.  I love it.  And I'm going to tell you why I love it.  Because I know the rapture is coming.  I know the Lord is getting ready to snatch the church out of here.  Because what's coming, we're on the brink.  This nation is on the brink of the tribulation right now.  Now, I got this article off of Jerusalem Post.  And it says that the judge upholds restrictions on houses of worship in New York.  Now, you can blame that on Big Bird.  And I got to come up with a name for Cuomo. ",
