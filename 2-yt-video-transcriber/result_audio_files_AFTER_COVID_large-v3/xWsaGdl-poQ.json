He left the station in a Manchester suburb and started to walk up the Bolton Road wondering what to do.  He came to some streets of terraced houses which lay at the foot of an immense mill.  As he took in the scene, he was filled with the urge to paint it.  And at that moment, he decided to become an artist.  His name is Lawrence Stephen Lowry. ",

I paint the people as I see the people.  It reminds I. I just paint the people as I see them.  I simply paint the people as I see them, and that's all there is to it. ",

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.  Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain.  And you are young and life is long And there is time to kill today.  And then one day you find Ten years have got behind you.  No one told you when to run.  You missed the starting line.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And you run and you run to catch up with the song they're singing.  racing around to come up behind you again.  The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older, shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.  Every year is getting shorter, never seeking to find the time.  Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.  The time is gone, the song is over.  It's all like something more to say.  Home, home again.  I like to be here when I can.  And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.  Far away across the field, tolling of the iron bell, calls the faithful to their knees to hear the softly spoken magic spell. ",
