            "text": "You know, there was a time where I used to think that my five long-term relationships were failures.  But given today's environment where no one has relationships, it seems I've had five successful relationships.  I've had five things that no one's even had one of.  A subscriber of mine, Dunstan, recently left a comment under one of my recent videos where he said, only boomers and Christians date.  And I have to wonder, does he have a point?  With the younger generation, it's the norm, the absolute norm that either you're hooking up or you're single.  That's it.  There's no in-between.  There's no monogamy.  There's very little long-term relationships or what your parents and before that would consider a committed relationship.  Women's lib has conditioned the ladies to think of commitment or marriage or whatever as a prison, as oppression.  And men are just taking what women offer, which is transient hookups.  While women keep their options open, again, we're either hooking up or we're on our own.  Given the 80-20 rule where 20% of the men get virtually most of the women, and those 20% of the men never settle down with anyone, they just perpetually... live a Chad lifestyle until they get old.  It leaves everyone else single and leftover.  You know, one thing you can say about history was that those 20% of men got the first pick and then it would leave the rest of all of us to sort of pair bond and create our own families and the human race would develop and so forth.  It would leave time for other pursuits like furthering society, inventing things.  technology, so forth.  But all that's happening now is those chads, those 20% of guys at the top are just perpetually enjoying that cycle of hooking up while women keep their options open thinking they're going to land the chad, which they won't.  They'll land the chad for one night.  What does it say for commitment?  What does it say more importantly for trust?  If you don't give enough time to stay with anyone, You don't trust anyone.  You don't form or recreate the bonds that our forefathers did.  Not just in terms of the superficial family.  You may not want family, but when everything ends before it's even taken hold, before roots have even developed, things like trust and community are gone.  We're atomized individuals.  That's really something important to think about.  When you're young, you think it's fine because you don't know yourself.  You don't know what you want.  But by the time you find out what you want, you find out the time you've wasted.  You find out that you're too old to get what you should have gotten.  There's a lot of women my age wanting to settle down finally and have a serious relationship.  And men my age aren't interested anymore.  I mean, even if you were the marrying kind when you were younger as a guy, why would a man my age want to settle down?  or even delusionally want to have children with some of these women that think they still can.  Why, when I've got my life together as a stable single male at this point, why would I change it?  And to be fair, there are a lot of women my age that have their kids from previous relationships.  and they don't really want to start again.  So how can we come together?  The answer is we can't, and especially you add on to that that they've got children.  They don't want to endanger whatever stability they have there.  We tend to have transient relationships at a distance and keep the lives that we've created for ourselves thus far, and that's quite sensible.  Guys I talk to online and off.  often It is the norm that they have not had a serious relationships at all.  All it is, is hookups.  I think dating is on its way out.  I'm not saying it should be on its way out, but this is the trend.  This is what's happening.  We are isolated.  We are so individuated without even knowing what we want.  I was speaking to a young family friend the other day in her late 20s.  She has never had a relationship.  Admittedly, she has never had a relationship.  She's had a lot of hookups, she's been with a lot of guys, but she's never known a relationship.  And I used to think a little while ago that was very surprising and odd when people said, yeah, I've been in a relationship.  and it was for three months.  And I'm thinking, you haven't even been past the honeymoon period.  That usually takes six months to a year in some cases.  And yeah, I can see the attraction for a young person in today's nervous environment to be very weary about putting your eggs all in one basket.  We're told to diversify our funds.  You don't keep a car for very long.  You make sure you've got multiple bank accounts.  If one gets closed, you have multiple streams of income.  You see people online.  If one gets shut down, if your channel gets shut down.  People are diversifying and fragmenting themselves where they don't actually invest wholeheartedly in any one direction, in any one person.  And as such, they're fragmented.  I see people diversifying themselves in a hundred different directions, whether it's with people or whether it's with hobbies and things, where they never know how much richness they can get out of an aspect of their lives because they never understand throw themselves at it.  Admittedly, the environment does everything in its power to make you diversify so shallowly that you never even barely dip your toe in any one direction.  You don't put all your chips in one basket because the smart thing to do is diversify your interests for survival's sake.  If they shut my channel down, I've still got a stream of income.  If my girlfriend leaves me, I've got another girlfriend.  It's the idea of spinning plates with people and things and hobbies where you're not experiencing any one of them.  You're trying to survive by having things in your life that really mean nothing.  And you know they mean nothing to you because you've got continual backups of any one thing.  People or hobbies or interests flicking on your phone.  You've always got something to sprint forward towards, but you're never sitting still with anything.  You're never developing a relationship with anything.  You're never investing in anything.  You keep diversifying yourself in 100 different directions, which means you never really experience any one thing.  Of course, it's admirable when you see a novelist who's spent their entire life writing and they've written a couple of really great books.  You can see the richness in a life like that.  You think, wow, if only I could get some of that, whatever that is.  Or you see your grandparents who've been together for their whole lives.  You think, wow, if I could just get some of that.  But if you never even take a step in a direction, then you'll never get any of it.  These days, people just have hookup after hookup after hookup after hookup.  I'll never be hurt because I'll never feel anything.  All I'll feel is lust.  Maybe that's it.  A generation of people just comfortable with lust because lust is safe.  Investment or love or caring, sharing.  It's easier to just hoard just your time and nothing else and not let anyone take that from you.  But all you can do with time is give it away.  I mean, you can give it away just here to yourself, or you can give it away with people.  I mean, even the friendship that people have these days, especially in times of isolation online, even friendships are diluted, but they're about the only thing that people invest in in terms of relating to each other.  It's getting less and less.  I hesitate to think in the next couple of years.  I mean, now it's generally acquaintances.  We have sex with acquaintances.  We have friendships with acquaintances.  There's a lack of depth.  And it's no surprise to me that when I talk to guys, their vocabulary how they think, they're not around people very often.  They don't talk, they don't use language that often.  They throw short phrases and words to each other because that's what they're used to on their phones, in their feeds, on Twitter.  And without that long form intimacy with your hobbies or people, you don't trust those things because trust takes time.  Trust with your hobby, trust with people, Again, atomized and on your own your whole life.  And it just reinforces the idea of, see, there's no one I can count on but me.  It's self-reinforcing too.  We're surrounded less and less by family and friends.  And when we're conditioned with that environment, that is what we start to recreate because that's all we're used to.  Again, there's no surprise why relationally we are far, far different than our parents and grandparents and those before them.  Only having sex with strangers, which isn't real intimacy.  It's just lust.  No trust because that takes time and you're not giving anyone or anything any time to develop any kind of trust with you.  And then you feel alone because you've got no one to trust.  Quasimodo said it.  well, relationships are for those who can relate.  And I see very few people who can relate.  They can barely talk to each other.  They can barely speak.  If you're not relating meaningfully, you're not forming long-term bonds, you're not forming trust, you're going to feel more and more alone.  And like it or not, people don't like this saying, but yeah, we are a social species and we are not used to this.  I mean, we can adapt and we are, and we should, But we are not built for this.  I mean, no community, no family, no friends.  This is pretty new, especially in such a densely packed world like we are today.  It really f***s with your head because you're surrounded by people and you're completely alone.  And as we all know, as Robin Williams said, the worst is to feel completely alone, surrounded by people.  And that is what we all tend to be now.  And look, I'm only describing the environment.  I'm not saying to give up.  I'm saying don't pretend to throw yourself at a world that you think is still your parents' world or your grandparents' world.  We need to adapt.  I don't know what solutions I can give.  And I'm not really a person that likes to give advice.  The person has to find their own way.  But I've said it before is be interested enough in yourself.  Look, I generally think we can only get out of this and better our lives philosophically.  That's about the only way out I can see because everything else we used to trust, social structures, relationships between men and women, um, Certain automatic things like that used to be on your side and used to be productive.  Now they're not.  Now they want to chew you up and spit you out and laugh at you for being so gullible.  So it's up to the individual now to be philosophically interested and in their own psychology and how they relate to the world and be really, really responsible for creating your own ethics and values and living by them.  Because right now, as Nietzsche said, if you're not obeying yourself, you're being commanded.  And it's never more evident than today.  I mean, people are living literally as emotional nomads.  Imagine living out of your backpack.  relationship wise, never having any place to sleep for longer than a week and moving and moving and never feeling at home, never feeling like you have a home with people.  That's what we're doing with each other and our lives.  Existentially, we're nomads.  And this is another very important thing to remember.  If you're never spending enough time with a person relationally or intimately, romantically, or even platonically with friends, all you get used to doing is keeping that initial mask on of pretending to be what the other person wants so you can just long enough to have sex or just long enough to be polite or just long enough to get the job.  And then you're out of there.  If we get used to wearing that mask and that's all we are with other people, we never spend long enough to be intimate, to be honest, to reveal who we are.  Not for them, for us.  We never spend long enough to be rooted in relationships with others to give it enough time to get there.  We are living perpetually with these masks that we feel awful about because we know we're being fake.  I've mentioned this in the last couple of videos, but it really comes to the forefront.  When long-term relationships are dead and they continue to die, they're almost extinct.  We are relating to each other with the initial polite masks so we don't feel alone, and then it ends, and then we put on that mask again.  And the only time the mask comes off is when we go to bed at night on our own, feeling anxious.  And a lot of times, especially if you're not interested in philosophy and psychology, your own philosophy, you will never be revealed unless it's in relation to somebody else.  Most people aren't interested in these topics, so they can only ever be revealed in a true sense by having someone else see them.  And if you don't give enough time for that to happen, you will never feel seen, you will never be seen, you will never open up as a person in the real world, and you will never know why.  I'm not saying to give up.  I realize the environment is dangerous, but I really think the answer is to be interested enough in developing your own philosophical way out of this and not have this safe position of, well, I'll never choose anything, but I'll have fun with everything.  Yes, I'm a big advocate for individual responsibility, but that does not mean pretending that you don't exist in a world with other people.  Like it or not, we've come this far as a species Not because we're the strongest or fastest, we don't have fur, but because we can cooperate with each other.  We are social animals and we are not used to this, what's happening in the world today.  It's something to think about anyway.  Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
