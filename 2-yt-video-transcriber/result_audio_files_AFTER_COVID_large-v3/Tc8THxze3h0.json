For the same trillion dollar deficits, four years I said we shouldn't.  Guess who's about to start caring again?  Cause like a guy who's found himself addicted to Uber Eats.  Well, it seems we're giving too much money to the Chinese.  Isn't that the same spending contained in bills that you recently penned?  The ideological difference is I'm about to start caring again.  you'll hear me well you'll hear me scoff.  you'll see me faint.  you'll hear me talk about how the spending's needing to go.  why for the past four years i didn't care.  our fiscal policy looked like a mr beast video cause.  when the president gets with us politicians get the itch to just defend our teams.  well and so I'm about to start caring, about to start swearing.  It's not a red herring, our debt needs repairing.  I'm here by declaring I'm about to start caring again. ",
