            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim.  During my prayer early this morning, the Holy Spirit was just leading me and the Lord kept leading me back to May 31st.  and clearly spoke to me how the G seven summit, which was actually, it's been around, I believe for four decades and it deals with, you know, nations that would gather together, uh, dealing with the global economy, security or safety and energy.  Well, on May 31st from air force one, after attending an event at Cape, uh, Canaveral for NASA, the launching of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  President Trump announced that the then scheduled G Summit at Camp David for June 10th to 12th was being postponed because of, excuse me, coronavirus.  And that having been on the back of some not so nice statements from Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding not wanting to travel.  So let me tell you about the G7 summit.  I've already told you why it existed.  Nations that have participated have been the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and EU representation.  at that time, president Trump postponed it till September.  Now I have not, I don't have verification of a date, but man, the Lord was Holy spirit was all over me and said, go.  And check this out.  And I did.  And when I realized the Lord said, September is significant.  Keep your eyes and be prayerful on what's going on on September.  Now, this is what really caught my eye.  as it's like the Lord wouldn't let me stop looking at certain things.  So one of the things that the president, I'm telling you, the Lord led me to that statement that he made on Air Force One on May 31st of this year.  He said, the G7 does not properly represent what is happening in the world.  Now listen to this.  This is from President Trump's own mouth.  And is, quote, very outdated, end quote, group of countries.  He has wanted to now invite, along with those other nations, Austria, South Korea, India, and now there's word even Russia.  And one of the topics that he wants to cover is is the future and the global sector of China.  Now what's really interesting, if you are following what's going on, the tensions between the U.S.  and China, But what really hit me, what really hit me, we've been saying this for a long time, prophecy watchers, that the UN is a forerunner.  It's leading the way for the globalist, for the new world order that is in play.  What is significant is the words, and this is what the Holy... Quote, very outdated, end quote.  Why?  Because the, and I've got to be careful what I say.  This video may be taken down.  So you guys know when we speak in code, it's because when we come too closely to that agenda, the censoring is unbelievable.  Because we are going to see a new world order established and redefining of this global structure.  Now, I'm going to go into greater detail on things that are happening.  Unfortunately, I can no longer do my news updates on YouTube.  There's people who hate that, people who love that.  Listen, it is what it is.  A lot of research and prayer went into it.  So there is a Patreon channel for that.  There are others who give news.  All I'm going to say is if you want that, you'll have to go to the Patreon channel for that.  I try to give bits and dribs that I can.  that won't take the channel completely down.  But at any time, I fully anticipate my YouTube channel would go down.  People have given me other free sites.  But the problem is when I check those sites, they're streaming.  I would still have to have hosting.  I am perplexed.  personally paying for hosting so the little bit that comes in from patreon is going to go toward that and anything overage.  again i'm we.  we do ministries.  so that's all i'm going to say because i i never want to misrepresent anything but i want you guys to know what's going on.  um Some people are saying I'm a 501c3.  I am not a 501c3.  If you ever see it, I put non-501c3.  I am a pastor of a church, but this is not a church channel.  This is Tim Henderson.  And there are many of you who are, you know, who watch this, who are members of the church, and you guys know we have a complete board.  I... I don't, we have a treasurer, we have accountability, that kind of thing.  This is separate.  So truly, I just wanna explain that Patreon, that's really the hosting fees in order for us to be able to do this and not be susceptible.  Now, could there come a time that that could even become censored?  Who knows?  I've already I'm working on a next layer that if that should happen, if that should happen until we are caught up out of here, we are going to keep bringing.  Listen, this is all about the Lord.  So I could care less about whether I'm on here.  We want to bring the gospel.  Christ died for our sins.  He shed his precious blood.  paid the debt once and for all.  He cried out to Telestai, it is finished.  The debt is paid in full.  The job is perfectly done.  He died, was buried, conquered, held death in the grave, and on the third day rose from the dead.  I've done a video, faith plus nothing equals salvation and eternal security.  I will share that again.  That is the gospel.  1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  And the ABCs of Salvation is in the description box.  We're always going to bring the gospel.  We also bring geopolitical news that ties to prophecy.  Prophecy is jumping off the pages of the Bible.  And we believe in the pre-tribulation rapture.  Well, I do a news segment.  I was doing that every day.  But that, they've been taking down most of those and are not permitted to be on most of the social media platforms.  Also, um facebook twitter i'm telling you travis and rachel who manage the pastor tim's channel family.  they they set that up.  that's a place that you can go on facebook for fellowship for support for prayer and i'm not on there.  it's rare that i even get on there.  travis and rachel did that and they are a blessing to this family in christ this channel family.  They've even been censored.  So they've got to watch what is put up there.  And to my understanding, where most people would be able to find it, see it, and you have to go look for it.  That group, you have to ask to be part of it.  They do not... They do not just keep people out, but there have been those who come on to try to cause division and issues.  I don't determine that.  They do a fantastic job.  Travis and Rachel, I love you guys and all the moderators.  So I wanted to come on and just tell you guys what the Lord gave me.  September is significant.  Now, will they have the G7?  I don't know, but it was back on May 31st that the president postponed it and then said, I'm telling you, Holy Spirit would not let... This is where he directed me.  He said, quote, very outdated, end quote.  Why?  Because they are working to establish... The Antichrist system is working to establish this new world order.  Well, when I do the news update in a little while, probably in about... Oh, I'd say 30 minutes or so.  Might be an hour.  Those who are able to access that, you are going to see.  Wow.  You're going to see.  Prophecies are jumping off the pages of the Bible.  The glorious thing is, if... You question whether this is true.  Things that the prophets wrote 2,500 to 2,800 years ago are literally aligning exactly as the word says.  It's exciting for the student of prophecy.  So God bless you guys.  I want to give you a blessing before I let you go.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  May his countenance be lifted on you and his shalom, his peace, perfect, whole, complete, nothing lacking, nothing missing, be yours in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Jesus Messiah.  I pray and I bless you.  God bless you guys.  Shalom, shalom.  Shalom Aleichem.  And have an awesome rest of your day. ",
