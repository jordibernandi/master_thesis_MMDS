And I think that's the crux of all of this.  Obviously, if we acknowledge that's a human life, but it seems as though you have, you're just okay with terminating it.  People who are looking to make headway with people who are pro-life, they would have to present some kind of an argument that would prove... prove that this is not a human being, that it's not a person.  But when you say it is a person, it is a human being, I don't care anyway, I have the right to kill another human being, as you've presented, yeah, I'm not going to be on board, but I appreciate you sitting down.
