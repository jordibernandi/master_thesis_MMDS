And I know I'm going to rot in hell eternally for this, but can I maybe just give it a sample?  Yeah, give a sample.  Okay.  It was written, the poem is a poignant rumination on how, quote, I can be a delicious lunch, dinner, or breakfast, if you're weird.  She goes on to describe herself, quote, as a round and flat piece of dough with lots of topping.  I am a mouth's best friend.  I make you say yum-yum. ",

I mean, it's kind of hard to do jokes when... you know terrible things happen in the news and I think we've all were affected and I'm trying to understand why so much you know I mean for me growing up in Massachusetts and the Kennedys are so much a part of my life as a kid you know I remember my mom crying when John and Caroline were in the funeral.  you know and it sticks in your mind.  and then when he came here and sat in the chair it struck me that at what point that I think that my life would ever intersect with his life you know and he really made an impression on everybody here genuinely a nice man.  i mean all the kennedy jokes we've done over the years.  he could have been nicer and kinder signed autographs said hello and then my wife and i were talking about it last night.  you know and you realize there there are people.  did you just want to see grow old just just for the fun of it because their life is so close to your life.  you know people like him and princess die and you realize these people never really did any bad.  whenever you saw them you smiled and you felt happy for them and you wanted them to have a good life.  you know.  and for those of you who think somebody has something more than you you go oh boy and then something tragic like this happens.  so Thanks for making the job easier tonight.  Like I said, doing the monologue, I said, how do you go out and do a monologue?  But that's the job we have to do here and try and be silly and try and maybe cheer people up.  But please don't think it's not on our minds because if it's on your minds, it's on our minds too.  So I just want to say, you know, say a prayer and God bless him.  And he was a very, very nice man.  That's all.  Good night, everybody. ",

You know when you're a kid and your mom's crying, you're like, what can I do here?  And I was sort of helpless and hopeless.  50 years go by.  I have Seinfeld on, my second guest John F. Kennedy Jr.  I saw him come out and then for some reason I started to tear up because I flashed back to my mother crying watching the TV.  And I never thought that triangle would have, I never thought I would know that little boy.  And my mom had passed away by that time, so I could never tell her that he turned out to be okay, you know?  And I didn't flash back to it when I was in the dressing room.  It wasn't until I saw it on the monitor, remember seeing it on TV with my mom, like sitting literally where you are while we're watching the TV in shoes and tears.  And I felt like I wanted to tell her it was okay, you know?  But it was just one of those emotional moments.  And the producer's going, I said, nothing, nothing.  It was just one of those weird things that hit me.  And it only hit me because of that.  I never thought that would ever happen in real life. ",
