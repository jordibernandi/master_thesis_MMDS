One, its incredible capacity to describe reality, and then what mathematics really is.  So let's start with the first.  How accurately does math describe the physical world? ",

            "text": "Well, it is extraordinarily precise.  In different areas, more precise.  In some areas, we know less about it.  But... I think people often find it puzzling that something abstract like mathematics could really describe reality as we understand it.  I mean, reality, you think of something like a chair or something, something made of solid stuff.  And then you say, well, what's our best scientific understanding of what that is?  Well, you say it's made of fibers and... cells and so on.  And these are made of molecules.  And those molecules are made of atoms.  Those atoms are made out of nuclei and electrons going around.  And then you say, well, what's a nucleus?  And you say, well, it's protons and neutrons.  And they're held together by things called gluons.  And then neutrons and protons are made of things called quarks and so on.  And then you say, well, what is an electron?  And what's a quark?  And at that stage, the best you can do is to describe some mathematical structure, you say there.  things that satisfy the Dirac equation or something like that, which you can't understand what that means without mathematics.  I mean, the mathematical description of reality is where we're always led.  And these equations are fantastically accurate.  The Dirac equation, which describes the electron or quarks, is a very precise equation.  And for example, there's a calculation which describes the magnetic moment.  That is, electrons behave like little magnets.  And the magnetic moment, the strength of that magnet, can be described in terms of other parameters.  And there's a calculation which gets the accuracy of that.  Well, Feynman had a very good description.  He said, it describes the distance between New York and Los Angeles to an accuracy of less than the thickness of a human hair.  So that's pretty precise.  That's unbelievable. ",

So that's 10 million.  Wow.  One part in that.  And then... there was discrepancies seen in the behavior of mercury and so on.  And that's where you start to see differences with Newton's scheme.  And then Einstein comes along and produces a theory which is now known to have a precision something like 10 to the power 14.  And that precision is a measure of how accurate, there's a particular system of two stars going around, special kinds of stars called neutron stars, very dense objects.  And these stars, one of them is what's called a pulsar.  It emits pulses of signals, which can be timed extremely precisely.  And over a period of, well, I suppose it's maybe more than 30 years now, I can't remember, they've been observing this thing.  And in that period of time, the accuracy over that length of time is known to something like one part in 10 to the 14.  Wow.  And the agreement between Einstein's theory and the observations.

And this precision... really dates back to the ancient Greeks, the time of Pythagoras and later, where they developed the mathematical ideas as a field of study stimulated to some degree by physical reality.  Because the geometry of Euclid, which was very much part of the mathematics that was being studied then, which we know.  nano isn't extraordinarily precise.  I mean, it is extraordinarily precise, but it's not as precise as Einstein's theory.  So one has to go a little bit beyond the, uh, geometry that they had.  I don't think they quite appreciated that they were doing physics because they didn't realize that the geometry of the world could have been anything else.  But they developed this mathematical scheme purely as a study on its own.  And so mathematics was studied as a pure intellectual activity and without necessarily it being related to the structure of the physical world, although geometry clearly was a big input.  But then the properties of numbers and how you add and multiply, and the notions of prime numbers, the fact there are infinitely many prime numbers that goes back to Euclid and earlier.  And so these things just about numbers were developed very much from the time of the Greeks.  And ever since then, mathematics has been the subject which you can study for its own sake.  It has its own life, in a sense.  And certainly mathematicians view it this way.  It's something out there.  which seems to have a reality independent of the reality, the ordinary kind of reality, like things like chairs and so on, which are what we normally think of as real.  But, okay, the mathematical reality is something different.  It's sometimes referred to as a platonic world, a platonic reality.  And sometimes people have a lot of trouble thinking that is real.  I mean, philosophers worry about that and so on. ",
