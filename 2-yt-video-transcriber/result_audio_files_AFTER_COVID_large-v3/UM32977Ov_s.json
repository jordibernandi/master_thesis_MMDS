            "text": "I think it's impossible to walk away from Avatar The Last Airbender without a special place in your heart for Uncle Iroh.  He's the loving father figure to everyone's favorite villain turned hero, a dedicated tea enthusiast, and one of the most powerful benders in the show.  But what exactly makes him so memorable and lovable?  As the uncle of a character who only joins the main group in the final season, it would be easy for his role to be simple and forgettable, but it's definitely not.  In this video, I'm going to run down just some of the reasons why I think we all remember and cherish Uncle Iroh so much.  When you first watch Book 1, Iroh comes across as just a really chill uncle.  He's supportive of Zuko, but he mostly just wants to drink tea and relax.  He's a bit of comedic relief to Zuko's constant angst.  But as the series progresses, we learn more and more about who he is.  We learn that his son died fighting in the war, and that he gave up being a general after that.  We learn that he just wants a humble life with his nephew and a tea shop.  We learn that he did not actually kill the last dragon, he only lied about that to protect the dragons.  As a part of that, we learn that he knows the true meaning of firebending, which many in the Fire Nation have forgotten.  He knows that firebending is about life and energy, while many others continue to feed their firebending with rage and hatred.  And we learn that he's part of the Order of the White Lotus, an ancient secret society with members from multiple nations that seeks to learn about the world.  The slow unveiling of all this over the course of the series gradually gives Iroh more and more depth.  That makes him an interesting character for sure, but there are two specific Iroh moments that I think really have the biggest emotional impact on the viewer.  In Book 2, in the Tales of Ba Sing Se episode, Iroh goes around helping people, first an infant, then some children, and then an adult.  It seems normal enough.  I mean, his role is kind of that wise old person dishing out advice and proverbs.  But the end of the episode really hits you hard and recontextualizes everything you just saw.  That episode takes place on his dead son's birthday, and he had been gathering things to have a memorial for Lu Ten.  This one line from Iroh is so powerful.  If only I could have helped you.  This changes the meaning of everything he just did.  He wasn't just being a kind old man.  He was trying to help people in the same way.  he wishes he could have helped his son.  He feels like he failed his son, and he's spending the rest of his life, in a way, trying to make amends.  There's nothing he can do to bring back Lu Ten, but he can make the world a little bit better by helping others.  Maybe through helping someone else, he can set them on the right path before a tragedy befalls them or their loved ones.  It's too late for him, but it doesn't have to be too late for someone else.  It's hard to express how much emotion and meaning is portrayed in this very short story.  The song he sings at the end has the lyrics about a soldier boy marching home, but his son never got to march home, and I just, I can't handle it.  But there's also the second Iroh moment I want to talk about, and that's his reunion with Zuko at the end of Book 3.  Iroh was absent from a good chunk of Book 3.  We saw him early on in a Fire Nation prison, but he escapes, and then Zuko goes to join Aang and the others.  While they go on training and doing their team avatar thing, nobody knows where Iroh is.  Zuko is worried that Iroh will never forgive him, because Iroh had already believed in him so much, and Zuko had betrayed him.  So when they finally do meet up with Iroh again, there's a big question mark looming over how Iroh will react to Zuko.  When he was in prison, Iroh had at first refused to even talk to Zuko, and then later tried again to convince him that he still had good within him.  so it could go either way.  At the very least, he would have every right to be mad at Zuko at first and forgive him later.  But what actually happens is that as soon as Iroh sees Zuko, he grabs him and pulls him into a tight hug.  He's just happy that his nephew has chosen to fight for what's right and has finally managed to break away from Ozai's horrible influence over him.  What mattered to Iroh wasn't how long it took Zuko or how Zuko had betrayed him earlier, it only mattered that he had finally gotten to the place that Iroh had wanted for him.  And I don't know how you don't cry at that moment.  It's such a pure, wholesome moment of love.  Iroh cares so deeply about Zuko that he's willing to instantly, without hesitation, forgive Zuko's betrayal at Ba Sing Se.  He's been a loving, understanding father figure for the whole show, but that's really the biggest gesture he could possibly make, and it's exactly what Zuko needed.  I think it's those two moments, Iroh setting up the memorial for Lu-Ten and Iroh hugging Zuko, that really cement Iroh as a fan favorite character.  But it's how those moments are connected that I think really makes Iroh a more interesting character.  My first reaction to learning about Lu-Ten was that Iroh was trying to raise Zuko well because he didn't have the chance to keep raising Lu-Ten.  Zuko was like the people in the Tales of Ba Sing Se that Iroh helped.  He was someone who needed guidance and love.  But I think there's actually a lot more to it than that.  Iroh didn't see Zuko as Luten, necessarily, but as Iroh himself.  Iroh used to be a general in the Fire Nation army, next in line to the throne.  He bought into all the Fire Nation's propaganda and was fueled by anger and hate.  He was just like Zuko.  That is, until he lost Luten.  After the death of his son, he was beside himself with grief.  He stopped his siege on Ba Sing Se and left to travel the world, leaving Ozai to claim the throne in his absence.  We don't know a lot about what happened during his travels.  All we know is that he changed a lot, since he had previously laughed at the idea of burning Ba Sing Se to the ground, but was now happy to live in Ba Sing Se serving tea.  During his travels, he must have learned about the different forms of bending and became friends with earthbenders and waterbenders.  which we know because of his connection to the other members of the White Lotus, and because of the importance we see in place on the balance between the elements.  Zhao even mentions that Iroh has been to the spirit world, which probably happened during those travels.  When Aang is in his spirit form and no one can see him, Iroh somehow does, meaning that he has a level of connection to the spirit world that very few other people do.  I think his travels after Luten's death did a couple of major things for him.  First, it humanized the people outside of the Fire Nation for him.  The Fire Nation propaganda relied on the idea that the Fire Nation was spreading prosperity, and that their war was necessary to share that prosperity with the world.  To make this argument, they had to position themselves as the superior nation.  According to the propaganda, the Earth Kingdom obviously couldn't be happy without the superior Fire Nation to rule over them.  But in his travels, Iroh must have seen that that wasn't true at all.  He would have seen that people from the other nations got along just fine without the Fire Nation, and in fact, they hated the Fire Nation and the war.  He had been so steeped in propaganda before that, and only surrounded by other Fire Nation people who were also steeped in that propaganda.  His travels allowed him to finally see outside of that limited worldview, helping him to see the humanity in those who were different from him.  And secondly, it allowed him to incorporate aspects of the different nations into himself.  This is best illustrated in the episode Bitter Work in Book 2, when Iroh teaches Zuko how to redirect lightning.  In this episode, he explains how knowledge must be drawn from different sources, and that knowledge drawn from just one perspective is rigid and stale.  He explains that even a firebender can learn from studying the ways of earthbenders, waterbenders, and airbenders.  This is directly at odds with the Fire Nation propaganda that fire is the superior element.  And so Zuko pushes back on this idea, but Iroh insists that learning about others is important.  He illustrates this by noting that he developed lightning redirection by studying waterbenders.  His connection to the spirit world is also unlike other firebenders, since airbenders are the ones who tend to be the most spiritual, so the loss of his son. ",
