            "text": "Good rising, brethren.  This is Big Judah coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, let me give you all praise.  It's the Most High, Yehawah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehawah Shai, pray that the Most High blesses this lesson this afternoon.  Because we're in knowledge and understanding of the events of the past.  In order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth.  So we know what will soon come on the Earth.  Most High led me to something today that I wanted to bring to the family to show you what these elites are seeing right now and to let you know that none of this is new.  The elites back then when the Spanish first got here would have been Moctezuma and his priests and soothsayers.  They were the ones that were holding the power.  Just like today, you know, we got elites that have been holding the power.  You got the people that you see, and we got the people that we don't see.  Well, the elites of our people were shown their demise before it happened.  Just like now, I'm sure that the elites, you know, they haven't told everybody.  They're keeping it a secret, but they've already been shown that their days are numbered.  I'm going to get a little bit into this book right here.  The Florentine Codex book 12.  You're going to see why a lot of this, uh, I can say these books are so expensive or you can, can't get them, um, because they give you so much understanding about what our people were experiencing.  You know, and the fact that the, um, Spanish and all the Europeans wanted to hide this information.  They wanted to hide the fact that, um, they already knew what was coming, just like the elites now know what's coming and they know that they can't stop it.  So therefore they're just allowing it to just continue.  What's amazing is right now you're hearing people, you know, you're hearing these leaders go on here, like Trump and other people.  saying that we're prepared for everything that is going to happen.  We're prepared.  We have the best medical staff.  We have the best medical minds and everything else.  We have the best medicine in the world.  And the fact is that we don't even make our own medicine.  How can we have the best medical team when we don't even have enough tests to test the people?  That's why they haven't tested these people because they don't even have tests.  How can you say that you're prepared for what's coming and you don't even have tests?  It just shows you the world that we live in and how it's just a bunch of lies.  And it's just things to make people feel comfortable in this matrix that they're in.  Let's go ahead and read.  We're all going to read a couple pages because you're going to see.  You know, I said how Moctezuma was shown what was to come and his soothsayers and his priests.  And trust me, ours, well, the ones of Esau and the Gentiles have been shown exactly the same thing.  This would be chapter 13.  Okay.  And you're going to see this, well, as we read it, you're going to see, like I said, how these prophecies here are jumping off the page right now.  You can see it by the actions of the people, especially of the higher-ups.  Most of the other people are still living in La La Land and don't understand.  But the elites already know.  So 13th chapter, in which it is told how Moctezuma sent still other sorcerers so that they might cast spells over the Spaniards and what befell them on the way.  Okay, so that's what's going on right here.  And another company of messengers, the soothsayers and magicians and incense offering priests had also gone.  They also went in order to contend against the Spaniards.  But nowhere were they successful.  Nowhere could they face them.  No more did they avail.  No more did they prevail over them.  No more were they sufficient.  So before, when they had the blessing, they were able to prevail over just about everyone.  But now that power has been taken away from them.  First they came upon a drunk man in the road.  They went to meet him.  They were confused by him.  They were beheld as a chalcan.  So was he arrayed.  He was adorned as a chalcan.  He was like a chalcan.  He seemed to be drunk.  He was like one besotted.  He was like one who was drunk.  With eight grass ropes was he bound by the chest.  He came facing them.  He came ahead of the Spanish vanguard.  And as he just rose up against them, he said, what have you still come to gain here?  What do you yet require?  What would Moctezuma still wish to do?  So he's already been losing.  He's already been losing against the Spaniards.  He hasn't been able to do anything.  So he's like, what is it you guys want?  What do you guys think is going to happen if you guys keep on going against the Spaniards?  Okay.  Have he then perchance come to his senses?  Is he then perchance now overcome by a great fear?  So, you know, these priests and Moctezuma, who would represent the elites, would be in great fear.  Now, you look at these people having press conferences.  Do you not see that great fear on their faces already?  They already know.  They've already seen the omens.  They already know that their time is done.  But they're still trying to, you know, hold on to their power as much as they can with their little fingertips.  But they know that their run is finished.  Okay, let's go.  It says, he has committed a fault.  He has abandoned the common folk.  He has destroyed the people.  Now see, the elites have abandoned the common folk.  They're not telling them the truth.  Exactly what happened with Mokhtar Zuma back then is exactly what's happening right now.  You have all these elites coming and telling everybody, hey, everything's going to be great.  Everything's going to be okay.  Everything's going to open up in a couple months.  Don't worry about it.  They're not telling you the truth.  And even these people on, you know, these different channels, hey, buy masks, buy this, buy that.  You'll be fine.  At the end, get gold, get silver, get money, because at the end, you'll be on top.  These common folk are abandoned.  Like I said, they're a ship with no rudder.  They have no direction.  They're still worshiping Cesare.  They're still thinking that Cesare is going to save them.  And we all know that that's not going to happen.  They're going to know at the final hours, unless the Most High opens their eyes to see.  Again, he hath abandoned the common folk.  He hath destroyed the people.  Because of him, they have been struck on the head.  Because of him, they have been wrapped in wrappings for the dead.  They have been laughed at.  They have been mocked.  And right now, at this point, we're sitting here listening to these guys, and they have no understanding whatsoever.  And unless the Most High opens their eyes to the truth, and opens their eyes to the people that he has empowered with the truth and starts to follow them, says they're never going to get it.  And when they had thus seen this, when they had thus heard his words, yet to no purpose, okay, yet to no purpose, did they pay him attention.  When they humbly prayed to him, when they quickly set up his watching place, his earthen platform and his straw bed, he no longer looked forth from there.  Quite in vain was what he had.  Let's continue here.  Let me get this moving here.  It's off.  Okay.  Had been set up in vain had they made the earthen platform there.  First, as if they had entered his mouth, he chid them.  He taxed them.  It was as if he spoke in a passion.  He said to them, okay, why in vain have you come walking here?  Nevermore will there be a Mexico.  Now don't get caught up with the names.  We know it wasn't called Mexico back then.  All right.  But that's very important right there.  Never more will there be a Mexico.  It is already gone forever.  Go hence.  It is no longer there.  Turn about.  Turn about.  Look at what cometh to pass in Mexico.  What thus already cometh to pass.  So he's already telling them that your land, this land that you love already, it's already gone.  It's already been turned over.  It's already been given to your enemies.  And see, a lot of these people are still holding on to America.  They're still holding on to, you know, everything being fine and them just continuing the way things have been before.  And that's never going to happen.  Because, like I said, the elites have already let go or abandoned the other people, just like I talked about with the Oath of Solomon.  And just like the days of Noah, people are just going to go by not knowing what's going on because the Most High has not given them the understanding and the elites have already abandoned them.  Continue here.  Then they turned about to look.  They quickly turned about to look.  They beheld that already all the temples, the Kapuli buildings, the Kalmaikak buildings, all the houses of Mexico were were burning.  And it was as if there was fighting.  And after the soothsayers had seen it, it was as if their hearts went from them somewhere.  They no longer spoke clearly.  It was as if someone had made them swallow something.  So now the, you know, the great men, the, you know, the thinkers, the ones, you know, that they would go to for counsel, now they'd lost, you know, the ability to speak.  They had lost the ability to think.  It talks about that even in the scriptures, about how Esau's men that could think and whatever else, they would lose all of their knowledge and understanding.  And that's exactly what we're witnessing right now, that all these people can't see the truth and can't see what's happening.  So like I said, I just want to show you how the things that are happening right now happened to us already first when the Spaniards got here.  And they hid these events in books.  Okay, let's read that again.  And after the soothsayers had seen it, it was as if their hearts went from them.  Somewhere, they no longer spoke clearly.  It was as if someone had made them swallow something.  They said, this was in no way for us to see.  It was for Moctezuma to see.  what we have seen.  For it was not just anyone who accosted us.  He was the youth.  Therefore he vanished.  No more did they see him.  And the messengers went no further to encounter the Spaniards because they weren't going any further because they already knew that it was game over.  Nevermore, you know, we got to see the fact that, um, You know, people got to see these omens that everything that we had was going to be destroyed.  And that it was already, you know, pretty much ordained by the Most High.  So there would be nothing that we could do against them.  And the same thing is happening to the Gentiles.  But they just don't see that yet.  Okay.  Right there, the soothsayers, the ensign offering priest turned back.  They came to notify Monk Dezuma.  they and those who had earlier gone with, I'm not even going to try to pronounce that name, joined with one another.  And when these messengers had come to arrive, they so related to Moctezuma what had come to pass, what they had beheld.  Moctezuma, when he heard it, only bowed his head.  He only sat with bowed head.  He hung his head.  He sat with head hanging down.  No longer did he speak aloud.  He only sat dejected for a long time, as if he had lost hope.  And this is exactly what has happened to the elites.  It happened to the elites first.  It happened to their priests, to their men of great knowledge and understanding.  Just like today.  The men that are in the higher positions, excuse me, have already known and understand.  That's why you saw a couple of days ago, a bunch of elites, a bunch of CEOs just up and quit and leave.  Just out of the blue, quit their positions and just left.  There was three CEOs.  I know one was from Disney, one from MasterCard, and there was another company.  I'm not sure exactly which one.  I'm sure if you guys know, you guys can put it in the comments section.  But, you know, men that have made all this money are trying to run away.  People are trying to run away, elites trying to run away because they already know what's coming.  The last ones to know from our people, you're going to see, were the common folk.  But the elites already knew.  So when you see them having these press conferences, look at their faces, look at their actions, look at their mannerisms.  They're already showing you that they are defeated because the Most High has already let them know.  It says, he only answered them in this way.  He said to them, what now, oh my warriors?  For already we are at the end.  For already we have taken our medicine.  Are there perchance mountains that we shall climb?  And shall we perchance run away?  For we are Mexicans.  Will the Mexican state in truth be glorified?  Unfortunate are the poor old man, the poor old woman, and the child who has no understanding.  So these are the common folk.  They have no understanding.  And they're not going to tell you the truth either.  So they're allowing you to just, you know, pretty much take the brunt of everything and have no understanding all the way to the end.  Just like it says, you know, in the days of Noah.  They won't have any understanding.  And now you'll see why, because the elites already know, but they're not telling anyone.  You see that?  And they know they can't run anywhere.  They know they can't go anywhere.  And this is following the exact pattern of Solomon, Odes of Solomon.  We said they were going to give them these fake religions and then just desert them.  And the days of Noah.  Now you see how it works, because that's exactly what happened to our people.  Again, will the Mexican state in truth be glorified?  Unfortunate are the poor old man, the poor old woman, and the child who has no understanding.  Where will they be taken?  What now?  What is to be done in vain?  What can be done?  Where in truth can we go?  For already we have taken our medicine.  whatsoever, wheresoever it is, we shall marvel at it.  So that should let you know and give you the example of what you're seeing right now.  The elites already know what's going on.  They already know about the certain amount of years that we had to go through our captivity and the fact that the Most High was going to redeem us at the end.  they're just not telling the vast majority of the world.  And they're just still hoping and praying that things are going to get better.  But if you look at history, and look what happened to our people, these plagues were just the beginning.  So for you, it's going to be exactly the same thing.  These plagues are just the beginning, and it's only going to get worse.  Sorry to tell you, there's no like... You know, there's no happy ending.  There was no happy ending for us.  There will be no happy ending for you unless the most high calls you and gives you the truth.  But like I said, that's not my call.  That's not our call.  That's the most highest call.  So if you are getting this information and you're making sense to you and the most high is working on your heart, get on your knees and pray for mercy because what's about to happen is exactly what happened to us.  Just like what happened, the horrible things that happened to us.  But, you know, at least I'm letting you know what's coming so that you can get prepared, as opposed to, you know, Cesare, who you're still looking at to, you know, take you away from everything or to protect you from everything, or the elites who have now abandoned you.  All praise is to the Most High, Yahawa.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Take knowledge with you.  Shalom. ",
