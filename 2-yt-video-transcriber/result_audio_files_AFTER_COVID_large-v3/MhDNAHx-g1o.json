And with regard to Dr.  Fauci, you're referring to a quote he allegedly told Bob Woodward, and I can give you quotes that we can all play on loop and video of him, saying that this response was impressive.  And he can't imagine anyone under any circumstance doing anything better.  Dr.  Fauci saying this, I can just tell you the President The first and only time I went and said, you need to do mitigation strongly, the response was, yes, we will do it.  The second time I went with Dr.  Birx to the President and said, 15 days to slow the spread are not enough.  We need to go to 30 days.  Obviously, there were a lot of people who had problems with that because of potential secondary effects.  Nonetheless, the President went with the health recommendations.

And the briefing said coronavirus from China is poised to spread globally.  But the good news is that it is not deadly for most people.  This is the information President Trump was getting.  And the next time he was briefed on it was January 28th, he was told that the spread was happening outside of China and the deaths remained all inside China.  He was told then that China is not sharing key data.  Indeed, China was not, because as I noted to you on January 9th, the World Health Organization said it does not readily transmit between people.  And on January 14th, the World Health Organization said no clear evidence of human to human transmission.  Clearly, that was not true.  Even on February 29th, as the virus was spreading, the WHO put political correctness first by opposing travel restrictions.
