I am bringing this message about changing our foreign policy away from waging regime change wars, being the world's police, going and toppling dictators in other countries, stopping this new Cold War nuclear arms race.

We've got to set aside any partisanship and really stand together as Americans, as leaders in this country to put the health and well-being of the American people first.  I think it's right.  I have supported his call to suspend travel from China, from South Korea, Japan, other countries that have been impacted with outbreaks from the coronavirus in Italy and other countries.  I think it's important to focus on the economic stimulus.  I agree with something that you said, actually, as we do this, that we give that direct aid to those small business owners and individuals who need it most and not just have it go to those who already are very well off.  I have concerns about the payroll tax approach that he's taking because it's not going to help people really who make under $25,000 a year.  It's not going to help people who are Uber drivers and who are working in the gig economy and who don't have an employer and are not affected in that way.  I think that it would be a more direct approach to take an emergency, put an emergency aid package together to provide a direct payment of a UBI to every single American in this time of crisis, given how broad the impact will be.  And the last thing I'll say that I didn't hear him address in his comments was about the testing.  We've seen how in countries like South Korea. ",
