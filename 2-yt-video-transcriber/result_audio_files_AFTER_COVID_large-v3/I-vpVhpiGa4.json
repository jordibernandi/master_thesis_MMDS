            "text": "welcome to the video about the insanely valuable presidential dollar errors that no one cares to look for.  inaugural edition since we are talking about the presidential golden dollar coins that are just truly unloved and just reviled in the coin community.  and i'm telling you for those of you that are thinking that same premise i think you're making a huge greatly huge mistake.  Just think about this for one second.  About how many of these have we found or seen in the last year?  Keep in mind, we are in 2020, people.  And I can honestly say I haven't seen a few or any of these coming out of a cash register.  I don't even bother to ask for these at the bank.  And now that I've done tons of research and I've had the time to actually gather data, I'm thinking to myself, what in the world, the money just flying around this presidential coin dollar series, all because of one very specific error that exists.  As we all know, there's a ton of presidents to collect, right?  But this error exists on about 30% of all the presidents, while there are a ton of others that have yet to be discovered.  The average sales price for a lot of these new discovery coins is like between $2,500 and $4,000.  I'm like, why aren't more people looking through these presidential dollar coins for the missing edge lettering error?  All right.  Did you guys know that there was edge lettering on these coins?  Let's go ahead and take a quick look at the design of the coins.  Okay.  So here's the George Washington.  which was released in 2007.  But nowhere on the front or the back of the coin do you see the date 2007.  All right, so how do you know it's 2007?  Well, it's real simple.  For this particular design, this denomination of coin, the presidential dollar series, there's actually lettering on the edge of the coin.  Okay, and I actually have an image of that that we're going to see here momentarily.  But the George Washington, of course, the number one coin to be released from this program, and it went into succession all the way until Ronald Reagan, which is the last coin released in the series.  That is the progression of the entire series.  And it spanned from 2007 to 2016, all right?  And there were four designs released every year.  Now... Let's go ahead and talk about a few of the kind of like, I guess, boring details about the series.  So from 2007 to 2011, the coins were released into circulation as normal, okay?  As if, you know, we're gonna release them, you guys are gonna spend them.  They're called business strikes, all right?  And these are coins that were intended for being used in commerce.  From 2012, because of waning popularity, The U.S.  Mint had decided we're going to do something called NIFC for the remaining four years or whatever it is of the presidential dollar series.  What that acronym means is not intended for circulation, okay?  This sounds very similar to what they did with the Kennedy half dollars.  Nobody was using these things.  They were big and cumbersome and bulky in your pocket.  If you had like 10 bucks worth... So what they did was they NIFC'd the last four years of the presidential dollar series.  Now these coins were only from that point forward available through the U.S.  Mint as a collectible item.  Now I did some research and found that these coins in 2012 when they were converted over to a full retail item, a collector item, is that they sold them in full rolls of 25 coins.  for $32.95.  They sold them in bags of 100, where if you've ever bought a bag of 100 coins of anything from the mint, they come out in really horrible shape when you get them, all right, because they're loose in a bag.  Those were available for $111.95 at the time.  And then finally, they also came in boxes of 250 coins.  That's $250 face worth.  and those were available for 275.95. all right so there's a little bit of premium associated.  okay very few people actually bought these things but eventually i believe that they sold out or they distributed whatever leftovers out into circulation even though these were intended to be sold on the mint website.  now what did that do to the vintage?  okay that's gonna be a question that a lot of you have.  the george washington had an astronomical vintage.  okay combined the philadelphia endeavor minted coins they exceeded 330 total million pieces which is a lot it's a ton okay.  and then the vintage just gradually dropped.  okay as a matter of fact.  in 2008 a lot of the coins uh fell sub 100 million.  okay as a matter of fact the uh uh to give you an idea the van buren presidential dollar coin was around 50 million per okay.  and then we got to the nifcs and they dropped under 10 million.  okay we're talking pretty scarce quantities for each one of the presidents but it really didn't matter because nobody wanted to touch them.  these were you not as popular compared to regular cash or paying with a card.  And that's why these things fell out of popularity.  Now let's go ahead and talk about that missing edge lettering.  This is what the coin would look like with the edge lettering on there.  Okay, there's a There's a type A and type B. What that really means is the orientation of the lettering on the edge could be right side up or it could be upside down.  But some of them are more common than the other and they're still plentiful in both ways.  um what is included on the edge?  okay we have the date we have the mid mark e pluribus unum and the motto in god we trust are all on the edge of the coin.  okay and that's how these are produced.  okay you won't find any of this other information on either side of the coin.  um upon release it was wildly popular okay.  and then The George Washington, of course, being that there was over 330 million pieces made, was hot stuff at the time of release.  People were talking about it.  It was all over the media.  Not because of the coin release, but because of this.  coins that exhibited the missing edge lettering.  So nobody really knew whether these coins at the time were released from the Philadelphia Mint, which would be my favorite pick on all this, or the Denver Mint.  So as you can see, this particular George Washington coin on screen is devoid of any information on the edge of the coin, and that was the big mistake.  based on the way that these were produced and manufactured uh... some of the big time error gurus like uh... fred weinberg fully believes that all the other presidents will have the same issue missing edge lettering and sure enough a lot of them do.  but These coins are not being searched, so that's why only 30% of the entire presidential run has missing edge lettering attributed, while the other 70% are still floating out there.  Maybe there's a couple examples, maybe there's a few hundred or many thousands.  like the George Washington missing edge lettering.  It is the most common to find the missing edge lettering, even today, if you went through full rolls or in change or whatever, wherever you're lucky enough to find these coins anyways.  The bank vaults will have a ton of these.  I have a few banks nearest me that have bags of these that they cannot simply move.  So these are very much available at a lot of banks.  There are some banks that don't have them.  They actually paid to get them pushed out.  They went back to the Fed Reserve and there they sit in the bank vaults.  I also wanted to talk about the five most valuable presidential dollar coins with the missing edge lettering that's confirmed.  Okay, and some of these have some really low pops, as in how many are in existence at the highest grade levels.  So the first one is the Calvin Coolidge.  All right, this one right here is a 2014.  So this one is a NIFC coin, which was only made available through the US Mint website.  The highest confirmed graded example of a missing edge lettering coin is Mint State 65.  There is one at that grade level and it has a guide value of $2,500.  It's quite a bit of money, all right, for something that not a lot of people actually know that this exists or probably has passed through it.  i will say this the nifcs are out in circulation.  people have spent these.  they are out there.  i have come across ronald reagan's some of the more obscure presidents like mckinley and harding and fdr and you name it.  i found quite a few of these nifcs.  they are out there and they're in the bags.  all right.  so this is the first one.  that's the most about one of the more valuable ones and they're in no particular order.  The next one is Grover Cleveland.  This one is a 2012.  It's the first date of the NIFCs.  This one right here, the highest assigned grade value is Mid-State 65.  There are only three at that grade level and it has a guide value of $2,000.  And the next one is the James Madison.  Now this one right here was part of that first year of release.  One of the more popular ones.  Quite a few of these were made in 2007 as a matter of fact.  84.5 million were made from Philadelphia and 87.7 million from Denver.  So there's quite a few of these.  The highest graded example is MidState 67 for a missing edge lettering.  Only one exists at that grade level.  It's got a guide value of $4,000.  And then one of the more expensive coins on the group is actually a Thomas Jefferson.  It's 2007.  It's part of the first year of release.  This one right here, the highest assigned grade is Mid-State 68.  These were actually produced at a really nice quality compared to some of the other ones from 2007.  Only one exists, and it's 68.  And this one has a guide value of $6,500 with the missing edge lettering.  And finally, one of the last kind of like most valuable is actually one of the most plentiful, the George Washington.  Most common with missing edge lettering is just being able to find a super high grade example is tough.  All right, just because this one was widely circulated, they were thrown. ",
