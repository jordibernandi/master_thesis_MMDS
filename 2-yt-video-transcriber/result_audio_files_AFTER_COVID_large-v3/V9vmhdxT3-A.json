            "text": "Thank you.  24-19 what?  On Christiana.  That's it.  On Christiana?  I know the street.  I know the house.  I didn't know the street.  Okay.  So you're dropping him off?  Yeah.  And you're coming from Indiana?  Yeah.  And he visits you in Indiana, so you come over here to pick him up?  No, we're just driving.  You're just driving?  Your answers are cryptic at best.  Okay.  Do you have anything illegal in the vehicle?  No.  Do I have consent to search your vehicle?  No.  Okay.  Step out of the vehicle?  Yes, sir.  Get out of the vehicle, sir.  Just so you know, either way it goes, I'm going to call K-9 to sniff the vehicle out anyway.  That's fine.  Okay.  You don't have to raise it up.  We're not going anywhere at the moment.  Let's just have it.  All right.  Get out of the vehicle.  Yes, get out of the vehicle.  We're all getting out.  Robert, we're relocating.  Go to the trunk.  Put your hands on the trunk, please.  Shut the door, sir.  Madison and Wilson.  Okay.  Before you get on, we're 22 on the clock.  There's no open containers.  Oh, what?  There's the consent.  What are you talking about?  Put your hands on the car, man.  Go ahead.  Go through the vehicle.  There's open containers.  We don't need his consent now.  By the way, we're recording you.  You're on body cam.  That's fine.  So the fact that now the open alcohol containers are in the vehicle.  Okay.  You don't even drink alcohol.  Okay.  That's not alcohol?  There you go.  I'm good.  Now you had me scared, so I was like, shit, I know that ain't me.  Okay.  When I opened the door, something spilled out there, too.  Unlock the car.  Do you have the keys?  Yeah.  Unlock it from that side.  Unlock the side and go search.  That's okay.  I'm not searching.  I'm not searching.  Why do you need to get in there, though?  Because I can open it to look at what's in plain view.  I don't need your permission for that.  He's got an open door.  Are you worried about him?  Yeah, I think he is.  I just don't like searching.  Why would they bother you if you're not doing anything wrong?  I don't like standing in this neighborhood.  Well, you're driving through here in the first place, aren't you?  Be honest, guys.  We'll be honest.  It'll work out out better.  Either way it goes, I'm going to let you know right now.  I'm going to call for K-9, and they're going to find something.  If you make me wait for K-9 and they find something, I'm going to hit you with every single charge, including trafficking across state lines.  So, again, do you have anything in this vehicle that I need to know about?  I don't have anything.  Anything.  And I'm not consenting to it, sir.  You don't need to.  Once a K-9 gets here and sniffs it out, if they give me a positive hit, we're tearing the vehicle apart regardless.  Okay.  Okay?  So you have nothing in here?  There's nothing in here.  Okay.  You want to call for K-9?  All right.  I'm going to run them first.  You got ID on you, man?  Yeah.  You got any weapons or anything on you?  No.  Okay.  Give me your wrist.  So where are you from in Indiana?  Valparaiso.  Valparaiso.  Is this Carmack and Avers?  Do we have a place to go in?  I mean, I saw them shuffling around and stuck something on their seat while we got there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  Can you, you want to call?  Okay, I'll call.  Yeah, yeah.  11-22, Robert.  But anybody nearby has an I-bond by any chance?  Hey, Sarge, quick question.  Me and Andrew got a traffic stop over here on Sir Mac and Avers.  Out-of-state guys from Indiana, they're real shifty.  I verbally asked for a consensus search of vehicle, and he said no, and that's fine.  That's his right.  But I can call for a canine, but when Andrew were coming up to the car, when Andrew were coming up to the car, I saw them, I saw him like stuffing something under the seat, but I don't know if for a moment it would be enough later on if we find something for the state's attorney to not be like, oh, you know, well.  Right.  Right, he's out of the car now, but I just want to run it past you because like I said, I'm on camera now.  I want to make sure.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, cool.  I just wanted to make sure, Sarge.  I thought so, but I just wanted to get your blessing before I went in and did that.  All right, thanks, Sarge.  I appreciate it.  Bye-bye.  1096, Robert.  1196, Robert.  Marquette, 96, Robert.  Squad, can you hold us on a traffic stop on Surmec and Avers?  Surmec and Avers, all right.  All right, so... We're going to go ahead and do it based on the furtive moment.  Now, because of the shifting and everything that I saw going on when we came out of the vehicle and we pulled you over and all the movements I saw making, I'm letting you know.  And it's on camera, so if you want to make a complaint later on, feel free to do so, but we're searching your vehicle.  I got off the phone with my supervisor.  I let him know what's going on.  He's backing us up.  I want it on camera because you're being recorded right now, and I'm letting you know that the vehicle is getting searched because of your movements when we got out of the vehicle.  I don't know if you're trying to conceal a weapon or what it is, okay?  And then my subsequent questioning of you about where you're coming from, where you're on your way to, and your vague and cryptic answers just make me even more suspicious, okay?  So affirmative movements mean basically you're making an attempt to conceal something or you're just basically trying to hide something.  That's what that means, okay?  10-22 Robert, go ahead ma'am.  Alright, Douglas Park, gonna be on the long box.  Can I get an event number for lunch at Grand and Western?  00851, 00851.  10-32, Robert.  10-32, Robert.  10-32, Robert.  10-32, Robert.  10-32, Robert.  Robert.  Yeah, I'm not.  Coming away.  Yeah.  What's this for?  For the seatbelt cutter.  Is that what it is?  Is this what you're trying to conceal when we came up?  No.  No.  That one's just a seat cover.  It's damaging to the, I don't know, the crew.  They're just in the car just in case they ever need something.  Okay.  No.  I did get robbed one time.  That's two years ago.  But I don't, but there's nothing.  when you're, when someone comes at you with a gun, you ain't doing hooks with them.  No, you're not.  Nope.  That's just more.  So is that why you were trying to conceal it?  No, I wasn't concealing anything.  Okay.  So now you want to get off my head.  What?  What?  What do you need razor blades for?  Those I bought when I had to take, I had to scrape up and off the window.  You bought these?  I used the one.  11-4, Robert.  11-12, Robert.  These fucking seats are stuck, and it makes me wonder why.  11-10, Robert.  I think I'm reporting to you.  11-10, Robert.  Robert, I copy.  Oh, yeah?  And the Stanley, I think they were on sale at Walmart, like five bucks.  Looks like it had a bunch of stuff you could potentially use.  You got anything in the trunk I need to know about?  No, sir.  You sure?  Positive.  So here's my thing.  If those knives are the only thing you have in the car, then what's the problem?  Nothing.  I don't know.  I didn't even think of the knife.  Again, I'm not, you know... You should think of them because they can get you shot.  Especially that big-ass knife.  There's no way that you can think that that's legal.  There's no fucking way.  Well, I basically had it for the seat belt thing.  If something happens... where you need to cut yourself out of a seat belt, you ain't going to be cutting yourself out of a seat belt anyway.  You're right, yeah.  So I don't buy it.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yes, sir.  All right, gentlemen, look.  This is what's going on, all right?  I don't know how they do things in Indiana, but in the state of Illinois, this can get you locked up.  All right.  So.  They're doing a park check at Douglas right now.  Yeah.  There's no way.  There's no way.  you think I'm going to let you leave with this.  So I can either lock you up for me.  I can lock you up for it.  What do you want to do?  You want me to dispose of it?  Because I'm not taking it.  All right.  Like he said, if I'm in a situation where I have to break the window, I probably wouldn't go anywhere.  I'm not taking your Leatherman, though, because I don't want your Leatherman.  I don't want your knives, either.  Even the little one?  The smaller one?  Do you think you can kill somebody with this?  I don't know.  Well, the answer is yes.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to write the move?  They can stay there.  They weren't completely cooperative so they could work.  It's in the car in the PDT.  Both of them.  The mics don't sync.  There's a ticket number for it.  Yeah, that's a big knife.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do.  Yeah, I don't want this shit.  I got my own knife.  I wish there was a manhole covered big enough.  Log in.  It was right at the roll, but the roll caught me long as fuck.  So I'll say about 11.15.  Because then the inspector came in, too. ",
