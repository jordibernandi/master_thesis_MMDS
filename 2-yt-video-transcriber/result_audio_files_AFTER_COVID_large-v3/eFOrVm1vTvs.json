            "text": "There are thousands of videos on YouTube about people having rapture dreams and predicting the rapture will happen in 2020.  But could this be part of the great deception?  It's time to learn the lies.  Hey, welcome to UNLEARN.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we UNLEARN the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Now let's get started.  Right now, there are many people talking about the Rapture.  They understand we are living in the last days, and the current events seem to be lining up with what the Bible says will happen before the Tribulation.  And since they believe the rapture will happen before the tribulation, they conclude the rapture will be soon.  My concern is that these rapture teachings might be part of the great deception that Yeshua warned would happen before the tribulation.  Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately saying, Tell us, when will these things be?  And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?  And Jesus answered and said to them, take heed that no one deceives you for many will come in my name saying i am the christ and will deceive many.  the greek word translated deceive here is planeo which means to cause to wander to lead astray to deceive to deviate from the correct path.  to deceive means to lead astray.  yeshua said take heed that no one deceives you for many will come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many.  Many will come in Jesus' name saying that Jesus is the Christ, but they will lead people astray.  If someone came to you and said, Jesus is a phony, you need to follow Buddha instead, No Christian would be led astray by that.  There's no need to warn us about that.  But, if someone claims to follow Christ, yet they lead people to a wrong belief about Christ, that's a huge danger.  Yeshua warned us several times about false prophets indicating the danger they pose in possibly deceiving the elect.  Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.  For false Christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.  See, I have told you beforehand.  There are a lot of Christians claiming to be prophets, claiming to have prophetic dreams or prophetic words about the rapture.  They're all telling people the rapture is going to happen before the tribulation.  But the Bible tells us something very different.  Yeshua said he will gather his people after the tribulation.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.  The stars will fall from the heaven.  and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And he will send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the  other.\".  So how can these people be speaking prophetically about the rapture coming before the tribulation if Yeshua said he's gathering his people after the tribulation.  Paul also gave us a warning not to believe people who are pointing to Christ gathering his people before the great falling away or before the Antichrist sits on the throne.  sits in the temple claiming himself to be God.  Now brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we ask you not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come.  let no one deceive you by any means for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first and the man of sin is revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself.  above all that is called god or that is worshiped so that he sits as god in the temple of god showing himself that he is god.  so the great falling away will happen first And the man of sin, the Antichrist, sits in the temple of God claiming to be God before Christ comes to gather his people.  So is it possible that the pre-tribulation rapture is part of the great deception?  Yeshua said, Take heed that no one deceives you, for many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many.
