The reason that empathy is bad for politics is because it leads you to empathize with people that you are more likely to like as opposed to people you don't like.  Okay, so first of all, the pitch for empathy is actually \u2013 there have been several books that are written on this, social science books, talking about how empathy is not actually \u2013 the best thing for politics.  It actually almost deactivates the reasoning centers of your brain.  Because when you're empathetic, you don't actually create good policy.  This doesn't mean that feeling sympathy for people is a bad thing.  It means that if empathy is what drives your policymaking, you're probably not acting in a rational fashion.  But the real goal here is, of course, not to generate empathy.  The real goal here is to suggest that if you disagree with the idea that America is systemically and institutionally racist, you're not an empathetic person, and therefore you're a bad, cruel, and callous person.  The idea is that empathy is really a moral statement about what kind of good person you are.  And you can't watch baseball until you say it along with Morgan Freeman.  You can't.  You can't just watch a game and be distracted, which is the goal of sports. ",

            "text": "Wow.  So that's a lot to go over there in the traditional Ben Shapiro fashion.  He has spoken rather quickly.  I feel like we're going to have to break this down point by point.  So let's address the central thesis of this, that empathy is bad for politics.  No.  Empathy essentially is the ability to put yourself in other people's shoes.  It is an essential tool to understand the state other people exist in, and as a person who creates policy for other people, your ability to empathize with their living situation is essential, as it so happens, to your ability to be a good politician.  See, What's that quote?  I forget who said it.  It was an Enlightenment thinker, I believe.  Reason must stem or must be downwind of the passions or something like that.  People like to... This is something that edgelords like to do.  Like high school... Right now, Ben's kind of channeling the high school 13-year-old vibe.  I haven't seen this clip before.  I just saw this for you... This is the first time I've actually seen the clip.  Anytime I see a clip of Ben Shapiro, I'm confident I can find something in it to make fun of, and I'm always right in that respect.  So I'm running this off the cuff.  But right now, Ben Shapiro is very much being the 13-year-old edgelord, you know?  He hasn't had sex.  Actually, he did brag about being a virgin until marriage.  That tracks.  Probably hasn't talked with many girls.  He probably thinks girls are kind of dumb for the most part.  Probably thinks that if he were president, he could just fix all the issues, you know?  He could just solve everything himself.  And I remember being a 13-year-old boy.  And when I was a 13-year-old boy, this is how I thought.  I thought there were two distinct things.  I thought there were feelings... And I thought there was logic.  And that they were two distinct things.  And that people who had lots of logic, or sorry, this was the hand I used for logic, who had lots of logic were good.  And people who had lots of feelings are, if not bad, at least, you know, intellectually deficient.  That's what I thought.  Now, here's the issue with that.  See, the argument usually is we intake information from our world, we empirically derive data from our senses, and then we can do two things with those data.  We can react to them in sort of an emotive way, or we can process them and try to arrive at conclusions through a rational sort of process.  The issue is, and here's the thing these types always forget, people's feelings are also a part of objective reality.  If a person is sad, the fact that they are sad is empirically measurable.  now of course what does sad mean?  it can get you know muddy but the fact that they are sad or if a person is hungry or if a person feels neglected on the social level these are things which are um empirically verifiable.  let me give you an example because how can you measure feelings?  it's an excellent question.  close your eyes for a second, if you will.  I'll do it with you, okay?  Close your eyes, and now think.  How would you describe the color blue to a blind person?  You can open your eyes.  How would you describe it?  Water?  Why would they have any association between water and blue?  You can give them emotions or items or things that you associate with blue, but you can't actually give them the sensory experience of blue.  It's not actually possible.  And what you'll find is that's the case with a lot of stuff.  For example, let's say you're a child psychologist and your job is to determine the extent to which people in a given community abuse their children.  Okay, rough work, but that is a real thing a person could do.  How would you determine abuse?  Say you're not working from existing texts.  You're not working from existing child psychiatry readings.  You're trying to determine abuse through your own processes.  How would you determine that exactly?  What level of stomach, you know, how empty does your stomach have to be and for how long?  Do you create a formula for it?  How hungry does a person have to be?  What level of pain is reasonable?  How wide the stick are they struck with?  If you actually think about it, qualifying what abuse means is almost infinitely complicated, but intuitively understandable by almost all of us.  I guarantee you, if I sat you motherfuckers down in a chair, gave you a pen and pencil, pen and pencil, pen and paper, you could not give me anything even close to a comprehensive understanding of what abuse means.  But with equal assurance, I say, I could show you the living situations of 10 children, and you could reliably pick which of those 10 are being abused.  Do you agree with me?  The secret to this, this magic that allows us to pull information without strictly adhering to hard empirical data, is empathy.  Empathy crosses that bridge because we know what we would feel like in that situation.  And by projecting ourselves onto them, we can see through our projected experience what abuse might look like in that situation.  Now, it's not a perfect tool for arriving at conclusions.  Ideally, an empathetic analysis should be tempered with a fuckton of data.  But this is how we determine whether a group of people are underprivileged.  This is how we determine a lot of stuff that we use policy to address.  How often have you heard the conservative politician talk about the death of small-town America, the death of rural America?  How often have you heard them talk about boarded up windows and shuttered shop doors?  Heard them talk about no one buying from local businesses anymore?  Heard them talk about cities eating up all the wealth and manpower?  Do they qualify this with a comprehensive empirical analysis of all of the characteristics that go into the death of small-town America?  Or do they rely, as politicians often do, on a collective empathetic understanding of what it must be like to live in those circumstances.  Ben Shapiro, my friend, you are being a 13-year-old boy, Ben Shapiro.  You are not considering the fact that empathy is an essential tool in understanding and appropriately responding to Social, oh God, I mean everything, but yeah, social problems.  So with that in mind, and I'm sorry, I know that was a little bit long-winded.  I recognize that.  But I think that understanding the importance of empathy, even in a rigorous data-driven context, is very, very, very important.  Without it, we could not make the determinations.  We could.  Here's an experiment.  Really quick, before we get back to the video, here's an experiment I want you to do.  I want you to have a simple 30-second conversation with a friend, family member, whatever.  Just any conversation.  And then I want you to think in your head how much implicit understanding both you and your conversational partner read into that.  How little the conversation was about the words you used and how much of it was about your shared interpretive understanding of the language you chose to partake in.  What you'll find is most conversations have very little to do with your actual words and everything to do with the subtext underneath that language.  And the only reason we're capable of understanding that subtext is because through empathy, we can project ourselves onto the experience of the listener, the looking glass self, or you can Google that if you'd like, I suppose, if you want to LARP as me circa 2017 doing sociology homework.  The words you use are as important as the subtext, though?  I think it largely depends.  When you say, for example, hi, how's it going?  To a person walking by you who you're just meeting, the words are almost irrelevant.  You could say almost anything.  What's up?  Hey, howdy.  You could say almost anything.  The words are largely irrelevant.  The greeting, the semantic meaning, or the pragmatic meaning, I'm sorry, not the semantic meaning, is largely what takes precedence.  But of course, if you're writing like a technical, like... technical document, then obviously the words would be almost exclusively the important thing.  The point I'm getting at is that it's important.  So with that being said, let's return once more to Ben Shitpiro.  and we can address these points. ",

It's the mechanism that results in including people in in-groups and othering them in out-groups, in which case you can then feel morally allowed to be sadistic towards them.  Think Blair White's Uncle Tom's.  I don't think empathy is exclusively the mechanism that allows people to engage in tribalism.  But as I said, you should always temper empathy with as much data as you can get.  Absolutely.  But that means, nonetheless, it doesn't change the fact that empathy remains an essential tool in reasoning out social situations and even policymaking.  So I responded to you and to Ben Shapiro there. ",

What if empathy has led you to believe that the circumstances of poor Americans are untenable, they're unethical, and that something should be done about it, and you're going to create policy to address that?  Is that bad?  Now, obviously, you should use data to reinforce, A, whatever actual policy decisions you're going to make, and B, your understanding of what qualifies as a poor person.

If you say you're a heartless monster, what they hear is... Wow.  Your data and rigorous adherence to logic defied me so substantially that you are unable to come up with any greater an impugnant of my character than to suggest that my adherence to logic defies your irrational, emotive response to the situation thusforth.
