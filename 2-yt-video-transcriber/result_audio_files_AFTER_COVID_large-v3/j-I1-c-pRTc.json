            "text": "So I just seen on Fox News that my president and still your president, Donald J. Trump, and it feels good to say that, still, was at Mount Rushmore yesterday, and surprise, surprise, all these protesters were out there whining and crying.  Look, you Indians need to just get over it, okay?  Because the United States government gave you that land a long time ago, and then they took it back.  I don't know what that's called.  Somebody should create a phrase for that where you give somebody something and then you take it back.  But I digest.  My ancestors stole that land fair and square.  And if these Native Americans don't like it, they can go back to where they came from.  And they even tear gassed the protesters before Trump got there, which is how you know he's on his way now.  You know, back in the day, they used to say, hear ye, hear ye.  But now you just see a tear gas canister fly in, and you realize you shouldn't be in that McDonald's drive-thru.  Mount Rushmore is sacred, and that's what these Native Americans don't seem to understand.  You know, you got George Washington.  He was our first president.  Thomas Jefferson, he wrote that thing Nicolas Cage is always trying to steal.  Abraham Lincoln, he won that war that me and a bunch of people seem to forget the South lost, and you got Teddy Roosevelt.  He's the Ringo of the group, and you go there, and you look up, and you just stand in awe.  You know, and you got those four giant pale faces looking down on you, and it just makes you wonder how big they would have made their peckers had they not run out of mountain, but Mount Rushmore is sacred, and it's one of the... It is one of the most beautiful gift shops I have ever been to.  And it's not as good as the 9-11 one, but it's pretty good.  And that's how you can tell stuff is sacred in our country by how good the gift shop is.  You know, I'm sure George Washington was crossing the Delaware thinking, God damn, I hope I get a refrigerator magnet out of this.  So you people need to leave Mount Rushmore alone.  It's sacred.  It's what our forefathers would have wanted.  Where do you think we even got that phrase to begin with?  There's four of them up there.  So leave Mount Rushmore alone.  Now get off my property. ",
