            "text": "I want to talk about the state of the left and break it down into two parts.  Part number one is Bernie Sanders had an experience in 2016 when he was sidelined, which WikiLeaks revealed by the shenanigans of the DNC.  Instead, he went on knowing full well, and I talked to Glenn Greenwald about this, and he was very adamant about talking about this point, that he knew full well what the mainstream corporate billionaire media class would do, which you alluded to earlier in our interview.  And he also knew how the establishment would attack him in 2020.  And yet he decided to, Boris Sanders decided to try to influence change within the democratic apparatus.  How do you view Bernie Sanders?  Is he part of some criticism as well, or should we just attribute it to external factors like the media and the DNC?  So that's part one of the question.  Part two of the question is a recent discussion I had with Paul Jay, and Paul Jay said the problem with the left today is that we don't have a vision when we talk about Medicare for all.  Well, we have Medicare for all in Canada and Germany, but there's still child poverty in both of these countries.  I know from Germany, there's a huge sector of people who get paid very minimum wages.  It's called the minimum wage sector, as they say it.  So let me summarize the two questions.  Number one, do you think Bernie Sanders... should receive some criticism.  And part two, do you think left intellectuals of the left overall has failed to provide a vision to the population? ",

            "text": "So in 2016, I did an event with Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein, and the socialist city councilwoman from Seattle, Shama Sawant.  And Shama pushed Bernie before the event.  I was there as to why he wouldn't run as an independent.  arguing correctly that we were never going to build an effective political movement in an election cycle, and we were not going to build it within the confines of the Democratic Party.  Sanders' answer was that he didn't want to become Ralph Nader.  What did that mean?  What does it mean? ",

            "text": "Right.  Ralph Nader is a was a great consumer advocate who exposed corporate power, the misuse of corporate power, wrote a series of, he was never in office, but he built a very powerful grassroots movement, wrote most of our major environmental law, the Mining Safety Act, the Clean Water Act, these 24 pieces of legislation to protect workers and the environment.  got a liberal wing of the Democratic Party to pass it through and make it law.  And then, of course, with the corporate coup d'etat, to quote John Ralston Saul, that took over American politics, the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was destroyed.  It existed only in rhetoric, not in actuality.  Nader ran for president several times.  He actually did quite well in 2000, getting almost 5% of the vote.  The Democratic Party had to destroy him.  They were terrified.  I was Nader's speechwriter then.  And they did.  They turned him into a pariah.  And that's what Sanders meant.  He knew the Democratic Party machine would destroy him.  They would mount an intensive campaign to deny him his Senate seat.  That's what they did to McGovern.  People forget George McGovern, the last Democratic nominee to take on the military industrial establishment.  He took on the animal agriculture industry, and I would tell all your viewers to become vegan if they care about climate change, which is why I became vegan, and held hearings about the carcinogens and the danger of animal-based products as the mainstay of your diet.  And they pushed him out of his Senate seat in South Dakota.  so that Bernie knew what they would do and he wasn't wrong.  Uh, and so he, uh, I think naively believe that, uh, in the period between 2016 and 2020, he would be a loyal party, uh, uh, member, uh, which he was, he was endorsing all sorts of neoliberal democratic candidates who espoused economic positions that he claims to be dead set against.  Uh, And of course, after the nomination, when many of his people walked out of the I was at in Philadelphia with Cornel West, we were in a march with homeless people, several thousand homeless people surrounding the Democratic National Convention Center, appropriately named the Wells Fargo Center.  And so.  Cornell said quite presciently to me, you know, Bernie missed his historical moment.  Bernie should have walked out and he should have spent the intervening years building a third party movement.  Would he have succeeded?  I mean, having worked with Ralph and seeing how dirty they play, probably not.  But he would have been able to begin to build something.  Uh, instead he, uh, he became a tool of the democratic party, which of course on the eve of the, uh, South Carolina was the South or North Carolina, uh, primary, uh, under Barack Obama's direction turned on him.  Uh, he knew the dirty tricks, as you pointed out, uh, the whole democratic national committee was fixed against him in 2016 and yet he said nothing.  It was left to Donna Brazil, uh, who had been the, you know, to expose it.  And I think it was political cowardice.  And now, of course, he's telling his supporters to vote for Biden.  I don't think he was.  So, yeah, I think it was a miscalculation, a belief that somehow the Democratic Party establishment would ever allow him to be the nominee.  And as as he was surging at the beginning, they made it clear what they would do.  He was never going to get enough votes.  One thousand nine hundred and something on the first round.  And in the second round, you have, quote unquote, superdelegates, I think there's 700 of them, who are appointed by the party.  They're all lobbyists and party officials.  So it was always fixed.  And Bernie just wanted to be part of the club.  I mean, one of the reasons Bernie didn't go after Biden on the campaign trail is because socially, especially his wife, Jane Sanders, they're friends with the Bidens.  And so, yeah, I think Bernie failed us.  And we don't have any time left.  I mean, because of climate change, things are deteriorating at a rate that even climate scientists never predicted.  We can't fool around.  Do we vote for Biden?  Do we vote for Trump?  Given the ecocide that is before us and the economic devastation that is weeks and months away, these kinds of questions are kind of absurd.  We have to begin to do what Extinction Rebellion is doing, which is shut the damn system down.  And even that may not work. ",

It does seem that when we talk within the left, there's a lot of criticism about our society, and rightfully so, but there's no way to go forward.  Do you think that's been the case with the left? ",

            "text": "Well, I think the left in Europe and the left in the United States are two different entities.  The left in Europe, and you still have communist parties in Europe, fairly strong in France and Italy.  You have the Workers Party.  I'm not an expert on Germany, and I'm not going to pretend that, but you do have that, what did they pull about, what, 5%?  The Labour Party.  I mean, I think the United States is in far worse shape than Europe.  We had a very powerful socialist movement.  which was just utterly decimated and destroyed over the last century.  The whole red scare, the red baiting until the you know, what what constituted the American left was essentially the Cold War liberal, you know, the person who was kind of liberal on social values, but hawkish in terms of defense and empire.  And if you weren't if you didn't fit within that paradigm, you were shut out.  You still are shut out.  That's why Chomsky shut out.  Chomsky is given no platform.  When I worked at The New York Times, the the the editor had actually banned Chomsky's name from even even if it had something to do with linguistics from the newspaper.  So there is no American left.  The European left is anemic and weak.  but it's far healthier than where we are.  And that's what's so frightening, because as we now head towards an economic decline that will certainly rival what we saw in the 1930s, we don't have those forces that we had in the 1930s, including the Communist Party, which gets written out of American history, that was able to build workers and into militant unions and fight back.  And it's all gone.  And of course, that empowers the very forces within the society that under the rubric of a kind of Christianized fascism will take power.  People forget that Trump has an ideological void.  Trump doesn't believe in anything.  You know, he's just a narcissist.  But that ideological vacuum has been filled by the Christian fascists.  That's Pence.  That's Pompeo.  That's Barr.  That's Betsy DeVos.  There was an article in The New York Times a couple of weeks ago about Betsy DeVos's brother, Eric Prince, who founded Blackwater, who uses these for profit mercenaries.  He was caught infiltrating like teachers unions in the United States.  I mean, that's kind of our equivalent of the brown shirts.  And I wrote a book on the Christian right called American fascists the Christian right and the war in America And I did not use the word fascist lightly, especially since I graduated from Harvard Divinity School and grew up in the church.  their heretics they've fused the iconography and language of American Nationality with a Christian religion just as the German Christian Church did under the Nazis.  and indeed my great mentor at Harvard and James Luther Adams was in Germany in 1935 and 1936 until he was expelled by the Gestapo, working with a confessing church, and saw, long before any of us did, the eerie and frightening similarities between the Christian right and the German Christian church, which of course was outlawed in Germany after the war.  So America is in serious, serious trouble because of The seizure of power by corporate interests, the evisceration of our civil liberties under judicial fiat.  So, you know, you have this largely through terrorism laws that have been set up initially to go after Muslims who have been seriously persecuted in the United States, but then are then used against everybody, environmental activists, animal rights act, anybody.  and a country where the pretense of democratic participation is rapidly being replaced by, you know, the heel of the boot.  It's especially if you go into poor areas of the United States, it's very frightening and very ugly.  I mean, we have militarized police in Kevlar vests, a thousand citizens in the United States are killed, not to mention hundreds more shot and wounded by police every year, and almost all of them are unarmed.  This is not reported.  I mean, the poor in the United States, who now constitute statistically half the country, live in either poverty or near poverty, have been rendered invisible by corporate media.  Nobody sees that.  I mean, I did a book with Joe Sacco.  We spent two years on.  it called days of destruction, days of revolt, written out of the poorest pockets of the United States, including places like Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and Indian Reservation, where the average life expectancy for a male is 48.  That's the lowest in the Western Hemisphere outside of Haiti, and where 60% of the people don't have running water.  This is the United States.  It's not the United States, the corporate media, which seeks advertising dollars.  And is and of course, is dominated by huge corporations like Viacom and generally shows to the American public.  But but having traveled around this country for all of my books, I report on all my books.  It is it.  you know, there are huge sections of the United States that might as well be the developing world.  with those disparities.  I used to live in Latin America.  I used to live in Miraflores in Lima, Peru, which is villas that look like they could be in Miami, except the walls are higher and they have concertina wire on them.  And then 10 blocks away, families are squatting in hovels next to open sewers.  I mean, that's what the United States is now.  It's not what we're becoming.  It's what we are. ",
