            "text": "When I was little, my father was famous.  He was the greatest samurai in the empire.  Hey everybody, my name is Jerry Williams, aka Greater Sapien.  Thanks for stopping by.  Today's video I hope will be relatively short.  It's going to be a response to some of the comments I got on my last couple videos.  My Kobe Bryant video and my conspiracy flat earth commentary video.  And mainly because a lot of the comments I got were negative.  Probably a disproportionate number of comments were negative.  Not that I mind, but I found it an interesting proportion.  So first off, the comments about Pepe.  I got a lot of reactions to the Pepe the penguin, and I referred to Pepe the frog and its connection to white supremacy.  I found it amazing how many comments I got energetically defending Pepe the frog.  And that's fine, but I just found it very interesting the amount of energy people have over this poorly drawn meme character.  It's fascinating.  Very personally, they take it upon themselves that they have some ownership of it and that they're very offended by the idea that I was connecting it to white supremacy.  and how dare I allow them to take this thing that's ours.  One commenter said that if you give that to them, if you allow them to take it, you're just giving this over to them and it's ours and you can't give it over to them.  And... I just don't care about Pepe the Frog.  I just don't.  I have no emotional connection to Pepe the Frog in order to preserve it and feel like it's something worth preserving.  I understand that Pepe the Frog's origin have nothing to do with white supremacy.  It's meme related.  And I get that.  And the vast majority of it is used for that purpose.  But to deny that it has been co-opted by white supremacists is to act like these things don't exist.  Understand my experience.  I don't have the same experience with this meme character that many of you may have.  Many of you are probably part of these online communities, going on message boards, 4chan, whatever.  That's not me.  I don't have any of that experience.  If you've been following me for these last 8 or 10 years, you should know by now, that is not me.  So my only experience with Pepe the Frog... is when it was brought to me by a bunch of bigoted fuckers who were trying to insult me from their white supremacist point of view.  That's my experience with it, and it is a wholly valid experience.  I understand that it's not your experience, but that is mine, and it's wholly valid.  So when I say there is a connection between Pepe the, well, Pepe the penguin is connected to Pepe the frog, and Pepe the frog has a connection to white supremacy, I'm sorry, it just does.  I understand you don't like that fact, and that's not your experience, but it's mine, and I am wholly valid in discussing it that way.  Someone wrote that Pepe is only linked to white supremacists because normal people think it is.  No.  Pepe is linked to white supremacists because white supremacists have made it a part of their movement.  That's why it's connected.  It's not because normal people think it is.  It's because abnormal people have made use of it.  That's why it's connected.  So I'm not giving Pepe over to them.  Even if I was, I don't care.  I am not part of that meme culture.  I'm just not.  You don't see me going around spreading memes.  You don't see me sharing them on a regular basis.  It's not my thing.  I think memes are a shallow means of communication.  It's shallow thinking.  I think the humor of memes, those especially that use Pepe the Frog and that type of singular character being used over and over again with different dialogue in order to tell a joke, I find that juvenile, tiresome, and unfunny.  So honestly, I think that's why bigots like them.  It's real easy.  It's real easy to make a joke out of it.  It's real easy to send a message with it.  And that's just not my thing.  I'm sorry, I'm not gonna sit here and defend Pepe and try to preserve it because it's not a cultural icon that's worth preserving.  And some of you didn't like the fact that I made that connection and you've said that you're gonna unsub me for it.  That's okay.  If you unsub me because you don't like my opinion on Pepe the frog or Fepe the penguin, I won't lose any sleep.  I just won't.  I know it's not something that people on YouTube are supposed to say, that they're supposed to sit here and try to do what they can to please their subscribers.  And I've done to a certain degree.  I've got a whole other channel where I'll talk more about this type of thing because I get such blowback from people on this channel whenever I say something that's a personal opinion.  But I'm sorry.  You're not going to get defense of Pepe from me.  You're just not.  We're not from that same world.  So there you go.  The other thing I got a lot of blowback on was my Kobe video, which wasn't really even about Kobe.  It was just brought about because of... of Kobe's death.  I was already making a video.  I was planning on making a video.  And as I was getting my things together to do it, taking clips off of the internet that I had saved and pulling them together so I could look at them, the news broke.  And so since I knew I was putting that video out, I felt it would be disingenuous for me to act like it never even happened.  That's why it was brought up.  But the reaction I got from people was quite interesting.  And sad in its own way.  People came, you know, reacted to me and how dare I treat Kobe's death like it was somehow more important.  And these are people who supposedly watched the video where I said specifically that his death isn't more important than anyone else's.  I said that.  But no, people have to say, how dare you talk about this celebrity as if he's more important.  His death is no different than anybody else.  What about all these other people who have died?  What about the other people who died in that crash?  And these first responders who died here or people in the science and technology fields who have died?  What about them?  Why aren't you talking about them?  Get off your high horse and shut the fuck up.  You're not helping.  It's one, most likely you didn't even think about those other people's deaths until this celebrity died, and then you decided to bring them up as some type of counter.  That's what people like you do, in my experience.  But to say, what about these other people's death and how dare you act like?  this is more important, which I did not do, is also to act like, not to act like, it also shows that you don't understand how people think.  You just don't.  People personalize everything.  They see a tragedy, how they react to it generally is guided by how personal it is to them, how much of a personal attachment they have to it.  When there is a plane crash in another country, most people don't care.  unless there was an American on board, and I'm speaking as an American.  Most people in America don't care about a plane crash or a tornado somewhere, or even a bombing somewhere, unless an American died, because all of a sudden it's personal.  There's a connection, even if it's not real, there's a connection between them and the person that was involved in that tragedy.  That's how people work.  It's not right, but that's how people work.  It's like missing white girl syndrome.  Kids go missing every day.  Kids get kidnapped.  They get lost.  They get murdered.  All sorts of things happen on a daily basis.  But you only really hear about it when it's a little white kid.  Because most people in this country have more of an emotional connection to a little white girl.  They just do.  And so that makes more news.  Amber Alerts are called Amber Alerts for a reason, because a little white girl named Amber.  And because we have this kind of false connection, we give it more importance.  when even if it's not such a, you know, on say racial lines or anything like that, if a child goes missing, they get kidnapped in a particular neighborhood.  And you've probably had this experience before.  I know I have.  You have something happens in the news and one of your co-workers is particularly upset about it.  Not all of your co-workers, but one co-worker is particularly upset about it.  You say, hey, what's going on?  Oh, you know, I'm just thinking about that kidnapping that happened or whatever.  And you go, oh, really?  Do It's like, well, because it's from a neighborhood just like mine.  When I saw it on the video, it looked just like my own neighborhood.  Or I saw that the family, that they look just like me.  They look like that could have been me.  So they have more personal attachment to it.  Even though that kid is no more important, than any other kid that gets killed or goes missing.  We do that.  And so when it comes to celebrity, people have a personal attachment to celebrity.  They do.  That's why they're celebrities.  They're famous.  Everyone feels like they know them.  So when a celebrity dies, it's someone that the average person has a personal attachment to.  It's like someone they know died.  And so since it's someone they know or feel they know, it has more weight than the nondescript firefighter that dies, that they don't know anything about.  It's not the way things should work, but it is how people work.  It is how human beings work.  It's even how those of you who are criticizing me work.  If someone in your family dies or a close friend of yours die and you're upset about it, Is it acceptable for someone to come up to you and say, why are you upset about your brother John dying?  Four other people just died yesterday.  Come on.  What's so important about your brother?  No, of course not.  It's not acceptable.  Because you have a personal attachment there.  Now, you may feel your personal attachment there is more valid than other people's attachment to a celebrity.  I get that.  But that's just how people work.  And so for you critics of me, just for bringing up the topic, come at me for just bringing up the topic.  When I did not elevate him to any type of importance, I just used that as a springboard to discuss other things.  You're being disingenuous and you're just being assholes about it.  And then there are some of you who claim that I was somehow a shill for bringing it up.  A shill for what?  What was I shilling by?  bringing up that this celebrity had died in a sudden way, which makes people go, oh crap, this stuff just comes out of nowhere.  And using that as a discussion about the fact that these things happen out of nowhere.  What was I shilling for?  You claim you're going to, you're unsubbing me because I was shilling with that video.  What was I shilling for?  I understand a lot of you hate sub me.  You're subbed to me because you like to disagree with the things I say.  I'm actually curious to know what portion of my subs are people who hate sub me.  And given that fact, when you say you're going to unsub me because I'm somehow a shill because I discussed Kobe Bryant's death, I don't care.  Go.  You're not wanted.  And those of you who have said that somehow that I was coming from a place of privilege because I needed a celebrity death to make me think about hugging my children, you don't know me.  Fuck you.  Let me show you something.  Let me just explain where I'm coming from and how far off.  those of you who say I'm coming from a place of privilege.  This right here.  It's hard to see.  It's kind of dark.  This right here is an oxygen generator.  That's what it's doing right now.  Now, the reason it's operating here in the dark when I recorded this is because my wife requires oxygen almost 24-7.  She's got pulmonary hypertension.  It requires her to be on oxygen almost all the time.  Now, the last couple of weeks were pretty crazy.  I got sick with whatever bugs going around with some type of cold.  It was pretty hard.  It hit me harder than most things do.  It wasn't the flu or anything like that, but it was pretty brutal.  And then I was down for about four days.  And then when I got better, then my wife got it.  Now, it hit her pretty hard.  It started getting worse and worse.  And then after about five days on it, she wasn't getting any better.  And her oxygen levels were dropping.  She was having a hard time keeping her oxygen.  She monitors her oxygen all the time, you know, at least once an hour or as many times as she needs.  And even with increasing the oxygen intake, she wasn't able to keep her oxygen levels up.  So take her to the ER.  And find out whatever she initially had has moved into pneumonia.  Now, it's lucky they caught the pneumonia.  At first, they did an x-ray, showed nothing.  Lungs were clear.  Kept her there because they were still trying to keep her oxygen level up.  And take some blood work out because that's what they always do.  And it came back with a funky little enzyme in it or whatever.  And so they said, you know what?  Your lungs are clear, but we're going to do a CT scan of your lungs just to see if there's a blood clot.  Something is keeping you from getting the oxygen you need.  So, you know, days gone.  It's been a long day, but the CT scan comes back and they go, well, nope, no blood clot, but hey, the CT scan revealed that you have pneumonia.  Now, the x-rays usually do that.  It didn't catch it, but the CT scan did, which was great because if it hadn't shown it, then she would have gone home.  If the doctor hadn't just had this inkling to do a CT scan, she would have gone home with pneumonia, gotten a lot worse.  But they're saying, hey, cool.  It's pneumonia.  We'll give you some antibiotics.  We're going to send you home.  Take these antibiotics.  Great.  We're doing that.  Day and a half later, 3  a.m.,  we get a call from the emergency room.  Blood work came back that we did earlier, and there's something going on with your blood.  There's some infection in your blood that we need to check out.  So you need to come back in.  Understand, this is a 3 a.m.  call.  Emergency room doctor is going.  Call them.  Have them come in.  That's some shit right there.  So we come back in.  And so they're concerned about, hey, there's somehow bacteria, something's gotten into your blood.  We got to do this.  We got to take care of it.  Now, she's got respiratory issues already.  And this is obviously a respiratory issue.  And given the things in the world going on right now, they didn't know what was going on with her.  So they put her on kind of on lockdown.  If you went in to visit her, they made all the people, you know, gear up completely, head to toe, gloves, masks, outfits and everything.  wash yourself on the way in, clean yourself up, everything, throw everything into the trash to be burned or whatever on your way out.  That's how they treated her.  Stuffed her full of a bunch of antibiotics, you know, just hit her, hammered her really good for 24 hours.  And then they let her go home.  But that was a scary 72 hours.  Real scary 72 hours.  But it's not much scarier than our normal 72 hours.  You understand, on a daily basis, when I leave the house, I know that there is a non-zero chance that my wife can have a medical emergency before I come home.  There's a non-zero chance that she could die before I come home.  It doesn't take the death of celebrity for me to think about this on a regular basis.  I think about it on a daily basis.  Most of you are privileged enough to not have to think about these things on a daily basis.  If you want to talk to me about privilege, most people can leave their house on a regular basis without thinking about these things.  They just go away.  Sure, there could be a car accident.  Sure, a plane could fall out of the sky and land on somebody.  Lightning could strike freakishly.  Yeah, all these things could happen, but you don't think about them because you don't have to.  If you want to talk about privilege, most of you have the privilege of not thinking about that on a daily basis.  I don't.  So don't come to me talking about.  I have the privilege of any of this.  Don't claim that I'm shilling for anything when I used that as a Kobe Bryant step to talk about this type of subject.  It's something I think about on a daily basis.  And if that's going to make you unsub me, unsub me.  That's my job.  That's what I do.  I don't lose.  I win.  I win.  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by congratulating on last night's victory. ",
