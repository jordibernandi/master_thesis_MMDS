Today we're here in Meridian Square Park in D.C.  asking people what they think of racist Donald Trump quotes.  They're actually all Joe Biden quotes, but we want to see if they change their answer based on who said the quote.  Let's go see what they have to say.  We're reading Donald Trump quotes.  We're trying to get people's reaction to them.  Just like a reaction video.  Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle.  The jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built up so high that it's going to explode at some point. ",
