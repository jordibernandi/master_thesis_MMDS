I've been debating going back and forth with atheists for just over a year now and sometimes I feel like catnip and I feel like they think they're the cat.  They see a Christian and they want to pounce on me and play just like they do with everybody else.  And they always pose this question and the question is, give me the evidence that Christianity is true, that Jesus is God, things of that nature.  So, you know, thinking they're honest, I'm going to go down the evidence and I'll cite the scientific evidence, the historical evidence, the archaeological evidence, How could there be scientific evidence of a God?

It's not clear to me that there is even a clear definition of a God.  It seems to be defined as something which is not physical, but if it's not physical, what is it?  And what would it mean for such a thing to be observed and tested in a scientific way?  How can you have historical evidence of a God?  And how do the historical accounts of Jesus demonstrate that He is a God?  Even if Jesus really performed every miracle described in the Gospels, it wouldn't follow that.  Jesus is therefore a God.  Even if Jesus really healed the sick, turned water into wine, and rose from the dead, the fact that He had those powers isn't evidence that He was all-powerful.  And again, since it's not clear what a God is even supposed to be, it's not clear what would constitute evidence that Jesus was one.  I've never seen any archaeological evidence that Jesus existed at all.  There's testimonial evidence, but there are no surviving artifacts, like the cross, despite all of the people who claim to have some bit of it, or a contemporaneous painting or sculpture.  The closest thing we have to archaeological evidence of Jesus is the Pilate Stone, which is a stone with Pontius Pilate's name inscribed on it.  that looks as though it was probably created during Pilate's lifetime.  And that's not really even evidence of Jesus, it's only evidence that at least one person mentioned in the Gospels existed. ",

            "text": "Third-party evidence is hearsay.  It's the weakest possible form of evidence.  Hearsay evidence that Jesus was a God is essentially that someone heard someone else say that Jesus was a God.  Nobody should find that even remotely convincing.  And you can't claim fulfilled prophetic evidence without applying hermeneutic contortionism to the Old Testament messianic prophecies.  Jesus didn't really fit the Old Testament description of the Messiah at all.  As the New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman says in his book, How Jesus Became God, it's very surprising that people came to think of him as the prophesied Messiah, given the fact that, as far as we can tell, Jesus did nothing during his lifetime to make anyone think he was this anointed one.  That is to say, he did not come on the clouds of heaven to judge the living and the dead, he was not a priest, and he never raised an army and drove the Romans out of the Promised Land to set up Israel as a sovereign state.  Apologists try to rebut this by asserting that it's all somehow metaphorically true, which they have to assert because of how obvious it is that a face value reading of the prophecies about the Messiah clearly doesn't match the attested life of Jesus.  Statistical probabilities.  By statistical probabilities, I suspect this dude means the application of Bayes' theorem.  William Lane Craig believes that Bayes' theorem proves that reports of Jesus' resurrection are more probably explained by a miracle than by hallucination, mistaken identity, fabrication,  etc.,  given the evidence at hand.  I did a video about why this is silly that I'll link in the description, but suffice it to say that you can't say that a miracle is more or less probable than any other explanation unless you can assign a value to the probability that a miracle occurred, which you can't without a clear and coherent explanation of what it means to say that a god exists, let alone what it means to say that one performs miracles.

What they are talking about is what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 6.  He says that Jesus appeared to more than 500 brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.  Every Christian who brings this up wants us to treat this single assertion by a single person, Paul, as though it has the same evidential weight as 500 separate, independent, mutually corroborating testimonies.

            "text": "First of all, there are not, in fact, 25,000 manuscripts that have never been altered.  Most of the manuscripts counted in the 25,000 are translations, and translation, I think, should count as alterations.  The number of manuscripts in the original Greek is only 5,800.  The 5,800 Greek manuscripts are not all complete.  Many are very small fragments and they do, in fact, contain inconsistencies.  Bart Ehrman says in his book, Misquoting Jesus, that even scribes who were competent, trained, and alert sometimes made mistakes.  Sometimes, though, as we have seen, they changed the text because they thought it was supposed to be changed.  For example, when they came across a passage that appeared to embody a mistake that needed to be corrected, possibly a contradiction found in the text, or a mistaken geographical reference.  or a misplaced scriptural illusion.  Ehrman gives the example of a difference between the 4th century Codex Vaticanus and most other manuscripts.  He says that in the opening of the book of Hebrews, there is a passage in which, according to most manuscripts, we are told that Christ bears, Greek phaeron, all things by the word of his power.  In Codex Vaticanus, however, the original scribe produced a slightly different text with a verb that sounded similar in Greek.  Here, the text instead reads, Christ manifests, Greek phaeron, all things by the word of his power.  So the manuscripts are not all identical.  But even if every manuscript were perfectly identical, it's not clear how that would be evidence that Jesus was a God. ",

Since a mind, as far as I can tell, is a process carried out by some form of body, a disembodied mind is a contradiction in terms.
