            "text": "The true greatness of truly great artists is my God in their work.  There they put much more than they knew.  Take Wagner.  He said all possible vulgar anti-Semitism.  But take an elementary look at Wagner's work.  What's the central Wagnerian hero?  Figure of wandering Jew, my God.  Everything changes.  Immediately you see it's more.  But now more serious.  We had a certain reading here which was that Mahler went through that, how should I put it, zero point of absolute void and saw the end of the world and saw the Holocaust, to cut it short.  Well... Now, if you allow me just for three minutes to make this point with all aggressivity.  Listening precisely to this last movement now of the Fifth Symphony, I claim, if there is a thing that Mahler emphatically didn't see, it was this.  Because, you know, okay, we know how history of music goes, very vaguely.  First we have pre-modern music where you have all those references to the Harmonia Mundi, all those referring, then Bach is the first radical modernizer.  He saw no harmony in the world.  you have to invent, impose a rational order onto music.  Then Romanticism, where you have this struggle with material.  With Romanticism, that's how I read it very naively.  You cannot do it like Mozart, a beautiful melody is there.  You must struggle for a long time so that the melody must arise through this density.  But that's not the end, I claim.  What happens with Schoenberg and afterwards, it's something much more terrifying.  It's really like moving from classical physics with dense matter. ",
