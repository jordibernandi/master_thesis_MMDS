I always use this day to take some time to reflect on my appreciation for the men in my life and everything that men have done for me.  As I do this, I also often take time to look around and see the other sentiments I'm seeing about men and International Men's Day.  There are a few patterns that I have noticed in other people's discussions about the topic, and I thought that that might make for an interesting show. ",

            "text": "Ladies, let's get ready to give your man some extra attention this November 19th, which is International Men's Day.  Women's Day is celebrated annually on March 8th.  Before you say, but isn't every day International Men's Day?  Listen up.  Even feminists are on board with the day, because by definition, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.  and as it stands now men's mental and physical health is not where it should be.  uh huh.  rather than challenge the definition of feminism for the millionth time let's briefly check in on the article they used to support their point.  While the title is certainly a humorous one, the article itself does very little to challenge the so-called bitching.  Instead, she briefly talks about her niece and nephew, and how she wants her nephew to be just as valued by society as her niece.  She also gives a mention to the other men in her life who have given it meaning, which again provides very little incentive for other feminists to not complain.  In fact, I often suspect that the reason why some feminists complain about this subject is because they lack a lot of positive male figures in their lives.  I'm quite sure that any feminists that are currently against International Men's Day will not be convinced to start caring about it just because this particular individual has some men in her life that she cares about.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little article with a nice message about appreciating the men in this one author's life, but it's hardly the stamp of feminist endorsement the original article is making it out to be.  So let's get back to that.  Sure, men may have it a little easier in some areas.  For instance, a report released in March found that the wage gap is actually getting bigger rather than smaller.  Another report the following month suggested the more professionally successful women are, the less they make relative to their male colleagues.  Last month, the World Economic Forum also found women work 39 more days than men per year. ",

            "text": "Now, again, we've talked about these issues forever on this channel, so I'm not going to spend a long time on them, but the first cited link flat out admits this wage gap is due to women's choices, like working part-time, choosing different careers, and prioritizing child care.  And the last link that says women work more days per year includes quote-unquote paid and unpaid work.  So chances are very good that we can simply discard that.  Not because I'm trying to be contrary and simply ignore data, but just because if you actually look at the gender gap report this article is based upon, you see it's just comparing the number of women in high-powered professional and technical roles to the number of men in the same roles.  I'm strongly suspecting that this report didn't go out of its way to elicit responses from single men living alone who presumably also have to do plenty of their own unpaid work of doing their own laundry and cooking their own meals.  Or, if it did, it didn't mention this fact.  So anyway, moving back to the article... ",

It's not that I don't think it is an important subject.  On the contrary, I think it's an extremely important subject.  My question is, what exactly have we as a society been really doing to address it?  Only in the past year or so have I really started to see a lot of messaging around actually trying to reach out to men for men's sake.  However, for all the statements being made about needing to reach out to men and to help encourage men to reach out themselves when they need it, it often feels like this is being done in the wrong way for two main reasons.  Conveniently, these two reasons are outlined well in the rest of this article. ",

Heyman would like to see boys to be taught to reach out for help and not stifle their emotions.  And then in big broad text in the middle... We need to break down those negative aspects of masculinity. ",

            "text": "As always, that's what a lot of this all comes down to.  In order to be mentally healthy, we must challenge aspects of masculinity.  Because it's always elements of masculinity that are the problem.  It's not that you might feel depressed and hesitant to reach out because you have been rebuffed for it previously.  It's not that you might feel anxious and unsure about what to do next, so you fall into a procrastinating pattern that continually puts things off until you're buried under a mountain of problems.  It's not that you're more solution-focused and therefore don't really feel all that much better about expressing your emotions if it doesn't lead to a concrete change in your situation.  It's not that you feel worried about burdening other people with your problems, or even just being perceived as a burden by others, which, by the way, is one of those major factors present in people with suicidal urges, so you decide to keep those problems to yourself.  Because if it were any of these things, then these would be behavior patterns that anyone, not just men, could be prone to, right?  No, for some reason, these days it always seems to come back to masculinity.  And sure, when people say things like this, they're always careful to mention the so-called negative elements of masculinity.  But regardless, it still comes across as attacking an inherent part of their being.  And that's because for some reason, it's acceptable to do this when it comes to men.  After all, you never see any articles claiming the need to challenge negative aspects of femininity.  or if you do, it's usually one directly in response to someone asserting the same thing of masculinity.  And in those cases, it comes across as snarky.  It feels like an attack.  I think it becomes more obvious because it's not politically correct to publicly denounce women's behavior, or even just behaviors that might be more common in women.  However, we've become so comfortable with making these kinds of statements of men and masculinity that many people have become desensitized to it and think of it as normal. ",

Are we trying to normalize men needing emotional support because it's the right thing to do, and because we genuinely want to try to be there for men who want to reach out?  Or is it yet another subtle dig at masculinity, or people trying to tell men what they need to do in order to feel better rather than asking them what they need?  I really hope for the former, but until I start seeing larger change in the way large organizations and societal attitudes relate towards men and their problems, I will continue to prefer instead to support men in the way they want to be supported rather than pushing another worldview on them.  Anyway, let's return to the last line of the article to see the other reason I think we are focusing on the wrong thing, the main thing the article decides to end on.  Children suffer when they lose a father or a grandfather prematurely, reads the International Men's Day website, so let's work together to turn the tide of male ill health and suicide.  Really a poignant thought to end on if you think about it.  The focus isn't really on men, but on those they impact when they decide to end their lives.  It's not, men suffer so much that suicide becomes a valid option.  It's, children suffer when they lose the men in their lives to suicide. ",

Maybe if we started to show them this level of care, we wouldn't need our focus on International Men's Day to be on male suicide.  Today on Men's Mental Health, I hope you'll come join us as we celebrate International Men's Day and reach out in a place you know you can get some genuine support. ",
