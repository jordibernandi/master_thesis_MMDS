            "text": "Hey, this is Dana Coverstone.  I'm a pastor.  I'm a husband.  I'm a father.  I'm a patriot.  I love this country.  And I can confirm the first part of what I'm about to tell you because I told some men at a prayer group back in December, second or third week of December.  I want to share three specific dreams that I've had recently going back to December, two that I've had this week, both Monday and last night, Monday and Tuesday night.  Because I believe, number one, they are prophetic.  The first one that I had has come explicitly true based on the events of March through June, the month in which we're living.  And I do not claim to be a prophet by any means.  I understand, though, that some dreams and visions by their nature have a prophetic tendency to them.  But I do believe I've seen things, both that have happened, as relevant by the first dream that I had, and some things that I've seen recently.  So you can take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.  You can pray about it.  You can think about it.  But I believe that I have a warning for the country, a warning for rural America, a warning for America overall.  Here's what happened.  Back in December, I woke up.  I had a dream.  And in that dream, I saw a calendar starting January 2020.  And it was being flipped.  And I saw January.  I saw February.  I saw March.  And when March came up, the hand held it and I saw a finger underline the month of March and then tap it three times.  So underline the month of March, tapped it three times.  So to me, it was emphasis.  Something's going to happen in March.  And then I saw April, May, June.  And when June came, the hand underlined June again and tapped it three times.  Then in the vision, I saw people marching.  I saw protests.  I saw people wearing masks.  I saw lines going into hospitals.  I saw typical medical doctors with needles or syringes.  I saw people on ventilators.  I saw people who were very, very sick, very, very ill.  I saw newspaper headlines trumpeting thousands of people getting sick.  I saw ambulances just flying down roads.  And then I saw cities on fire.  I saw buildings being burned.  I saw protesters with masks.  I saw people who had their fists in the air, people who were yelling and screaming, angry just at the world.  I saw courthouses.  I saw state houses surrounded.  I saw people who were mad at the world.  I saw guns, shotguns specifically put in the air, held like this, and I saw barriers within cities.  And I told several men in my church about this, and I can confirm who those men were, and they'll confirm that what I'm telling you is what I told them.  I saw absolute chaos.  And the other thing I saw was vultures flying over large cities.  Not just the ones that were burning, but I saw vultures flying over the cities.  And I saw smoke rising.  And I saw people fearful.  I saw people terrified.  I saw people inside their homes looking out the windows, the curtains of their windows with guns in their hands because there was absolute fear.  Then I heard the words, brace yourself.  Brace yourself.  So since December, I've been hearing those words, brace yourself.  Brace yourself.  Um, January, February came, didn't seem too much.  I reminded the men of the dream.  And then in March, boom, COVID-19 hit.  And things started shutting down.  Churches were shut down.  Business was shut down.  The economy shut down.  Then we began to see the protests starting in May in Minneapolis and all those things began to go on.  So where we are at the end of the primary election here in Kentucky, and now there's talk of more shutdowns.  I just heard the governor talk about schools opening back up and things of that nature.  But the things that I saw in a dream of vision back in December are the same things that I watched in the news almost every day since March through June.  All this time I kept hearing, brace yourself, brace yourself.  I spend time in prayer.  I spend time in the Word.  I'm a pastor.  And it's not just my job.  It's something that I enjoy doing.  I love doing.  And I'm very interested in the news around the world.  I read 40 newspapers a day from all around the world.  I keep up with news.  In other parts of the nations, better sometimes than I hear here because it's hard to know who to trust.  But I get news from all over the world, all around the world, from both liberal and conservative sources.  I'm very well read.  I'm very understanding of how nations work.  I've traveled quite a bit, and I'm not just making these things up.  I can confirm what I have said.  And with that in mind, on Monday night, I had another dream.  And it woke me from my bed.  I made notes about it.  I shot some video of myself, just making sure I can remember.  But here's what I saw.  I saw a calendar.  It started with a calendar.  And as I was having this, the calendar was up, a white figure appeared.  And to me, it was representing God, the Holy Spirit, something pure, something righteous, something true, something holy, because there was nothing sinister about it, nothing evil.  But I heard the voice say, part two, part two.  And I saw June go up.  I saw July, I saw August, and then I saw September.  And I saw the finger underneath the word September, like emphasizing it, and tapped it three times.  And then I saw October come up.  And then I saw November.  And this is when it got real to me in the dream.  I think the intensity, according to my Fitbit, when I woke up, my heart rate was about 180.  So that was Monday night.  It was also a night that I woke up not feeling very well at all.  I was up during the night, not feeling well.  But anyway, the minute the finger underlined November three times, instead of tapping it, I saw a fist ball up and it hit the calendar.  And literally, the calendar exploded into the wall.  The numbers seemed like they were 3D and they were just flying everywhere.  And there was a cloud of chaos that started.  And then the next thing I saw was I saw... I saw armed protesters.  I saw fighting in the streets.  I saw people pummeling one another.  I saw businesses shuttered and shut up.  I saw schools close.  I saw schoolrooms with cobwebs hanging in them and things like papers falling off the wall and posters falling like no one had been in them for months.  I saw banks.  Bank buildings with the roofs being taken off.  It looked almost like alien abduction because money was just flying through the roof into some type of vacuum cleaner.  I know that sounds kind of strange, but I was watching wealth just being taken.  I saw politicians in back rooms making deals with people, patting people on the back and laughing and smiling and smirking.  And I saw monuments.  I saw Washington,  D.C.,  I saw Washington DC blazing.  I saw fires everywhere.  I saw people being rounded up.  I saw Chinese and Russian soldiers on the ground.  And Russian soldiers were telling the Chinese soldiers to go and pick up these people, round up these people, secure this quadrant, secure this area.  I saw blue helmets of the UN.  I saw military things taking place.  I also saw no sign of President Trump.  I saw no sign of leadership in Washington, D.C.  But the vultures that I had seen were now like gargoyles and they were 10 feet off the ground, 10 to 15 feet off the ground.  And they were just attacking people mercilessly.  I saw people hiding in their homes and garages.  I saw churches being burned.  I saw homes being burned.  I saw absolute chaos.  And the fist punch on the November of 2020 is what got my attention.  And then I heard the words again, brace yourself, brace yourself, brace yourself.  That has been something that I have heard for almost seven months now.  Starting once we get to July, it's going to be seven months.  And once again, I'm not claiming to be a prophet.  I'm not claiming, proclaiming.  We'll see what happens in November, through November, and see if I'm right about this.  But I know when I hear God's voice.  I know what God's voice sounds like to me.  I know when He speaks.  And I know when I have a dream that I know is Him.  And the things that I was saying, I don't say this to scare people, but I say this to warn people that there are some pretty sinister things coming down the pike.  And not just for the lost, but for God's people as well.  The second dream I had last night, and it woke me up.  In this dream, we just had a yard sale to help fund a team going to Ecuador this next year.  And we had a yard sale.  And I had asked our secretary to get us some change for that yard sale.  So in the dream that I'm having, I walk to the bank, I walk into the bank to get some change.  And on the door it says there's no change available.  I saw the sign.  It registered in my mind, but I walked on in, and the president of the local bank was at the teller station, and she was going to be taking care of business.  And I said, I need to get $10.25 for a yard sale, and she said, I'm sorry.  But the U.S.  Mint is no longer making currency or making change like pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars.  We're not doing that anymore.  I said, well, what do you mean?  She said, they've stopped doing it.  I said, well, how are we going to be able to charge $1.50 for anything?  And she said, prepare for hyperinflation and just charge $2.  And then she said to me in the dream, oh, and by the way, $1 and $5 bills will follow soon after that.  And then I heard those words.  Brace yourself.  Brace yourself.  Brace yourself.  And I woke up.  I wrote these things down.  I've never gone on video and recorded the dreams that I've had.  And I hesitated to not do the one I had back in December.  But everything I saw in that dream in December came true between March and June.  In the dream, I was showed March through June.  And so I don't think I would be doing... anyone a service if I don't share what I saw in these dreams and visions.  And I believe that we're going to see not just a second huge wave of COVID between September, October, November, but we're going to see major things with the elections.  We're going to see major chaos in our country.  We're going to see troops in our cities.  We're going to see the protests get even worse.  We're going to see buildings burn.  We're going to see what could only lead to civil war in this country.  And so for my friends that are believers, I'm just going to share with you what I think you need to hear.  First of all, you need to be preparing food.  You need to make sure you've got alternative forms of currency like silver or gold or whatever.  I believe you need to have an ample supply of both guns and ammunition.  And that's not just the Second Amendment fan in me coming out.  That is the things that we're seeing.  They're talking about defunding the police.  That means one thing.  You're on your own in a lot of areas.  I also believe you need to be praying like you never prayed before.  Make sure your family knows what's going on, where you are.  Have some communication between your family about if certain things happen, if certain things go down.  I'm not saying get off the grid.  And I've never, ever said anything like this in my church.  I have said I believe things that this could happen, but I've never done what I'm doing right now.  And I'm telling you, that between September and November of this coming year.  And you'll be able to check me.  If by the time we get to November, nothing's happened, or December 1st, man, you call me on this and say, Dana Coverstone, you are an absolute idiot and a fool for saying those things.  Go right ahead.  Because I realize I'm responsible for what I've spoken.  But I also know what I sense.  And I know the Holy Spirit's voice enough to know that what I've heard, I believe is going to happen.  And what I heard in December happened between March and June.  Not because I'm a prophet, but because dreams have a prophetic edge to them sometimes.  I've been doing a whole series on dreams and visions.  I'm going to finish that series up tonight at our church.  And I'm going to talk about why dreams and visions are literally an extension of the spiritual gifts of 1 Corinthians 12.  Because word of wisdom, word of knowledge, discernment, all those things are required for dreams.  And I pray, Lord, show me what these things mean that I have seen.  Show me how to interpret them and what they are.  And right now as I speak this, it is June 24th, Wednesday night at 5.30 p.m.  in Burksville, Kentucky.  I'm in my office at the church, Livermore Ministries in Burksville, Kentucky, sharing this.  Not to scare you because I believe, you know, look, God gave the prophets of the Old Testament a lot of warnings.  Not to scare people, but to prepare them for what was coming.  And so I'm challenging you.  Don't just throw my word away.  Don't just think I'm some preacher trying to get people to come.  That's not it either.  Because look, the Bible says the last day is a great falling away.  Jesus tells people to endure to the end.  Make sure you endure to the end.  Why?  Because people won't endure sound doctrine.  Some are going to hear me and go, oh man, he is on drugs or something.  I'm just telling you the dreams I've had.  You can do with them.  You can interpret them the way that you want to.  But I'm going to declare that I believe we're going to see between September and November incredible, terrible, awful, nasty, bad things happen in this nation.  And for the people who are not prepared for it, it's not just going to catch them in a bad place.  It's going to destroy a lot of faith, a lot of hearts, a lot of relationships, a lot of people.  The aim is to kill this nation.  Because right now we are a nation that stands in the way of a lot of the Antichrist principles like freedom, liberty, justice.  First Amendment, Second Amendment, the Antichrist doesn't want those things.  And yes, I do believe the Antichrist is alive and well on planet Earth.  And I don't really care what people think about this video.  You can call me whatever you want.  You can say whatever you want about me.  But wait until December 1st to say it.  And if I'm wrong, I'll be the first one to come out and say, Folks, I don't know what I was thinking.  I don't know what I ate that night.  I've never had two dreams like this.  I've never had a part one, part two.  Part one came fully true.  And part two, I believe will as well.  So heed my words, folks.  Believers, stop messing around if you're not living for the Lord like you need to.  Because the press, there's an olive press moment coming for the church in this country.  An olive press moment.  And we're going to get crushed and squeezed and pushed down.  That's why I believe God keeps saying, brace yourself.  He's saying this to me so I can say it to you.  Brace yourself for the things that are coming.  Endure to the end no matter how hard it gets.  I'm not giving up the faith that I have in Christ.  I've come too far on this walk and too far in my life to do that.  But I want to make sure that others don't make that mistake and don't just walk away from it.  Take up the cross, deny yourself, and follow him.  Thanks. ",
