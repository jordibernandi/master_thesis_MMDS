            "text": "I just watched Mika Brzezinski's interview of Joe Biden on MSNBC's Morning Joe, and I've got to tell you, if she was trying to destroy Joe Biden, mission virtually accomplished.  VivaFry, Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  If you are extremely perceptive, you might notice that I'm shooting this vlog towards the end of the day, hence the lighting is not all that good.  My wife had the three kids out of the house this morning, and I spent the day mopping the floors, vacuuming the house.  You should have seen the color of the water in the mop bucket.  It was disgusting.  Now, for those of you who may not watch MSNBC like myself, you might nonetheless have heard of the fact that Mika Brzezinski just did an interview or what I might call a cross-examination of Joe Biden on Morning Joe on their morning show.  The interview didn't go that well for Joe Biden.  For those of you who may not know, Joe Biden is being accused of sexual assault by a former staffer named Tara Reid, an incident that dates back to the 1990s.  Now, I don't know what Mika's objective was with the interview, but it became clear within about 30 seconds that she was not there to give him law-ball questions.  From a legal cross-examining point of view, we can learn a lot from this interview, and I'm going to go through it to bring out some of the highlights.  But the manner in which Mika conducted this interview perfectly illustrates that one does not have to come into an examination frothing mad in order to get their point across.  On the contrary, setting aside a few convoluted or unnecessarily complicated questions, Mika was methodical, and she tore Joe Biden apart.  She had good questions that were on point, she pushed back on the evasive answers, and she allowed for the awkward silences that other people might have interrupted because of the fact that they would be so darn awkward.  All right, but enough of the prelude.  Let's get into the interview. ",

I always get suspicious when someone tries to support their own position by relying on the inconsistencies of someone else's position.  Why?  Because generally speaking, there are always going to be inconsistencies in someone else's position.  And it is yet another diversionary tactic in that one can justify their own dishonesty not by making false statements themselves, but by relying on the inconsistencies of the other party.  And so the person doesn't even have to lie or make untruthful statements themselves, all they can say is, look, it has to be false because there are so many inconsistencies in that person's story.

And in doing that, she's actually doing a greater service than if she were to get aggressive with Joe Biden.  In fact, what makes this interview so effective and so devastating for Joe Biden is that Mika asks the questions and just lets Joe Biden sink himself.  The questions were good, they were on point, and they were methodical, and above and beyond asking good questions on point in a methodical manner, what Mika did best is allow Joe Biden to answer.  She didn't interrupt, she didn't put Joe Biden on the defensive by getting aggressive, she just let Joe Biden answer.  And oddly enough, that is a lesson that a lot of litigation attorneys need to learn when going into examinations.  You could have the most relevant on-point questions, but if you don't allow the witness to answer, they are useless.  Here, Mika asked the questions, she allowed Joe Biden to answer those questions, and I think the world is going to judge Joe Biden by those answers.  I have just shed whatever insight I can into what I think of those answers.  And while some people might consider this analysis to be partisan in that it has to be pro-Trump because it's critical of Joe Biden, others might think that it is in fact pro-Democratic Party because it's illustrating the fact that they need a more viable candidate to actually beat Trump in 2020. while others might just accept it for what it is, my analysis based on my experience with whatever insights I think I can add to the situation.
