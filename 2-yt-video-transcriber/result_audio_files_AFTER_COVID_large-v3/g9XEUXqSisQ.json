            "text": "Hey, y'all, I just wanted to comment on a rumor that's spreading like wildfire across small town America right now, and that's that Antifa is deploying busloads of liberal provocateurs from all the big cities on the coast to infiltrate rural America and wreak havoc.  And I just felt as somebody who's kind of done the exact opposite of that, I was in a position to comment on it.  First of all, rural America, Antifa's not real, not really.  It's just the latest in the long line of fictional boogeyman.  you uncreate whole cloth out of thin air to help yourselves maintain the vital balance of fear and anger upon which you thrive.  They're just like the transgender toilet monsters or the big government rifle snatchers of years past.  They're not really a thing.  But let's just say that when you say Antifa, you mean like big city, coastal liberals.  They're coming to your town.  To fuck with y'all.  Let me tell you something, rural America.  Coastal liberals wouldn't come to where you live if the ghost of Karl Marx offered to pay them in aborted fetuses, okay?  They're not coming there.  For nothing.  Ever.  Ever.  What are they going to do with that?  What are they coming there to loot?  What are they going to loot?  The co-op?  The blizzard machine at the Dairy Queen?  Those aren't vegan friendly.  What would they want with them?  Are they going to riot?  How are they going to maintain the strength to riot when they all survive off of wheatgrass and pretension?  Huh?  They coming to spread their message to y'all?  They don't know how to talk to y'all.  Why do you think I have a career?  It ain't the jokes.  And how are they going to get there?  Buses, right?  Big fleet of liberal buses.  You think they've got the time and resources to find that many fully electric buses and paint them rainbow colors?  Come on.  Nothing about it makes any fucking sense at all.  Here's my point.  You cannot keep talking out of both sides of your mouth where coastal liberals are concerned.  You cannot, on the one hand, act like we are all a bunch of spineless, ineffectual, overly sensitive soy boys.  And at the same time, we are somehow a cabal of special forces shadow queers.  It don't make any sense to say nothing of how it makes y'all look when you buy into bullshit like this.  Don't you know what it makes you look like when you share these rumors around?  It makes you look like you're scared.  Like you're afraid of coastal liberals coming to your town.  And I know that can't be it, right?  You would never admit that you're afraid of liberals.  Imagine your papa shaking his head at you in disappointment from the bowels of hell.  No, that can't be it because you ain't worried about it, right?  If they do show up, you'll take care of it, right?  You whoop everybody's ass, shoot everybody's dog.  You big, tough, and dumb.  You got guns.  Let the liberals show up.  See what happens, right?  You'll take care of it.  Nothing to worry about, right?  Okay, then shut the fuck up about it.  Jesus. ",
