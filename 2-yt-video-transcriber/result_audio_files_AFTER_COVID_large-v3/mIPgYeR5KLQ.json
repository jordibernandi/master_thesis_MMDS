He's appeared very often on Plank of the Week, not as a plank, of course, but as a panelist on Plank of the Week.  Yesterday, he took it upon himself to do his civic duty and his nationalist duty.  And he went down and cleaned up the Winston Churchill defaced statue because he had been called a racist.  Black Lives Matter had put BLM on the bottom of the sort of the plinth on which it stands.  and Maya first of all thank you very much for doing that and thank you to all the other people who who joined in in that particular endeavor.  but it's taken a bit of a nasty turn since you did your good deed.  tell us about it.

That's just an excuse because there is a reason that the majority of the black community in this country aren't supporting this movement because they're just too busy living their own lives and having a job, having a family.  And also black people, generally speaking, stereotype, but are more culturally conservative than these woke Black Lives Matter activists who most of them are middle class white people, by the way. ",

It's the senior management and senior teams who are, over the last couple of decades, have become so woke.  The way these people are recruiting the police force these days, And I think we need a balance because there is an issue in America with the American force, not necessarily based on racial stuff, but the American police are slightly aggressive as compared to the British police.  But the British police sometimes are too soft.  And if we have the balance, it would really help because, as you said, in Bristol, the senior police officers were just saying, we actually sympathize with the cause of this violent movement, violent movement.

I was watching an interview last night, which was actually on CNN, with a woman who said when she was asked, well, what would happen to me as the presenter of the new show if my house was broken into?  And she was putting this question to a woman who was advocating basically the doing away with of the police force altogether.  And this woman said, well, obviously, you're coming at that from a position of privilege because people would want to burgle your house because you have things.  And I'm going, yeah, really.  So apparently people don't have their houses broken into.  if they are living in black neighbourhoods, which is absolutely and utterly ridiculous.

But they keep calling, and for those who don't know, listening to this, obviously I'm British, but my background is Persian.  And then I keep receiving Twitter messages saying, oh, you're Indian, or you're an Arab terrorist, or you're Pakistani.  Like, wait, you're being racist yourself at this point.  And there's a reason that... They don't understand that in this country.  we have the data, pure research says that 52% of Brits actually say that migrants, well, legal migration actually makes this country stronger.  So this is not a racist country.  This is a racist country.  This is the most tolerant country we have on this planet.  Right. ",

And I said this to a caller yesterday.  You know, it's all very well saying, well, they can take down a statue because everybody agrees with it.
