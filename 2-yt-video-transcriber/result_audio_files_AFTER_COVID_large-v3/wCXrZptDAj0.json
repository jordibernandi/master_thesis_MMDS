            "text": "white people are going on strike.  hashtag white strike.  trends on twitter.  hello everyone.  this is mr obvious and today on the internet we're going to talk about the white strike.  so a hashtag has been trending here.  you can see trending in the united states hashtag white strike.  with 24 000 tweets quite a number And many people are talking about this.  For example, you can see a tweet by Cassandra Fairbanks who says, Now a lot of people are talking about this.  Here, for example, a Twitter user named Skeletor says, The white middle class is the backbone of the West.  We put in by far the most and take out the least.  Time to show exactly how much.  Hashtag white strike.  Now, I find this movement amazing because I'm finally seeing a segment of the white population in the West start to stand up for themselves.  It seems for a long time now that white people have been expected to just, I don't know, take all the blame for society's problems.  You see the political left in the West, namely the Democrats, the liberals, the people on the far left, the activists, the left-wing activists, you know, those who are woke Those who virtue signal, those who believe in social justice and other nonsense.  They have really been vocal about how they blame white people for all of society's problems.  And for a long time, it seemed like white people didn't say anything.  They just stood there.  They turned the other cheek.  But it seems now that people are calling for a hashtag white strike.  The idea is simple.  What would happen in America, for example, if all white people were to go on strike?  Well, the economy would crumble.  It's that simple.  Regardless of what side you are on, on the political spectrum, even if you're a left-winger, even if you're a right-winger, it doesn't matter.  If white people were to stop working tomorrow... the country would come to a halt.  Now, like it or not, the white population in America is still the majority.  As of 2010, 60.4% of the US population was white.  That's a huge, huge amount of people.  And so the white strike has come.  So we're going to talk about all of this, exactly what would happen if all white people were to go on strike, and what people are saying about this movement.

So I'm here on Twitter and I want to look at what some of Twitter is responding with here.  Because it was trending on Twitter and it made a lot of left-wingers angry.  Oh my God, how dare they?  How dare they want to practice their civil liberties and go on strike?  Now they had a lot of things to say, so let's just jump right into this.  Here we can see a user named StephGenXSynicForJustice who says, The fact that hashtag white strike is trending is effing hilarious to me.  Like, all the white middle-aged racist assholes think they're going to win against folks 10 to 15 years younger than them?  who outnumber them exponentially and are in much better physical shape?  Ha, okay, try that.  First of all, I have no idea what she's actually talking about.  What do you mean?  This isn't a fight.  This isn't a conflict.  When people say white strike, what they mean is, what would happen if all white people were to stop working, were to go on strike?  It's simple, the economy would stop overnight.  Because, like it or not, as the majority of the population, white people are the backbone of America, of the United States.  Without the white working class and the white middle class, there would be nothing.  I mean, sure, you still have other people who could still work, but simply put, things would not work.  It would be a disaster.  And maybe then, and only then, would a lot of these left-wing groups, you know, especially the regressive left, maybe then, and only then, these left-wing groups would realize, that maybe white people are important after all.  And, you know, no offense to this person, but I think they're kind of projecting here.  They don't really seem that physically fit to me.  I don't understand why.  that's even a part of the argument, you know, like, a 20 year old is going to be stronger than a 30 year old.  but you know a 30 year old that's ripped that's got muscle is probably a lot stronger than a 20 year old who has no muscle.  so weird argument there.  and then there's the k-pop stans the most annoying cancerous group on twitter and in the world.  here you can see a user named naruto uzumaki245.  So, K-pop fans do this every single time that white people dare defend themselves or do anything.  They're trying to hijack the hashtag.  Now, This is very simple to defeat.  You simply take left-wing hashtags, and you make the K-pop stans tweet out those, as well as attacking K-pop's hashtags themselves.  But, you know, I feel like hashtags like this really expose the left.  It really exposes how bigoted they really are.  Now, a Canadian anonymous... A fucking leaf!  has a very good point.  He says, while this is a great idea in theory, there would be no civilization to return to, no police jobs to return to, no buildings to occupy, and because civilization would effectively be gone, there would be no one left sane enough to be able to say, I told you so, too.  Now, while I understand his concern that if there really was a white strike, it would destroy society overnight, or at least cause a lot of damage.  Now, while I understand that, That is exactly the point.  The point is... Enough is enough.  You know, I've seen white people be criticized.  I've seen them be demonized.  And I've seen them be put down.  Especially by the political left wing.  And enough is enough.  You cannot blame... One group of people for all of your problems.  Can you have criticisms?  Of course you can.  But those criticisms need to be logical.  They need to have evidence.  They need to be provable.  You can't just say, all white people are bad.  I am NPC unit 1245.  Also, orange man bad.  And, you know, go about your day willy-nilly.  No, that's not how it works.  You have to be able to prove what you're saying is true.  Now, the idea for the white strike seems to have originated from the blue flu the country is currently experiencing.  A lot of police officers are going on strike after being demonized and attacked by the public.  This seems to have inspired the idea of a white strike where white people, you know, they voice their support for the idea of white people going on strike in order to prove how important they actually are to society.  because they're being demonized and attacked by the left.  It's the same thing.  Now I have a really good post that talks about the anger of the modern person.  In America, here you see, Bethany S. Mandel says, Watching people lose their businesses, bury family members who died alone, without funerals, seeing special needs kids suffering without therapy.  While watching the same politicians cheering massive protests through the street.  The anger I feel will never go away.  She's talking about the pandemic.  COVID-19.  It is currently still active.  We're still in a pandemic.  And yet, the political left wing.  Are you noticing a pattern here?  has been doing massive protests, massive protests in the streets.  And they've been looting, burning, attacking people.  They've been violent.  They've been stealing.  They've been creating autonomous zones after driving out the police and taking over towns and cities like madmen, like gangs, and harming people.  They've been doing all of this.  It's been the political left wing in this country.  And yet the politicians, the Democrats, they applaud them.  Oh, good job.  You're so woke.  There's no pandemic.  Except when right wingers throw a rally or something.  The same politicians go, how dare they throw that rally?  Don't they know we're in a pandemic?  It's two-faced.  It's nonsense.  They're hypocritical.  And people are angry.  A lot of people's family have died in this pandemic.  Bethany goes on to say, I've buried a lot of people, parents, grandparents, etc.  The pain is unimaginable.  I cannot wrap my mind around it being made worse.  Not only being allowed to say goodbye, not allowed to have a funeral, and what?  To see all these images happening simultaneously.  I think a lot of people are underestimating the level of anger here.  From people who already feel like they've lost everything and have nothing to lose, it's a bad combination.  Make no mistake, calling for hashtag white strike is a peaceful protest.  It is peaceful and nonviolent.  Unlike the political left wing in this country, it is not a call for fighting.  You know, leftists see the hashtag white strike and they seem to think that it's some sort of call for like a Civil War II electric boogaloo.  But the truth is, it's simply a call for white people To let the world burn.  It's exactly like the idea of the blue flu.  Of cops going on strike.  What will you do without us?  The bodies will pile up in the streets.  The rioting will spread like wildfire.  And in the end, they will beg them to save them.  And you know, it's just, it's so obvious that left-wingers just don't get it.  Now, of course, you have a lot of these Twitter people saying that hashtag white strike is just the Russians.  No, Karen.  Not everything is the Russians.  Here, a user named Miss Krasenstein says, This stupid hashtag, white strike hashtag, is another hashtag created by Russia.  early in the mornings here in America.  Remember, only you control how racist you want to be.  Not Russians sitting in computer labs.  If you want to join them, you're both stupid and racist.  Again, another far leftist.  Someone in the far left end of the spectrum.  who doesn't understand white strike.  It's a peaceful, non-violent protest against all of this hate because that's what you have.  You can't just call everybody you don't like stupid and bigoted and believe that it's true.  It's not true.  You're just a moron.  You're delusional and you're brainwashed.  You actually believe that big boogeyman mother Russia.  Oh my God, Russia's doing it.  They're making white people go on strike.  It's not Russia.  When will you learn?  Now, I want to show you a very powerful example of what this movement is about.  Here you can see a user named Anglo John Gage, and he is verified on Twitter.  He says, Keep on hating whites until they hashtag white strike.  It's like you all never learn.  And then it shows a headline.  Zimbabwe exiled farmers, and these were white farmers, urged, begged to return home.  as agricultural industry struggles.  So the history of Zimbabwe, it's very interesting.  Long story short, at one time, it was a prosperous, prosperous country.  In fact, one of the most prosperous African countries out there.  And this was because there were many white people who were native to Zimbabwe, and a lot of them were farmers.  They produced food, and they produced in abundance.  But then Zimbabwe, which started preaching bigotry against white people, said that it's not fair that white people have the farms and the land.  We want what you have.  And then they attack these farmers.  A lot of families died because of this.  And they kick them out of Zimbabwe.  And they gave the land to the people, or so they say.  But what happened after they kicked out white people?  Zimbabwe became a starving country.  starving nation.  And now they're begging the farmers to return.  Now, I don't know about you, but if I was a farmer, and then the country kicked me out and took my farm, and then begged me to come back, because nobody knew how to farm, apparently, I'd say, F you, I'm out.  Now, I think the perfect way to leave off this story is right here.  Carmine Sabio says, I get the idea of a hashtag white strike.  When you get called a villain due to the color of your skin daily, you get frustrated.  But I think it is more helpful to simply ignore skin color.  We all should.  It is 2020.  The current year.  Skin color does not make you anything.  Now, I completely and utterly agree with this statement.  Unfortunately, left-wingers do not.  Here you can see a meme posted by the following user.  Bass Lindsey posted the following meme.  NPC says... We're here to resist racism and sexism.  That's why we made race and gender the focal point of our lives.  Because who more than the NPCs, than a lot of the political left, are obsessed with race and skin color?  It's not conservatives.  It's not Republicans.  It's not right-wingers.  It's the left.  They've even done scientific studies that show that when a liberal talks to a minority, they talk in simpler words.  because apparently liberals think that minorities are not as intelligent as them.  But conservatives... They talk exactly the same way to minorities as they talk to everyone.  Because it turns out that liberals look down on, and a lot of these liberals are white, look down on minorities while conservatives treat everybody equally with respect.  Isn't it ironic?  But that, my friends, is merely the obvious.  Well, that's all for now, folks.  What do you think about this story?  What do you think about the hashtag WhiteStrike?
