            "text": "Long before the MAGA days Barack Obama paved the way Democrats we had it made.  Those were the days.  Well, Nancy, we got a problem.  Seriously, Chuck?  You think I don't know we have a problem?  Well, I didn't know if you knew or not.  Of course I know, Chuck.  I know everything.  Oh, why don't you just go get your hair done?  Seriously, Chuck?  Anyways, we're losing this election.  Do you honestly think I don't know that?  Well, then what are we going to do about it, Chuck?  Huh?  Well, for now, we need to keep Joe hidden as much as possible.  That's actually a pretty good idea.  Hey, Barack, you know we got a problem, right?  Uh, nope, we got a big problem.  Hey, I don't gotta go nowhere, do I?  No, Joe, you ain't gotta go nowhere.  Okay, good, because I don't like going anywhere unless it's like a high school.  Hey, what are we gonna do?  We're losing this election.  Figure it out, Barack.  And give me some toilet paper while you're at it.  Hey, anybody got any cheese?  Hey, did someone order a pizza?  Hey, everybody, the pizzas are here.  Wink, wink.  What about the ice cream and vodka?  Did you bring the ice cream and vodka too?  Of course.  What kind of party would it be without ice cream and vodka?  And cigars.  Did someone say cigars?  Well, what are we going to do, guys?  We're just going to have to keep Joe hidden until we come up with a new plan.  Don't screw it up, Barack.  You ain't got no idea what I'm going through.  Hey, where's my cheese at?  You can't let Joe defeat Trump.  That's a no-brainer.  Huh?  But what if we say Joe is unfit to be president?  And then I run for president.  Actually, that's not a bad idea.  And then I can be vice president.  And then we can move back to the White House.  Hey, where's my cheese?  Oh, this pizza is delicious.  Oh, it tastes so good with ice cream, too.  I like my pizza with sauce on it.  I like pasta and hot dogs.  Adam loves his pasta and hot dogs.  Hey, Adam, you remember when you stayed at your standard hotel?  Yeah.  All you did was order pasta and hot dogs the whole time you were there.  Yeah, I love pasta and hot dogs.  I can't believe I'm going to be president.  I can't believe I'm going to be vice president.  I can't believe I still don't have my cheese.  All right, guys, let's get rid of Joe.  Somebody call Pelosi and tell her the good news.  Don't be starting that.  I need the help.  I ain't no mate.  You make your own phone call.  Easy, Michelle.  Wait, what, what?  So I just got word that Kamala is going to be running for president.  Oh, good.  Our problems are solved.  Oh, good.  Now I don't got to go to prison.  Okay, so if Kamala becomes president, does that mean carrots will be illegal?  Oh, my gosh.  I need some more ice cream and vodka.  Honestly, I'd like to have some ice cream and vodka, too.  I'm going to make some more pasta and hot dogs.  Anyone want some?  Oh, Adam. ",
