            "text": "back in my evangelical days i was what i like to call a fox news christian.  i listened to rush limbaugh michael savage glenn beck i read ann coulter and of course i watched fox news religiously here on the other side of my evangelical looking glass.  i wanted to go back and just sort of examine those days to get into the Fox News phenomenon, right-wing radio, the evangelicals who believe that this country belongs to their specific God for that God's specific purposes, based in the Bible.  The power grab by the theocrats, getting into the gun culture in the United States, linking it to a God and country narrative, so many other things related to to this culture.  So my new book, Confessions of a Former Fox News Christian, gets into that.  It officially releases to Amazon and Audible.com in August of this year.  But for my audience, for those who are interested... I'm making available an autographed copy.  You can pre-order that.  You can enter autograph instructions on the payment page, and I will personally autograph to you or whoever you wish the book, Confessions of a Former Fox News Christian.  Again, it won't ship for several months, but you can pre-order with autograph instructions right now.  So go to my website to do so.  That site is SethAndrews.com.  Now, for my international audience, I just have to apologize in advance.  I'm going to make the book available internationally because I know there are some masochists out there who don't mind paying extra for the shipping, but I'm not Amazon.  I don't have hubs around the world that make it economically viable to ship these books for just a few bucks internationally.  I'm going to give you the best rate that the post office gives me, but it ain't great.  In many cases, it's more than the cost of the actual book itself.  the best rate I've got.  So I'm going to make it available for those masochists who don't mind paying the extra.  I'm just going to do that.  But if you're looking for a reasonably priced option, I would wait.  I'd skip the autograph.  I would wait until the official rollout in August of this year.  So I just need to throw that caveat out there.  Thanks for your support.  I'm excited about this time, excited about the project, and I hope you are as well.  Pre-order, let me autograph a book for you.  Just go to sethandrews.com. ",
