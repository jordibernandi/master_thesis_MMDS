            "text": "Shalom, shalom.  Well, I wanted to make sure that I brought this piece of prophetic news.  In IsraelToday.co.il Israeli rabbi says he's already holding meetings with Messiah.  Now we know that Messiah already came.  Jesus Christ, Yeshua HaMashiach.  always existed, left glory, laid down his glory, was born of a virgin, wrapped in flesh, lived a perfect life, never sinned, and shed his precious blood on the cross to pay the debt for our sins, all our sins, past, present, and future, once and for all.  He died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  The gospel, as outlined in 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  The nanosecond less than you believe.  You are born again and dwelt with Holy Spirit.  Saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  Glory to God.  The ABCs of salvation is in the description box.  Well, this is really interesting.  I mean, this makes me rejoice when I'm hearing these things because whom they will believe, these rabbis, is Messiah, will be the Antichrist.  And we know that means that the body of Christ, hallelujah, is going to be harpazoed, caught up, raptured, because the bridegroom cometh, hallelujah, for his bride, the body of Christ.  Everyone who has believed on the Son of God and his redemptive finished work on the cross at Calvary, his death, burial, and resurrection.  And it never gets old, does it?  Well, listen to this.  This Israeli rabbi says he's already holding meetings with Messiah.  Rabbi Yaakov Siltzholz on Sunday told religious broadcaster Radio 2000 that Rabbi Haim said, Konovesky recently told him that he, Konovesky, is already in direct contact with Messiah, with Messiah.  Israelis, many of Israel's biggest names, biggest rabbis, are all afraid to leave the country lest they miss Messiah's coming.  Brothers and sisters, they're telling us that he's coming.  And we, as the body of Christ, we can see the times we're living in.  I had to bring that to you.  Now, I say this all the time.  We occupy and redeem the times.  There is no one on the planet, I don't believe it, who is more excited about the bridegroom coming.  Yeshua, Jesus, hallelujah, coming to catch his bride away than I am.  That being said, I don't, you know, I get accused of idolatry for that.  No, that's not true.  Who wouldn't be excited about Mashiach coming, about Jesus coming?  Hallelujah.  So, but I like to keep it in perspective.  I can't help myself.  He's coming.  Do you realize that?  That's glorious.  We are living in the final moments of the end of days.  Hallelujah.  I can't wait till that time.  But until then, I want to fulfill the destiny.  Glory to God.  I just, when people say to me, you're nuts, you're crazy, whatever.  Bring it.  I'm excited.  I know my bridegroom is coming.  You know what?  I've been married to one woman in my life.  One woman, the loveliest bride in all the land.  Actually, we had a disagreement today, but I'm not going to go into all that.  And it's not a biggie.  But anyway, what I was saying was we and I do need to get sleep tonight and I'm planning on it.  Praise God.  But you know what?  If not.  I can do all things through Christ, which strengthens me.  Hallelujah.  One one wife and I remember.  I wanted to be married to her so desperately.  Because we were honoring God with our lives.  We weren't saved by that.  We were already saved.  The nanosecond we believed.  Five years old.  Hallelujah.  My five-year-old grandson, I shared the testimony, just recently got saved.  Hallelujah.  He'll be six at the end of next week.  But praise God.  He believes on the Son of God, his death, burial, and resurrection.  He is saved, sealed, and sanctified.  Hallelujah.  Boom, done deal.  Hallelujah.  Heaven bound and rapture ready.  Now I'm going to help him be discipled until the Lord comes.  But glory to God.  So when my wife and I, when we were going to get married, oh, the excitement, the excitement, anticipating the wedding day and the wedding night.  Well, praise God.  I'm excited because our bridegroom coming.  Of course we should be excited about that.  And we know the times and the season we're in.  So don't ever feel... Odd.  Who cares what people say?  Be excited.  But also, let's be excited for every moment we have.  The Bible says that our life is like a vapor, a mist, here today and gone tomorrow.  And you know in the next 60 seconds, 105 people will breathe their last.  Oh, that we, the body of Christ, would have the heart... You know, God would that all would be saved.  We know they won't.  Well, I just wanted to encourage you.  I wanted to share that about what the rabbis are saying.  Glory to God.  I'm going to have to go get my praise on.  Remember, God loves you fiercely and passionately.  And greater is he who's in you than he who's in the world.  And the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead abides in you.  Shalom, shalom. ",
