They've now got a lesson on where their property begins and ends and the law.  Kudos to the St.  Johns County Sheriff's Department.  Hopefully I'm not speaking too soon for doing the right thing and not trespassing me.  It's all good?  Good to go, man.  All right.  I'll just let you know, man.  Yeah.  All I want to do is capture what they're telling the people to do, the procedures, the process, so the public will know.  I can edit out the tag numbers, and I'm waiting for the car to get in there so I'm not getting anybody's faces or anything like that.  I mean, I don't have to do that, but I'm doing it for privacy.

I'm out here at Flagler Hospital today because I was covering the COVID-19 testing site, which is located right over here in parking lot B at Flagler Hospital.  And moments ago, staff from the Flagler Hospital attempted to have me trespass what was Flagler Hospital property.  But the problem was this road that you see these vehicles driving on is Sergeant Tutton Drive.  It connects 312 out here, runs along and it goes up here to the right and connects to US 1.  It's public property, public sidewalks, as public as it can get.  And here's a perfect example to show you how I know that this is public property, Sergeant Tutton Drive.  Right there is a sign, Sergeant Tutton Drive, public road.  Over here on the side, it says San Bartolo Drive, which says PVT, private property.  PVT clearly marks this as a private road, San Bartolo.  Where Sergeant Tutton Drive, where I was standing, engaged in constitutionally protected activity, specifically freedom of the press, on the sidewalk, is public property.  You can see here, This is Sergeant Tutton Drive out here.  You come in here, there's still the public right-of-way, and you see the difference in the asphalt from where it's public property on Sergeant Tutton Drive to private property on San Bartolo Drive.  So I want you to put into perspective here.  Staff from Flagler Hospital, including security, healthcare workers, and administration, attempted to trespass from what they thought was Flagler Hospital property because I was engaged in freedom of the press.  And this is in the middle of a health care crisis, all right, during the middle of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.  What if I would have got sick and I was trespassed from the hospital?  What if a family member would have got sick and I was trespassed from the hospital?  Would that mean that I could not come and get health care, seek treatment for me or my family?  It's truly disgusting behavior.  from Flagler Hospital. ",
