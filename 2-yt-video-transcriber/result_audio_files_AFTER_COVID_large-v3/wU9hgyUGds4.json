            "text": "So a few weeks ago I started writing down a list of questions for Christians, because surprise surprise I do script my videos, and as I did so I started to recognize two main types of questions emerging.  Those that are more about the daily experiences of Christians and those that are more about popular arguments for God.  So last time I did the first type, but then this time when I set out to do the apologetics one, I found my list splitting once again into two types of questions.  this time between broad philosophical apologetics and apologetics surrounding the Bible.  So once more, what was going to be one video turned into two.  So if you want to hear my questions about things like arguments from design and stuff, stick around today.  If you want to hear my questions about things like the absolutely amazing number of New Testament manuscripts, come back next time.  Or if I'm really, really lucky, maybe you'll do both.  Now one final note, while I call these questions for apologists, these are not for professional apologists who probably won't care about questions like these because they, uh, don't exactly get paid to consider stuff like this.  I envision these questions being posed to average everyday Christians who hear popular apologetics in passing and think things like, where did the universe come from without God, is a slam dunk against atheism.  Hopefully these questions, while not drastically changing these Christians' minds, will help them at least start to see why atheists won't necessarily be blown away by their favorite over-the-pulpit arguments for God.  These are likely going to be your friends, neighbors, or even family, so as I implored you last time, be gracious and friendly in all your conversations.  This is more an intellectual than personal list so I'm not going to keep belaboring that point, but it's always worth keeping in mind.  With that, here are five questions for apologists.  Number one, why should an atheist have to explain things about science to justify not believing in God?  We've all heard it a million times.  If you don't believe in God, then explain how the universe came from nothing, or atheists think life evolved randomly from single-celled organisms.  But this obviously makes no sense for a couple reasons.  First off, why do people who don't believe in God have to think the same things about biology or cosmology?  People who don't believe in vampires don't share all the same ideas about science, right?  They just heard people propose a being exist, didn't find the evidence for it compelling, and thus don't believe.  Simple as that.  Yet somehow many apologists think not only that atheists will share the same ideas about how the world works, but that the moment someone says they don't believe in God, it suddenly becomes appropriate to ask them all kinds of questions about science.  This was dramatically illustrated in a Facebook post, which I'll replay here from my first dumb things video, in which a pastor I used to know said this.  Life is another challenge to the atheist.  Explain the reproductive process of the desert horned toad, one of many examples.  How can that evolve?  It had to be created that way.  There is no possible way it could evolve.  Explain the shrinking sun in light of billions of years, the slowing of the rotation of the earth.  Explain the rotation of planets and moons that are spinning the opposite way.  Of course this is totally uncalled for.  I mean pretend you and a friend are in a building and you hear a mysterious thumping coming from a locked room.  Neither of you know exactly what's causing the noise, right?  In this story, right, which is why I called it mysterious.  I mean, try to keep up, okay?  But your friend just tells you it's the ghost of King Louis XIV.  You chuckle and say, I don't believe you, and he says, well then explain everything about how the building's boiler and heating system works, implying that unless you can, you should believe in the ghost of King Louis XIV.  Now of course this would be absurd.  The fact that neither of you know what's causing the noise means you should both admit it and either investigate further or move on.  It does not mean that one of you should just make up a guess, then put the other person on the hook to actually explain stuff before not believing that guess.  I think the analogy to Christian apologetics is clear.  If someone tells you an invisible spirit being spoke the universe into existence, the next logical step in the conversation is for them to demonstrate their claim, not for them to suddenly start demanding you explain science for them just because you don't believe what they never proved.  2.  How does a person get from the conclusion that the universe's origins are unintuitive to the conclusion that God created the universe?  Of course, apologists don't think they're just guessing that God created the universe.  They claim to be able to deduce as much through argumentation, the most famous form of this being the Kalam Cosmological Argument.  Now yes, this syllogism is just riddled with problems, the most obvious being that it appeals to our simplified sense of intuition about cause and effect to draw conclusions about aspects of the universe that probably defy our intuition, but that's a lot to dig into here.  What I would ask a Christian is, even assuming this argument is both sound and valid, what does it conclude?  all it tells us is there was some cause to the universe.  One that we would probably infer is highly unintuitive, far different from anything we've seen so far, and likely beyond our imagination.  And because it's so far different from anything we know, it could be literally anything.  Maybe there's a purely natural reality that lies outside our realm of observation and defies the laws we've used to describe the universe so far.  Maybe space and time as we know it could be the unfolding of some higher dimensional structure.  Now yes, these are just guesses, but unlike apologists, I'm not making the grandiose claim that I can reason my way down to the right guess, much less start describing the origin of the universe's personality or tell you how it wants you to live your life.  The point is that the possibilities are endless, and we should recognize that whatever started the universe, if that's even an adequate way of describing the state of affairs, is currently so far outside our comprehension that using our intuition to even start arriving at an answer is jumping the gun.  This is perfectly illustrated by the part of William Lane Craig's opening debate script that tries making the jump from the universe having a cause to God actually being that cause. ",

            "text": "There must have been a cause which brought the universe into being.  Now, as the cause of space and time, this being must be an uncaused, timeless, spaceless, immaterial being of unfathomable power.  Moreover, it must be personal as well.  Why?  because the cause must be beyond space and time.  Therefore, it cannot be physical or material.  Now, there are only two kinds of things that fit that description, either an abstract object, like numbers, or else a personal mind.  But abstract objects can't cause anything.  Therefore it follows that the cause of the universe is a transcendent intelligent mind.  Thus the cosmological argument gives us a personal creator of the universe. ",

            "text": "I consider this Craig's single most embarrassingly transparent and unjustified leap toward a desired conclusion.  Think of how many things he just flatly asserts, of the insane deductions he claims to be able to make about a distant reality he doesn't know the first thing about.  I mean, really, he knows the universe's origin had to be immaterial?  He knows that the only immaterial things are abstractions and personal minds?  Or that there aren't amazing, heretofore unobserved yet natural realities that defy our categories of material and immaterial?  There are so many things we have yet to discover, to gradually incorporate into our understanding of the universe.  Yet instead of exploring and observing, meanwhile admitting what he doesn't yet know, Craig pretends he can solve the most amazingly vast, complex mysteries of the universe by sitting around pontificating like a jackass.  I got off on a rant there, but I think it's worth using the audacity of Craig's assumptions as a cautionary tale for Christians.  Watch Craig over and over in that clip.  catalog what he actually says, and come to terms with the fact that this gush of verbal diarrhea represents one of Christianity's most illustrious attempts at going from a cause to God.  Based on this, I would ask Christians, do you really feel qualified to jump to these kinds of conclusions?  If you didn't already believe in God, would you even dream of deducing such things?  How many other mysteries of the universe have ancient people been tempted to attribute to bigger conscious agencies and how many times has this conclusion ended up being correct?  3.  What would an undesigned universe look like to someone within that universe?  This is a pretty simple question, but I think it's worth getting a Christian to consider.  Apologists love saying the universe appears designed.  But this relies on us as small parts of that universe looking at it from the inside to conclude a lot of things about its workings by generalizing from how we alter parts of it.  This leads to all kinds of tricks of perception, the most obvious being articulated by the puddle analogy, that fool us into misunderstanding patterns or aspects of it that work to our advantage.  But if the universe appears designed, the first thing I'd ask is designed for what?  Most often the answer will be for life.  But as we've all heard a thousand times, practically the entire universe would instantly kill us, and we even have to struggle to survive on the small portion of our own planet that's even remotely hospitable to us.  On top of that, since the modern Christian version of the designer is all powerful and created everything from scratch, we must acknowledge that for every solution he designed, he also designed the problem.  For example, before God fine-tuned the earth to provide us oxygen, comfortable temperatures, and food, he first created us specifically so that we'd die without them.  Does that make any sense at all?  Why would he build us with unnecessary vulnerabilities that he actually had to imagine himself and then adjust the universe to accommodate them?  This self-defeating design process is also illustrated by a point I've made before, which is that an antelope only had to be intelligently designed to escape a cheetah because the cheetah had been intelligently designed to chase the antelope.  So proposing that God designed the universe leads to more problems than it solves, painting a comical picture of someone who repeatedly undermined himself in totally unnecessary and illogical ways.  So, considering how weird and convoluted the design of our universe is, I would challenge a Christian to consider what any undesigned universe would look like, especially to beings who lived within that universe, had adapted to it, and were used to its workings.  Hopefully, doing so might get a Christian to recognize the tricks of perception that lead people to see design and, by trying to recognize what an undesigned universe would look like by contrast to ours, see that, well, the undesigned universe might be just a little too similar to ours.  4.  If you believe that God is perfect or all-knowing, how did you arrive at this conclusion?  This question very succinctly demonstrates just how much Christians flatly assume about God.  To conclude that a being is perfectly good, you'd not only have to have a concept of good that's independent of that being, an idea that in and of itself is problematic for many Christians, but you'd have to judge that being based on your own concept of good.  To whatever extent you came to trust that being, you would do so because it lived up to your expectations, and you would, consciously or not, continue evaluating what it did.  This thought process belies the very idea of concluding a being as perfect.  In fact, I'd say that even forming a complete and consistent ideal of perfect good by which to judge this being is not only impossible but pretentious.  Just try describing any form of perfection in any level of detail.  In the course of trying, you'll probably end up changing your mind, running into paradoxes, and generally just arriving at a lot of uncertainty, right?  That's understandable because we're just human, and perfection might not even exist except as a vague abstraction that quickly becomes paradoxical.  Yet for all their claims to be fallible, fallen, imperfect, limited beings, Christians consider themselves amazingly astute at recognizing perfection when they see it.  The problem with determining that God's all-knowing is even more daunting.  Unless you know everything, how can you determine whether someone else does?  If there were something God didn't know, how would you know it?  And how would he know he didn't know it?  In the end, how can you distinguish between something that's super smart and knows like a bazillion times as much as you do, yet is still finite, from something that's actually all-knowing?  Hopefully, by getting Christians to see how difficult, even logically impossible it is to actually reach these conclusions about a being, you will get them to recognize that they have just assumed God is perfect because other people told them he was and they grew to feel it was virtuous to think he was.  5.  How would the existence or non-existence of a God make morality fundamentally different?  This question, of course, addresses moral arguments for God, as well as the often repeated assertion that, say it with me everybody, without God we have no basis for morality.  Somehow, a lot of Christians think that the very concept of morality hinges on God's existence.  But if you look at what morality actually is, a concept of right or wrong behavior, and start seriously pondering what makes things right or wrong, you have to start wondering how the existence of a higher being has anything to do with it.  In the end, acting morally, doing the right thing, doing what you ought, or however you want to phrase it, boils down to deferring immediate gratification for your long-term good and the good of those around you.  Seriously, try to think of any defensible concept of morality that doesn't in the end come down to that, or at least something similar.  When people think God's involved in this, it's for a couple main reasons.  First, he has greater insights into the consequences of our actions, and thus is better prepared than a human ever could be to instruct us on how to behave morally.  Also, you know, he's like super strong and can enforce moral behavior.  And while I guess such a being might be handy, all it would be doing is helping us navigate issues that would still exist in a godless universe.  It would be doing nothing to define morality, or even to have any impact whatsoever on what morality is.  Second, of course, is the idea that God defines morality.  Basically, morality, by definition, is whatever is in God's nature.  Of course, all this does is shift the definition of morality from any actual intelligible concept to the preferences of another being.  The problem with this is that God's nature would either, one, be such that his preferences align with the constructive, empathetic behaviors we associate with morality, or two, be indifferent to or even set in opposition to those behaviors, meaning he'd be what we consider cruel or uncaring.  If it's number one, it's just by coincidence, and if it's number two, he wouldn't be moral in any useful sense of the word.  So either way, we have an idea of morality that's separate from God, that he doesn't define, and that would exist in a universe with or without him.  I guess in the end we run into Euthyphro Dilemma type stuff.  In light of this, I would ask a Christian how God is important to, or even has anything to do with, the actual concept of morality.  If he's an enforcer, humans can be too.  If we're obligated to God, we can be equally, and just as objectively, don't even get me started on that word, obligated to other humans.  If he's an exemplar, humans can be too, though to lesser degrees, and the degree to which you exemplify an outside concept does not make that concept dependent on you.  And we can do our best to work toward good moral behaviors, even if a God doesn't instruct us.  And if God doesn't exist, aren't we better off doing that by systematically understanding our obligations to each other, instead of listening to people who claim to speak for someone who might or might not exist?

Which maybe I guess I should have said at the beginning, but eh.  And with that, I'll let our Sing the POZ song.  contributor outro for us. ",
