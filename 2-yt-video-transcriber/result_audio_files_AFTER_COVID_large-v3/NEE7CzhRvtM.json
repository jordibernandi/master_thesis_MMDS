            "text": "Right.  So I think that belief that, that part where you're sure that the vest can stop bullets, that was easier, and that Took about six months for me once I started investigating the New Testament, really the Gospels.  If you think about it, the theology that flows out of the life of Jesus and his ministry is really in the letters.  But whether or not it's true is going to be found in the Gospels, because there's some claims there that are grounded in historical events, allegedly grounded in historical events.  And so I spent a lot of time in the Gospels just because it appeared that.  And the reason why I always did that at all is because, you know, Susie wanted to, she thought she had been raised in a culturally Catholic setting.  And when we started having our kids, she felt like, well, shouldn't we be doing something, raising them with some beliefs?  And they are being raised with my beliefs because I have no beliefs about God.  But I also love Susie and I wanted to make sure that she got to raise the kids also the way that she thought was best.  And so I said, I was fine going to church if you want to go to church.  And my dad still does that.  He'll go to church with you, uh, as a non-believer, uh, because he thinks it has value.  Uh, and he's seen the value it has in raising kids and, and, and establishing a culture that he loves to live in.  Uh, so I, I went to church with her and this pastor was just, uh, very much, uh, followed a kind of a seeker sensitive model where he assumed every week that there were gonna be people in that room who were not believers.  And so always he would say something, he would make sure his words were couched in a way that they were at least open and were available to those of us who are not believers.  I didn't know.  that's why we were going.  I'd never stepped foot in that church before.  And I'd never really never stepped foot in a church of any kind, except if Susie was dragging me to a performance or as a wedding or as a funeral.  Uh, aside from that, I had no interest, but we went and, uh, he, he did talk about Jesus as this really smart guy who, whose moral teaching was so far ahead of its time that it established the foundation for Western civilization.

            "text": "Yeah, it's worth.  So I bought a Bible.  I bought a really inexpensive pew Bible.  I think I spent five or six bucks on it.  Um, I didn't know anything about translations, didn't know anything about anything.  But I bought that Bible and started reading through it.  And right away became interested in trying to get back to original languages as much as I could, not being somebody who had studied the original languages.  But just there was enough.  This was probably at the very beginning of the Internet age.  And there was some software available, but not a lot.  But there were books, lexicons that were out there that I was able to kind of.  So I just did my best.  to see what they were telling me.  I thought I was going to open up scripture and it would be more like proverbial statements, you know, more like Proverbs or like the writings of Baha'u'llah, the Baha'i prophet, or where I would just be assessing these claims because this guy says this is really smart.  Okay, fine.  But what I find is that there's actually historical narratives that are claiming something happened in real time and in a real place and in a real sequence of events with real people.  Well, that's something that now I was really interested because that's often what my casework is like because you're looking at an event, any crime that you investigate as an event in the past.  It can be an event that's two hours old, two days old, two weeks old, in my case, 35 years old, if it's a cold case homicide.  And so there's a skill set you can put into place when you're assessing reports related to eyewitness accounts that are old.  And I just started to apply those to the gospels.  And that's why after about six months, I was really probably at that belief that stage where I was like, okay, I remember telling Susie, I think this is, I think if you asked me, I would say, I believe these are reporting something true.  I don't get the whole dying on a cross thing.  Do you get that?  I was like, you know, I don't, Even if it was true, I don't understand because I didn't.  I wasn't looking at the theology of it.  I wasn't.  I was simply trying to assess the claim.  The problem is, if you think these are telling you something true, then you're stuck with the dude who comes out of the grave.  Right.  And what are you going to do with this guy?  And so now I'm trying to process what this all means.  And I mean, it was a lot, lot longer process than that, because a part of that that search was to.  I have such ingrained.  naturalistic tendencies that i rejected anything supernatural.  if you can't explain it with space time matter of physics and chemistry i'm not interested.  that's really where i was for a long time and i had to kind of figure out if that if if my naturalism was well grounded.  and so that's that's in a book called god's crime scene which is really the way.  so i'm kind of doing these two things uh parallel and uh.  but in the end i had to move toward belief in and i i kind of put it this way For example, I spent 90% of my time in those first six months in the Gospels.  I mean, I've read the letters, but I would go back to the Gospels.  Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.  What is that word in the original language?  Where else is that word used by that author?  I'm not really trying to get to the meaning. ",

But you wouldn't be able to ask, what do you think he meant?  Because now you're making an inference that you can't read his mind.  All you can report as the witness is what did he do.

You'll have belief that.  But if you're willing to look and investigate the scripture to see what it says about you, you will transition to belief in.  Because it's only when I read how it described me and I realized, yeah, that's true.  That's who I am.  I was at a point where I could recognize that this is telling the truth not only about Jesus, but the truth about me.  My need for a savior and the identity of the savior.  Good timing because one solves the other.  And I ended up becoming a Christian.  Thanks so much for watching our video.
