Such has been his flagrant disregard for basic economics that his mismanagement of the city has now resulted in him having to go to Boris Johnson to beg for a bailout.  Who could have seen this coming?  Well, me actually, back in June 2019.  Take a look at this. ",

And now the egregious weasel Khan is using the coronavirus as cover for his own inept management of the city's resources.  They are currently running a \u00a3600 million a month deficit and money is set to run out unless Big Buck's daddy Rishi Sunak finds another magic money tree somewhere.  In addition, he's had to raise fares again, again citing COVID-19.  But as Sean Bailey, his mayoral rival, has pointed out, this is a flagrant lie.  His initial price freeze, keeping ticket prices below inflation while doubling staff wages, is clearly the ultimate thing to blame here.  And let's not even get into the awful crime situation in London again.  And so I call, as I have so many times before, for Sadiq Khan to resign.  Sadiq Khan resign.  Sadiq Khan resign.  Now get out.
