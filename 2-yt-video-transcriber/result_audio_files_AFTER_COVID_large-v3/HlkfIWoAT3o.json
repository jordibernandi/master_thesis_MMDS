            "text": "Hi guys don't mind me today we are going to Cote d'Ivoire.  that's why i'm speaking french.  welcome back to my channel.  how you guys doing.  as for me you can see i'm fine.  thank you so much for coming back.  um thank you for the comments the love the everything you do for me on this channel.  guys i appreciate every one of you.  so as you can tell already today i'm in high spirits because i have good news for you guys.  but before we do that how does my hair look?  someone told me to change my hairstyle so i've done it.  how does it look?  fine right thank you.  have you subscribed?  no go ahead.  Thank you for subscribing.  So let's go into the topic for today.  Some of you say I talk too much so I'll try and keep it brief today.  So today I want to share with you something good, something positive coming out of Cote d'Ivoire.  A lot of you have nudged me to check that story out so I found it very interesting and I couldn't imagine that all this way.  I have not come across the story.  Anyway, so what's the news?  I'm talking about a former footballer with Chelsea FC from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ivory Coast, in the name of Didier Drogba.  So what has Drogba done?  Drogba is involved in charity, you know.  He does a lot of charity work through his foundation, the Didier Drogba Foundation.  he has built a school in in a community in code of what to you know facilitate access for children you know to education.  so a number of children have been able to access education through his foundation and of course through the school he has built.  Now they can learn in conducive environments.  Good, right?  That's not all.  So in the wake of this pandemic, Didier Drogba already has a hospital that he has built.  Of course, through his foundation, he does charity work to help in the areas of education and access to health care.  So he has a hospital that he has built in Abidjan there in Cote d'Ivoire.  So in the wake of the pandemic, in addition to him adding his voice, you know, to campaign for prevention amongst Ivorians, he has also given out his hospital to be used as a treatment center.  This is a state of the art hospital, not just a clinic.  You know, not just the roadside, you know, clinic.  We could take managed body.  State of the art hospital.  Remember guys, recently following the proposal by the French doctors to test COVID-19 vaccines on Africans in Africa.  Didier Drogba was one amongst the, you know, African celebrities.  to publicly condemn that act.  He has been vocal about issues, taking part actively and campaigning for prevention of the spread in Africa, especially amongst Cote d'Ivoire citizens.  Ivory Coast has about 500 cases that have been confirmed already in the country and the government, as usual, is doing all they can to provide treatment and prevention services to the citizens of Cote d'Ivoire, but in the spirit of patriotism and seeing that there's a need and he has the means to help, he offered this hospital to be used for the treatment.  How cool and how noble, how thoughtful and kind of him.  And of course, because of his acts, he has been hailed as being patriotic.  Who wouldn't hail him as being patriotic?  I always say this, guys.  As Africans, we hold our destiny in our hands.  We are the ones to rewrite our story and change the narrative about ourselves.  You know, it's true that there's a lot that has been said erroneously about Africans, Africans being a poor continent, Africans being people who are helpless and waiting for some Messiah somewhere and all of that.  But if we look at our story, you know, we are heroes of our own stories.  A lot is being done on the continent.  We are taking initiatives.  Even before the COVID pandemic got to Africa, A lot of Africans who are privileged, who have access to resources, have been doing a lot, you know, to better the lot and better the circumstances of the lot of Africans who are not as privileged as they are.  As you all know, the Drogba Foundation has been in existence for years.  The hospital we are talking about was opened since 2016.  So it has already been providing healthcare services to people of, you know, Cote d'Ivoire, people of Ivory Coast.  That's the name in English.  But given the need, the urgent need for more accelerated access to health care.  He offered the hospital.  use it to treat.  This is just, you know, a clarion call on all of us Africans, both on the continent and in the diaspora, that we have our part to play.  When we see needs on the continent, when we see needs around us, we should rise to the responsibility of meeting those needs, especially when we have the means to.  His hospital could as well just be lying there.  It is his hospital.  Nobody is going to question him for that.  But he saw that there is a need.  And he has risen up to that occasion.  Did I also mention to you that prior to this incident, I think in 2019, he signed an MOU with the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Ministry of Education to facilitate access to education, to promote literacy amongst you know, youth of Ivory Coast within the shortest possible time, I think within the period of the next five years.  So he has been actively involved and vocal about issues that concern Africa and Africans.  So African celebrities on the continent and in diaspora, this is a clarion call for you.  You have used your talent, obviously, to improve your circumstance.  Your talent has paved the way for you to access resources.  It's a duty on you to use your resources to better the lot of the rest of Africans on the continent and in diaspora who are not as privileged as you are, you know, to access similar opportunities.  We only rise by lifting each other up.  And if you are talking about changing the story about Africa, you know, developing Africa and making Africa to become the... envy of the world in the next shortest possible number of years then it is our responsibility.  we have to join hands to take up on this responsibility.  oftentimes you see a lot of youth on the continent just wasting away a lot of talent and all of that but no access to opportunities.  so it's important for us to pave way for others when we have the opportunity to.  And on a lighter note, my fellow African youth, this is just a call on all of us to use the resources that we have within our reach wisely.  Drogba used his talents to play football, make a living and to, you know, improve his community, improve his country and the continent in general.  Don't use all of your money to go and do betting, spot betting.  You bet from morning till night.  in season and out of season.  i'm sure.  now that covid 19 has shut down the world and things like football are not being played again you know some people are not happy.  you had the opportunity to keep betting.  you'll be betting but let's let's check you keep betting and you're not winning anything.  how about putting that money together to start a business no matter how little it is?  use those resources and do something reasonable instead of betting.  betting betting Instead, engage in a business.  This might come across as offensive to some people, but please take it in good spirit that a sister is talking to you because a sister cares for you and a sister cares for our rising, every one of us, okay?  So rethink.  even when the leagues have come back and everything try as much as possible even if you must bet minimize how much resources you're committing to betting on.  try to also invest some of those resources into you know a productive venture that will keep yielding some returns for you.  so by reason of this kind gesture now more people are going to access treatment.  you know people who would probably lose their lives as a result of lack of access to treatment or treatment facilities.  Now that gap has been closed.  And who has done this?  A fellow African like you and I. So thank you so much, Drogba.  Thank you everybody for watching today's video.
