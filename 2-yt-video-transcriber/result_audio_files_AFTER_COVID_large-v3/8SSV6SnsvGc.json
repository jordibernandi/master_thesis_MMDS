            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters.  It's Pastor Tim.  It looks like it's going to be an all-nighter for me, but all glory to God.  We are in the final moments of the end of days, so we want to occupy and redeem the time.  I was actually... I've talked to several of our brothers and sisters.  I was on the phone with Brother Greg Jackson just moments ago, and I could literally hear... a helicopter over his house in Denver area.  And he said the sky was full of helicopters.  His precious wife, I believe it was his precious wife, who said, what is it, the end of the world?  And he said, yes, as we know it.  And anyway, you know, what a blessing that brother is.  Brother Greg, G-R-E-G-G Jackson, bro, love you.  My brother from another mother.  We're going to get to spend the rest of eternity together here very soon.  Well, anyway, I was sharing with Brother Greg and some others earlier, and I'm just compelled to share with you.  I was driving.  I was talking to another.  I don't even want to say their name, but a beloved friend.  member of the family of God.  And I said, wow, the Holy Spirit just really spoke into my spirit this.  And it was so clear, like the Lord speaking to me clearly.  And it was this, there are many, and this should be no surprise to us, but there are many, I mean, the Lord was adamant about it.  There are many who have sat in churches, in church pews and chairs.  And you've heard me say many times, if you've followed for any time, length of time, that sitting in a church pew or chair no more makes you a true believer, a convert, a Christian, than sitting in a garage makes you a car.  There are many, the Lord, spoken in my spirit, that have sat in churches for decades and have never been true converts.  They are not rapture ready.  What makes you rapture ready?  What makes you heaven bound?  Well, we know that Romans 3.23 says, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Romans 6.23, The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  We believe in the eternally self-existing God as the Bible expresses in the persons of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  God the Son, the Son of God, left glory, laid down his glory, was born of a virgin, wrapped in flesh, lived a perfect life, never sinned, and shed his precious blood on the cross at Calvary to pay the debt for our sins once and for all, past, present, and future.  He died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  That's the gospel, 1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  The nanosecond you believe on him.  It is an event.  You are saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  The ABCs of salvation is in the description box, and I've done a video.  Faith plus nothing equals salvation and eternal security.  Ephesians 2, 8, and 9 tells us, for by grace are we saved through faith.  and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, lest any man should boast.  We're saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.  Solo fide, John 3, 16, for God's soul of the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Hallelujah!  Well, it never gets old, does it?  Well, the Lord went on, because not only did he tell me there are those who have sat for decades, he said to me, there are those who have stood behind pulpits, career pastors and preachers, not called to that, but career.  And he said there has been not even one convert from their teaching.  God have mercy on us.  And what the Lord was communicating to me was, there are many who wear the label of Christian.  But brothers and sisters, there are so few that have truly and lightly of the masses who have truly trusted in the finished redemptive work of Jesus on the cross of Calvary for the remission of all their sins.  And what I'm telling you is we're blowing the shofar.  This is last call.  Brothers and sisters, time is of the essence.  You are not guaranteed your next breath.  Am I saying the rapture is tonight?  No, I'm not saying that.  Am I saying the rapture could happen before I finish this video?  Absolutely.  It's imminent.  It could happen at any moment.  And we know, while we don't know the day nor hour, we know the season we are in.  By the way, that day nor hour, I've done teaching on that, talking about the second coming.  But truly, we know we shouldn't be caught unaware.  We know the season we're in.  What more has to be revealed?  Wow.  Believe on the Lord Jesus.  You know, Romans 10, 13 says, all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  The jailer in Acts said to Paul and Silas, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.  And you will be saved.  You and your household.  Brothers and sisters.  Over 200 verses in the Bible.  Solo fide.  Faith plus nothing.  Equals salvation and eternal security.  I had to get on.  Just that unction.  That urgency.  Tell your loved ones.  Tell them while you can.  Let's be bold in proclaiming the gospel.  Christ died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  We call it the ABCs of salvation.  Admit you're a sinner in need of a Savior, in need of saving, and believe, hallelujah, on the finished redemptive work of Jesus on the cross at Calvary for the remission of all your sins, past, present, and future.  Hallelujah.  And then we, you know, admit you're a sinner in need of a Savior, believe.  We... Some say confess Christ or call upon his name.  That comes because we believe.  It's really believing.  Believe on the Son of God.  You know, the person who admits they're a sinner in need of saving and cries out, Son of God, have mercy on me.  Believing on Mashiach, on Messiah, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Messiah is saved.  It's saved.  Hallelujah.  It's glorious.  Oh, the love of God.  I pray if you have not believed that you believe.  It is not about us or anything.  The prophet Isaiah describes our righteousnesses like filthy rags.  Romans says, there is none righteous, no, not one.  2 Corinthians 5.21, for God made him.  Who's him?  Jesus, Son of God, God the Son, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Messiah.  For God made him who knew no sin.  Jesus, to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.  Hallelujah.  The nanosecond, it's an event.  You believe, you are indwelt with Holy Spirit, born again, saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  A couple verses on our eternal security, Ephesians 4.30 and Ephesians 1.13 and 14.  Brothers and sisters, Oh, believe on the Lord Jesus.  And it's finished.  He cried out to Telestai.  It is finished.  The debt is paid in full.  The job is perfectly done.  I'm telling you, when the Lord put that in my spirit, there was just a knowing, a knowing.  Oh, well, in any event, Look up and rejoice for our redemption draws nigh.  God bless you guys.  Shalom, shalom.  And have an awesome rest of your day. ",
