By contrast, the third use of Columbo takes us more on the offensive, yet in an inoffensive way.  We ask a different kind of question, sometimes called a leading question.  As the name suggests, leading questions take the other person in the direction we want them to go.  Greg may consider this to be an offensive, but in a court of law setting, leading questions are considered a dishonest tactic and one that distorts the truth.  Objection, Your Honor.

Now, despite any instinctual intuitions one may have that there is any kind of objectiveness to this phrase, in reality, and upon reflection, actions and potential actions exist on a spectrum.  Each individual has outcomes that they prefer to others.  Some actions more likely lead to preferred outcomes, and we label those as good.  Other actions are more likely to lead to undesired outcomes, and we label those bad.  But notice that in using the phrase, bad things, Greg is forcing the listener to bring their answer, imagining undesired outcomes.  It doesn't matter if Greg and the listener would have any common ground on what things are desirable or undesirable.  the listener answers with their own context.  similarly the phrases be punished or pay for them.  the listener's mind will automatically fill in the punishments and payments that the listener deems to be appropriate and proportional for the actions they personally find distasteful.  The listener will also bring their own model of punishment.  Perhaps they desire retributive justice that divvies out revenge.  Or perhaps a deterrent model where punishment is meant to influence others to want to avoid similar consequences.  Or maybe merely restorative, where the punishment attempts to restore the victim's prior state.  These are vastly different models.  But Greg doesn't care.  Someone not paying attention to this ambiguity will, of course, answer yes, as the question is asking no more than, do you want people to act in the way you want them to act?  It is a tautology.  Someone paying attention will ask Greg follow-up questions.  Moral according to whom?  Bad according to what standard?  Punishment according to what criteria?  Payment according to what scale?

First, this hypothetical god must be sufficiently demonstrated to exist before we can entertain a secondary notion of standards, which would also need to be subsequently demonstrated.

Ask for clarification.  These are not dodges.  These are necessary.  Bad by what standard?  Punishment by what standard?  Payment by what standard?  Can you demonstrate that the victim of the so-called sin actually exists?  This chapter of Greg's book draws to a close with this observation.  When a cherished few is at stake, it is not unusual for people to raise empty objections.  Objections that initially sound worthwhile, but simply can't be defended once examined.  Questions aimed at undermining the view often reveal a lack of substance behind the bluster.  I recommend we take this advice and ask those questions that will reveal the lack of substance behind Greg's bluster. ",
