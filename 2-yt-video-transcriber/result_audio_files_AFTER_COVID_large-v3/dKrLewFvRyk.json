It isn't about superiority or inferiority, dominance or stereotypes.  It isn't about looking backward.  It isn't about violence.  No race is the enemy.  No genetics makes a person virtuous.  My work is about white well-being.  And no matter what race you are, the race of your wife or husband or children, your sexual orientation or your checkered past, if you serve white well-being, you are welcome here. ",
