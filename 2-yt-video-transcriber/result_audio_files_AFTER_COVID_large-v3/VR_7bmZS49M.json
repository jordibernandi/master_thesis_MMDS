            "text": "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.  Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies.  Thy father's children shall bow down before thee.  The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come.  .  .  .  .  .  .  Hector!  Hector!  Father, forgive me for any offenses.  I've served you as best as I could.  Hector.  No father ever had a better son.  What's your name?  Eleus.  Do you know how to use a sword?  Yes.  The sword of Troy.  As long as it remains in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future.  Protect them, Aeneas.  Find them a new home.  I will.  Hurry!  Thanks for watching!  And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him, for this is he.  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren.  And the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.  I have found David my servant.  With my holy oil have I anointed him, With whom my hand shall be established, Mine arm also shall strengthen him.  The enemy shall not exact upon him, Nor the sun of wickedness afflict him.  And I will beat down his foes before his face, And plague them that hate him.  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.  If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments, if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments, then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.  Nevertheless, my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.  Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.  His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his hosts, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it.  And they built forts against it round about.  And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.  And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.  And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden.  Now the Chaldeans were against the city round about, and the king went the way toward the plains.  And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho.  And all his army were scattered from him.  So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah.  And they gave judgment upon him.  And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.  But Johanan, the son of Chariah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven.  to dwell in the land of Judah, even men and women and children and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuchadnezzar, the captain of the guard, had left with Gadaliah, the son of Ahicham, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch, the son of Neriah.  So they came into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord.  Thus came they even to  Tophonis.\".  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
