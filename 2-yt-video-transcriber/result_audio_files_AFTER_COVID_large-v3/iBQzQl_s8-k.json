            "text": "Well, all I have to say is that that's the objective.  That's the ultimate objective of codification.  Even dealing with white people, non-white people, the ultimate objective is that every contact that you make with a person, you come away with that contact with a result that has been of very constructive value to you, to the other person and everybody involved.  Otherwise, these contacts should not exist.  That's the logic.  People have been on this planet for thousands of years, millions of years, and the contacts are terrible.  Most of them have gotten to the place where most of us, where we glorify, killing each other.  We have parades.  I mean, talking about how many people we kill.  We won a war.  Won a war?  Stop and think about that.  This is something to have a parade about?  You won a war?  What does that mean, when you won a war?  Well, we killed a lot of people.  Well, stop and think about that.  And this is what you're having a parade for?  Flying flags and beating drums?  and a lot of people carrying the same rifles that they carried when they killed someone, destroyed something that the Creator made that you can't make, and you're having a parade about this?  Everybody all lined up and dressed up and grinning and tooting horns and firing off something called fireworks.  The person who the last thing they heard was a gunshot, that person doesn't want to hear any fireworks.  That's the last sound that they heard before they fell with blood gushing out of their mouths.  And then they died on a battlefield.  Do you think that they appreciate gunshots?  No.  Well, what's this parade about?  See, we are absolutely, sophisticatedly insane.  All of us and the white supremacists have fed this more than anybody and made it worse.  I don't say they invented it, but I'm saying as long as it's been around, they just made this particular thing worse when they should be saying, hey, we're going to change this world for the better.  No more of these military parades or none of that.  I mean, showing off military hardware.  No, when you land your plane and come to visit the new people of this planet, when we visit each other, we're going to have our carpenters out there to greet you, our doctors out there to greet you, somebody who repairs something, somebody that does repair work, plumbers, bricklayers.  We're going to have a fellow out there with a hard hat on.  I mean, he's going to have his tape measure and whatnot.  I mean, tape measure in one hand, you'll shake your hand with the other hand.  Then he'll show you his tape measure, his new one, the new electronic tape measure.  that does a whole lot of calculations real fast.  All right, and he's going to take his hand and put that in your hand and present that to you when you get off the plane.  rather than somebody salute you because you killed somebody.  This is a bunch of foolishness.  Yes, sir.  By people who are supposed to be super intelligent.  But we are intelligent, but for the incorrect reasons.  Yes, sir.  Stop glorifying death.  Start, you know, if you're going to celebrate, celebrate, you know, making somebody alive. ",
