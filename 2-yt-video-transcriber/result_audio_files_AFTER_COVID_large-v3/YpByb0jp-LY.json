So I wasn't going to do any videos, but man, I saw this and I was like, dude, there's no way I cannot do a video on this.  Where do I start?  It's going to be a difficult thing to comprehend, right, for you guys.  So let me show you guys the video.  Let me show you the video and then we'll discuss what's going on. ",

            "text": "The Iowa caucus is essentially the perfect example of systemic racism.  91% of the voters in Iowa are white.  The reason why you see a drop in turnout, I'm just speculating here, it could be perhaps that white children are not in the cages.  So when you're talking about the tangible pain that black and brown people are feeling, they feel a sense of urgency because their kids are being put in cages, right?  The Iowa caucus is essentially the perfect example. ",

            "text": "Now, I know you guys, some of you guys are going to be like rewinding that and do what you got to.  But long story short, she's saying that, you know, our caucus voter turnout isn't as, I guess, high maybe as anticipated.  And she's blaming that on.  I guess racism, specifically black and brown kids being locked in cages.  Now, this is why and where more so mainstream leftists lose people because, and a lot of people are starting to wake up to what they do.  And it doesn't matter if they're Republican, libertarian or anything like that, or even People that have historically, for the most part, aligned themselves with, let's say, Democrats in this case.  Because.  The race card in this element, right, or pulling some aspect of racism is the.  The card that they pull everywhere, right?  And she is trying to, her name is Zelina Maxwell, I believe is how you pronounce her name.  But she's trying to pull this and take this angle.  that doesn't even make any sense.  But that sort of thing happens.  It happens when you can't actually... explain it.  you're just more so looking at an end game that you're trying to prove and that's racism.  right that's just racism racism racism.  how they get there.  clearly she's not concerned because it doesn't even make any sense right?  because she's talking about well the white kids on in the cages and all of this it's like.  well The white kids aren't the ones that are voting.  Anyway, right?  And the ones that, you know, if the claim is that there are black and brown people in jail, in cages.  more so, if that is the claim, the black and brown kids, they don't vote either.  And this is the side of rhetoric, obviously, you guys know when you talked about border... enforcement, dare I say, and that's the angle that they took, the whole locking people up in cages.  So they're gonna repeat that, repeat that, and repeat that because they feel like it takes a knock at everybody.  that is maybe against their narrative.  This does not make any sense, okay?  Like what she's saying doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't make a lick of sense.  It doesn't, it's like, Are you trying to connect the dots?  And I watched this several times trying to make sense of what angle she's going.  She's talking about a sense of urgency.  I'm like, are you trying to say that they, because the people are in cages, they feel this sense of urgency?  And I'm like, wouldn't that mean that they would be more itching to try to go vote and stuff like that, which would mean a boost in turnout?  if that's the claim?  You know what I mean?  This whole urgency thing.  So it doesn't make sense.  But she is so fixated on applying race to this that that's what it came out.  That's what came out.  It doesn't make sense.  I know it doesn't make any sort of sense.  I watched it several times.  Like, what is she talking about, man?  Like, what does that have to do with any of this?  You know, it's Iowa.  I'm pretty sure most of the voters anyway out there are not.  I'm pretty sure I know most of them out there are white anyway.  But The angle that she take that she's taken makes absolutely no sense.  She just wanted to say use this as an opportunity to say, OK, there's existence of systematic or systemic racism.  Again, how she got there wasn't important because that makes no sense.  I mean, you're talking grasping for the all the straws you possibly can.  This is a huge reach.  But again, if there's anything that you should be able to learn from it is that not only does it show you guys these mainstream leftists and sort of tactics, but it really does highlight more so how they are so obsessed.  And everybody knew this, I would hope.  But you're seeing it in action.  They are so obsessed with this concept of politics.  applying racism that they try to apply to every single thing right.  and when you are more obsessed as opposed to analyzing it honestly as opposed to looking at it objectively and you're more fixated on okay i want to prove something here that is racist.  that's what comes out.  it's like dude.  this doesn't make any sense.  It makes absolutely no... I had to do a video on this.  There's not much else I can say because it sounds ridiculous and the video almost... makes itself creates itself.  But seriously, guys, you see the type of tactics, you know, mainstream leftism and what they try to do.  And they try to look at racism in everything.  Right.  And everything, God forbid, they get a result that is unfavorable, that, you know, there's a bunch of different factors that could maybe go into why they utterly, you know, I guess, fail.  to meet what they thought the line they thought they probably should have met when it came to, let's say, I don't know, caucus voters, right?  Reggie, I don't know.  Like, right.  I don't know.  It's like when you look at something like that, why people don't do that.  I mean, a lot has happened over the last two or four years.  Like, who knows?  But as opposed to analyzing it as such, first thing she's saying, the results when this was put out.  The results of the, you know, they're still having this whole shadow app thing going on, so they don't really know the inconsistencies in the results.  So at the time, they didn't know what the results were.  anyway, for the most part.  She is already throwing that card, right?  Dude, that's not the way to do it. ",
