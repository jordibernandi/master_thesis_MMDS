            "text": "I think Brian was just happy to get out of there.  That was almost seven minutes.  of Breonna Keillor solidly pushing the Trump White House official on the issue of healthcare, knowing full well that Trump doesn't have a healthcare plan, has never had a healthcare plan, has been saying for years that he has a healthcare plan, has never shown anything, has never presented any healthcare plan.  Before the election, Trump was saying that his healthcare plan, he would have everyone covered.  Under Trump's healthcare plan, everybody would be covered.  Well, Where's the plan?  That was four years ago.  They have no plan.  All they have tried to do is repeal the Affordable Care Act, which, if you know anything about what I do, is not a great plan.  The Affordable Care Act is literally a Republican plan from the 90s.  It is a Heritage Foundation health care plan from the 90s.  It is a private insurance-based health care plan.  That is capitalism 101, tying health care to private insurers for the rest of time.  This is why Trump has never presented a healthcare plan.  Because how further right could he possibly go?  What healthcare plan could he possibly present that would cover pre... Could he possibly present that would cover pre-existing conditions and still guarantee everyone healthcare while also keeping it a private insurance-based system?  What could he possibly do?  That's what Obamacare is.  It is a Republican healthcare plan.  And... Brianna here did everything you should do.  There's only one thing that I would have done extra, and that's I would have brought in the discussion about how far right Obamacare is and what could Trump possibly do and maybe bring up Medicare for all.  But then I guess that'd be getting too into the weeds on on what should actually be done in health care.  And I guess, you know, hosts can't really do that, though they should.  But.  She did everything you're supposed to do here in terms of bringing up clips.  So, you know, credit also goes here to the producers for having this stuff ready.  Those two different Trump clips about Trump saying he's going to have a health care plan in a few weeks.  Brilliant.  This is exactly what you do because it shows you how dishonest the administration is.  They have no plan.  They have never had any plan.  And part of the reason you rarely see this kind of pushback really is because of commercials.  Hosts on television have to worry about time, so they can't just keep going forever.  I guarantee you the only reason they cut off there at about seven minutes is because they had to go to a commercial.  Otherwise, it would go on forever.  And Brianna should try to keep pushing Brian on that question of health care.  But again, their limitations are on... It's all about timing.  And also, I mean... There are other limitations as well in terms of corporate donors.  And this is also very rarely why you see proper analysis on Medicare for all because Medicare for all cuts out private insurance and you see a ton of private insurance commercials on CNN, on MSNBC, on Fox News.  So they very rarely give you the actual straight truth on a single payer system and how beneficial it would be and how awesome it's been in Canada and other countries that have some kind of universal health care system.  But so there's that limitation as well.  But ultimately, look, this is this is exactly what I want to see.  This is what you should expect from journalists.  Again, Brianna Keillor shouldn't get too much credit here because this is just this is what their job is.  But we also have to encourage this.  So, look, if you're on Twitter, send her a message, tell her a good job.  I want to see that more often because this is the kind of thing we should expect out of cable news. ",
