            "text": "Hey guys, this is Pastor Allen and I hope you're enjoying this video and we're going to dive right back into it here in a moment.  But we're at a place right now in our nation where we need one thing and one thing more than any other.  We need a revival of the Holy Ghost.  Just over a year ago, God spoke to my heart to publish a book called Encounter.  Are you ready to experience more of God's power and presence?  And in that book, I walk you through the revivals of the past and overlay that with your life and with what's happening in the nation today.  Let me share with you just what Mario Murillo had to say about my book Encounter.  He said, Encounter is not just a book.  It is the right book for this moment.  Don't just read it.  Absorb it into your spirit.  It is the word of the Lord for this desperate hour.  It sounds the alarm, but more importantly, it infuses us with faith for an awesome intervention of God.  It's truly humbling to have someone like Mario Murillo say that about this book.  Even Dr.  Rod Parsley wrote the foreword of the book and said that this book is indispensable in this hour.  I wouldn't have written it.  I wouldn't make it available to you if I didn't believe that was true as well.  That's why in the month of January.  We're offering this book to you for a gift of any size.  We just want to put it into your hands.  All you have to do is go to EncounterToday.com and you'll see the special offer tab there in the menu.  And you click on it and for your donation, fill in all your information so that we can ship it to you.  But for your gift of any size, we will send it to you to be a blessing to you and to thank you for partnering with our ministry.  We're not going to be doing this very long.  Supplies are limited on this book.  So go right now to EncounterToday.com and get your copy.  Now let's dive back into the video.  And I want to get into what I believe is probably the most important prophetic word that I've heard concerning 2021.  Every minister has something they're coming out with praying for word.  I've even had something that the Lord has shared with me.  But what God shared with you.  And what God has spoken through you, I believe is the most important word the body of Christ needs to hear.  Those of you watching online right now, share this message.  Share this video right now while you're watching because everyone needs to hear this.  Let's get into what I believe is the most important word.  You said, don't go after predictions for what will happen.  Seek God and then make something happen.  Unpack that for us. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  Well, I'll tell you what it is, is that we became spectators.  We started chasing prophets, debating.  This prophet said Trump was going to win, and he didn't.  And if you wanted to get a hearing in social media, just do a prophetic word.  Just get up there and say, after this, this is going to happen.  And people started looking at it the way the world reads their horoscope.  It became a fascination, but it created an apathetic spectator spirit.  And if you want a word from God, read the Bible.  If you want a word from God, read the Bible.  And what's going to happen to you is you're going to realize that God wants to do something through you.  And there are plenty of things.  You know, when Paul the Apostle didn't have guidance, he tried to go to Mysia, and God said no.  Acts 16.  He tried to go to Bithynia.  God said no.  He tried to go to Arabia.  God said no.  You know what he did?  He laid down and he saw a vision of the man from Macedonia saying, come over and help us.  And ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly what happened.  He saw that God had clearly given him direction.  The people who are going to be directed by God today are the ones that are already trying to do something.  You know, let me tell you, there are cities, and I won't name them, where big Bible colleges exist, gigantic Christian training centers.  And what is the phenomenon in many of them is that the graduates ended up working in restaurants, working in this profession and the other, and never left the city.  Why?  Because they were waiting for a church to call them.  They submitted resumes and waited for a church to call them.  What am I doing?  Well, I'm waiting on tables because I'm waiting for someone to call on me.  That's not how it works, folks.  If you've graduated from Bible college, then you've got to understand, you have to assume nobody's going to call me, but that doesn't matter because God called me.  So I need to start something.  I need to start a ministry.  I need to pray and determine in my mind that I'm going to do something.  And that's why I say to people, don't look for predictions of 2021 and what will happen in 2021.  Seek God and then make something happen. ",

They got the dynamic deal, which I believe is still available on your website while supplies last.  It's $20 for Vessels of Fire and Glory and Reaching Critical Mass.  Now, Reaching Critical Mass, for those of you who don't know, and you need to get your copy of these books at mariamarillo.org, is a revival classic.  Everything he is unpacking for you, everything he's sharing with you today will be imparted to you as you read through the pages of this book.  You talk about, I believe we mentioned this in our last broadcast, the midnight of the soul.  Could you refresh that for us today?  Because I think we need it. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it's the dark night of the soul.  The reason I use the term critical mass, because I talk about seven stages.  from the moment you begin to pray for a revival, you will go through seven stages of God's dealing in you.  And one of them, near the end, is stage six, which is the dark night of the soul.  The dark night of the soul is something that scientists discovered when they were bombarding.  In early nuclear fission, what they did is they bombarded the nucleus of an atom with a neutron beam because it had neither, it's called neutral beam or neutron because it has neither a positive nor a negative charge.  So there's a cloud around the nucleus that protects the atom, the nucleus of the atom.  And what happens is when they started bombarding it with a neutron beam, because it's the only one they can get through, they had a theory that if you split the nucleus of the atom, that energy would be released.  And so they found that right before the atom splits, the nucleus actually goes dead.  It deflates.  It becomes flattened.  And it seems to the scientists, we failed.  Isn't that something?  Right before the split of the atom, the nucleus depresses.  That's where we are right now.  We've prayed, we've prayed, we've prayed.  The Congress didn't act.  The Georgia election was lost.  The media censored us.  More and more and more there is a despair and a feeling.  That means that we are right at the moment when that atom is going to split and the energy is going to be released.  That's what happened in the Welsh revival.  Prior to the explosion that Evan Roberts saw, he had a dark night of the soul.  Finney had it.  Wesley had it.  Paul the Apostle had it.  And anyone that seeks the kingdom is going to go through it.  And what did they do?  They learned that when the nucleus of the atom seemed not to respond, turn up.  turn up the intensity of the neutron beam.  And that's what did it.  That's what did it, and that's what will do it today. ",

They come when humanity writhes in the depths of depravity.  They arrive in the shadow of wars and convulsions in nature.  We are prime right now candidates for a move of the Holy Spirit. ",
