            "text": "Stop for your speed.  Also, you got an illegal tint on your vehicle, alright?  What's your vehicle?  Say again?  You got an illegal tint on your vehicle?  No, you have an illegal tint on your vehicle.  Illegal tint?  Yes.  This is not a commercial vehicle.  You're at 2%.  Don't do that.  You just scratched my tint.  You just scratched my tint.  You just scratched my tint.  That's five inches.  This is not a commercial vehicle.  You're citing commercial vehicle code.  You have a driver's license?  Can you let this down further, ma'am?  Can you lay this down further?  I can't see through those windows, and I need to see hands, all right?  Just do it, brother.  What?  Just do it.  That's what happens when you get bigger.  You just do it, and then next they come for a pulpit.  And I need you to lay down this back window.  Hey, sir.  Go ahead and step out of the car for me.  You can bring your phone with you and record.  I'm recording as well.  Can you give me the insurance, please?  Oh, look, now he's calling the sheriff, guys, because I'm recording for my First Amendment rights.  He wants the sheriff deputy, which is a true law of the land anyways.  Yeah, just get off the app and text it to me.  Yeah, just text it to me.  He pulled, he's calling in a sheriff because he doesn't like me recording for my First Amendment rights.  He just waved at a sheriff over.  We've got a sheriff pulling up right now that he waved over because he doesn't like me recording.  So they'll probably shake hands and do the blue line thing.  Just text it to me when you get it.  I'll show it to you in a minute, bud.  We got two officers over here.  Can I see the radar?  Nope.  So he's not gonna let me see the radar, guys.  He's scared because of you.  My daughter's scared because of these guys.  My daughter's scared because of these guys.  I've complied with everything, guys.  I've complied with everything that he's asked.  He asked me to sit right here, guys.  I did it.  I did everything he did.  He waved this guy over here.  What was your name again?  Sergeant Bennett.  Sergeant Bennett.  So what's your problem?  The problem is that he separated me from my family.  Never again, guys.  I've been in Mexico 8,000 kilometers.  Wasn't treated like this until I get back.  My Coast Guard stops on there, too.  Hey, go ahead and roll your window up.  They're with me.  8,000 kilometers through Mexico, guys, and that's what I get.  As soon as I get back, I get this stuff.  And then he separates me from my family.  They don't separate you from your family in Mexico, but here they do because they have egos.  Their egos are so big and bloated over here, it's insane.  Now he's telling me what to do again.  Where do you want me to stand?  He's telling me to move again, guys.  Colon searches are coming next, guys, to a town near you.  Colon searches are coming.  We have no rights in America.  left, guys.  They're almost all gone.  We gotta stand up.  We gotta stand up for it.  They're taking non-violent crimes and destroying people's family.  They're talking about my tent.  Did I pee your tent on your vehicle?  No, I can't see his tent on his vehicle at all.  Been in Mexico, had a good time.  Then I get back here, this is what I get.  A bunch of harassment.  They're trained that we're the enemy.  They're trained that we're the bad guys.  They're not our friends anymore.  They came to help when they first came.  Now they're trained that we're the enemies and that we're going to hurt them.  And he's asked me to take my hands out of my pockets.  He won't let me see his tent.  Got two cruisers here separating me from my family.  It's all they want, man.  These are the same ones.  The same people that put your family enslaved, what, 400 years ago?  It's the same regime, guys.  This guy showed up.  He didn't like me recording.  They hate the Constitution.  They hate freedoms.  They hate the Constitution.  Every day, they hate it.  This guy's working for the same regime that put his people in slaves 400 years ago.  He's working for the same people.  The same ones, man.  I hate to see brothers working for the government.  I know they gotta make money too, but... That's an Oklahoma County sheriff, guys.  Assisting the highway patrol here.  He's got me a long list of tickets there, guys, that hate the Constitution.  He's given me three citations, even though I tried to issue... Can I see the radar?  for having illegal tint on the side windows.  And you've been issued a citation for having tint on your front windows that extends more than five inches from the top of the windshield, all right?  So 546.  There's our government overlords, guys.  We can't do nothing. ",

The Constitution is here.  We the people is the highest law of the land.  Look, handshake.  They give each other respect, but they don't give us respect.
