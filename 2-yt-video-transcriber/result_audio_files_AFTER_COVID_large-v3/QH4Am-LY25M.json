            "text": "Any of you calling yourselves patriots, I'm ashamed!  Get up into your governor's ass.  Get into your mayor's frickin' ear.  Tell them that you do not agree with these trampling of liberties.  Do not sit still.  Do not go silent into the night.  Fight!  stand up and be heard.  fellow countrymen our civil liberties are being impinged.  our rights are being stripped away all without our permission because we are sitting down doing nothing saying nothing.  we are celebrating our freedom on fourth of july by letting off fireworks.  instead let's fill the land with our voice of those deals right now.  if they had a vote in nevada and i had a chance to vote if i don't want to vote then shut up.  but i had a chance to vote and i said optional and then i waited for the tally and i realized the majority of this state wants mandatory mass.  and i'm the holdout.  i'm the screaming about it about my rights.  i sound like a sniveling little.  if i'm the minority i should just shut up and go become part of the majority that agrees with me which might be a state away.  So like, if I'm like, okay, dude, I didn't know everybody here wanted it mandatory.  I apologize.  I understand you're scared.  You're worried.  You're precautious.  Whatever the word is.  I understand.  Allow me a week to get my stuff collected.  And by the way, can somebody point me in the direction of the state that voted optional on masks?  And if someone says Utah, Montana, Texas, New York, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nashville, Tennessee, hopefully, any of those, well then, honey, call a realtor.  We're moving to an optional state.  Optional businesses open.  Optional masks.  Optional patronage.  It's optional.  We have choices.  This is America.  It's not that big of a deal.  Let the people decide.  Show us that we have freedom.  Show us a reason to celebrate 4th of July.  And I would love to see what my great state of Nevada decides.  And trust me, I'm not mad either way.  I just have a feeling they would decide optional and businesses can be open if they want them to be open.  You can go if you want to go because you have freedom of choice here in Nevada.  I'd be happy here.  Everybody would be happy wherever they were unless they weren't happy.  If they weren't happy, guess what they do?  They find the state that voted the way they voted.  And then you go there and you're all happy together.  You show up at a new state.  Where'd you come from, Nevada?  Oh, dude, those guys are gonna die.  They're all optional.  I can't believe their stupidity.  Welcome in, brother.  Welcome in.  Six feet away, of course, okay?  You don't know who anybody is because everybody's wearing a mask.  Nothing's open.  Oh, I hope you brought some groceries with you.  We do have a van rummaging supplies from the unmasked zone once a week, okay?  But you have to sign a waiver.  Why is everything open in the unmasked zone?  Why is the unmasked zone thriving?  Why are the hospitals empty in the unmasked zone?  Okay, but everybody in the masked zone, it's the same shit, but they're all fucking sitting at home doing nothing, making no money.  Then they're going to be hungry.  And then they're going to be invited.  Hey, take your mask off.  Go to the unmasked zone.  Things are popping over there.  Things are popping.  But that'd make too much sense, wouldn't it?  And then you follow the same line of thinking all the way down the line with all the issues.  You want police?  Take a vote.  Majority don't want police.  Police and the people that lost the vote, gather up your belongings, head to a state that wants police.  I'll be seeing you there.  Eventually, there'd be some area that voted just like you did.  There'll be people that say, optional masks, no police.  Right over there.  I voted optional masks.  Police.  Right there.  What did you vote?  You're heading to Kentucky or Oklahoma.  Pick one.  And by the way, here's a little money from the government to move gracefully over there without discomfort of any kind.  Are you happy?  Excellent.  Run along, happy friend.  Go wear your masks in peace.  Go hide in your homes and shut down your businesses.  Long live and prosper.  All governors, come one, come all, hear ye, hear ye.  Countrymen and countrywomen, lend me your ear.  I've got a solution.  I've got a suggestion.  How come everybody can't just give a suggestion?  There's my suggestion.  Let everybody decide.  Well, what about all the people that are endangering the others?  They won't be around.  They're going to go to where they belong.  The mandatory states.  Put it to a vote.  Put everything to a vote, governors.  Come on, governors.  Stand up, governors.  You've been elected.  You don't get to decide the law.  You're supposed to enforce the law.  You don't get to decide legislation.  You get to suggest it and support it.  And legislation should be drafted and ran through the frickin' process.  A governor should sit there and give the choice to the citizens of the area.  If you're in New York, you're governor of New York, ask all New York people.  Optional or mandatory?  Quarantine or non-quarantine?  Optional or not optional?  Go down the list of all the pressing things that are pissing everybody off.  Once you get the majority of the vote tabulated, the rest have the option to leave to an area that voted like them.  End of story.  If the governors just did that, every governor would finally be doing its job, which is manage.  Don't dictate.  You guys aren't dictators.  You're not dictators, governors.  You don't get to decide.  You're elected.  You can be unelected.  You can be impeached.  You can be recalled.  If everybody understood that we have the ability to recall the governor, if the majority... That's why they don't let us vote.  Because... They don't want to get thrown out.  So guess what?  They just lay down the law and plug their ears and truck along, which is why next election, we all better do our part and get involved and find out who are the people running.  What do they believe?  How would they handle situations like this?  Use 4th of July to realize you should vote.  Like dude, as soon as I heard Nevada was going mandatory, I searched what states are optional.  mandatory because I will move over it.  if it was permanent.  I think it's till November 4th, but if it was permanent, dude, that's okay.  Okay, I don't love Nevada so much that I have to stay here when nobody wants me here because I'm an outcast, not willing to wear a mask, not believing that I should.  I ain't going to be here.  I'm going to go move.  I'm going to move to Texas.  I'm going to move to Oakland.  I'm going to move to Montana.  I'm going to move to frickin' someplace that says, hey, come here, dude.  We're with you.  We don't think it should be mandated either.  We think the government should just manage affairs and give us our options, give us our freedoms, give us our choice.  And I'm going to go celebrate 4th of July there.  But seeing as how we didn't do this before 4th of July, tomorrow I am forced to celebrate our freedoms.  So now I must simply celebrate what freedoms remain.  So I will be grateful that all my freedoms have not been taken.  I will be grateful tomorrow and celebrate the fact that, hey, at least I don't have to wear a mask while I'm sleeping.  And if those lawmakers were really thinking, perhaps they would have to wear the mask in bathroom stalls.  Maybe courtesy flushes should be mandatory.  Like if you're gonna make something mandatory, make a courtesy flush mandatory.  What's with these people that come into the stall next to you, drop a deuce, blow out the whole bathroom.  when a simple flush We'll take care of the smell.  You know what makes a bathroom stink?  The shit that's floating in the water below your ass.  Stewing.  Like, just press the button.  It goes away quickly.  And then it doesn't stew.  And then it doesn't smell.  But are masks mandatory in the bathroom?  Oh, no.  That would make too much sense.  Hey, all of this is gold, kids.  All of this is gold.  Although, I know when I'm out here, you hear that.  You hear that.  You hear all the noise.  So they're going to be like, damn, this was good, but we should have done it inside.  He's just a camera holder, right?  Sebastian, you're supposed to say, hell no.  I didn't know you wanted me to direct and create art.  Let's take a vote.  Who here wants Sebastian to direct and create art?  Three out of three.  So shall it be.  If you do not want Sebastian to direct, pack your things up and go over there.  Dude, the message to the governors.  Like, trust me, I have a feeling about the virality.
