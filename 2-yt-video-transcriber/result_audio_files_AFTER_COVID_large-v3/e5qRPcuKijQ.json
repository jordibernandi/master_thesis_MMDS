The pineal gland is responsible for producing and secreting the vitally important hormone melatonin in the body.  But is there another substantial function of this gland?  Ancient cultures and traditions revered the pineal gland for being the key to unlocking our universal connection and divine nature.  Could there be any legitimacy behind these metaphysical beliefs?  And if so, are there ways to consciously activate this gland for spiritual connection?  As an integral part of the endocrine system, the pineal gland is a tiny organ with a long history.  The name pineal comes from the Latin word pinea, meaning pine cone, due to the pineal gland's conical shape.  The gland is often associated with higher states of consciousness.  French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes called the pineal gland the seat of the soul and believed it was the place in which all thoughts were formed.  In Indian Hinduism, the chakra energy system correlates to the glands of the endocrine system in the body.  Subsequently, the third eye, or Ajna chakra, corresponds to the pineal gland, which Hindus believe can serve as a gateway to becoming clairvoyant and enlightened. ",
