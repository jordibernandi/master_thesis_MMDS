            "text": "Hi, this is a really quick video just to give you a newsflash.  So you may notice that my live streams go missing.  That's because I need to take them down and make them YouTube friendly before I upload them.  I need to take them down, filter out the content that is not YouTube friendly, and then re-upload them.  So let me give you some background.  Two channels, at least two channels this week, got deleted off YouTube.  I don't know how to say this without drawing attention to YouTube, so I'll say it like this.  Two channels that discuss pills that are red, if you get what I'm saying, they got taken down, they got deleted off YouTube.  So if YouTube is willing to take channels down that discuss pills that are red, can you imagine black-pilled channels?  Like, YouTube must know me not just by my, you know, account number, you know, account number three billion and eight.  They must know me by name.  They must know the Earth coordinates to my house by now.  So I need to walk on thin ice.  So I need to make sure that the live streams I re-upload are YouTube friendly because YouTube is a business, right?  If YouTube can't sell advertiser space on a video, then they're just hosting a video for free.  That's just four gigabytes.  They've know lost for no reason.  so they want.  if they if youtube is hosting your videos and they can't put ads on your videos they want you gone.  so i need to toe the the line with youtube.  so that's why and and so.  but the thing is i can't even delve into the into sanitizing cleaning up The live streams until I finished what attracts women.  six, which is my main priority right now, so There is a backlog of videos to come.  But all I can say is be patient.  I'm trying to get through things as quickly as I can.  and for people who say just upload videos to bit shoot, bro British shoot videos get 1% of the views that they do on YouTube.  So that is a straight no.  I planned originally to do a stream on the 15th of May.  That is being postponed until the 23rd of May.  But I am doing a stream on Saturday the 16th and that is with a special guest.  Shall I just name him? ",
