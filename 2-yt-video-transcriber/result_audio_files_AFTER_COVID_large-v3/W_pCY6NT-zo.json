            "text": "Never in American history have politicians been more powerful than they are now.  Effectively, they are gods.  I am the chosen one.  News organizations exist to hold the powerful to account.  Here we have the powerful acting with no accountability at all.  No, I don't take responsibility at all.  And their news media, they are cheering it on, besotted fangirls.  God sent this president.  He is a person of providence.  No abuse is too grotesque for them.  No talking point is too stupid to repeat.  Reporters will do whatever they are told.  They are all in.  Hydroxychloroquine.  Hydroxychloroquine.  Hydroxychloroquine.  Hydroxychloroquine.  Totalitarianism does not shock us anymore.  Maybe that's because all of a sudden, it's all around us.  Nobody disobeys my orders.  Well, I have the ultimate authority.  The conclusion can't be avoided.  These people actually hate America.  There's no longer a question about that.  And yet, paradoxically, at the same time, they desperately want to control America more than anything. ",
