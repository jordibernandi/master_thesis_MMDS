So if you can see way down there, we've got a few service members.  We'll see if they take any interest in me.  We got the doors wide open.  See if they respect First Amendment.  See what happens.  And there go the doors.  Crying eyes.  There we go.  And I wanted to know what was behind door number three.  Looks just like a forklift, but... Yeah.  I am a complete civilian, but that looks like some Patriot missile.  I don't know what the hell that is.  It looks fancy.  It looks expensive.  And we paid for it.  All right, here we go.  Hopefully everybody acts right.  I'm mostly talking about myself here, so nobody else.  Yeah, peekaboo.  Say hi, ladies.  Oh, they're nervous.  It's a camera.  It's not even a camera.  It's a freaking phone.  But... It could be the end of the world.  No one's really sure.  Here we go.  It's about time.  What should we do with them?  Should we call the police?  Should we take them out with a 7-6-2 round?  Sniper?  What do we do?  Call the Pentagon.  Somebody is acting suspiciously behind me.  in that poor car.  Yeah, I thought so.  Cam back.  Thank you.  More cam backery.  Yes.  Yes, it is possible.  You're going to hide in the bushes.  Cam backery.  All right.  So the police are rolling up.  They don't know what to do with me.  Because I'm on a really busy street.  This is Victory and Woodley.  This is a separate standalone bus station.  I'm probably going to get somewhere where we can hear the audio a little bit better.  Just because I know there's going to be interaction here shortly.  So we don't want to ruin the audio.  there they go on a fishing expedition looking for me because i walked down that way too bad.  i'm not that in that area anymore.  all right cops are rolling up right behind me now.
