            "text": "Can't wait to see Bernie debate.  Mr.  Trump.  I'm Dick Van Dyke, and I'm a very enthusiastic supporter of Bernie Sanders.  The age question keeps coming up.  I know that I'm 20 years older than Bernie.  I have all my marbles.  I could run for office if I wanted to.  So I don't think age really is a matter except for his experience and the years he's put in.  And I can't understand why, according to the polls, he's having problems with older citizens like me.  Why wouldn't an older citizen vote for somebody with that kind of a record and with that kind of experience and honesty and trust?  It just doesn't make sense to me.  It's not getting my generation.  And I want to urge my generation to get out and vote for it.  Please.  This election, I think, is probably the most important one since the end of World War II.  Another four years of the current administration, and we won't have a democracy anymore.  Four more years of no concern about the climate.  We must get him out of it.  Democratic principles are flying out the window.  He has assumed authority beyond what the president's allowed.  And he's going to get worse.  The fact that we are the only country that doesn't have universal health care, that's shameful.  And that it's more expensive than anywhere.  That he'll do something about, I'm sure.  Bernie has been consistent with his policies ever since I first met him when he was in the Senate.  He never has changed his tack because of pressure from the outside or what he felt.  the wind was blowing another way.  He's stuck with who he is and what he believes.  I think somebody younger, like Bernie, is just a perfect candidate.  Yeah, he'll be around a long time. ",
