            "text": "The MGTOW subreddit has been quarantined.  No longer are individual men of the community censored on YouTube.  Now everyone is censored.  Now every man who wants to comment and spread his knowledge and partake in this community is now censored.  Obviously, we knew this was coming.  I made a video a year ago called First They Came for the Red Pill subreddit.  And in that video, I described how MGTOW is next on the chopping block.  So none of us should be surprised at this.  And they can't destroy MGTOW.  They can't censor MGTOW fully.  The ideas are already out there.  If MGTOW went away tomorrow, I would be fine.  Many of you listening would be fine.  Many of you who have just come into the community would be well on your way to achieving your goals because you have enough foundational knowledge if you've been partaking in the community.  But it is insidious for the new guys who haven't discovered this yet.  Which I feel sorry for those guys who haven't found MGTOW yet.  And they won't have the opportunity to find great resources like the MGTOW subreddit.  It won't be able to expand at the rate that it was expanding at.  TFM, a great YouTube channel, experienced censorship.  ThinkingApe, Sandman, myself, plenty of other people have been censored in some way or another.  And it's just a matter of time before they came for you guys too on the subreddit.  Because that was really your platform to communicate as completely individual anonymous men on the internet.  And that's actually where I started.  And some of the essays, some of the posts I made for that subreddit were too long.  So I made them into videos and that's how the channel started.  So it's very sad that it has come to this.  But a lot of the guys are pointing out double standards.  So there are feminist subreddits that openly advocate not only for the restriction of men, the imprisonment of men, but violence against men.  They openly advocate for it.  And those subreddits are not only allowed to exist without being quarantined, they are allowed to grow and be promoted.  And those guys who are pointing out the double standard, you're playing by the old rules.  You're trying to project fairness and justice on a system that is totally in favor of women, that is totally imbalanced in favor of gynocentrism.  And you need to get out of that mindset and start thinking practically in what we have to deal with today.  Obviously, it's unfair.  It's unjust.  But that's not what we're dealing with now.  We're not playing by those rules anymore.  It's guerrilla warfare.  It's new tactics that we have to use using the internet.  Using the power of the internet.  Because this was an anomaly.  The MGTOW community.  It is apolitical.  It does not have any vested interest in changing anything.  It is a place for men to discuss and share philosophies and experiences and observations.  And that is... The resounding reason why we're hated on both the right and the left of the political spectrum.  Because we're not recruiting guys.  A lot of guys, when they're in the red pill rage, they want to spread the truth out as far as they can and reach as many new guys as possible.  Which I can relate to that because I did the same thing when I first found MGTOW.  But we don't recruit people.  Observation and experience does that for us.  Men see what is going on around them.  Men experience the shit show that is the dating market, that is the sexual marketplace, that is the gynocentric society we all live in.  They can see it with their own eyes and eventually they will start to ask questions on their own.  And unfortunately, they may not have all the sources available to them to provide some of the answers.  But they will have something.  There will be something out there.  And this leads into the next topic of alternatives.  And this is a tricky one because BitChute is viable.  I think someone told me Sandman reached a significant milestone on BitChute.  TFM is doing well on BitChute, I think.  But again, there's a lot of miscommunication.  Plenty of guys ask me about my Bitchute channel and if I'm on Bitchute and if I'll open a Bitchute.  I've been on Bitchute for a long time.  The link has been in every description of every video.  Bitchute is not well known.  A lot of guys don't use Bitchute.  The transition from YouTube viewership to Bitchute is not even close to half.  Not even close to a quarter.  So, you know, we just have to wait for bigger YouTubers to get censored.  But even then, if we entertain the darkest timeline and we look at what's happened so far, I always come back to a few examples because they are huge cases that we can look at.  And one of them is Tommy Robinson in the UK.  He got arrested for protesting the Muslim grooming gangs in London.  And no one gave a shit, you know, there were a couple protests.  there were some marches very small in nature and Everyone kept going about their business.  and then Alex Jones who's one of the biggest guys biggest independent news guys.  he gets Basically deleted off the internet and he still has his core following but his growth has been completely cut off and his ability to self fund.  and And I look at these examples.  and then I look at us, MGTOW as a community, both on Reddit and YouTube and other forms of communication.  MGTOW is big.  MGTOW is blowing up.  MGTOW is the biggest part of the manosphere, but it's a drop in the bucket when you think about just the total amount of information out there that men are trying to access.  and Frankly, men don't know how to navigate that huge bucket of information, let alone have the interest in it until they're experiencing shit.  Until they get backlash in their lives from gynocentrism or go through a bad breakup or feminism strikes at them.  And then they go and look for it.  And by the time it happens to everyone, it'll be too late because MGTOW will be expunged from the internet.  Now, I'm not going to put too much stock into the darkest timeline theory that I'm talking about because many of these ideas are already out there.  The genie is out of the bottle.  They can't put it back in.  And the ideas that we talk about in this community have already begun to seep into other communities.  You're seeing it come up in different ways.  And frankly, it's just a matter of time.  They can delay it, which is what they're doing with the censorship, but they can't stop it.  They can't stop it.  It's... It's a symptom of a societal sickness.  And that sickness is not going away anytime soon.  And I wish it would.  I don't have this hate in my heart that a lot of guys do.  I've come to accept the state of things.  I wish it was different.  I wish we didn't live in this timeline where it was so overwhelmingly corrupt and decadence was just widespread.  But I'm not going to get angry at it because that's just attaching myself to something that will never be.  And I can still live my life and have my morals and try to help others and not give up because everyone else is going down the toilet in terms of quality.  I can still persevere.  But that doesn't mean I have to fool myself into thinking we can ever go back to them.  It's... The damage is long since done.  A fatal wound has been struck upon Western civilization.  So I don't think censoring MGTOW will slow us down.  It will prevent some men from finding information that could genuinely help them.  that could genuinely improve their lives which is a shame and it's disgusting that they would do that and then turn around and promote on reddit horrible subreddits that openly advocate for violence against men.  they promote these shit youtube channels where chameleon thoughts try to infiltrate and corrupt the ideas we talk about here.  but then the actual ideas that we talk about as men are buried and removed and censored.  and it's just the state of the game.  you know i've been enduring it for almost three years now and it's very disheartening but it is a psychological weapon that they use against you.  if they take away your voice they try to take away your ideas.  they try to take away your motivation to share your ideas.  Don't give in don't give in to them.  It's simple as that and For us MGTOW if they deleted all the forums and the videos were fine.  It's about passing it on to guys who haven't found it yet.  That's what it's about.  So if you haven't already Back up all your favorite forum posts and your favorite videos and stuff on my discord server I've already put together a team of guys who have created torrents of MGTOW YouTube channels.  So if you come to my server, you can download those and preserve them yourself on your computer.  Again, if you find any hard copy stuff, make sure you get that.  My book is free on my website, but my website is liable to be deleted as well.  That's why I made a hardcover copy of the book, which I recommend you get.  No one can take that away.  I am working on my new book coming up, which will be out sometime this year in the spring.  And you know, you can't censor that.  If you have the hard copy, they can't take it away.  So, thanks for listening to this, guys.  Don't lose hope.  They will censor everyone on MGTOW on YouTube.  They will continue this.  And even if you make another subreddit, they'll censor that too.  It's just the state of the game.  And as the election comes up, the escalation of censorship will continue to rise.  And attack all freedom of speech.  All people who speak out against gynocentrism will be penalized.  That is the nature of the beast.  And don't lose faith because it is a story of David and Goliath.  Truly.  And as soon as you start thinking that it's hopeless, you lose the fight.  Because that's all we have is hope.  The principles that define our path on MGTOW and that guide yourself, that is what makes you self-sufficient.  So take care, guys. ",
