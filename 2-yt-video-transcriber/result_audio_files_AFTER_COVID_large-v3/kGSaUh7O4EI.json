            "text": "okay, that were following Gentile customs until the Most High raised up the Apostle Paul to go to that area and teach them.  I bet your pastor can't tell you that.  I bet the person that's giving you scriptures in Galatians, the third chapter, can't tell you that.  Huh?  Read what you got.  Read Galatians chapter one, verse 15 and 16 again.  But when they pleased Jehovah, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace, To reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him among the heathen.  Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.  Stop for a second.  Look at verse 16. real close, McGonagall.  Because I think you read it wrong.  It doesn't say to reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him to the heathen.  Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.  It says to the heathen, right?  It says among the heathen.  It says to the heathen, don't it?  In this one?  Yeah.  No.  What does it say?  Among the heathen.  Ah!  It says among the heathen.  Ah!  Now, a Christian... Listen, I'm being funny, but I'm not being funny.  It says among the heathen.  To a Christian, that means to the heathen.  That's why we read in 2 Peter 3, verse 16, the things that Paul said are hard to be understood.  The word among the heathen is a... talking about everybody.  Thank you.  And this is the newest production.  Yes.  The book of Galatians chapter 1, verse 15.  But when it pleased Jehovah, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace, To reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him among the heathen.  Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.  Stop for a second.  Look at verse 16. real close, McGonagall, because I think you read it wrong.  It doesn't say to reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him to the heathen.  Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.  It says to the heathen, right?  It says among the heathen.  It says to the heathen, don't it?  In this one?  Yeah.  No.  What does it say?  Among the heathen.  Ah!  It says among the heathen.  Ah!  Now, a Christian, listen, I'm being funny, but I'm not being funny.  It says among the heathen.  To a Christian, that means to the heathen.  That's why we read in 2 Peter 3, verse 16, the things that Paul said are hard to be understood.  The word among the heathen is a that it ain't talking about everybody.  I'm going to prove it.  Give me the book.  Keep your finger right there.  We're going to keep coming back to that.  Keep your finger right there.  Leviticus 26 and 33.  We're going to start from the beginning.  Leviticus chapter 26, verse 33.  Paul said that the Most High, through Christ, raised him up to preach among the heathen.  The Christians say that means the heathen can be saved.  Let's see if this among the heathen thing.  Read Leviticus 26 and 33.  Leviticus chapter 26, verse 33.  And I will scatter you among the heathen.  I will scatter you among the heathen.  The book of Leviticus was written to the Israelites.  The Lord said he was going to scatter Israel where?  Among the heathen.  So Israel was scattered among the heathen.  Interesting.  Let's move on.  Leviticus chapter 26 verse 30.  Excuse me.  Jeremiah chapter 9 verse 16.  The book of Jeremiah chapter 9 verse 16.  I will scatter them also among the heathen.  There it is again.  Jeremiah 9 verse 16.  The whole style of scatter Israel where?  Among the heathen.  The whole style of scatter Israel among the heathen.  Right?  Read on.  Whom neither they nor their fathers have known.  Right, so whom they nor their fathers shall have known.  So the Most High scattered the Israelites among the heathen.  But let's keep going.  Let's go to the book of Ezekiel.  Okay, we're going to go to chapter 11.  And we're going to read verse 16.  Ezekiel 11 and 16.  It says, Therefore say, thus saith the Lord, Yahavu, although I have cast them far off among the heathen, among the heathen, among the heathen, And although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.  So Israel was scattered amongst the heathen.  This is all prophecy.  How are we going to read the book of Galatians chapter 1, 15 and 16 where Paul said he preached the gospel among the heathen and going to come to the conclusion that that's everybody without having first read the Old Testament.  How are we going to do that?  Huh?  Huh?  They ain't going to teach you this in church.  No.  Okay?  Let's keep going.  We're not done yet.  We are not done yet.  Let's go a couple chapters over.  Ezekiel chapter 20 verse 32.  Ezekiel chapter 20 and verse 32.  And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all.  That, he said, we will be as the heathen.  Now this is worded a little bit different.  The Israelites said that they will be as the heathen.  Why?  Because the Mosiah scattered Israel among the heathen.  So while we were among the heathen, we became just like them.  What did we do?  We started taking up their gods.  and worshiping their gods, we started eating the foods that they was doing, and we made ourselves wicked.  There's plenty of examples of this.  Plenty of examples all through the scriptures.  We were scattered amongst the heathen, and we became just like the heathen.  See that?  Okay?  From there, give me 36, Ezekiel 36, 19 to 21.  Ezekiel chapter 36, verse 19 through 31, right?  Mm-hmm.  Come.  And I scattered them among the heathen.  Start from verse 17.  Just in case, because, just in case somebody is still not convinced, start from verse 17, but the point is in 19.  Go ahead.  Come.  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way.  So now we clear who this is talking about and ain't me twisting it.  This is talking about Israel.  Come on.  And by their doings, their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.  That's a nice way of saying that our people were just disgusted, man.  You know what the uncleanness of a removed woman is talking about.  It's talking about a woman on her menstrual, that bad.  That's disgusting, man.  That's how our ways were in the nation of Israel before the Mosiah.  So there was a judgment for that.  Read on.  Wherefore I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land.  And for their idols wherewith they had polluted it.  And I scattered them among the heathen.  Most.  I scattered Israel where?  Among the heathen.  And they were dispersed through the country.  According to their way and according to their doings, I judged them.  And when they entered unto the heathen, whether they went, they profaned my holy name.  So not only did the Most High scatter us amongst the heathen, we went the hell off when we got there.  Is this not making more sense?  Is this not making more sense?  See, come on.  When they said to them, these are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land.  Come on.  Which I have pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen.  Whither they went.  Right, so everywhere the Israelites went, everywhere that they were scattered among the heathen, they profaned the name of the Most High.  That's what happened.  Okay, so the Most High cast Israel as a nation away.  until Yehoshua, Jesus Christ, came down and became a sacrifice for the nation of Israel, that we can then again be joined back to the Most High, man.  That's how we're able to be joined back to the Most High now, through Yehoshua shedding his blood.  So as a result of Yehoshua shedding his blood and dying on the cross, now the Most High was willing to accept Israel back.  That's where Paul came in, because now Paul, let's go back, let's go back.  Galatians chapter 1, verse 15, let's go back.  That's why Moses had to raise Paul up.  Now the scriptures are harmonizing.  Now the song is sounding like a song.  All the notes are where they're supposed to be.  Okay, the drum is playing one time.  The organs and the cymbals is all sounding one time.  Why?  Because the Bible is harmonizing.  It's not contradicting itself.  It's making perfect sense.  The Most High drove Israel through the four corners of the earth, scattered us amongst the nations, scattered us amongst the heathen for breaking His commandments.  But then when that time was up, the Most High raised up prophets and teachers to go among the places where we were scattered, right?  And teach the ones of our people that are profane in the name of the Lord.  Let's go back.  Galatians chapter 1 verse 15.  Galatians chapter 1 verse 15.  But when it pleased Jehovah who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace to reveal His Son in me that I might preach Him among the heathen.  That Paul might preach the gospel among the heathen.  Not to the heathen but among the heathen because Israel was scattered among the heathen.  That was the curse of Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.  Right.  So that's pretty self-explanatory.  Real quick, give me the book of St.  John, chapter 7, verse 33 to 35.  St.  John, chapter 7, verse 33 to 35.  This is going to say the same thing that Paul said.  Remember, Paul said that he was sent amongst the heathen to preach the gospel.  And we found out, pursuant to all the precepts in the Old Testament, which is the history, that the Israelites were scattered among the heathen.  But Christ mentioned this also, showing you how Paul, what he did, harmonizes with the Scriptures.  It harmonizes with what Christ said.  It wasn't a different mission.  Read.  Book of John, chapter 7, verse 33.  Then said Jehovah Shalom to Donah.  Yet a little while I am with you.  And then I go unto him that sent me.  Ye shall seek me and shall not find me.  And where I am, there ye cannot come.  So the disciples did not understand.  That went right over their head.  Watch this.  Read on.  Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go?  that we shall not find him?  Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?  Right.  So who is?  Well, let the Bible speak.  Let it harmonize itself.  Let's go to the book of Isaiah chapter 11 and start from verse number 10.  Isaiah chapter 11, verse 10.  Isaiah chapter 11, verse 10.  And it says, And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand before an ensign of the peoples.  To it shall the Gentiles seek, and to his rest shall be glory.  So to it, there shall be a root out of Jesse, right?  That root that came out of Jesse is Yahavashah, Jesus Christ, okay?  Because from Jesse came King David, and from King David Through the line of Solomon comes Yahashua.  So Yahashua will stand up.  Read on.  Read that again.  There shall come a root out of Jesse.  There shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign among the people.  There shall stand for an ensign of the people.  Read on.  To it shall the Gentiles seek.  To it shall the Gentiles seek.  Now, an unlearned person will think, well, see, the Gentiles are going to be seeking for Jesus.  But we've got to keep reading.  Read on.  And his rest shall be glorious.  And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people.  which shall be left from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Patros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.  Read on.  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations.  So, the whole sign is going to set up an ensign for the nations.  What nations?  These discursions we just read about in verse 11.  But these are not actual Gentiles.  Read on.  And shall assemble the outcasts of Israel.  And all sides are going to assemble the outcasts of Israel.  Because Israel was dispersed in all these lands.  We don't know.  and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  So the Bible says that Mosiah will set up an ensign for the nations and gathered together the outcasts and they dispersed of Israel and Judah from the four corners of the earth.  Because Israel was scattered into all these lands when they broke the laws and they became Gentiles.  Does everybody not see that from verse 10 on down to verse 12?  Israel became Gentiles when they were dispersed amongst these other nations.  Start following the customs and everything.  Let's go right back to St.  John real quick and then you can bring out your precept.  Let's read it again.  St.  John chapter 7 verse 35.  Now we understand a little better.  Come on.  John 7 and 35.  Then said the Jews among themselves, where will he go?  that we shall not find him?  Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?  So who was dispersed?  According to the Bible, not according to me, the dispersed was Israel.  We just read it in Isaiah 11 and 12.  Israel was dispersed, Israel was scattered, Israel was outcasts amongst the Gentiles, amongst the nations, and they completely forgot about the Most High.  They turned their backs on the Most High, so the Most High put them in captivity, but then after Yahushua died, when Christ came on, excuse me, after Yahushua died, the Most High began to raise Israel up again, and he used Paul as one of the first chosen vessels to go among the heathen.  Salam, all praises to Yahuwah and his son Yahuwah Shai.  My name is Korab.  My name is Shamoala Besai.  My name is Officer Zachariah Von Yahawada of the Lions of Israel Camp.  I have been in this knowledge for 31 years, since 1988.  I've been in the truth nine years.  I've been in the truth for three years.  Before I came into this truth, I was in a gang, and I did a lot of wickedness towards my own people.  Before I became an Israelite, I was in the church doing both and doing the wrong things.  I was a Rastafarian before I came into this knowledge.  The Lord is looking for a few good men because our Lord Christ says that the harvest is plentiful and the laborers are few.  Donate to the Lions of Israel Building Fund so that we can teach our people their true language.  So the spirit of Moshe, donate to the Lions of Israel Building Fund to wake our people up.  Brothers and sisters, Yehovah Hashem Yahushua Barakatah.  Shalom.  Yehovah Hashem Yahushua Barakatah. ",
