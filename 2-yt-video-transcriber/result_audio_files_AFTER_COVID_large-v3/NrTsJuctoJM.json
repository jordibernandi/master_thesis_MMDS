            "text": "Good damn morning, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again.  And since I got a new phone, the camera is like backwards.  I don't know how to fix that.  So if any of you people out there who are more tech savvy than myself, which is not hard to do, I got a Samsung phone and if we can get the camera back to how it used to be, that would be great.  If not, This is what it is, people.  So something I wanted to explain real quick.  Somebody hit me up in the comment section this morning, and they were like, what does Gavin Bang Your Wife Newsome mean?  Well, for those of you who haven't been with me this long, who weren't here at the origins of that little saying there, you may know Gavin Newsome as the illustrious head of California, the leader in how to fuck this state up.  But he used to be the mayor of San Francisco.  That's where he sharpened his political teeth.  Um, he was the mayor of San Francisco.  And of course, San Francisco was a disgusting shithole, just like he's trying to make the state of California, but he got busted for banging his best friend's wife.  So that's why I call him Gavin bang your wife Newsome, because apparently you can be his best friend and he will still bang your wife anyway.  We're going to do a little positivity today, people.  It's so easy to get caught up and get mired in all of this nonsense that is going on.  Everything from the China virus, a.k.a.  the sweet and sour sniffles, the stupid, ridiculous, pointless, fruitless BLM marches, protesters, all that bullshit.  We're gonna do a little positivity today.  So first of all, Trader Joe's.  Now I know them to be a heavily liberal company, but I did a video last week or so talking about how they were coming under fire, much like a lot of other companies, for their racist labels.  You see?  All those fools back in the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers, the Freedom Riders, they're all fools.  You got it all wrong, guys.  Instead of staging real peaceful protests, could you imagine, look at how these dummies are acting in these riots and protests.  Now, today in 2020, imagine if the police were out there in full force like they were back then with the fire hoses and the German shepherds.  Imagine how these fools would be acting now.  They'd probably tuck their tail and get their ass back in their mama's basement.  But because of what those people did, these are different times.  But what those people did, the civil rights leaders and people who were part of the civil rights movement back then, what they should have done.  Instead of going through all that nonsense, what they should have done is just take colored people off a food label.  It'd be like Back to the Future.  Remember when Marty would change something that happened and he'd take out his little picture and you'd see people either disappear out of the picture or they would reappear in the picture depending on how he changed history.  So that's what they should have done.  You should have found the dude who put Aunt Jemima on the fucking syrup bottle And you should have found the people or the person who created Uncle Ben's rice.  And if you would have stopped them, then we wouldn't have any problems today.  There would be no police brutality.  There would be no skyrocketing levels of violence in the inner city.  If all they did was change the food labels.  Then Martin Luther King could have pulled out a little folded up black and white and saw how all these victims of gun violence would reappear in the picture.  All these children who were gunned down in Chicago and St.  Louis and Baltimore and Los Angeles and Detroit, they would all reappear in this picture because all you have to do to cure society's ills is take colored people off of labels and change the words.  See how stupid that sounds?  This shit means nothing.  And Trader Joe's saw the light.  Do you see the light?  Trader Joe's saw it.  I read a couple articles and they were basically saying Trader Joe's has gotten a lot of feedback from customers who find that shit ridiculous.  from customers who enjoy Trader Joe's marketing campaign and the way they do things.  Maybe there's hope for us yet.  Maybe us sane people who don't believe up and down, down is up, and we live in the second coming of the 1920s.  Maybe there's hope for us yet.  Maybe there are enough.  Not even, it has nothing to do with right or left, Republican or Democrat.  Let's just start with saying, in order for us to get along and go along in society, there's some things we have to agree on.  We have to establish a baseline.  And one thing we have to agree on is America is not a racist country.  There are races in it, but that does not make it a racist country.  If you have a crackhead in your family, does that make you a crackhead family?  Does everybody pick up a pipe?  Does everybody start sucking that glass dick because one person does?  No, you just have a crackhead in your family.  You're not a crackhead family.  So there's certain things we have to agree on and sanity is one of them.  And we can't sanitize society.  We can't scrub everything clean so everybody is happy all the time.  It doesn't work that way and it shouldn't.  Especially about things that aren't offensive.  So Trader Joe's said, no, uh-uh, we're not doing that shit.  We're going to keep our little Trader Jose and Trader Ming and Trader Giados and Trader whatever the fuck else we want because this is our company and our customers who have been with us.  And you know what?  The people complaining about that shit probably don't even shop there.  So your opinion means even less.  We're talking business here.  You're not spending money in my business?  Fuck you.  We're going to stick with the people that do spend money with our business.  So I hope other businesses drink that Goya Kool-Aid.  What the fuck are you talking about?  I'm going to do what I do.  This is my company.  And we're not going to tear down the very thing that put us here.  That's why Trader Joe's has its own company.  has its ravenous supporters.  We'll put it that way.  That's why people are so serious about Trader Joe's.  That's why they're so loyal.  Trader Joe's has its thing.  It's found its niche in society.  And they will be fools to spit in the very face of what got them to this point.  People are serious about Trader Joe's.  So I hope it continues.  I hope other companies see that, oh, okay, you can go against this slobbering evil leftist mob and survive.  What was that?  That movie, Robin Hood, the one from like 1990 or 91 with Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman.  There's a scene where he's fighting Big John in the river.  And he swept his feet from under him and Big John thinks he's drowning.  He's like, help me, help me, help me.  And he says, hey man, put your feet down.  Oh, turns out he's only standing in a foot and a half of water.  That's what's going on.  That's what I hope goes on with these companies.  They think, no, we can't go against the leftist mob.  We'll go out of business.  Oh, shit.  We didn't go out of business.  Hey, hey.  There are a lot of regular people out there who don't buy into this horse shit.  Now, speaking of someone else who doesn't buy into the bullshit, can you imagine this?  I hope you guys are sitting down.  If you're on a ladder, come down.  I don't want you to fall and hurt yourself.  An NFL player, yes.  All right, let's rewind that a little bit more.  Black.  NFL player, came out and said, I'm not kneeling for shit.  His name is Stephan or Stephan Tuit.  He's of Caribbean descent.  And his grandmother came here from the Caribbean, got her slice of the American pie, worked hard, got her citizenship, brought her family over here to start a better life.  See that?  Remember that bullshit?  They tell you the illegals, they just want a better life.  Well, there's a way to get it without stealing it.  And this dude's grandma did it.  He said, my grandma came here and worked too damn hard for me to take my overpaid millionaire ass out on that field and kneel.  He said, I'm not doing it.  And direct quote, I don't give a crap.  who has a problem with it.  The dude's a defensive lineman.  He's like six foot something, 300 some pounds or close to it.  Anybody can tell him shit.  But he came out and said, no, I'm not having it.  I'm not kneeling.  I believe in this country and I believe in what this country offers still to this day.  Take a drone down to the U.S.-Mexico border and tell me you don't see people still trying to sneak up in here.  How come you think they still have the damn detention centers?  They're going back and forth about, oh, we should release the kids with their families and all this other shit.  Release them all.  Release all of them back into Mexico.  Why do we have detention centers?  Why are we detaining these people?  If you have the proper paperwork and you're going through the proper channels and you're jumping through the fucking hoops, why do we need to detain you?  There should be no detention centers.  There should be a giant wall to the moon.  Are you kidding me?  I want birds to fly and be like, shit, we got to go around.  This wall's too damn high.  That's what it should be.  But I haven't seen any backlash yet.  We'll see if any of the other NFL players come out and call this dude a coon and a sellout and an Uncle Tom.  Because he's not going in lockstep with the rest of you dummies, with the rest of you zombies.  He's not going to be in lockstep with you.  He's not going to kneel because he doesn't believe in it.  And that's his right.  Just like you have the right to kneel down like a dumb ass, he has the right to stand up like a man and not play into that shit.  He's not like the rest of these dummies.  Now, I hope this man doesn't cave under the pressure because you know it's coming.  Because the Steelers, the players were saying that, yeah, we're going to do something in solidarity to show support.  He said, man, please.  And you know what the reaction would be if he was white.  What would he be called?  I don't even need to say.  You guys know.  Go ahead and say it.  Yell it right now.  Racist.  Of course, which is bullshit.  You can't have a difference of opinion without being called this horrible fucking name.  That's disgusting.  So big ups to Stefan Tuit, T-U-I-T-T.  So all you French speakers, anybody north of the border, how do you pronounce that?  Did I say it right?  Tuit.  That's beautiful, man.  I hope this guy gives other players the courage to stand up for what they believe if it happens to be against the group.  Because groupthink is what they're about.  They love diversity of appearance.  They want every group they get together, they want it to look like a fucking rainbow coalition.  They want every color of the rainbow.  But there will be no, and I mean no, diversity of thought.  It's all appearance.  We look like we care about everybody, but we don't give a shit.  Look as different as you want, but you all better think the same.  I mean, is it far-fetched that more players are going to come out?  Yeah, but it can happen.  This guy did it, which is great.  Why should it be such a big deal for somebody to come out and say what they believe without persecution?  I can't remember who. ",
