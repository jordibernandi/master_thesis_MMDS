It also mentions Meshech and Tubal.  And then in verse 6, Gomer and Tegarmah.  Now, in the time of Asia Minor, the time of Paul and Peter and the others who evangelized what is modern-day Turkey, that is modern-day Turkey which it's referring to.  In verse 5 it says Persia, and until 1936 Persia was known by that name, but today it's Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.  In fact, Iran still speaks the Persian language.  It also mentions in verse 5, Ethiopia, which would include Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, and Libya.  And then when you slip over to Psalm 83, there in verse 6 it mentions the Ishmaelites, which would be Saudi Arabia today, and in verse 7, Tyre, which is modern-day Lebanon. ",

Remember the man on the red horse coming forth with war, a war that's going to take place in the first three and a half years.  And when you go over there to Daniel 11, starting in verse 40, it mentions the king of the north and the king of the south.  Early on in chapter 11 you determine that geographically the king of the north is Syria and the king of the south is going to be Egypt.  Now remember Isaiah, and here we are in the Old Testament teaching Revelation.  In Isaiah 17 it says Damascus is going to be destroyed.  That's talking about Syria, and they're the first ones to make a move.  Today they're within two and a half miles of the Israeli border, and Bashar Assad, the president, said he wants to take over the Golan Heights.  So that's going to be the coalition of nations that are going to be under the direction of Satan, actually, as he influences those leaders of those nations to form this coalition. ",
