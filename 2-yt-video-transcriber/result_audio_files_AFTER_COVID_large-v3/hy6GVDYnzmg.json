            "text": "You're watching another epic, awesome, amazing episode of the Unboxing Thor YouTube channel.  I want to make a quick video about this lock really quick because someone sent this to me a while ago.  The thing is, is that this lock is a lot better.  This one in my hand here is a lot better than what I've seen in some of the other reviews on YouTube.  So I want to make a video about this really quick and show how this works.  So you do get a manual.  You get a plastic bag.  And it's unlocked right now so the track will go up and down.  And that's how it works.  But here's the thing about this lock.  It doesn't really seem to have many vulnerabilities.  And it's actually really heavy and pretty tough, actually.  So here's what I'm going to show you.  First, you've got to lift the shackle.  Then the door will open.  Some people say that you can open the door without lifting the shackle.  It doesn't work that way.  The shackle has two positions, and it kind of does.  It kind of has two positions.  There's like a halfway and then all the way up.  Let's talk about the pros and cons of this really quick.  So you can fit keys in here.  It's not really wide enough I don't think for a whole key ring.  I mean you could just put keys in without the ring and you could fit a lot of keys in there.  but then when you open this door they're going to fall down into this little drawer here and hopefully not on the ground or anywhere.  So as far as the keys going in the lock, I don't think there's anywhere inside here to tie the keys.  Some of these that you get from different companies have a little loop or something inside where you can tie a string and tie it to the keys so they won't fall out.  That long string.  so you can put it to the door or whatever.  But then it also comes with this tool for resetting the combination of the lock.  And how that works is, so you pull the shackle up and you turn it over here.  And then you take that pin and you stick it in a little hole right here on the side.  And when you do that, you can change the combination.  and then you pull the pin back out, so you push all the way in and click, and then you pull it out, and then you can put this loop back, and your combination will be changed to whatever you set it to.  But here's the thing, somebody said these were really easy to decode, that you could just by playing with these and seeing how loose they were, you could see what the combination was, but I found personally that's not the case, so with the first shackle, it's loose between eight, ",

            "text": "one, and the combination is zero, so there's really only two numbers there.  When it's loose, you can guess between those two numbers, but on the other sets for the combination here, they're all equally loose, so it doesn't seem like you can discover the combination just by turning this lock around.  So that's what I'd like to debunk about other videos I've seen on this product.  is that even if you just turn these around, the only one I can even get close to figuring out is the first one.  The rest of them are nothing.  Now, you might be able to stick a tool in here and try to figure it out.  but the thing is this really seems like it's upgraded to me compared to what I've seen in the other videos.  or maybe someone just got a bad sample, I don't know.  But the door won't open, this door won't open unless you pull the latch up and that is different to me because I'm a professional property inspector And when I go out to people's houses to inspect them and they have one of these types of locks on the door, you punch in the code and then this door down here opens.  Okay, but that's not the case with this one.  You put this down here.  You have to have this shackle up in this position in order to get this door to open and shut.  And so in that case, again, this whole thing could just be removed from the door with it unlocked.  So that's why... You know, I don't know.  What really interests me the most about this lock is just this lock up here.  It's thick and it's heavy and I could put this through something to lock it.  Like if I had, you know, two loops or a chain, I could put this through it and lock it.  That really interests me.  Again, I think the best use of this Oriya lock is with this lock here between two chains.  Very sturdy, very stable, and very heavy.  If you're looking for a heavy lock as far as the weight, it's going to pull down on a chain or whatever, make it more difficult to remove, to mess with, and it makes noise too.  See, that's the thing about this.  Even if I lock it, it still makes noise.  There's movement here.  And apparently it's unshimable.  Apparently you can't shim the lock to open it.  Like I said, I know some people that might have some tools where they could try to pick this.  It's very difficult here to try to get anything in between these numbers and try to get in there and feel anything because the gap is almost non-existent.  But I mean, I'm not saying there's not a gap.  I'm sure there is.  But it's pretty much non-existent.  So love the product.  All right.  Thanks so much.  And you can check out the link in the description if you want to get one.  It's a very nice lock. ",
