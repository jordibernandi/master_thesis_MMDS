            "text": "In our model, Pennsylvania is a tipping point state around 35% of the time.  If you had Biden with an eight-point lead in Pennsylvania, okay, then we really are kind of getting into territory where Trump is in fairly desperate straits, but he still does have a winning path that runs through the Keystone State.  We have gotten some higher quality polls, Pennsylvania, and they still show a relatively tight race.  I mean, they do show Biden leading, but like maybe by four or five points, which is not entirely comfortable.  It's just barely bigger than the polling error there in 2016.  Biden's margins in states like Wisconsin and Michigan are on the order of eight points.  That is quite a bit larger than the polling error in 2016.  So, you know, if that were to occur again in those states, then Biden would still win and win by enough that it wouldn't be like in recount territory.  Pennsylvania though, I mean the big mystery is that Pennsylvania has for most of the campaign been polling tighter than Michigan and Wisconsin.  And we're now at the point where it's too late to say it's just a quirk.  Pennsylvania is tricky because different counties have different rules for how they'll count ballots.  Some counties will not count mail ballots, which are going to be probably very democratic until the end.  Some won't even start counting them until Wednesday.  And by the way, the Supreme Court has also ruled in Pennsylvania that you can get your ballot in after Election Day.  So Pennsylvania will be maybe the last of the major states to definitively say what happened.  You know, look, I think there's a 10% chance that Trump wins.  If Trump wins, it'll probably take a while to figure that out, I think, actually.  There's probably a 60% chance that Biden wins and we know it by 3 a.m.  And a 30% chance that Biden wins, but it takes longer to know that.  It's kind of roughly how I think it would probably break down.  The talking point that, oh, it's going to inevitably go to the Supreme Court, I think is closer to bullshit than reality, right?  We model what's the chance within the recount margin in a state that would change the electoral college outcome, and the chance of that is about 5%.  You know, I think a 5% chance of the court getting involved in the country today is a very small serious chance that people have to look at carefully, right?  At the same time, 5% is not inevitable.  I mean, who knows?  Maybe we're in uncharted territory, but the court's rulings up to this point in time would suggest a conservative court that's not super pro-voting rights, but that is kind of within the norm of traditional court behavior, right?  Where they can tie break for Trump, they can interpret things in a certain direction, right?  But they're not going to be a vehicle for Trump to steal an election that he clearly lost.  Probably not, at least.  Hey folks, we put a lot of effort into actually making good videos for you, so please like and subscribe to our channel on YouTube. ",
