At least 26 million Americans have already voted in more than 40 states, a staggering 20% of the total vote in 2016, more than two weeks before Election Day.  FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver weighs in on what it may say about the final result. ",

            "text": "Breaking news, the election is happening now.  More than 25 million people have already voted, either early in person or by mail, and the number will continue to rise between now and Election Day.  So far, Democrats have a big edge over Republicans, leading the number of returned mail ballots in states that track party registration, according to the US Elections Project.  But remember, this is pretty much what pollsters expected.  63% of Democrats said they plan to vote early as compared to 35% of Republicans, according to our recent ABC News Washington Post poll.  But Republicans could make up for that with a big turnout on November 3rd, and 60% of them plan to cast a ballot on Election Day.  That should make the margin a lot closer, though.  keep in mind that Donald Trump significantly trails Joe Biden in national polls.  There are also pluses and minuses to voting by mail.  The upside, it's easy and convenient.  There's no chance something will come up on election day, say your car won't start or you're not feeling well and have to stay home.  The downside, a higher percentage of mail-in ballots are rejected because it's easy to make errors, like not having the right written signature or not putting the ballot in the right envelope, depending on your state's requirements.  Overall, though, turnout tends to increase when states implement mail voting, and officials on both sides encourage their voters to do it.  So I buy that Republicans should be worried.  Democrats are locking a lot of votes in, but I wouldn't say they should panic.  Odds are that in the end, turnout will be sky high on both sides, perhaps even topping 150 million votes.
