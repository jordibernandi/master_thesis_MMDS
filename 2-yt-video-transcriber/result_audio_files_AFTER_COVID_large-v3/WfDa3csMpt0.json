            "text": "Linda Forsythe, Welcome back to see by news.  We, the people.  This is Linda foresight.  Today I was going to be having a show.  Linda Forsythe, Like I do every week with Ron ask our attorney that had formed the foundation proceed by news.  man has a great amount of wisdom.  But as the last moment came up that we were going to be starting the show, his office called and said, since he is located in Riverside, right there by LA, that they were closing down the business, closing down shops, so to speak, because the riots were headed right their way and all these streets are blocked off, et cetera.  So you know what?  I'm going to do a brief video here.  And going to discuss a little bit about what Ron and I were going to talk about.  What is the difference between peaceful assembly and violent protesting?  What's the difference between peaceful protesting and violent, you know, taking things apart in an attempt to make yourself heard?  What is really being heard?  those that who take the time to really listen to be able to think for themselves what is really happening right now they're trying to um instill fear these rioters and there's a lot of interesting things coming out because of uh well since i do the news i do a great deal of research about all different types of news and there's many things coming out that are of interest that you know what, folks?  This is all staged.  I am not saying that there isn't plenty of things to be angry about, to be upset about.  I am not saying that there is absolutely things out there that you need to voice your concerns.  You need to make yourself heard.  Absolutely.  But there's something else going on here.  And I am talking to everybody.  This isn't a political agenda in what I am saying right here.  I am talking about plain common sense.  I am going to share my screen for a minute because I want to show you something.  Okay.  One of our volunteers, Brian Carone, thank you very much, did a little bit of sleuthing and he found a multitude of videotapes of all different angles of what happened with Mr.  Floyd.  And he was able to put all these together and to put together a video that puts quite a bit of a different story.  What we put up on YouTube is uncut.  It is uncensored.  It is everything from beginning to end.  And in reading exactly what it says here, it says, this is a comprehensive look at what happened with George Floyd.  Several videos from different sources included uncut and complete in its entirety.  Pertinent questions are added throughout.  There's no politics.  There's no bias.  And then there's an update because of some of the comments.  And there were quite a few people that have been watching this.  Some of the comments had made some outstanding points.  So we did an update in this.  Thanks to commenter Carolyn Glass, who provided the following link to the Washington Post video, we now have a better idea as to definitive timeline of events.  Thanks to this video, we now have answers to a few more of our questions.  So we've added to this.  And this link is in the description here of the video.  So you may want to look at that also.  Also, when was the ambulance called?  In that video, and we have the link, it states the ambulance was called at 8.22 p.m based on other information gleaned from the video.  This puts the moment of the call around 1537, or in other words, 337 of our video.  They called for a code two, which is a non-emergency, no lights and sirens.  A minute later, they called for a code three, emergency lights and sirens.  From the first call, it takes the ambulance six minutes to arrive on the scene.  Now that we know the time of the call, it still begs the following questions.  Who called for the ambulance?  Why did they call for the ambulance?  Why would they continue to apply pressure after calling for an ambulance?  Number two, why did officers Lane and Keurig park so far away?  According to the Washington Post video, the officers parked in front of the store where George Floyd allegedly passed counterfeit bill.  the owners of the shop were also the ones who allegedly called the police.  if you have additional information that may answer some of our questions please provide in the comments below.  okay so when you go here you're going to see this and i'm just going to give you a heads up.  the following content has been identified by the youtube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences.  you go ahead and if you understand that just click it to proceed From beginning to end of the video, puts a little bit of a different story when you see things in its entirety.  There was one of our other commenters that noticed that when you watch the time aspect in the video, there looks to be as an ongoing synopsis of what they're trying to do, all of a sudden the time is a day later.  It's almost like they did a retake.  of this video to fit in different pieces to be able to fit, I don't know, to say a different scenario.  There's so many questions and the questions are asked throughout the video.  It is not telling you how to think.  It is not telling you what to think.  It's pointing you in different directions of where to observe.  Now, as we go down through the many comments that were made in the video, I will say to you, 98% of people who are thinking for themselves, 98% of all the comments thus far are saying this was staged.  This was staged.  Now, when you go on to all the riots and everything that are happening in Minneapolis and Oregon and Washington and Atlanta and Ohio, different places in Ohio, um, in LA in, you know, multiple different places where it is out of control, absolute rioting, absolute rioting.  This isn't making a point of helping Mr.  Floyd.  This is not what needs to happen.  What needs to happen.  is we need to come together and recognize that we are being manipulated.  We are being manipulated.  I am begging people to please take the time and the effort, putting aside things that you have been told, and look at things with your own eyes.  Look at things with your own eyes and look at all different sides of it.  and start recognizing what's really going on.  Mr.  Ron Osk, who was going to be here today, his business is gonna be shut down again.  Okay, all of a sudden COVID is so dangerous and it's, you know, they found out that all the numbers were conflated and et cetera.  All these people are getting together in the streets.  There's not a whole lot of mention about COVID.  But yet they're trying to make it where the riots are horrific enough that people stay locked down in their homes and shut their businesses down.  Okay.  What is going to destroy America quicker is not only the fear.  that is being, they're trying every different angle, people, come on.  They're trying every angle.  to make you so afraid that you stay in your homes and that you're afraid to open up a business again.  All for what?  Okay, we can deal with situations, but with a level head.  If there's something that's going on that you want to have a voice about, you can peacefully protest.  It was peaceful protesting that forced businesses to open up nationwide in the first place.  Well, there are certain people that couldn't allow that to happen anymore.  So they're restaging, in my humble opinion, the word protest to be coming out with these riots, with hoodlums, with destroying businesses.  I mean, what kind of sense does that make?  It makes no sense.  We need to think logically.  You still need to make your voices heard.  Make your voices heard peacefully.  No matter what it is, your opinion, you have free speech.  Doing what's going on right now in shutting down business and destroying your cities and quite frankly, family's livelihoods and our country.  Come on.  This is not how you take care of things.  So understand.  that things are being instigated.  They're being instigated.  I highly recommend you go to our YouTube channel, Seabine International News Network on YouTube, and watch this video.  You decide for yourself.  Nobody's telling you what to think.  You watch with your own eyes, uncut, unabridged, from beginning to end.  Look over here, look over there, you decide.  In the meantime, I'm going to go ahead and sign off on this particular video because it's just occurred to me.  I have been spending all my time reporting the news of all these chaos and crisis situations going on in every different direction imaginable, and I haven't taken the time to finish my five-part series of 9-11.  Well, here's something.  Right after this, I'm getting on it.  I'm getting on it.  No more diversions.  Have a good day, everybody. ",
