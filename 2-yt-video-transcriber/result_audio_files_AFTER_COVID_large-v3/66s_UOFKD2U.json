            "text": "All right, guys, welcome back.  Part three of my lifted 4Runner.  If you've seen part one and two, you know it's a different truck now.  Sold my 16 Trail Edition with KDSS, mostly because I wanted the Quicksand TRD Pro.  One came up for sale, used on Craigslist.  Always loved the color, and yeah, I ended up buying it.  So this is gonna be a little review about what I think about the Pros versus the TRD Off-Road with the KDSS.  And primarily what I said is I bought this mostly because of the color, the uniqueness out here in Hawaii.  There's only three that were ordered that year and this is one of the three.  So far I've been pretty stoked with the truck, but KDSS does make a huge difference and Control, just less body roll and cornering big time.  I can feel it.  I mean, off-road and driving on the city, just cornering off highways.  It's standard on most of the Land Cruisers, the Lexus GX line, and it's an option on the Land Cruiser Prado in Australia.  There's a great video that shows a comparison that 4x4 Australia did.  I'll put the link in the bio.  But obviously, I love the interior.  I really actually like the TRD off-road suspension that comes in this.  When I bought this truck, it looks exactly like it looks now.  The guy vinyl wrapped the flares, the door handles, the mirror, the roof rack, the hood scoop.  I didn't do anything outside of adding the Nerf bars, the Predator bars.  It had the same tires, the Goodyear 27570R17.  it's a nice in between the stock 265 70 and a 285 70 and i'm going to do a little review about these tires as well and they've been on here a good year.  i put about 10 000 miles on them so far.  i had to rotate and it did about right about 8 000 miles.  they started cupping a little bit on the edges you can.  i'll show a shot of the rears.  you can see how the tread is getting uneven but they're pretty quiet for a mud tire and the.  the overall handling is really nice.  you know i primarily drive beach.  here there's you saw in my previous videos.  i had some mud time at coolo ranch uh jurassic park and um they're sliding you know.  so mud tires are definitely you know unique in the sense of they work a lot better in mud and of course you know in rain and stuff like that.  but in the sand.  you'll see this we're at today.  we're out here by sandy beach and it handles amazing.  i haven't aired down or anything and it just floats across this sand.  Tread-wise, like I said, they're wearing out a little bit uneven, but I think this just goes to with most off-road tires.  You have to rotate them pretty regularly.  It's recommended in between 5,000 to 10,000, but I would say at 5,000, if you can, just try to rotate them.  It's tough to do with just time, but it's worth it. ",

            "text": "Okay, one thing I forgot to mention was when I bought this truck, it had... a little bit of a leveling kit on it.  I just put some Rough Country, I think inch and a half top plate spacer in the front and then a one inch, I think corn fed spacer in the rear.  So my plan is to replace the rear coils with some Eibach.  And Eibach actually, they've been sponsoring a lot of these builds we've been doing.  So they're sending me, Eibach is making a reservoir suspension for this truck.  I'm pretty stoked.  So they're gonna evidently send me one out.  So prepare for another video on that when it comes. ",

            "text": "What else is the difference between the KDSS?  Obviously the big difference, TRD Pro, you get the, you know, if you do a color, you know, the special color, the interior is a lot different than the cloth versus the TRD Premium.  You can get it identical.  No sunroof, no JBL.  That doesn't come out, or that didn't come out until 2019, 2020. they have those standard but the kdss makes a huge huge difference for handling like i mentioned and get the trd off-road and the premium if you want the leather and the sunroof and all that.  is there any other questions comments you got?  guys?  just you know.  shoot them in the comment section.  i'll get back to you and any other feedback you got from your own personal rigs.  i'd love to hear it and thanks for watching.  i'm going to keep driving a little bit.  Thank you. ",
