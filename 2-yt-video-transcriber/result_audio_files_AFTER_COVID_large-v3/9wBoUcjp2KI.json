            "text": "y'all y'all so excited i can't focus on anything other than what is happening right now.  okay so you guys know i just posted on my channel trump just went live and announced this agreement with the peace plan.  this is literally not only historic but this is prophecy jumping off of the pages.  y'all this is crazy.  i'm so excited.  i could just cry but i'm not going to because i'm just not.  but okay so i want to explain a few things.  i was going to make a video which i am going to.  but i was going to make a video basically just um talking about where exactly the rapture is in the bible.  um how there's so many mockers and scoffers that are literally trying to whisper lies in people's ears and say that it's not a real thing.  guys at this point just flick them off the think of them as little flies and you just flick them off the wall and don't even worry about it.  don't let these people steal your joy.  okay we're gonna go over all that.  but i want to talk about this really quick.  um so if you haven't watched um trump just went live.  go back to my very most recent video and listen what he has to say.  um so everybody's wondering okay is this the peace plan that the the bible talks about?  okay um first of all i want to read you daniel 9 27. um it talks about how.  let's just go over it really quick.  Daniel 9.27 records, And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the ablation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.  So if you actually go back to the original wording, right there in Daniel 9, 27, it says confirm.  But like I said, if you go back into the original wording, it actually says to strengthen or make greater.  So I believe that when the Antichrist comes on the scene during the tribulation, there will have already been a peace plan that's already there that he's going to come along and he's going to strengthen it.  or make greater.  so could this really be the actual peace plan that is talked about in the bible?  i truly do believe so.  so i was working on getting this getting some scripture together for this video earlier that i was going to do talking about the rapture and where it's found and just going over thessalonians which i'm still going to do.  uh but as i'm literally putting all of this together I see the breaking news where Trump is on saying peace and safety.  And it's just crazy how.  let's read this verse here in Thessalonians that talks about when they say peace and safety comes sudden destruction.  it literally is right there in the bible.  in thessalonians when it's talking about the rapture it's all right there.  it's right there.  when the bible is speaking of the rapture it literally talks about how peace and safety sudden destruction.  um let's read it really quick.  first.  Thessalonians 5 verse 3 says for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape.  so it doesn't say oh they say peace and safety and then you know destruction is going to come down the road.  no it says literally.  it says sudden destruction.  this is just crazy to me.  i mean you have israel that is looking for their false messiah.  You have Lebanon that literally just, like, exploded over there.  The government stepped down.  We're watching Emmanuel Macron.  I mean, we won't see, you know, the revealing of the Antichrist, but we see how their government stepped down, and it leaves an open door for Emmanuel Macron everywhere.  to come in and kind of fix everything he literally just i mean netanyahu.  i think it was netanyahu that you know had just met with emmanuel and was like praising him for stepping in y'all anyways.  um so israel's like on the brink of war.  it's like super.  there's so many tensions over there.  okay you got this peace plan that the bible talks about.  um you have all of these other signs you got.  you know as i was just reading through thessalonians.  you know You know, where it talks about the rapture of the church, the catching away, the harpazo.  And then it talks about the peace and safety.  I just, guys, this is crazy.  I mean, how much more do you have to see?  How much more do you have to hear?  to believe, you know what I mean?  Like the, the human minds, like our carnal brains want to just tell us no, no, no, no, no.  But it's like the Lord keeps showing us.  He said for the times and seasons, I don't even need to write you guys.  Um, don't even know if i should just make a separate video.  the lord showed me as a little girl at the age of 10. i didn't even know what the rapture was.  okay the lord showed it to me at that time in my life.  he said that we were at the halfway midway point.  i had an understanding that it was almost time to go home.  okay we all spiraled up into the air.  we got into the atmosphere.  the halfway midway point he let us back down.  i turned and walked back to wherever i was coming from looked to the person to the right of me and i said that is a sign from god.  that's almost time to go home.  the lord literally showed me guys it was almost time to go home.  that was 20 years ago.  and now like knowing you know where if you got.  okay let's let's just go over it really quick.  okay i will show you where the rapture is in the bible.  um you know i didn't even know what this was okay.  now i have this understanding that He gave that to me 20 years ago for such a time as now.  I had the dream at 10.  We got to that halfway midway point, which I believe was when I was 20.  Okay.  And the timing of the rapture, I believe, is this year.  I am now 30.  I believe the Lord was showing me a timeline.  I had no clue what the rapture was.  Okay.  Let's just go over it really quick in Thessalonians.  I will show you exactly where the rapture is.  1 Thessalonians 4 verse 15, For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  And so shall we ever be with the Lord.  Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.  for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night.  for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape.  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.  Ye are all the children of light and the children of the day.  We are not of the night nor of darkness.  For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.  But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, for and helmet the hope of  salvation.\".  For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.  Wherefore, comfort yourselves together and edify one another, even as also ye do.  So there's a lot of people that are coming against the rapture right now.  And they say, oh, well, the word rapture is not even in the Bible.  Okay, well, the word Bible is not in the Bible.  Literally, what we just read is the rapture of the church.  And let me point out a few things here.  So we always use the word rapture, okay?  The Greek word from this term rapture is derived, okay, and appears in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 17, which is translated to caught up.  So when we read it, when we read about the rapture in the Bible, it's used or it's translated to caught up.  Okay, so we are reading in our Bible chapter, caught up but the latin translation of this verse used the word rapturo.  so we're using the word rapture which comes from the latin translation okay so it's in.  in latin translation it's rapturo and that's where we get rapture.  okay so we are reading in our bible caught up but the latin translation of this verse used the word rapturo.  so we're using the word rapture which comes from the latin translation okay so it's in.  in latin translation it's rapturo and that's where we get rapture.  Okay, so then if you go to the Greek, the Greek word, it translates to harpazo, which means to snatch or take away.  So catching away, harpazo, rapturo, okay, that's where we get the word rapture.  So you have to do your research, okay?  You have to look into the original texts.  okay so yeah well it's raining guys so i'm sorry for the noise but so i wanted to go over.  where is the rapture found in the bible?  well there it is right there in thessalonians.  it's so funny how he literally talks about when peace is when they say peace and safety then comes sudden destruction.  okay we see everything that is happening in the world right now.  uh it's it's just crazy to me.  so you know the lord literally showed me as a little girl that this event would take place when I didn't even know what it was, okay?  Many, many other brothers and sisters, including myself, have received other rapture dreams that are truly from the Lord.  This is a true event.  You just have to look into, you know, it... It doesn't matter what you call it.  You can call it the rapture.  You can call it the harpazo or the snatching away, the catching away, okay?  It's all the same thing, okay?  We just use the word rapture because that's, you know, it all translates into the same thing, okay?  Rapture is a real event.  It is going to take place before the tribulation.  You just read it.  We are not appointed to God's wrath, okay?  He says, now... comfort one another with these words.  why would the lord say to comfort one another with these words if us as christians were not going to be snatched away and we would have to go through the tribulation?  okay he says comfort one another with these words.  we're not appointed to his wrath.  And he says, for the times and seasons, I don't even need to write you.  You'll already know.  And so as we see, they say, peace and safety come sudden.  destruction, okay?  Everything that's happening right now, the Lord says to look out for.  And he's giving us all of these signs, all of these words, all of these dreams.  He's giving us peace.  everything so that we would know the times and the seasons.  and brothers brothers and sisters the times and the seasons.  the season is now okay and literally the timeline that the lord showed me as a little girl literally lines right up with the fig tree parable.  he says that generation will not pass away until all these things are fulfilled.  what are those things?  the rapture of the church, the seven years of tribulation, and the second coming.  He said that generation.  When you see Israel become a nation, which happened in 1948, a biblical generation is 80 years tops.  It brings you to 2028.  You minus the seven years of tribulation because we know that we're not pointed to god's wrath.  okay it brings you to 2021. it is literally all lining up.  it just gives me chills.  okay and like i said there's a lot of people.  he literally jesus literally said that the mockers and scoffers would come out in these last days.  okay and say your your lord is not coming.  You know, you guys think that you're just going to be snatched up out of here and you're going to be raptured.  Okay.  I get railed day in and day out by these people, but I'm literally considering them little flies on the wall.  I'm just flicking them away.  Okay.  Because they cannot take my joy.  Okay.  Our, our father is coming for us.  We're going to meet him in the clouds and we will forever be.  Be with the Lord.  So you guys be encouraged, okay?  Don't listen to the naysayers because Jesus said that they'd come and they are here, okay?  Everything is lining up.  You guys stay encouraged.  We're going home.  Love you all.  Talk to you soon. ",
