            "text": "Well that is, I'll show you that.  There, like that.  Watch out, yeah.  No, seriously, I can't even address what you're saying because I have no idea what it is.  I really hope this doesn't go on too long because this video would suddenly become really, really boring.  It's already boring, Logic.  Yeah, fuck you.  Okay, I think you said, and over there, where that light's coming from.  Just there, you see.  I'm decently confident about that, 75%.  So, let me just show you a quick comparison here between the sky as it looks in this image, and the sky as it looked in the filtered image.  A little bit less impressive, right?  A lot more... mundane looking.  So, now that we can actually see what's going on here, let's talk about what is going on here.  I'm assuming that by the light coming up over there, you're not just talking about the clouds.  Those are kind of dark, not light.  So I think what you're talking about is the fact that the sky towards the horizon looks lighter than the sky straight up, or directly towards the sunset.  So let's go back to remedial sky color class.  Now, the reason the sky is blue is that the atmosphere scatters light.  Light collides with small particles in the atmosphere and scatters, and light with shorter wavelengths that's closer in size to the particles that it's passing by is more likely to be scattered, more likely to be bounced around, and that means from all directions.  in the sky you see light with shorter wavelengths more, and light with shorter wavelengths is blue light.  Most people are going to know that already, at least in the form, the sky is blue because of light scattering.  But that's not the end of the story.  What happens if the particles in the air are big enough that not just light with shorter wavelengths, like blue, is scattered predominantly, but also light with longer wavelengths, like red, and everything in between?  What if you have water droplets, dust particles, things like that in the air?  Well, because it can more effectively scatter a wider range of wavelengths, there's more of the light spectrum being scattered around, more of that's coming into your eyes, it's more white.  This is the reason.  clouds are white, it's the reason why on an overcast day the sky looks light grey, it's the reason your headlights aren't very helpful in the fog.  And it's the reason that when you look straight up, the sky is pretty dark blue by sky standards.  But if you look towards the horizon, it's a lot whiter.  It's called Mie scattering, M-I-E.  The thing is, when you're looking straight up, you're not looking through that much atmosphere.  That's effectively the shortest distance you can get from you to space.  But when you look towards the horizon, you're looking through a lot more atmosphere.  When you look straight up, you are looking through a decent amount of dust, water droplets, whatever.  But when you look towards the horizon, you're looking through a lot more.  And that means there's a lot more scattering of white light.  So if you go out on a clear, sunny day, and you look all the way around you, 360 degrees around that horizon, the sky above that horizon is gonna look pretty light.  And if you look straight up, it's gonna look darker blue.  Now, the reason it's still showing up in your video here is because, well, look at it.  This is not after sunset.  The sun is still up.  It's still lighting the sky over there.  Over in that direction, it looks like daytime, and that's how daytime looks.  If you were to wait around a little while and keep filming the sunset, you would eventually notice that the area of the sky that we're looking at right now would get darker as the sun actually set, and as it stopped lighting that area.  But that hasn't happened yet.  The sun is still pretty high in the sky.  So I really don't know what you would expect, other than for the sky at the horizon to look like it's a normal day.  Now the point I want to make here, Hunter, is if on a normal day you can go outside and all the way around the horizon the sky is light like this, how can that possibly imply that there's a second sun rising?  I mean, at that point that sun would have to be rising along the full 360 degrees of the horizon.  All day, every day.  And yet somehow you never actually see it.  Just some light sky that kinda maybe indicates it's there.  Are you absolutely sure this makes sense to you?  Well, it's at least some very nice video of the English countryside, I'll give you that.  All the nonsense aside, I'm kind of enjoying this part.  I wish you'd had it looking like this the whole time.  I don't know what you mean by square pattern, but digital cameras, by their nature, do tend to have those kind of problems.  Noise, compression, color-bending, whatever.  It's just kind of a fact of life.  If you don't like it, don't get a digital camera.  And it doesn't really matter if it's your brand-fucking-spanking-fucking-new-fucking-iPhone-fucking-pro-fucking thing.  Either.  It's still a digital camera, it's still not going to be perfect.  It'll be good.  It'll be good enough for pretty much anything you need, I'm sure.  But don't expect perfection, that's just not even fair.  Especially considering it's a cell phone camera.  I mean, cell phone cameras are great nowadays, but they're still cell phone cameras.  Let's temper our expectations a little bit.  Just because you spent a lot of money on it doesn't mean that it's a perfect record of reality.  In fact, no camera is.  You could spend millions and it still wouldn't be.  It's technology, not magic. ",

But now that I see it, it's kind of hard to unsee it.  For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I'll put a grid up on the screen.  The pattern is going to follow that grid.  It's a very regular large grid pattern that only shows up in the brightest parts of the image, specifically where the sun is.  Now, I don't know what is causing this, I'm not aware of any camera that has this issue, but then again, who knows?  I'm obviously not aware of every issue plaguing every camera.  It could also be an issue with the effect that's being applied.  Considering this is a digital camera, a very complicated piece of technology, there's all kinds of things that could be going wrong.  And it doesn't really matter exactly what is going wrong.  What does matter is the fact that while you're swinging the camera around wildly, the grid pattern is staying perfectly still relative to the camera.  But it's not staying perfectly still relative to the sky.  So we know for sure that this is related to your camera, not to the sky.  Which really is all that matters, because you're trying to convince us that this is something in the sky, when because of how it moves with your camera, we know it can't be.  watch it what does it refer to?  i assume the lens flare.  all right i see the lens flare.  yes i'm watching the flare spreads out as if it's hitting a sphere shape.  watch again.  okay hold on you know it's a lens flare.  you're moving the camera around and that's moving it around.  you know it's not in the sky.  you know this is something produced by your camera.  you're even calling it a lens flare and you're telling me that you think it hits something by which i can only assume you mean in the sky.  so how you know.  never mind.

Take the filter off, throw it in the garbage can, or whatever the equivalent is of that for video effects, and forget you ever saw it, because this effect really sucks, and it's making your video suck, and that's why your video sucks.  I have no idea if that's gonna fix that grid pattern.  It might, in which case, great!  And if not, at least you don't have some shitty effect exacerbating the problem.  If it's still an issue after that, and it seems to be genuinely a problem with your camera itself, use something else.  This isn't that complicated.  Alright, I'm watching the lens flare, and I see what you mean about how it looks.  kinda like it hits a spherical thing, I guess?  But it's a lens flare.  You know it's a lens flare.  This effect completely moves along with your camera.  This is not something that's in the sky and you know it.

I've noticed over the year or so that I've been looking at this kind of stuff that conspiracy theorists like this seem to think that digital cameras are like the glasses from They Live.  There's some sort of magical device that shows you the real reality that the they don't want you to see.  I don't know how they think they do that, but apparently they do.  It's an extremely bizarre phenomenon.  And frankly, if cameras were doing that, I don't think the they would be so eager to sell them to you.  It's getting pretty hard to hear you here, but I'm getting the idea now that what you're calling a planet is the dark blue spot up in the sky.  Which isn't really a spot, it's just most of the sky.  Remember when I was talking about how the sky higher up is a darker blue than the sky lower down?  And I know you're not seeing this with your eyes.  I mean, we just saw a much more accurate color video.  You showed it to us, and it's from this same period of time, and it doesn't look anything like that.  This is all just manufactured by whatever stupid filter you're using.  That's not showing you the real world.  That's hiding the real world from you.  Look with your eyes.  Or at least through a well-configured camera.  Come on.  Sorry about the wind noise, but look at this pattern.  Yeah?  Color banding and noise cranked up to 11 by your stupid-ass filter.  I know I'm being kind of repetitive about this, but I really can't say it enough.  Like, these conspiracy theorists fuck up their imagery so much, so often.  Video after video, year after year.  It gets a little frustrating to watch, honestly.  I wish I could get through to just, like, one of them.  I mean, I guess Donny at Daytona is doing a little bit better lately, so that's one case of getting through to one of them, sort of.  He's still spreading conspiracy theories like crazy, but at least some of his imagery looks a bit better.  Yeah, I see that big white light.  Play that back.  Slower.  So, we have that tree there, surrounded by white.  Or at least much lighter sky.  It's what I said before, where the darkening effect seems to dodge around dark objects like trees.  Now, watch what happens when that finger comes in.  Based on what I just said about the tree and the darkening effect, what's your prediction for what's gonna happen?  Well, here it is.  Everything around the finger lightens up, and the darkness dodges away.  Wow, look at around that finger.  There's a big white light now.  See, this is why I'm telling you to look with your eyes.  This is not reality.  In reality, the sky itself is not brightening around your finger.  Use your fucking head. ",

It's circular.  There's no real sign that it's spherical.  I can see how you might interpret it that way.  As an illusion, kind of, because it's only part of a circle, so it looks like light is shining on one part of a sphere at some points, kind of.  But it's a 2D circular shape.  And secondly, do you notice how this supposed sphere shape moves exactly along with the lens flare produced by your camera?  When you move your camera, that sphere is moving too.

Huh.  Maybe you do just mean the color banding, I don't know.  It's honestly kind of hard to tell because you don't really describe the pattern you're seeing either.  I don't really know for sure which one you're interested in. ",

Cuz, when I scroll down to the comments, the comments on this video are sorted by newest first.  And the newest comment on this video is about this exact thing.  Bonnie Van Dyke says, Planet X Hunter, do you watch your own videos after recording?  Because when you're recording your backyard and are going into your house and turn around to record for patterns, the recording slows way down like time itself is slowing down.  And then a low, horrible growling starts, and then a form becomes visible, like a spaceship, and I get the feeling it stares at you and quickly disappears.  If you see it, you should have it looked at by someone you trust, and get another opinion.  There definitely was something there, and since you didn't mention it, I wondered if you noticed it.  Strange craft appears about 1402, time of video.  Low growling starts, and then a grey image, then it seems to fade out, and then boom, there it is, a spaceship, with more detail, and it quickly disappears.  Okay, Bonnie, for one thing, this was not the first time this happened in this video.  I don't know if you're just skipping around through it or something, but if you are, you're killing the guy's watch time.  Come on now.  That's just rude.  Secondly, of course he knew about it.  That's why he slowed the video down, to show you the gray spot in the sky.  He's as interested in gross artifacts from slightly shitty cameras as you are.  The technological ignorance on display in the video is already pretty bad, but the technological ignorance in this comment is just catastrophic.  Oh, that's just fantastically helpful, thank you.  Looks great, perfect photography.  Let's just keep it like this, you have no idea the kind of UFOs I'm seeing right now.  Alright, well there's not much more for talking in this video, not much for interesting captions either, so I think I'm gonna call that the end.  I guess the message I would like to leave you with is, if you buy a camera, you don't have to become an expert, you don't have to know everything, you don't have to be a professional photographer.  But please, at least play with it, and maybe even read about it.  Watch YouTube videos about it.  Just enough to understand what it is, the very basics of how it works, what exposure means, what ISO means, what a sensor is, how focus works, what depth of field is, what software effects are, common optical aberrations, and flaws specific to digital photography.  You can be up to speed with the basics of how to work a digital camera, and the different kinds of effects it can produce, the different kinds of flaws to watch out for, how to fix them, in a day.  Less than a day.  And if you go into it with the understanding that your camera not only might, but will show you things that are not present in the external world outside the camera, you won't be confused like all of these people.  I don't understand how so many people have become so confused by basic consumer technology.  This stuff is easily accessible to most people.  Probably most of the people who believe this shit own a smartphone.  They could pick that thing up and just film around.  Produce any one of these weird effects that people produce with their smartphones.  Pay attention to the fact that it's clearly being produced by the camera, because it moves around with the camera, and you can produce it without looking at the sky at all.  It's not something that comes from the sky.  But they don't.  They just don't care.  It's incredible.  For all their lip service to the truth, they seem to have no motivation to do so much as five minutes of work to determine the truth for themselves.  It's mind-blowing.  Anyway, I don't mean to go off on a rant here.  That's it for this video.  Thank you very much for watching, everyone.  Hopefully you've enjoyed my first month back making filmed videos after quite a while.  These videos went up for patrons in February.  Patrons and Subscribestar supporters.  If you like the channel, please consider supporting it on one of those platforms, even with a small amount.  It's extremely helpful, it's the whole reason I can dedicate so much time to this.  If even 1% of my subscribers pledged $2 each, this thing would be rock solid for ages.  But that's enough of that.  See you on the next one. ",
