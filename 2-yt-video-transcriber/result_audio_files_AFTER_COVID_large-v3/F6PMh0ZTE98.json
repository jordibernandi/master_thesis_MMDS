Of course we do.  She cites Jim Flaherty.  And not only did he believe in the independence of the Bank of Canada, he never funded his deficits by having the Bank of Canada print money to lend it to the government.  In fact, throughout the entire great global recession, we never relied on the bank to print cash to fund our operations.  That is something that this minister and this government are doing.  They are dependent on the bank and therefore cannot be independent from it. ",
