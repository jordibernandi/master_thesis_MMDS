            "text": "Way back when, when they said all men, they meant every wealthy European male.  So back then, to vote required being white and being rich and being male.  They said, you can't vote if you've got no property.  You can't vote if you're not free.  You can't vote if you are a woman because you've got no stake in democracy.  Year by year, people have to ponder what the Declaration must have meant.  By all men, clearly it was time for an electoral adjustment.  And they won the vote for those who had no property.  Won the vote for those who'd been free.  Won the vote, won the vote for women.  And they wrote it down, it was guaranteed.  They all said it's my vote, you can't deny it.  My voice can't take it away.  My rights, I won't be quiet.  It's my vote, my voice, my rights.  My vote, my voice, my right.  Well, the right's a right, but without a fight it can't evaporate and float away.  And by night, people came a-creepin' and they tried to take the vote away.  They said, you can't vote.  You haven't paid the poll tax.  You can't vote.  You can't pass the exam.  You can't vote for fear of retribution.  And the people stood up and said, well, damn, it's my vote.  You can't deny it.  My voice can't take it away.  My life.  I won't be quiet, it's my vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right.  So my friends, make yourself a plan to cast your ballot because you got to vote.  And beware, always in the shadow, there are those who want you not to vote.  They're saying you can't vote.  They're throwing away your ballot.  You can't vote.  They're purging the rolls.  You can't vote.  They took away your mailbox.  You can't vote.  rigging the courts.  Say you're gonna use it.  Say you'll never lose it.  And if they ask you who's it is, just say it's my vote.  It's my voice.  It's my right.  It's my vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right.  My vote, my voice, my right. ",
