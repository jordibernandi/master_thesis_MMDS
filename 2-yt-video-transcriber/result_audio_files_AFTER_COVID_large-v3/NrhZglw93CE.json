We're like a fight club that talks about Fight Club all the time.  Like a great value Call of Duty.  Like a bunch of 4chan frat boys.  The He-Man Woman Haters Club.  Like a Deer Stand Alex Jones.  The Sonic Parking Lot Militia.  We're just a bunch of open-carried Larrys.  We like both kinds of movies.  Taxi Driver and Joker.  I sit down at Great Clips and I say, make me look like Richard Spencer loves craft beer.  And bam, Gavin McInnes.  We're not racist.  We're part of the new right.  We've rebranded.  You know, this ain't your daddy's KKK.  It's pretty hard to fight antifas when you're wearing a robe and a hood.  And that's the only mask I'm going to wear, by the way.  Yeah, we haze each other all the time.  Do you want to be a proud boy or not, Kyle?  Well, good.  Get them britches down and start reciting breakfast serials till he stops paddling.  And yeah, a lot of times we do keep our faces covered.  It's cause we're proud.  And you know what?  We don't need women, except to sew the patches on our tactical vests.  Proud boy sounds like what your dad calls you when you win the Pinewood Derby.  When you get your first paycheck from Dairy Queen.  When you build a birdhouse and shop class.  If being a proud boy is wrong, then I don't want to be far right. ",
