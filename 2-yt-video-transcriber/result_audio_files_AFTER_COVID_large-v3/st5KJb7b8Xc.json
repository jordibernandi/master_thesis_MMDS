            "text": "Hello beautiful ladies and welcome to today's video where we're going to be talking about why hashtag believe all women is a problem.  I want to start off this video by saying I don't think that these issues are easy.  I don't think that we should take sexual assault lightly.  And that for women who go through this, it's incredibly painful and it's really difficult to know how to deal with it.  So I'm not at all downplaying that.  I don't want to make anyone feel like this is an attack video on women who do come out and say that they've been through something.  I still look at the hashtag believe all women movement as a problem.  And I want to talk about why.  There are two reasons that hashtag believe all women is a problem.  One, it's a lie.  And two, even if it were true, it shouldn't be.  Let's deal with number one first.  It's a lie.  Hashtag Believe All Women started after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court.  Tons of women came out and said that he had sexually assaulted them.  Christine Blasey Ford being at the forefront of all of this.  A lot of people did not want Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.  And a lot of people lied to keep him off it.  It was discovered afterward that many women had lied and said that he had sexually assaulted them with crazy stories that were unbelievable.  But people on the left still said, hashtag believe all women.  All women should be believed no matter what the evidence says.  No matter that there should be due process, we should throw due process out the window.  If a man is accused of sexual assault, it doesn't matter what the evidence says, he is guilty.  The left used this as an ax to wheel to force us into submission and make us feel like we had to agree or we would be bad people for doubting a woman's accusations.  Now, let's look at the news today.  Joe Biden is being accused by Tara Reid.  Tara Reid has come out and said that she believes that Biden sexually assaulted her.  These same people who said hashtag believe all women are now saying we don't believe all women, we side with Joe Biden.  How crazy is that?  Did the goalposts move?  or what are we doing here?  As a woman, I look at this and I think to myself, I don't believe all women.  I don't want to get rid of due process, innocent until proven guilty, and you need to bring proof.  It's simply not true that these people believe you should believe all women.  They believe you should believe all women if that woman is on their side and I find that despicable.  Now I'm not saying that I believe Tara Reid.  I don't know what happened and I'm not going to say that I'm on her side because the fact is Joe Biden deserves due process, as do all men.  So that leads us to point number two.  Even if it were true, it shouldn't be.  Even if people on the left truly subscribed to hashtag believe all women, it still wouldn't be a good thing.  Because you have to have due process.  Innocent until proven guilty is really important.  Think about your husband.  Think about your son.  Think about your father.  If somebody wanted to ruin his life in one sentence, they could, and there would be no repercussions for it.  I'm not trying to come up with statistics of how many women have lied, but there is always a chance that women will lie and say that, hey, this guy did something horrible to me, that if he actually did, should deserve the worst punishment possible.  But if he didn't, And we sentence him to that?  Well, some women might take advantage of that.  And that's really scary.  Sexual assault should not be taken lightly on either side of the scenario.  If a woman says that she's been sexually assaulted, we need to investigate that.  But we also can't immediately assume that she's telling the truth.  Men have a right to due process.  And as women, we should be looking for truth.  Truth doesn't necessarily side with gender.  It just sides with what really happened.  The hashtag BelieveAllWomen movement was never real.  It was created to wield as a hammer against Brat Kavanaugh and have the right fall in line.  And as soon as it wasn't working in the favor of the people who created it, they threw it out when it was inconvenient.  And on top of that, believe all women should never have existed in the first place.  You investigate and make sure that there is proof of what happened so that people's lives aren't ruined because they were guilty until proven innocent.  That's never been the way America has worked, and we are lucky to live in a country where we are innocent until proven guilty.  I do want to reiterate that if you've been sexually assaulted, that's a horrible thing.  And of course, it should be taken seriously.  Those accusations should be listened to.  But we also have to protect the innocent whose lives could be ruined by one person spreading a lie.  Let me know in the comments below what you think about hashtag Believe All Women.
