But the reason he's asking this question is because the lawsuits wouldn't account for the votes that are needed for Trump to win.  These lawsuits, by the way, which are being thrown out in these states.  So I'll get to that in a second.  But first, I want to show you some of the response here.  From conservative media.  This is Benny Johnson.  I believe he hosts a show on Newsmax.  Yeah, so another conservative network.  He says here, Fox News is now indistinguishable from CNN.  This segment is disgusting.  Every single conservative in this country should stop watching.  Send a message.  Obviously here, Benny Johnson wants you to watch Newsmax over Fox News.  But the... What is so terrible about this?  He's not even acknowledging, by the way, that Joe Biden's president elect.  He actually pushed back several times when when the Trump spokesperson was was making that point.  So, like, what are you talking about here?  All he was asking is, where do you find the votes for Trump to actually win the election?  That is what they were trying to argue.  They should have an answer for that.  And she has no answer for it.  Now, let me show you, this is the map.  The election's over.  Joe Biden won, 306 to 232.  He picked up Arizona, picked up Georgia.  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.  Joe Biden won the election.  It's done.  Now, you may want to point to, oh, but how about those lawsuits going on?  There's all these lawsuits going on.  This is why OAN, another conservative network, have not acknowledged the states that Biden won.  They're saying this race is still close.  Let me quickly play this clip from OAN, and you're going to laugh at the absurdity. ",

These states are called, the election is over, yet they're still trying to pretend they're contested.  Let me show you here why Aaron Perini could not answer the question.  Trump strikes out in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania ballot challenges.  So to get to the specifics here, in Arizona, Trump's campaign dropped a legal challenge of a number of ballots in Maricopa County, saying Biden's overall lead in the state is too big for the disputed ballots to make a difference.  So even in their lawsuit, even if they won this legal challenge, which has no bearing in reality, Even if they won that, it wouldn't be enough for Trump to actually win the state.  So they had to drop the lawsuit anyways.  In Michigan, a judge declined a request from Trump backers to block the certification of election results in Detroit.  So they lost that legal challenge in Michigan.  And in Pennsylvania, Secretary of State Kathy Bookvar said she is determined not to order a recount and a recanvass of the election return in six, seven counties.  For a recount to be ordered, Trump would have to be losing by less than 0.5% of the votes cast.  And Biden has a solid lead there.  He won Pennsylvania.  There's no need to do anything more there.  So they had to drop that.  And still, Trump is refusing to concede.  I'm going to show you a couple tweets in a minute.  Actually, right now, I'll show you those tweets.  Here's one from this morning.  In fact, I saw this right when it went live.  Let's refresh and see if Twitter has corrected it.  Not yet.  OK, so he tweets out here saying the radical left Democrats working with their partner, the fake news media, are trying to steal this election.  We won't let them.  The election's over.  You had to drop your own lawsuits because they wouldn't even be enough for you to win the election.  Another one from this morning.  I won the election.  Official sources called this election differently.  Jesus Christ.  This is just... Look, the election's over.  Trump can't steal it.  It's not going to happen.  He's never going to actually concede.  I can almost guarantee you that.  He will never actually concede.  And he will use this energy to start his own Trump network or a show on one of these conservative networks.  He's going to do something with this outrage, this victim culture that he has amassed around him.  Always playing the victim.  Always playing the victim.  What a sad, sad little man. ",
