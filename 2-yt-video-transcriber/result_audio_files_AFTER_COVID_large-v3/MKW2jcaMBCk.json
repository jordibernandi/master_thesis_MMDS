            "text": "This is Pastor Carter Conlon from Times Square Church in New York City.  What a pleasure it is to be back with you again today.  And here we are, you and I, in the midst of our social storm and all the difficulties that are going on around us with the financial situation we're facing, people having to stay in their homes for whatever reason.  It's a very, very difficult moment.  for so many people.  But I've been sharing with you the last couple of times that we've met about the psalmist in Psalm 46 who's talking about God is our refuge, God is our strength, a very present help in time of trouble.  Even though everything around us seems to be shifting and moving and collapsing and swelling and falling apart, there still is this river of life in Christ that makes our heart glad.  This presence of God in us, the promise of God in us, it makes my heart glad, and I'm trusting it makes your heart glad too as well today.  God is in the midst of it, and we are given the promise that we will not be moved, though, verse 6 says, \"...the nations  raged.\".  There's this rage in our world against Christ, and I think we're paying the price in some measure for a lot of that.  The kingdoms were moved.  He uttered his voice.  The earth melted.  The psalmist says, The Lord of hosts, verse 7 in Psalm 46, is with us, and the God of Jacob is our refuge.  Come, behold the works of the Lord, who has made desolations in the earth and makes wars cease to the end of the earth.  He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two and burns the chariot in the fire.  Be still and know that I am God.  I will be exalted among the nations.  I will be exalted in the earth.  The Lord of hosts is with us.  The God of Jacob is our refuge.  It reads simply, God is saying, you're about to see things in the world that you've not seen before.  The nations are going to rage.  They're going to actually, ultimately, they rage against God.  They rage against the authority of God or the laws of God or the ways of God.  And there's going to be desolations come into the earth because of it.  But at a certain point, God is going to move his hand and say, that's enough.  That's enough war.  That's enough rising up one against another.  The promise of God is that one day Christ will return and there will be a new heavens and a new earth.  Until that day comes, the Lord says, be still.  and know that I am God.  Be calm inside.  Don't be driven around by the winds and the waves and every news report that comes across the air every five minutes.  Don't let those things drive you.  Be led by the word of God.  Be led by the promises of God.  Actually, be led by the life of Christ being lived out inside of you.  Be still and know that I am God.  Be still and know.  Think about those words just for a moment.  Be still.  Remember Jesus said these words in the New Testament.  Let not your heart be troubled.  Let it not be afraid.  In my Father's house are many mansions.  I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there ye may be also.  If it were not so, he said, I... would have told you be still.  and no God says that I am in control of everything that is happening around you today.  nothing is outside the control of God.  and one day one day God says, I will be exalted in the earth.  And you have placed your trust in him, will not be disappointed.  You will not be put to shame.  You will not be conquered.  You will not be vanquished.  You will not lose your testimony.  Your hope will one day prove itself to have not been in vain.  Why?  The psalmist says it this way, the Lord of hosts is with us and the God of Jacob, who is Jesus Christ, is with us.  He's with you.  He's not left you.  He's not forsaken you.  That was His promise to you.  I will never leave you.  I will never forsake you.  So, it's a tough time for all of us.  If your whole focus is on the exterior, then you're going to be thrown.  If you have a rich interior presence of God, and a heart that's filled with confidence in Him and His promises, you will not be shaken by the days we're now living in.  It will all pass soon, and one day, you and I will gather at the throne of God, we will rejoice and sing together, and we'll say this one thing, I'm sure of it, oh, thank God we didn't give up our hope.  Thank God we didn't cast away our confidence in Jesus Christ in the midst of the storm.  I love you so much because God loves you.  Thank God for you because he's thankful for you.  He'll keep you.  Don't be afraid.  We're going to make it.  Our sons and our daughters and our brothers and our sisters, all that we've prayed for and all who have trusted in Christ, we will all be there soon and very soon.  Until that day, be encouraged.  Be encouraged.  I'll see you again soon. ",
