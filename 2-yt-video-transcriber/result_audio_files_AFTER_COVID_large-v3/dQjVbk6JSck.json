            "text": "Why is the right so fixated with cucks?  So the dictionary definition of cuck, short for cuckled, is a man in a Robert Varathian scenario, in which he does not realize the children he is raising were in fact sired by someone else.  The glint in the milkman's eye and all that.  The word derives from the common cuckoo's practice of laying their eggs in the nest of another bird who raises the chick as their own.  If you watch Black Mirror, you know, you know, is the child mine?  Is one of Charlie Brooker's big hangups?  He's more afraid of brood parasitism than he is of cell phones.  But colloquially, a cuck is someone, usually a man, whose partner, usually a woman, is cheating on him.  To use a common metaphor, the cow is out with the bull while the steer is alone in the barn, sometimes with the implication that the steer knows about it.  It is a common insult for a man who is, or who would theoretically be, too weak to leave a faithless woman, and might even tell himself he's okay being cheated on.  How this term enters common usage is through cuckoldry porn made for cuckoldry fetishists.  So a cuckoldry fetishist is someone, again usually a man, who gets off on the humiliation of being cheated on, often with someone more masculine than him.  And cuckoldry porn serves this fetish by showing women having sex with men who are not their partners, sometimes with their partners watching.  Or traditionally, and now we're getting to it, white women having sex with black men who are not their white partners.  This is based on a lot of racist stereotypes about the animalistic virility of black men and the need to protect white women from it, and generalized fears of race-mixing.  That's not to say all cuck fetishists or pornographers are white supremacists.  They can find the idea of being cheated on with a black man more emasculating than a white one without necessarily asking themselves why they feel this way.  And, as is usually the case with porn, what becomes standard is not often what the majority wants, but what a minority wants and the majority will tolerate.  That said, it is still racism and misogyny.  And that's why the right is into it.  The term has grown in popularity roughly in tandem with the rise of the alt-right, especially in the new coinage, Cuxervative.  a term the far-right uses for establishment Republicans whom they feel are insufficiently to the right, i.e.  could stand to be more racist and misogynist.  While not everyone who uses it is aware of the racial component, the connotation is deliberate.  It originated on white nationalist websites, pushing the narrative that mainstream conservatives are letting their woman, America, get fucked by Mexicans, Muslims, and black people.  It is in fact very important to a large contingent of the right that the racism not be sheared off.  To quote Richard goddamn Spencer, the cuckservative meme doesn't make any sense without race.  It's all about race.  So every time someone uses this word in public, there's a portion of the audience that hears it as just an insult, and a portion that hears it as a signal of racial allegiance.  and a lot of people using it like to keep us guessing as to which way they meant it.  Now, if you're a man on the internet who's not a raging dickwad, you've probably at some point been called a cuck by a man who is.  I personally have been called a cuck by dozens of people, many on this very website, sometimes for hours at a time, often with upwards of seven ad breaks.  Let's unpack that a little.  Now, I don't want to give oxygen to these people.  I don't do response videos.  I'm not going to be addressing their arguments, as compelling as I'm sure they are.  And they aren't owed access to my platform.  But I do need to put something on screen, so since they're mostly bearded white guys yelling into video cameras, they will be played today by Nick Offerman.  Steer clear of Ian Danskin, ladies.  This man is a cuckold.  And for all the fans of these videos already writing angry comments saying that I should be naming names and showing clips, that's not what strawman means.  So, okay.  Most often, when you get called a cuck on the internet, it's being invoked to accuse you of a masculinity deficiency.  It's a loose synonym for beta male, although I hear the preferred term for that now is simp, so I will have to update my stationery.  But I get it more than most because, as some of you already know, I am polyamorous.  When you're a public figure on the internet, you can't really prevent people from forming parasocial relationships with you.  But you can make it easier or harder for them.  I opt for the latter.  I rarely appear on camera, I rarely speak unscripted, and I don't talk much about my personal life.  And that's not going to change today.  I'm not going to share specifics about my partners or my experience of polyamory, but people do take advantage of this.  In a partial vacuum of information, bad faith actors just make assumptions or outright fabricate, which puts me in the position of either allowing false info to spread about me or divulging things that are nobody's business if I want to correct it.  And neither is a win for me.  Turns out you can't fight discourse with discourse.  That said, while I don't talk a lot about being polyamorous, it's not exactly a secret.  The Right knows this about me because years before I was a YouTuber, a partner of mine went on the Huffington Post Live to talk about polyamory and invited me to join.  And after I made my series on misogynist harassment campaigns, Gamergate's sleuths went all the way to the second page of Google search results to dig it up.  And since the only version of polyamory they can fathom is a guy whose partner cheats on him and gaslights him into thinking he's okay with it, I've been hearing them chant, You let your wife sleep with other men.  for the last five years.  Let the record show that when I accused them of being a sex estate mob, they countered with, Well, you can't keep a leash on your woman.  Which I found, um, a poor rebuttal.  And I should say, while it is deeply uncomfortable to have strangers essentially writing fanfic about what they think I do or don't do with my junk and getting paid for it, I don't actually care that these people think I'm a cuck.  And I understand that not caring that people think I'm a cuck is proof of what a cuck I am, or alternately that everyone cares deeply about not being cucks and only a cuck would lie about it.  But seriously, it is a model of relationships and masculinity so far removed from my own, it doesn't even qualify as an insult.  And I think they know that.  I can always tell when one of these videos comes out because I get an influx of commenters going, cuck, cuck, cuck.  And I confess, sometimes it's fun to mess with them.  But it's not really for me.  It's for their own benefit.  It's performative.  They see polyamory as a disruption to their idea of what it means to be a man in a relationship, and feel a need to reassert their model.  It's insulting me as a form of self-talk and in-group solidarity.  I've talked about how conservatism tends to view the world hierarchically.  There can't simply be two relationship models that are both valid.  They have to be ranked.  If one is good, the other must be bad.  And that by being polyamorous, by treating polyamory as valid, I am inviting the counter-argument that no, in fact, it is monogamy that is valid.  Because if polyamory is valid, then I'm saying they should be polyamorous too.  Which, boys, from the bottom of my heart, no you should not.  You would be disasters.  Like, you're a pack of heterosexual misogynist men.  I don't think you should be dating anyone.  Also, I don't concern myself with the relationship models of people I'm not trying to make out with.  Now, an interesting thing about that HuffPo interview is, uh, Steve Harvey's people saw it, and they invited us onto their show.  Nothing came of it.  They actually ghosted us.  after a few phone calls, though I now get to say, Steve Harvey outed me to my family.  But it meant we spent a couple of weeks vetting Steve Harvey, and we learned a bit about what he thinks of men.  Among Steve Harvey's many beliefs are that men can't be friends with women, they only want to sleep with them, and that men never turn their fuck buddies into relationships, and that men don't nag.  And if these claims are countered with personal experience of real and actual men doing these things.  Well, Joy.  That's what I'm hearing.  Maybe, maybe the position I'm taking is maybe you should check your husband's man card.  I think a lot about Steve Harvey's man card.  Like, setting aside the obvious flaw with this argument.  This is pure crap, by the way.  That's really the meat of all these comments and tweets and retumbles, isn't it?  Ian Danskin, check the expiration date on your man card.  And it's funny.  I can't deny that it's funny.  Because if we wanted to play that game, we could play that game.  There are a lot of stereotypical male fantasies that get put on the table in an open relationship, from group sex to casual hookups while maintaining a stable relationship to sleeping with all your attractive friends.  But that's not where their minds go.  And when they call me a cuck, I do toy with saying, oh darn, I'll be sure to meditate on what a cuck I am during my next three-way just to get their heads spinning.  I'm not saying I've had a lot of three ways.  I'm also not saying I haven't, because it is, again, none of your business.  But I'm not gonna play that game.  I'm not gonna say polyamory is good actually because sometimes it's alpha.  The truth is, I've been at this a while, and there have been stretches where I was dating only one person who had multiple partners.  There have also been stretches where I was dating multiple people, all of whom were only involved with me, so I guess I was cucking them.  And honestly, it's all just dating.  You do this long enough, you're gonna be in a lot of permutations.  But the reason these guys hear polyamory and their minds immediately go to guy who stays at home and cries while his wife is out with other men is because that's what they're afraid of.  There are many reasons to choose monogamy over polyamory, but theirs is fear.  They are afraid of getting cheated on and what it would say about their masculinity.  Monogamy makes them feel secure in possessing the object of their desire, so cuckoldry is horrifying because it means no longer possessing the object, but the object still possessing them.  Of course a hierarchical mindset is terrified of polyamory, because they cannot imagine their partner could date multiple people and not rank them, and they fear not being at the top.  They're afraid of being insufficient, of not being sexy, or manly, or interesting enough to keep a woman from wandering but liking her too much to cut her loose when she does.  And they're afraid of polyamory getting normalized, of people they want to date asking them to consent to things they're not comfortable with, and getting shamed as relics of the past if they refuse.  Or, at the very least, that's what their audience is afraid of, and feeding that fear makes them money.  Seven ad breaks.  So there's a lot of profit in selling Steve Harvey's man card.  I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to use it, you know?  Like, do I get student discounts?  Frequent flyer miles?  These guys say I'm a cuck for being polyamorous, right?  So, presumably, to no longer be a cuck, I'd have to stop.  Thing is, I can't just end all my relationships, save one, and become a monogamist.  You might gather that I don't date monogamous people.  I date polyamorous people, none of whom want to be in a closed relationship.  So they would probably just break up with me.  And I'm close with a lot of my partner's partners, so I wouldn't just be losing my relationships, but an entire extended community.  And men and women can't be friends, apparently, which I find distressing because most of my friends are women.  And I don't know Steve Harvey's stance on my friendships with trans and non-binary people, but I can't imagine he thinks highly of them.  And from the other things people who call me a cuck say, I've gathered that emotional intimacy with other men is gay and therefore bad, and being in therapy means you're weak and taking antidepressants is for cowards.  So all I gotta do... is cut out every emotionally supportive relationship in my life, go off my meds, lose all my safety nets, and turn my entire life ass over tea kettle, and in return, I'll get... what?  Guys, I get what?  Your respect?  Weirdos will stop yelling at me?  Yes, Ian.  Become what we want, and we'll stop fucking with you.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's an abuse tactic, but setting that aside, these people who flood my comment sections to insult me every time a bearded white man mentions my name, who post screenshots of my work out of context to misrepresent me, am I supposed to want their approval?  I'm supposed to want to leave my community for theirs.  I'm supposed to adopt their view of how to be a man.  These guys who spend hours of their day keyword searching on Twitter so they can pick fights with strangers.  Am I supposed to believe they're happier than me?  What's in it for me?  I mean, I know the default response to this question is to just shame you until you stop asking it.  You have to get pretty deep in the manosphere before you find people actually trying to answer it, and that's a subject for another day.  Being a real man will not make you happy.  Happiness is for cucks.  But I'm not seeing the percentage.  I have my ups and downs same as everybody, but what I'm doing works for me.  And let's say I am unconvinced that what they're doing works for anybody.  I don't know, I guess I just find the whole cuckoldry thing fascinating, because it's a collision of the right's incompatible worldviews.  Like, they could just cop to it, just admit, we idolize masculinity because we're men, and it feels good to think the world belongs to you.  That would at least be consistent.  But no, they gotta gussy it up with all this bullcorn about the essential character of manliness.  It's all about power and stoicism and sexual appetites.  Satisfying and controlling your woman.  I was just introduced to the phrase paleolarping, which is perfect.  A real man is built for leading tribes and hunting the mammoth.  That's us in our natural state.  But then you've got white supremacy idolizing Europe, saying that whites are the architects of civilization, that what makes us great is that we're cultured and intellectual, we painted chapels and took credit for mathematics.  It was right of us to enslave those brutish and animalistic Africans.  But of course, you can't idolize Paleolithic man and denigrate Africa.  White supremacy has got them stereotyping black men into being everything toxic masculinity says they should be.  Strong and sexually voracious.  And what do they do with that tension?  What does anyone do?  they eroticize it.  Of course they're going to have an inferiority complex around black men.  To paraphrase T from Champagne Sharks, of course they're going to have an obsession with the black penis.  Of course one of the driving fears and morbid curiosities of their entire politics is gonna be the image of a black man fucking their girlfriend.  And of course they're going to project all their fears onto you when you say go and God bless when your partner clicks with someone else.  Not that I care.  But I'm going to take 40 minutes to explain how much this clearly bothers you.  These boys have hang-ups.  And there's no arguing with it.  They don't care what's true.  They've been yelling, you let your wife fuck other men for pushing six years now.  And fun fact, I've never been married, never claimed to be, and no one but them has ever said I was.  But their story, that I have one partner whom I've either willingly sacrificed my autonomy to because I'm such a worm, or who I'm stuck with though I secretly yearn to be free, just works better if we're married.  That's the story they prefer, so that's how they tell it.  And half the time they're confusing it with the shit they made up about Anthony Burch.  Why would I waste my time arguing with that?  Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head.  Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head.  Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head.  Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head.  It's been a little long, but the fantasy's finally gone.  Rest in peace to the me that you had in your head. ",
