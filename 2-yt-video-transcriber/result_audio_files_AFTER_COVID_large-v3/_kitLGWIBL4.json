And social media is also jam-packed full of similar comments from people who should also think about what they're going to say before they say it and then not say it anyway.  And I've got to say, this guy here must win the internet for his reply to somebody who correctly told him what a virus actually was.  So what actually is a virus then?  Well I'm going to get this question out the way very very quickly because I think by now we all know and also right now there are a ton of videos on this very subject flying around the internet.  So here's just a quick recap in 25 seconds.  Now for a start, unlike the brain cells of some of the people you're going to see in this video, viruses are real.  And here's an electron microscope image of our old friend COVID-19.  Now on the outside of a virus are things called glycoproteins.  And if the glycoproteins on the outside of a virus are a good match for the receptors on the outside of a cell, then it can gain entrance to the cell where it releases its own genetic material and forces the cell to mass produce other viruses until the host cell is destroyed.  Now, as off-putting as I actually find the idea of taking a live bat and dropping it into boiling water in order to cook it, it's not at all likely that the coronavirus was the result of somebody eating bat soup, which was one of the stories during the rounds early on in the pandemic.  You see, remember those glycoproteins we talked about earlier?  Well, with the SARS coronavirus, which also started off in a bat, they mutated just enough for them to be a good match for the receptor cells on a civet.  They then mutated again so they could infect human cells.  The MERS epidemic went from bat to camel to human, and early evidence suggests that COVID-19 did not jump straight from bat to human, but made its way into the pangolin first, which is a problem, and we'll see why later on.  Time for part two. ",

            "text": "Well, given that some sources are suggesting that the first case was actually reported in China as early as the 17th of November, and given that at the time of the making of this video, we now have, I don't know, a shitload of cases, it would appear that this virus can actually spread.  But how?  Well, we all know that limiting human contact is very important.  In the early part of the outbreak, Russia closed its borders with China before it even had a single reported case.  As a result of that, it now just sits at 0.9 deaths per million of its population, truly showing that early action to stop people mixing can be very effective.  So why is it then that COVID-19 appears to spread so quickly when compared with other outbreaks?  Well, some early estimates place COVID-19's R0 value anywhere near as high as 3.  Now an R0 value basically tells us how many people on average will be infected by somebody else who has the virus.  This graph here shows us a very, very stark picture of just how much more aggressively a virus with an R0 value of around 3 will rip through a population, compared to even a virus with an R0 value of 2.6.  To put that into perspective, the flu has an R0 value between 1.4 and 1.6, giving us a line that's even flatter than the purple line on this graph.  But why does it spread so quickly?  Well, we all know that COVID-19 can be spread through sneezing.  But unlike the flu, the COVID-19 virus can survive in those tiny water droplets for far longer.  It was believed that the flu virus, for example, could remain able to infect outside of the body for anything up to 48 hours.  But more recent research suggests that actually under normal conditions, this number is far, far lower.  In fact, just a few hours.  Whereas current evidence is suggesting that COVID-19 could remain able to infect in water droplets on hard surfaces for days.  In addition to that, COVID-19 can also be sustained in faecal matter, making the faecal-oral transmission route a possibility.  Some suggest that even two people in separate apartments in the same building that share poor plumbing can be part of the same transmission chain.  And then we have the series interval, which is essentially a measure of how quickly one person can pass a virus onto somebody else.  Now, for COVID-19, we can be thankful that it's not the shortest series interval out there, but it is still shorter than other large epidemics, such as the SARS virus.  Oh, and remember this guy?  Well, it turns out that the scales of the pangolin have reputed healing properties, making it an animal that is far and wide on both legal and illegal markets.  This is something that would only have helped speed up the transmission of COVID-19.  Next point. ",

            "text": "So how exactly does COVID-19 harm the body?  This is the ursac or alveoli in the lung.  This is where necessary gas exchange takes place.  In other words we absorb oxygen into our blood and we lose carbon dioxide from our blood.  Now inside the alveoli we have these type 1 alveolar cells.  Their job is to facilitate this gas exchange and they are very very thin to allow it to happen.  But just as importantly we also have type 2 alveolar cells and their job is to reduce the surface tension within the alveoli which stops the alveoli from collapsing.  Now it's these type 2 cells that do get invaded by COVID-19 and that means if the body doesn't respond eventually the alveoli will collapse preventing that all-important gas exchange.  But the body does respond to this infection and the white blood cells release chemicals called interleukins.  Now there's a lot of interleukins but we're concerned about number one and number six.  But these interleukins also cause an inflammatory response which draws fluid out of the capillaries that are surrounding the alveoli.  This puts a physical pressure on the ursac and again can cause it to collapse.  Or this extra fluid can also enter the alveoli blocking off gas exchange as if we were drowning.  Now this of course makes it incredibly difficult to breathe, causing the patient to expend an incredible amount of energy gasping for breath, and this is why ventilators are so important.  Now while all that's going on, the same interleukins that cause that inflammatory response trigger the hypothalamus to raise the temperature of the body, resulting in a fever.  Now the damage to the alveoli obviously decreases the amount of oxygen we can take into our blood.  And that causes the heart to work faster, to pump faster, to desperately try and get whatever oxygen is in the blood around the body.  And you might think that that will have the effect of increasing blood pressure.  But actually, if the inflammatory response we talked about before spreads to other parts of the body, then we can lose an enormous amount of fluid from the blood, which actually causes a massive drop in blood pressure.  But of course, COVID-19 isn't going to affect everybody as seriously as that.  Only a small percentage of the people.  However, when the number of cases are so high because it's spreading so rapidly, that small percentage becomes a big number of people.  And that is why we need to be acting to make sure we're not overwhelming the NHS. ",

If you're so convinced you're going to have a tracking microchip injected in you, then maybe you should put down that GPS-enabled location-detecting smartphone that you're filming your video on.  Now, the truth is we didn't manage to make a vaccine for SARS and MERS.  All of those attempts were unsuccessful, and the latest reports are that there won't be a vaccine within the next 12 to 18 months.  But by that they mean a vaccine which is safe to be given to the masses.  Those vaccines are first tested on animals and any that show promise are then tested in phase one on a small number of people to make sure that they are safe for humans.  Testing then moves on to phase two and phase three with progressively large number of people to see how effective the vaccine actually is.  However, experimental vaccines can be made much sooner with the aim of giving them to key workers and to the vulnerable.  And new emergency legislation has been put in place to make this more possible.  So where does that leave us?  Well, in the meantime, we are inevitably going to build up some sort of herd immunity, but we all know there's going to be a big cost to that.  Other than that, I would never claim to know what needs to be done to balance saving as many lives as possible and saving the economy.
