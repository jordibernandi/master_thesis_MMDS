            "text": "We were the first accident.  I hit those two.  I'm not sure if I hit anybody else.  I assess injuries here.  No injuries.  They don't want any mess.  I went back up there to assess their injuries, but police just showed up.  So I came back over here.  That's all I'm sure about.  I'm not sure if it's all of the same or not.  I'm really not sure.  That's about where the impact happened, I think, somewhere around there.  Maybe it was up here.  Who knows?  It happened up there, and then y'all moved over here?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, so I'm really not sure as to how they're involved or not.  Okay.  And then when you're ready for my information, I'll give that to you.  All righty.  What happened?  My... I'd rather not say.  Well, I mean, I'm asking you what happened.  Yeah, I'm just going to be quiet.  Separate or safe?  Sounds like separate, but he doesn't want to say anything.  Yeah, I'm not going to say nothing.  I'm not going to answer any questions.  You're not going to tell me what happened?  I'll provide my information, and that's it.  Okay, we'll make the assessment of what you did then.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Very cool.  All right.  No problem, no disrespect, but I just, I don't talk to police.  Do you know who I am?  I'm TX ShipDog72, Jack Miller.  Ah, that's nice.  So it should come up no surprise to you that I'm not... I know the name.  Yeah, so... You know, I'm not... You film me on Zara the Moral one day.  I'm not going to talk to the police, you know that.  Okay, that's good.  No disrespect, but I'm just not going to answer any questions that aren't required.  Okay.  No problem.  Awesome.  But I did... Is your truck drivable?  I did... No.  No?  I did immediately assess for injuries.  They're not injured, and then I went back there to assess for injuries, because that's most important.  You're a nurse?  No.  You're wearing it.  That's right.  It's comfortable to go to jail in.  I go to jail a lot.  Let me get records on the way for you, okay?  All right, man.  Can you let him know where you want your truck towed, though?  Huh?  Can you let him know where you want your truck towed, though?  Yeah, absolutely.  And I can call my own record if you need to, but whatever.  There's an ordinance on that one.  Yeah, but yeah, I can.  Yeah, sure, sure.  There you go, sir.  If you have any questions, ask me.  If you have any questions, ask me, because some questions I might answer.  Like where you want my vehicle towed, I'll answer that.  We'll wait for that, and then let me go get with them over there, okay?  You know what?  What lane we're all in?  I don't know, bro.  To be honest with you, I don't know.  Thank you.  So the very top left corner, that's the case number.  Okay, so I'm going to write the report under that case number right there, okay?  So very top left.  So this is just some preliminary info, but all the information will be under my crash report, which is going to be under that case number.  Okay, it's a formal report, and all the info will be in there.  all righty uh description of what occurred what y'all told me.  uh everyone's info all that will be in there.  okay yeah all right y'all have any questions?  so i just yeah i do.  i'm sorry go ahead you first.  yes sir so we're still waiting.  they're stuck in traffic so we're trying to pull them through to get up here.  so we got two records coming out.  okay okay thank you you're welcome.  yes sir i see amanda i'm assuming that's her yes and then i don't see anything on him.  Well, no.  So, I'm just providing... I know what you're fixing to say, but I'm required to get all information from the other party involved in the crash.  So, I think I made contact with his vehicle as well.  So, I would need his information as well.  If you want it, that's fine.  Hey, Lonnie, can you put it... Thank you.  That way I can give everything to the insurance and let them know who they need to contact.  Okay, that's fine.  Like I explained, I'm going to do a crash report.  So, ma'am, if you don't have any questions, you're free to go.  And you guys have my information on your sheets.  So, you're free to go.  Excuse me.  I didn't ask you.  I was talking to them.  You don't talk to me when I'm talking to them.  You don't interrupt me.  You go over there.  I'm standing here.  I'm involved in the crash.  I'm in a safe place.  I don't want to talk to you.  I'm the officer investigating this crash.  I don't want to talk to you.  Go away.  I'm going to ask them the question that I asked them before.  I'm talking to her.  She's free to go.  I'm going to ask them the question that I asked them before you interrupted me.  She's free to go, sir.  Are you done with me?  She's free to go.  Are you done with me?

And so I asked the lady, do you have my info?  And he fucking gets in the middle of us.  And I'm like, come on, dude.  I'm talking to you.  What the fuck?  So anyway, all right, man.  I'll get your info real quick.  Okay.  All right.  I'm not going to be mean to you, man.  I'm going to be very mean to him, though.  Fuck that dude.  I got to keep my man on camera.

So go ahead, explain some more.  Let me hear your reasoning for doing what you just did.  I'm sure you got a lot of views, correct?  I'm sure you do.  Give me some of that explaining though.

You touched me several times.  And then he can look at our cameras and see that I didn't fucking touch you.  That's fine.  It'll be on there.  So charge me with a salt.  Put some cuffs on.  Mr.  Miller.  That's his right.  I'm sorry, man.  I know it is and it's my right.  Sarge, listen.  It's my right.  It's his right.  Okay, listen.  You're not going to let that wrecker hit me.  It's his right, it's my right.  But I'm not going to keep that record out here any longer than I need to.  I know you don't care, but let me tell you something.  I was 1,000% respectful until he started his shit.  Okay, I understand.  Okay.  All right.  And I do care.  Okay.  All right.  But I need to get this highway opened as fast as I can because there's, what, 10,000 people?  That's fine.  Do what you got to do, man.  That's what I keep telling you guys.  Get to work. ",
