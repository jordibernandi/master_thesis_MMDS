            "text": "Is anyone missing the signs of the end times now?  You know, it wasn't long ago I remember I was in a pastor's office.  This pastor had a mega church.  I'd actually spoken for him several years back and he said one of these things that pastors say when you go into the green room.  He says, you know, really good job.  Thanks a lot, Pastor Steve.  And we're definitely going to have you back again.  And, you know, six, seven years later, you don't hear from him and you wonder what's happening.  Because if I say that, then I mean it.  So I asked him about it and finally he fessed up and he said, well, you know, we just don't agree about the end time and I don't think it's a major topic in the Bible.  You know, we're on a different journey.  So he said that to me and I just left him to the Lord.  But I realize how many pastors can actually make fun of scriptures concerning prophecy prior to coronavirus.  And now I think it'd be very hard to find a pastor who's making fun of the end times.  The signs are clearly upon us.  The drones are upon us.  They're unleashing such totalitarian power over the people and there is such great deception, such censorship of any voice of dissent.  So I said about two months ago that I believe when Passover comes, that at that time when we celebrate the holy blood of the Messiah, the blood that was shed for the sins of the world to be washed away, at that time the power of the blood will be applied and the coronavirus lockdown will begin to dissipate.  Well, sure enough, it's happening.  States are opening up all over America, all over Australia.  The restrictions are easing for the moment, and we're in this period of waiting, prophetically, on the calendar of God, waiting for the next feast, which is called the Feast of Shavuot, or the Feast of Pentecost.  So Passover started on April 8, and now we wait 50 days.  We're about to arrive on the 28th of May, which is the first day of Shavuot, or Pentecost.  In the Old Testament, the law was given.  In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit was given.  I really believe on this day, the 28th of May, my 10 policy recommendations based on the 10 commandments of God, how to apply God's Word to our lifetime, to our government now, will be on the desk of President Trump.  I know that the book has already gone into the White House, but there are lots of people there, and it doesn't mean the President has taken the time to read it.  But I believe on the 28th, and you know why the 28th is also significant for me personally?  The 28th is the day that I accepted Jesus as Lord.  It's my spiritual birthday this year.  It just so happened to be on Pentecost.  And I really believe on this law-giving day, Holy Spirit descending day, something is going to change in the spirit realm and in the White House.  I know that Christians can be guilty of being long on the problem, but short on the solution.  And I want to stay away from that.  You know, this is one of the reasons why people who read my book, Trump's Unfinished Business, say it is refreshing, it is so different, because I'm not writing about why Trump won or something that happened in the past.  I'm writing about solutions for our future.  And even though I believe Jesus is coming soon, I have great hope for humanity.  I don't believe that we'll take over the world.  I don't believe we'll stop the Antichrist.  But he's only going to be in power for three and a half years.  We have a lot of work to do to bring righteousness and justice to our nations.  And when the Antichrist comes, we'll let him have his way for three and a half years, and then Jesus will come, it will be all over.  And then we'll resume our work of righteousness and justice on the earth.  And the template, the ten templates given in Trump's unfinished business will still be needed.  And it will be implemented.  As you can see, I've got a page open that's Trump's unfinished business in Portuguese.  This is our first foreign language and I think it's really important because Brazilians follow me and Brazilians are praying for revival and Brazilians have an opportunity with a conservative government to make a lasting change.  The last time there was revival in Brazil, there was no effect on the state, the governing, the leadership of the country.  And that was such a shame.  The church completely dropped the ball because the church preached salvation of individuals but not of the nation.  And Jesus said very clearly He wants us to disciple nations.  That means the very top leaders of government need to know what to do and how to make decisions based on God's template of governing and leadership and justice.  So that's why I'm very proud to say that it's in Portuguese.  Because of coronavirus lockdown, depending on your country, you may not be able to get the paperback, but you should be able to get the Kindle edition. ",
