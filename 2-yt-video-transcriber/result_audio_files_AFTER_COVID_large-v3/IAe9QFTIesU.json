So I wanted to kind of hear a little bit more on it.  In terms of how do you respond to people that say, what happened to the people who who died before Christ or in regions of the world where Christ didn't come until later on? ",

            "text": "Okay, I had to give a Twitter type answer to this question that Eric posed.  And what I said was that given the universality of sin and the uniqueness of Christ's sinlessness and atoning death, It follows logically that there is no other way of salvation outside of Christ.  But that doesn't imply that the only way to access that salvation is through explicit faith in Christ.  People who lived during the time of Abraham had never heard of Jesus Christ.  but they believed in the revelation that God had given to them and the benefits of Christ's atoning blood were applied to them even though they had no conscious knowledge of Christ.  So it would be as though you had a rich uncle who left you an inheritance in his will that you had never heard of before and you suddenly discover that you You are named in His will and are Arab as well even though you never knew that He existed.  Some of these Old Testament people will probably be like that when they get to heaven and meet Christ because they were trusting in the revelation that they had, but ultimately their salvation is won through the atoning death of Christ.
