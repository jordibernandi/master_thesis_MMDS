Because I think it really does summarize what his appeal is to people, both the actual appeal that people are feeling and also what he wants them to feel.  Now, it is not necessarily perfectly targeted to a progressive like me in terms of being founded in policy.  But I do think that it could be pretty effective.  So we're going to watch it right now and discuss.  This is one of the last Joe Biden ads.  There's a new world coming, and it's just around the bend. ",

And I thought it was good.  I intentionally did not watch the ad before the show because I felt like I wanted to be authentic in my response to it, right?  And my biggest takeaway was hearing Nina Simone and the imagery that matches, right?  I think that at the core, all black people, all American people, all Hispanic people, white people who are of pure intentions wanna see that version of America, right?  They wanna see an America where our children have a future.  They wanna see an America where they see men, women and people of all orientations walking together and progressing in this life and through their journey.  And there's some type of human connection to that, right?  And to have it laced with Nina Simone, I think it is a powerful image.  I hope that it speaks to the heart of people to remind them of what we can be and not what we are. ",

So we're going to have to go right back to work on trying to fix.  But the reason I think that this is going to be so successful, and this is sort of what I was saying back in 2016, when I know that there was this debate about whether it was better to have Donald Trump get in rather than Hillary Clinton.  So that hypothetically, a strong progressive would eventually run against Donald Trump in 2020, that it would give rise to this.  And I remember saying over and over, people are going to be so beaten down by how unrelentingly awful these years are gonna be, that they're going to want to just go back to something that seems sane.  something that seems decent in any way, something that seems relatively close to the truth, all of these things.  And I think that Joe Biden does represent that to a lot of people. ",

And so that ad was not full of a ton of, it wasn't about Medicare for all.  It wasn't about a Green New Deal.  It wasn't about infrastructure reform.  It wasn't about criminal justice.  I mean, it was about those things, but not specific.  But I think that's what people want right now.  That's what we've been given by a combination of Donald Trump and 2020.  They just want to feel like we're going to have a person who is not literally among the worst people on the planet right now in charge of everything.  And that's why I can see that being an effective ad for a lot of people. ",

They're making their decisions based on.  is this someone that I believe can manage the job, right?  And where are you taking us, right?  I think we've had all of the policy debates.  I don't think three weeks out from an election that people are deciding based on Joe Biden or Donald Trump's policies that they're gonna vote.  They're gonna vote because they wanna say this person has the ability to take this nation where I want it to go.  And for conservative Republicans, that's down a rabbit hole of racism and bigotry.  And for everybody else, it's towards at least some sort of normalcy and hope for a better tomorrow. ",
