Upward of 25,000 National Guard members were stationed all around a lockdown capital in Washington this week as police and military authorities sought to fortify the area around President Joe Biden's inauguration.  The troops set up an expansive perimeter in Washington,  D.C.,  with the aim of deterring more violent rioting around the inaugural events.  For a look at the unprecedented Guard presence, the Military Times team was on hand in the city. ",

            "text": "With the inauguration of President Joe Biden taking place amidst potentially violent tensions in the United States, the Capitol has become a virtual fortress likened by some to the military green zone around the U.S.  compound in Baghdad.  Because of several threats and a deadly riot at the Capitol, some 25,000 National Guard members from across the United States were called up to defend and patrol the area around Capitol Hill.  They were armed with M4 rifles, riot gear, and streets in all directions around the inauguration site were cordoned off.  Authorities went to stunning lengths to protect the ceremonies.  The FBI screened thousands of troops for scientific extremist activities, and a dozen were eventually dismissed from inauguration duty.  Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy spoke about the FBI vetting process earlier in the week. ",

So the question is, is that all of them?  Are there others?  So it's clearly something we need to be conscious of inside the entire formation, let alone men and women that may be assigned to this operation here in the Capitol.  We've also been vetting them through the FBI, getting support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to say, to continue the vetting of every man and woman that come here.  We have a process to our JRSOI process where we vet them.  So we're continually going through the process and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation. ",

The historic show of force appeared to have worked.  No protests like the one seen on January 6th when rioters stormed the Capitol in support of President Trump had materialized or interrupted the ceremony, and streets around the inauguration site were mostly calm.  And as calm as it seemed, it wasn't without danger.  Several dozen National Guard members tested positive for COVID-19 in the days leading up to the ceremony.  And while deadly violence and tear gas filled that Capitol building two weeks prior, the ceremony itself was particularly quiet.  President Biden was sworn in before a national mall that was not filled with Americans as it traditionally has been, but with nearly 200,000 flags representing the people who couldn't attend because of the pandemic.  For an inside look inside of the ceremony itself, we go to Military Times Capitol Hill Bureau Chief Leo Shane. ",

Quite a different inauguration than what we saw four years ago for President Trump.  Several thousand guard troops around here.  No crowd, just the flags waving on the National Mall.  You know, on my way in here, I saw a lot of riot shields, a lot of rifles.  So very different, but still transfer of power to the new commander in chief. ",

And if you confirm me, I assure you that the Pentagon, under my leadership, will respect your oversight responsibilities, and we will be transparent with you.  And I will provide you my best counsel, and I will seek yours.  And just like you, I will take seriously the many challenges facing our country, the most immediate of which, in my view, is the pandemic.  And if confirmed, I will quickly review the department's contributions to coronavirus relief efforts, ensuring that we're doing everything that we can to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness.  We'll also do everything we can for our military families.  They too are educating kids at home and losing their jobs and trying to stock the pantry.  I know this committee shares my view that we owe them our best efforts to lighten that load.  We also owe our people a working environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment.  And if confirmed, I will fight hard to stamp out sexual assault and to rid our ranks of racists and extremists.  and to create a climate where everyone fit and willing has the opportunity to serve this country with dignity.  The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies, but we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.  For those enemies and adversaries outside the ranks and around the world, we need resources to match strategy, and strategy matched to policy and policy matched to the will of the American people. ",
