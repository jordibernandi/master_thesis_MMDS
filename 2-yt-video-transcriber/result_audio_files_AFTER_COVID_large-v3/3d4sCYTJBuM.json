Earlier in my career, I had the privilege of covering the White House from the press briefing room for two different broadcast news organizations.  And I have to confess, it is personally and professionally refreshing to see a president of the United States hold a news conference, face tough adversarial questions, and not freak out or spaz out at reporters.

That means you don't lash out or wage war on the press or the media when you get a question you don't like.  There's also a strategic and political component to this as well.  When Joe Biden is courteous and polite to Peter Doocy, even after Doocy has taken an earlier Biden statement out of context.  It increases the chances that Ducey will be objective and fair in his reporting about Joe Biden or his questioning of Biden in the future.  It might also take a Fox News story that might ordinarily be 80% negative, 20% positive about Joe Biden and make it 75-25 or 65-35.  That is a victory for a White House dealing with an adversarial news organization.  And by the way, whether you're the president of the United States or anybody else, when you are calm and professional and firm, you win over people who are not sure whether to believe you or to believe the people who are taking shots at you.  We saw that with Joe Biden and Peter Doocy at the end of a White House signing ceremony.  Thank you.  Mr.  President, what did you talk to Biden about?  You.  Boom, confident, calm, witty, and presidential. ",
