I'm really looking forward to this episode where the flat earth tries to answer Professor Dave's 10 challenge questions.  This one involves flight planning and this is kind of a special one to me because I am a pilot.  I know how to do long distance navigation and I have a hint for you.  It's done on a globe.  So I'd really love to hear your reasoning behind some of these, and then I will point out exactly where you went off the rails.  So cue up the music, and let's get going. ",

Now, the geometry of a great circle course is if you take a sphere... and you divide it with a plane, with that plane going through the center of the sphere.  The distance, the circle that is prescribed by the edge of that plane, where it intercepts the surface of the sphere, is called a great circle course.  And it is the shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere.  When you use a map projection and try and project the spherical Earth onto a flat map, you get distortions.  And if you were to plot out that straight line on the sphere along a map that is in two dimensions, there will be a curve in it.  Any two destinations in the southern hemisphere joined by a great circle course will have a curved line between them with the curve directed towards the pole.  Any two points in the northern hemisphere that have a great circle course drawn between them will have a curve directed towards the North Pole.  At no time will a great circle course between two points in the Southern Hemisphere ever go into the Northern Hemisphere.  You're flat out making that up because you have no idea what you're talking about.  Now let's prove that.  Please carry on. ",

You still have to fly the path laid out for you.  Now, you're talking about really long international flights in the southern hemisphere between continents.  If you have a private jet... the range of private jets, like if you have a Gulfstream II, even then I think you would have some difficulty with the range.  But if you look into it like I have, and like many of us have, you find out that there are flight lanes, and the lanes are such that they're laid out ahead of time, and you have to stick to them because you go into radio silence where you're off the radar.  Remember the flight MH317?  Yeah. ",

            "text": "Now he goes into some nonsense here about having to stick to jet lanes because the reptilian overlords or whatever mandate that.  That's not true at all.  You can file a flight plan anywhere in the world, and if it's a flyable flight plan, you can fly it.  If you want to fly direct from Sydney, Australia to Detroit, Michigan, and Wolfie 6020 flies an aircraft that has the range, so your entire argument is nonsense.  In congested areas, they have things called Victor Airways and Jetways.  They're high and low altitude airways.  They're kind of like highways in the sky.  They are based on ground-based radio beacons.  And they are there for convenience if you wish to use them.  If you wish to fly direct and air traffic control doesn't have any conflicting traffic, you can fly direct.  You don't have to fly airways.  As a matter of fact, we rarely do in general aviation.  Don't need to.  So if you're going to talk about aviation, the first thing that you might want to do is perhaps talk to somebody who actually knows something about aviation.  Wolfie6020, me.  Happy to answer any questions for you.  Talk to a pilot that you know that you trust.  Somebody who actually knows what they're doing.  Because the ones that I've seen put up by Flat Earth are, in general, incompetent.  They don't know what they're talking about.  Now, you go on to talk about GPS being ground-based.  After this particular flight that went missing, they made some changes to the GPS system.  First of all, GPS does not transmit your location from some box in your airplane to somebody.  If you're off radar and out of radio range and not near any other aircraft that have a special type of a transponder on them, nobody knows where you are.  That's why they couldn't find it.  They knew where they were because they could receive the satellite signal, but nothing in their airplane talked to the satellite system.  Now aircraft do have the capability of making, say, satellite phone calls.  and bouncing messages through a satellite back to their dispatchers.  That's how they do the reporting positions lots of times.  But they've changed it, so now there's going to be continuous reporting of that aircraft's position via satellite to their dispatch.  And they will track that aircraft all the way across the Southern Oceans.  Not a problem.  Shouldn't have an issue like they had with that Malaysian airliner anymore.  Now, Wolfie6020 put out a really nice video about this not long ago because this is a brand new system that was put out in response to that accident.  And I'm going to go ahead and put a link to that in the description of this video.  Please take a moment and go have a look at it. ",

            "text": "Now, if the heliocentric model is true, and if NASA doesn't lie, and if there are thousands of satellites, why is it that you have to go into dead reckoning, basically?  You have to use IMUs to navigate over the expanse of ocean when you're making these intercontinental flights.  There's no GPS out there. ",

            "text": "Well, yeah, actually there is GPS out there.  There's GPS coverage everywhere, with a possible exception of right at the poles, because then it gets a little scattered down there.  That simply has to do with where the satellites are.  Now, the inertial reference system, IMU, which is another name for that, INS is a name for an older version of it, is an internal reference system.  that is extraordinarily accurate and used for navigation, it is by no means dead reckoning.  Now, combine that with GPS and then ground-based units when you're within range of them.  You have a very accurate system of navigation in modern airliners.  You don't get lost in those unless you're trying to get lost in those, or you do something wrong with the equipment.  Now, one of the things that Wolfie talks about quite a bit is he does an awful lot of flying between Australia, the United States, Europe, and Asia.  And on those courses that he flies, he is able to fly those courses within one wingspan of the planned course.  That's how accurate these courses are.  And what do we plot these courses on, you may ask?  A sphere.  Why do we use a sphere?  Because that's the shape of the Earth, Sonny. ",

            "text": "Actually, you can and do make satellite phone calls from the middle of the ocean because there are satellites up there.  There's very limited economic benefit to having satellite phone coverage over the poles, but it is becoming available.  It depends on what satellite network you use.  We went over this when we talked about the one more orbit record-breaking circumpolar navigation flight that occurred last spring.  I'll put a link to that video in the description as well.  It's actually very interesting.  You know, I kind of wish that they were just assigned to us.  You know, I say, hey, I want to go from here to there.  Where do you want me to fly?  But that's not the way it works.  Each aircraft commander makes their own flight path and has to file that flight path and have it approved.  And by approved, I mean they're not flying through restricted airspace where they're doing military maneuvers.  There's no conflict with other aircraft.  They're within range of rescue.  Their fuel supply is sufficient to get them someplace if they have an emergency.  These are the requirements that you have to do to file a flight plan.  If that flight plan is approved, you fly the flight plan that you wrote.  That's the way it works.  It's not just assigned to you.  But if you knew anything about aviation or had you done even the smallest amount of research into this before putting out a video on YouTube, you would have known that. ",

Now I'm sure you recognize this because we've had problems with some flat earthers being able to properly identify Australia.  You'll see that if you look at the one more orbit video.  Let's get a little closer here.  Now what do we have here?  Okay, here's Brisbane, Australia.  So here's an airport in Brisbane, Australia.  We're going to go ahead And we're going to add that to a flight plan.  And we're going to come on over here.  And where do you want to go, Chief?  How about... How about we go over here to Chile?  Oh, wait a minute.  Look at that flight path.  So you see, here's the actual flight path between those two locations.  And that is the shortest distance between those two points.  See how it dips down towards the South Pole?  Here's the Antarctic Peninsula right here.  It goes all the way down here and then comes up and goes to Chile.  Now, does that cross into the Northern Hemisphere at all?  Where is the Northern Hemisphere?  Here.  Here's where the equator is up here.  This is all the Northern Hemisphere.  That's Southern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere.  and it curves down towards the South Pole, just like Bob the Science Guy said.  Did you do this?  Why don't you go make a flight plan for me that goes from two points in the Southern Hemisphere, and you show me it curving into the Northern Hemisphere.  You can pick any place you want.  Here.  See that one?  Let's go over there.  Now let's go back over here.  Look at that.  They all go from southern hemisphere to southern hemisphere, and every one of them loops down towards the South Pole.  Do any of those go up into the northern hemisphere?  Not a one.  There's a reason for that.  It's called a great circle course because the Earth is a sphere.  So this is Bob the Science Guy signing out from Northern Michigan.  Thank you very much for stopping by.  Now our next episode is going to be our last episode, and it has to do with do a scientific experiment that is peer-reviewed.  So hit that little like and subscribe button down there.  Join Team Bob.  Things are going to get really cool here in the next few weeks, and I'd like to have you be part of it.  So take care, guys. ",
