            "text": "Guys, welcome to Better Bachelor.  This is Joker, and I promise I only watch the videos for the articles.  That was the old excuse back in the day when Playboy had magazines.  It was, I don't look at the pictures.  I only read the articles.  You can't get away with that anymore now.  Maybe if you were like, what were you doing on that site?  Looking for articles?  It doesn't fly so well.  Mia Khalifa is back in the news.  And we're going to talk about this because it is a perfect example.  of why you always watch what somebody does.  Actions speak louder than words.  And when you're in the spotlight and you say, oh, I didn't really like it.  I'm so glad I'm out of it.  But also, I went right back to the spotlight.  It shows you that you have to take people at their actions, not their word.  The other thing is, too, that it speaks a little bit to when you have a dicey past and you want to escape it, you have to escape it.  You can't keep, like, dipping your toe back in the pool thinking that you're going to somehow come out of this.  okay.  And I really, out of everybody, I guess it's good for a lot of her fans, but it's really bad for her husband too.  And we're going to talk about that.  All right, let's get recording.  And, you know, Mia Khalifa, if you were to ask me... She'd definitely be boner of the month.  She looks pretty good.  I've got no hate for her.  She's attracted better on pictures than in video.  And if you don't know who she is and you decide to do a web search for her, make sure you have a safe filter on if you're at work.  If you're at home alone... Good times.  Guys, all right.  Mia Khalifa reveals how little she made in the movie industry and how people are stunned.  So this is going back to really, she only did, I think, a handful of videos.  She said she only made $12,000 in that profession.  And she works as a sports broadcaster now.  but a lot of people still assume that she's in the industry.  And she says she deserves a second chance and everybody has a past they're not proud of, she says.  So she made a name on some of these websites and she said, I just, you know, I want to, I want to shit.  This is literally what she said.  I'm ready to shed a light on every questionable moment from my past because if I own it, it can't be used against me.  And good for her.  Good for her.  Hey, you, you, you own up to what you did.  You say I'm moving on and then you move on.  And she says, we should all be this free.  I just want to get over it.  I'm ashamed of it.  Or she said, don't be ashamed of it.  But you've got to move on.  And they say, good for you, Mia.  Thanks for sharing your story, says Yahoo Entertainment.  And so what did Mia do?  Well, then she became a newscaster.  Oh, wait, no, first.  First, I think she got engaged.  So she's out of the lifestyle, and this guy, a chef, who's worth about half a mil, according to the web, a chef steps up and says, I'll marry her.  Okay, good for you.  And so she's engaged to boyfriend Robert Sandberg, and she's a Swedish boyfriend, Robert Sandberg, the chef proposed on Thursday night in Chicago, and this is back on March 19th of 2019.  She's officially off the market, Not much more to say than that.  She's off the market.  And she shared the story of how they got engaged.  I told her, Robert continued, I told her not to do that when she was sifting through some dry stuff.  And I pulled out the ring to surprise her.  And he said, I love you and get ring.  And now she's engaged.  And I looked this up.  She's actually married now.  So they did it.  They got married.  So she got out of the business.  She moved on and new life.  And now she's a broadcaster.  Oh, wait.  She quit her role on Complex Out of Bounds?  The sports broadcasting she was going to do?  What happened?  Mia Khalifa has quit her role as a co-host for Complex's sports talk on Out of Bounds just after two months.  She only made it two months.  I don't know about you, but being a sportscaster would be a pretty good job.  The former film star spent two months on the show but has now announced her departure to focus on other business ventures.  Speaking on the Lance Armstrong podcast, the 25-year-old said, I didn't want to be in L.A.  It was my dream job, but I walked away when I realized I wouldn't watch my own show.  I love Complex, but they were understanding when I said I wanted to leave.  Oh, but good news, good news.  She's launched her own show on a streaming service on Switch.  So she's landed on her feet.  She has another job.  She's also focusing efforts on cooking and plans to release a cookbook.  I'm a cook.  I've been cooking since I walk.  I've been cooking since I could walk.  All different cuisines.  Hey, good for her.  So I wonder how her cooking book is.  Ding, ding, ding.  What do we have for her, Johnny?  And ex-star Mia Khalifa joins OnlyFans to take back power from Instagram.  The brunette model will charge fans under \u00a310 a month to see her exclusive content as excited subscribers rushed to welcome her to the platform.  Okay, I'm not hating on the player, and I'm not even hating on the game.  You do you, girl.  You do your thing.  But imagine if you're her husband who understands that she did, I don't know, five or six or something movies, made 12 grand off of them.  And she said, you know what, honey, I'm out.  That's my old life.  That's my past.  I'm going to be a news broadcaster.  And he says, hey, okay, you know, I mean, he is a chef.  I mean, you think he'd, if he's a popular chef, he'd probably want to keep a good name about him.  I don't think Gordon Ramsay would have done as well if he had a, you know, had someone like her for wife.  Maybe, maybe not.  But then after that, she says, well, I'm going to quit the broadcasting thing.  And he says, all right, I guess I'm going to support you in whatever you want to do.  What are you going to do next?  She said, well, I'm going to focus on myself.  I'm going to write some cookbooks.  I'm going to write a book about my experiences.  He says, okay, I'm down with that.  And then literally like two months later, she's like, yeah, I've decided I'm going to jump on OnlyFans and start making money that way.  Now, here's the thing.  If he says no, you can't.  On Instagram, he's like got a million followers.  She has like 22 million followers.  How is he going to say no to, you know, someone that's got, and if he does, you know, 22 million of her fans and probably others will say, hey, you can't hold her back.  It's not your place to do so.  You don't own her.  So now he has to put up with it.  So he basically is stuck.  Wow.  Good for him.  But he listened to her words and he didn't follow through in her actions.  And, you know, here, I mean, the engagement, I guess, was what, 20... This is from... Do they have any dates on this thing here?  Well, when's the story?  When was the story written?  This was written on March 2019.  And here we are just a year later.  So... Let's read this and then we'll talk about it.  The X-Star and sports commentator.  Two months.  Look, if I served ice cream, okay, in a little shop for two months, you can't call me Ben and Jerry's.  You can't call me an ice cream supplier.  She did it for two months.  She's not a sports commentator.  She's an ex-star and now a OnlyFans star.  She's joined the paid-for website OnlyFans and vowed to post regular content for subscribers.  So apparently she is not going to do anything spicy.  We'll see how long that lasts.  The Beirut-born 27, who received bad things because she did bad things on videos, I can't read any of that, has turned her attention to the subscription-based platform.  She revealed the news on Instagram in a tongue-in-cheek post about making money.  She shared a snap of herself eating sushi with a laptop next to her OnlyFans page.  She wrote, \"'I have a full-time job as an accountant,' with a smiley  emoji.\".  More than a million people like the post.  Mia will charge subscribers $12 a month to watch her in action.  She has almost 22 million followers on Instagram and she could be in line to make a fortune if she even gets a fraction of her loyal supporters migrate to OnlyFans.  So there you go.  There is your value in life.  And again, I'm not hating on her.  She's young.  She's got the looks.  She wants to make the bank.  That's fine.  I'm fine with all that.  But is the husband fine with all that?  Did he really think you were getting out of the business before all this?  And on top of this, basically you're saying, I failed at everything else I tried.  So I'm going to go back to something where I know I can make some money on this.  And again, I'm not even hating on that.  But the thing is, when she quit the industry, the online industry, her thing was like, I need to take control of my life back.  And I don't want to be viewed as this person.  And I want to move forward with my life.  What happened to that?  Because she did a complete 180 and went right back into it just in a different manner.  We'll see how long it takes until some various spicy photos pop up.  She says, thanking people for the support, Mia said, I'm finally growing into my self-confidence in who I am and the decisions I make for me.  And this is my way of being myself outside the perimeters of conventional social media.  You could almost take that quote and move it right back to like 2017 when she quit the online business.  It's almost the same thing.  But now this time I'm really doing this.  No, this not last time.  I mean, I thought I knew what I wanted then.  But this time I'm really taking control of my life and I'm proud of this.  She says, even though I will not be creating spicy content.  yet.  I'm going to be treating this page like my Instagram without the terms of service.  Okay.  So in other words, you're just going to charge people to look at you.  I want to take my power back and just post what I want and what makes me feel good.  And I'm just so thankful that y'all are going along for this wild ride.  You can do that on Instagram.  I've posted everything I've ever wanted to on Instagram.  What would make you think that you need to do this without terms of service?  This is all very new to me.  I've never been on a platform as fan-facing, so any suggestions for improving my presence here is greatly appreciated.  I love you.  Instagram's pretty fan-facing.  I don't know the difference.  I've never been on OnlyFans.  Fans rushed to welcome her to the site, prompting her to add a follow-up post saying she was very excited for her future.  Now, remember, there's not going to be any spicy content.  But she had to get off Instagram.  She also commended other people who use OnlyFans to make cash.  Mia told them, fellow accountants.  Oh, what do you do?  I'm an accountant.  That is now code for.  I'm an OnlyFans content provider.  I'm an accountant.  I will have to vet my next accountant when I go to do taxes very carefully to make sure that he's not or she's not really on OnlyFans.  It's that it's a real accountant.  Thank you for being amazing and securing your bodies and the decisions you make with them.  Y'all inspire me to do my own power.  Y'all inspire me to own my own power.  What does own your own power, by the way, mean?  That means I'm going to control my future of myself with your money.  How empowering.  Mia became the most popular internet star in the world, despite only starring in a handful of productions, but she has since warned others against joining the industry.  She wrote on Instagram, those 11 videos will haunt me until I'm not on this planet anymore.  And I don't want another girl to go through that because no one should.  But you're on a content provider that pretty much focuses on the same type of material.  The only difference is you're in control of the material, for the most part, and you're in control of the money.  Now, do you think she'd be saying the same thing if those 11 videos, instead of netting her $12,000, net her $12 million?  Or she turned into the next Kardashian because they got leaked online?  Probably not.  Long story short, don't do that kind of videos online.  And if you do, don't do it with a company.  Do it for yourself on your own terms.  Oh, okay.  And if you do consume it, make sure it's ethical and not from some giant corporations who profit off the women.  Like your groceries, shop local and direct from the creators.  They say OnlyFans is a social media site where people can sell their content, such as pictures or videos, via paid monthly subscriptions.  Fans pay a monthly subscription fee for access to exclusive content.  OnlyFans is popular in the adult entertainment and fitness influencer industries.  And there we are.  So, you know, here's the thing.  I don't hate on her for making her money.  I don't mind.  You do you.  But the problem I have with is talking all bad about all the stuff that you did in the industry, deciding I need to leave and I need to take care of this and I need to improve my life and I got married and I got a commentator job and I'm free.  And then turning right around and going right back to it, except now you're married and your husband can't really do anything about that because, of course, he'll get heat if he complains about you doing it.  And then on top of that, she says, well, maybe it wasn't so bad.  You just need to control the content yourself and make sure that you get paid for it, which, again, I'm fine for.  But before you said you had a problem with it because you did it.  Now you've got a problem with it because you didn't.  control the content and you didn't get the money for it.  And now you're saying don't even spend money on these mega corporations that gave you your start.  You're saying paying it on the low-level influencer.  And again, I'm not hating on it, but the thing is the double standards here.  The problem is, and you know something else, it shows that when things get rough, what do we men do?  If things get rough, like if I just lost my YouTube channel tomorrow and the stock market crashed and I lost all my income, I'm going back to work.  And I've done some jobs that I didn't love.  When I got out of the military, one of the very first jobs I did, only for a month or two while I looked for another job, I was a dishwasher for minimum wage, which back then was like $5.25.  And it was enough to make my car payments and my insurance.  That's about it.  I really struggled to even have a place to stay.  So, you know, we don't have the golden parachutes.  And that's what bothers me on this is things got a little rough for her.  She even had a commentary job where many people would love to have something like that.  She bails on it, goes right back to this.  She's got a husband that's worth 500K, a star chef.  So, you know, he's taking care of the bills.  She could have taken this time to get an education.  to get a skill, to really write that cookbook, to cook, to go in any number of directions, and she falls back right here, back at it.  So I don't like the double speak, and I don't like the double standard.  I don't like the fact that she basically did this to her husband, with or without, I mean, he didn't sign up for this, I have to assume.  But lastly, I think, and of course the golden parachute where she can just go back and rely on her looks.  And don't get me wrong, she's got the looks to do it, in my opinion.  I think she's got the looks to do it.  She's 27.  She's young.  She can maybe make several hundred thousand or a million dollars out of it.  Go for it.  But it's all the standards, and that's what I don't like about this.  I don't know.  Let me know what you guys think.  I'm curious to see what you think.  Am I just being like crabby or does it bother you when somebody says, oh, I'm so glad I got out of that and that's such a bad industry.  And then they do this lap of where they could have been successful in four other things, but then just went right back to almost basically the same industry that they started in.  Only now they're going to get more money, so they're OK with it.  And this poor husband, man, I feel for him.  Always pay attention to what somebody does, not what they say.  She said she was out.  She said she wanted to be married.  She said she had a commentary job.  She said she was going to get away from it.  And here we are a year, year and a half later, she's right back into it.  And she, all for naught, except this guy's now, this guy's now tied his sails to this boat.  Guys, if you want to support my work, links are below as always.  If you have, thank you very much.  And the best way to support me is like, comment, share, subscribe.  And check out my older videos.  And join me over on betterbachelor.locals.com.  Got a video coming up there probably tomorrow.  I think I'll get it done tomorrow about some of the cases and laws that I can't talk about here because YouTube and their whack hammer.  Guys, I'll leave it there.  This is Better Bachelor.  I'm joking.  Remember, watch what she does, not what she says.  And this is why you don't get involved with anybody that's been in the past industries, that's done this stuff in their past, that says, I mean, she's a Catholic.  Like they say, she says she's from one area and she's improving her life and she boomerangs right back to it within like two years.  Give me a break.  Well, hi there, Mr.  Clean.  Mighty glad to know you.  I've got some weekend cleaning job. ",
