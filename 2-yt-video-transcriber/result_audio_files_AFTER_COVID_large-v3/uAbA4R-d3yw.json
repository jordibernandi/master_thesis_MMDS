            "text": "Welcome back to Liberty and Finance and Reluctant Preppers.  Today is Friday, March 13, 2020.  This is an early morning urgent bulletin.  We've heard from a very trusted source that there is a rumored shutdown of the entertainment industry in Hollywood over last night in anticipation of a rumored national quarantine that could go into effect today.  Friday the 13th.  We don't know if this is confirmed, but it's a serious situation.  And if we do get a national quarantine this afternoon, it will be extremely difficult for people to get to the pharmacy, get to the grocery, get the basic stuff that they need.  If you haven't done it already, and I hope you have, but for those of you who may not have, Don't delay one more hour, but if you need to get to a 24-hour pharmacy to pick up any prescriptions that you're going to need over the next several days, any basic supplies that you would normally have purchased, water, bathroom tissue, whatever that you would normally be needing at your household to make it through the next several days or weeks, You need to get that now, and you want to get there before the crowds if you haven't already.  So just wanted to get this out there.  If we hear any further news, we'll pass it along.  Everybody stay safe out there.  Take care of yourselves.  If you're living close to other family members, you might want to consider how you can best support each other to get through this together.  Take care. ",
