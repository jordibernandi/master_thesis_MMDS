            "text": "to start this video with a warning because what you're about to watch is confronting.  It's graphic.  And if you have any heart, it'll rip it to bits.  But I have to show it to you.  And you need to pass it on because everyone in this country needs to see what happened to this defensible 16-year-old girl on Sunday at Southern Cross Station in Melbourne.  Have a watch.  Thank you very much.  .  .  .  .  .  Horrific.  And to think that that gang of eight thugs was so proud of their cowardice behaviour that they shared it on Snapchat just makes me sick to my stomach.  Scary thing is that this didn't happen in the middle of the night.  It was midday in front of bystanders who did nothing to help this defenseless child.  What the hell is wrong with you people?  How could you witness such a thing happening in front of you to a little girl and refuse to intervene?  Today I spoke to the victim's mother and she says to me that the worst part of the attack wasn't even caught on camera.  Moments after what we saw there, she was dragged off the bench and stomped on by the gang of eight thugs.  The victim was taken to hospital after that brutal beating.  She had broken ribs, significant bruising to her face, two black eyes.  Her legs were pretty banged up.  The poor girl has braces, so even her internal mouth wasn't spared, ripped to shreds.  As you can imagine, the 16-year-old is mentally and emotionally broken to the point that she refuses to make a statement to police.  She fears that if she makes a statement, the gang will hunt her down and finish the job.  And how can you blame her?  So the mother went to police by herself and Dandenong Police told the mother that they couldn't open an investigation without a victim statement.  So the cops are saying, that they can't form an investigation based on the evidence you've just seen and based on the CCTV showing her being stomped on by a gang of eight savages.  So this gang, this gang of absolute scum are now free to target their next victims, your kids, my kids, anyone.  The question is, in the current climate, if the tables were turned and the victim happened to be black and the perpetrators were white ones, Would the cops say the same thing?  I guarantee not.  Every news source in this country would run this story as their lead headline.  There would be protests from here to the Northern Territory, and so there should be.  But no one is giving this real airtime.  And not one person has protested what happened.  So why the double standard?  Don't Australian lives matter too?  Usually here I plug supporting our work at TR News, which you're still welcome to do, of course, just go to tr.news forward slash support.  But if you have limited means and can only help one person right now, please go and help this girl's GoFundMe page.  The links are in the tr.news article to this story.  She needs and deserves it more than us. ",
