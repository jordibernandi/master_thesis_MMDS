            "text": "Chapter 24 Traits vs.  Accomplishments.  Imagine you are the most talented heart surgeon in the world, or perhaps the best chef on the planet.  Maybe you're the best musical composer of all time, or perhaps you are simply the greatest mom in the history of moms.  Now, put yourself alone on Mars with nobody around you.  What you will soon realize is that without other people, it doesn't matter that you're the greatest surgeon, the greatest chef, the best music composer, or the universe's greatest mom.  Without other people to recognize or avail themselves of your abilities, you have no value.  You are, technically, worthless.  Predictably, some will argue that you have at least some philosophical value in being the best.  That just because you were a music composer on Mars and create the universe's greatest song doesn't mean it doesn't have value.  It's a great song that just needs somebody to discover it.  But that makes the point even more so.  Not until somebody else discovers it will it have purpose, meaning, or value.  It will remain a piece of paper with notes written on it, indistinguishable from the matter of Martian dust that surrounds it, until another sentient being finds it and can appreciate it.  This is the key thing to understand about value, specifically what gives humans value, that you cannot be an individual and confer value upon yourself.  the option to declare yourself valuable or worthy does not exist.  Value is completely dependent upon the existence of other people, and it can only originate from and be given by other people.  Therefore, if you wish to have any value, at least here on planet Earth, you need to do one of two things.  You either produce something of value that other humans will willingly transact their time for through the use of money, as money is nothing more than their time converted into a physical, exchangeable form, or you be an interesting enough human that people will willingly spend their time.
