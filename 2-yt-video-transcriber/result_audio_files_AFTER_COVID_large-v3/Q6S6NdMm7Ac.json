            "text": "Welcome back here, Dr.  Goldberg.  Today we're going to be dealing with a host of interesting stories.  So let's just begin here.  He seems drunk.  So here we have the picture, uh, all about that flab, no six-pack.  Now, this is not gonna be another regalement of how this moral righteous figure profiting off of such a message is doing the same stuff behind the scenes, but rather we have to talk about something more important.  And so he, I believe, confirmed the affair she had with the pool boy, where he was actually allegedly okay with it, maybe pleasuring himself to the image, And then this other guy came out and said she was pursuing him and they were having sex.  And this is a message she sent.  You don't want to cover up those hunter-killer eyes.  Yup, that's Blackpill.  And you know the banana drives me wild.  So you can tell that she's definitely going after him.  If these are legit, I don't know if they actually happen to be.  But the fact that Jerry Falwell, as far as we know, was okay with the relationship, was even looking in on it, comes to an important point.  There's a lot of men, young and old, even millennial generation increasingly, who believe this feminist lie where they say, I respect a man who's confident in his sexuality and doesn't mind if she goes out and screws other dudes.  Yeah, she respects the fact that you have no control over her.  A modern independent woman wants to be in parity or superior to a man in every regard.  So she has a career too.  You change the diapers as well.  You do the chores as well.  You can't make any rules and enforce them on me.  I am a free spirit.  I can do everything no matter what.  This gender fluid tyranny that we are now experiencing.  And that's what I want to talk about in this video, because really the scandal is irrelevant.  It's the fact this has become more accepted and mainstream.  So let's switch over here.  This is something a lot of people were talking about probably a month or two ago.  And we've got Jada Smith and also the fresh cuck of Bell Air. ",

You can't find happiness outside of yourself, but you did try to find it by screwing this guy.  And apparently your husband, was he okay with it?  They've never been clear whether they have the open relationship, but I think they do, and they just don't want to admit it.  So he had to be okay with it, but not okay? ",

So now it's back to her, even though they were both struggling instead of like, okay, doing counseling, solving it.  No, she went out and had sex with someone else because it's her, but it was his fault.  So they broke together, but it was his fault that she had sex with him, essentially.  Okay.  Classic example of how open relationships play out.  And then here we go.  This is a book you might have heard of, or probably not.  Too Much Is Not Enough by Orson Bean.  He was the father-in-law of Andrew Breitbart.  It was some television entertainer, no one that famous.  But he wrote this book and he talks about.  he was in a relationship with this woman, had kids with her for a while, and he kept pressing the idea of an open relationship, which she found disgusting.  But at a certain point, the kids are being taught by this hot young thing who rides a motorcycle.  He's doing swimming lessons with the kids.  Well, Orson Bean tells his wife to have sex with this dude.  I guess because it's going to spice up their relationship.  And eventually she does.  And he starts this cringy passage where he talks about competing with this guy for his wife's attention.  So he gets an earring, I get an earring too.  He gets this jacket, I get the same.  Well, it should not be surprising to anyone, it ends up falling apart.  Disunion, right?  Because the reality is... A woman is not going to respect you for that.  Like a man can be married and he can go out and have sex with another woman.  And unless he like destroys the family life through it, he can still love and treasure his wife and his family.  Because the fact of the matter is, while it's not moral or ethical to be clear, okay, you're a man who's desired by other women, right?  That says something about you.  a woman who goes out and has sex with another man in a marriage, and her husband's okay with it.  What he's communicating is he's completely letting go of his dignity because, as Red Pill Mentor Tokyo brought up, A woman never has to worry about whether a child is hers, right?  Regardless of whether it's with her husband or with the boyfriend, it's fine, right?  It's always going to be her kid unless she has some kind of implant, which is why oftentimes women are the ones telling you not to wear protection.  Men are usually the sensible ones when it comes to having sex and taking precautions.  A man, if he doesn't enforce strict guidelines, could very well be paying for and raising another man's offspring because he's a fool.  You can say whatever you want.  When people are skeptical of what modern marriage has become, and you call them other incels, insecure, you need to be more positive about life, We see the same thing in the case of the Falwells.  Wealthy, conservative people, you know, not Eastern Orthodoxy, but certainly fundamentalist Baptists, who still are falling prey to the same thing, who still are going down the same degenerate paths.  And this is what happens within the context of marriages.  Maybe not all marriages, but it is a significant problem.  So men have to decide, if you're even going to get married, you have to set out these rules clearly, because they're going to consume and destroy you.  And the alternative, there is that old quote you might have heard of.  It was from a commercial, and it was like... Could switching to MGTOW really save you 15% or more on cuck insurance?  Just saying, do not accede to an open relationship unless your goal is to either raise someone else's kid or you're trying to deliberately sabotage and end the relationship.  Because I'm going to tell you, a woman will not respect a man who says, yeah, it's okay for you to go down on this dude.  It's okay for you to have sex with this dude.  They will not respect you.  They'll respect the power they have over you.  but they will never look at you in a positive light ever again.  So, just going to say, because it had to be said. ",
