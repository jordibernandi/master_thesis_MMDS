            "text": "Hmm.  Hmm.  Hi, this is H. John Benjamin.  I'm here to talk to you about a big problem on the internet.  It's called people emailing my wife.  No, it's called PragerU.  Imagine a huge stream of lies that pours into every computer in America.  Imagine it's disguised to look unbiased and packaged into slick videos.  And imagine oil billionaires give them tens of millions each year to indoctrinate your friends, your family.  Well, that's PragerU.  And the thing is, it works.  One out of every three Americans online has seen one of their videos, and 70% say that Prager's videos change their minds.  This stuff makes a difference, and every day it is pulling people toward the right.  At the Gravel Institute, we're building something to beat them at their own game.  Short, high-quality, easy-to-understand videos presenting leftist ideas and refuting right-wing lies.  Stuff you can send to your friends, your mothers, your secret lovers, your mother's lovers, your known lovers.  Oh, and we've got big-name presenters from Bernie Sanders to Chelsea Manning.  Here are a few that we've lined up.  Okay, so this won't be easy, and we're going against a Goliath, so we definitely need your help.  We want this to be a collaborative organization guided by its members, where we're trying to do something big.  So hey, let's do this. ",
