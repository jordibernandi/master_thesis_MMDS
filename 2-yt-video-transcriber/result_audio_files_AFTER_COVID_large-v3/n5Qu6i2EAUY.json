            "text": "Sex work, like many jobs, is not empowering.  When certified nurses assistants, janitors, garbage truck drivers, or people in other occupations considered undesirable go into work, they are not doing it to feel empowered, but to receive compensation.  The work can be empowering if the person enjoys wiping asses, cleaning up after people who barely pay them, smelling garbage, etc.  Or in the case of teachers who are routinely underpaid and overworked, the salary itself is not empowering, but the work can be.  But ask those same teachers if they can pay their bills with empowerment.  Sorry, no.  Landlords and utility companies only accept cash, checks, credit cards, and money orders.  Some predatory landlords might even take sexual favors, but not empowerment.  The definition of empower is to give someone the authority or power to do something.  The average American is not empowered through their work to feel better about themselves, to be fulfilled socially, or to make a change in society.  In the case of labor, the only empowerment most jobs give is the power to pay your bills, and plenty of jobs fail at that task, which is why so many people are homeless or in massive amounts of debt.  Even still, those jobs do not turn people into targets.  Those employees are not told that they are scum who don't deserve protecting.  And very few people claim that those jobs should be eradicated.  So why is the same courtesy and understanding not extended to sex work?  The usual suspects.  Misogyny.  Consciousness over coochie.  Politics over punani.  Religious shame.  All the young girls who want to make life with pussy.  Your pussy will perish with you in hell.  May your pussy perish with you.  And a lot of projecting.  May your smooth pussy, Kenya pussy, and Thai pussy perish.  One thing I get pretty tired of seeing is people posting a tragic story about a sex worker being degraded or murdered and saying, see, and feminists want you to think sex work is empowering.  Actually, we don't.  This is a straw man's argument that ignores the discourse actively happening among feminists and sex workers.  First of all, there are radical sex-negative feminists who think all sex workers are victims or scum.  The rest of us, who you are probably railing against, actually just want you to see sex work as labor in which the laborers can safely make a living without being harassed, abused, or murdered by police, clients, or the general public.  You know, basic things like making porn sets safe for performers or allowing full-service sex workers to pay rent with their income rather than going homeless because they can't provide the required pay stubs.  Sex workers are not inherently radical goddesses, nor are we inherently tragic victims.  We're people navigating the same wealth inequality as anyone else who wants to survive.  With the recent wave of A-list to D-list celebrities joining sex worker-powered platforms like OnlyFans, it's important to remind the public that there are real and normal people making their living through sex work.  Not for fame, not for publicity, but to survive, be happy, and achieve financial security for themselves and their families.  We should be able to speak up when mistreated like anyone else.  While some sex workers can feel empowered through what they do, and I assure you they are the privileged ones who aren't doing it for survival, or the ones like me who enjoy being freaky online in exchange for cash, or those who have used sex work as a successful stepping stone from an abusive relationship.  Nobody with sense claims the industry of sex work is empowering.  The idea of being empowered through labor is itself a myth.  We can feel empowered through the security that labor can give us, money for bills, money for food, et cetera, but most people's jobs are not actually empowering, nor are they meant to be.  The guy being yelled at by angry fast food customers for $9 an hour without health benefits while the company's CEO takes home hundreds of millions is not being empowered.  The overworked minor or factory worker with developing lung cancer or job-related arthritis is not being empowered.  The underpaid call center associate with job-related hemorrhoids is not empowered when he sells health insurance or collects debt over the phone.  The overworked and underpaid migrant worker responsible for the bounty of fresh fruits and veggies at your local grocery store is not being empowered when he spends hours hunched down in one position, damaging his bodies for years to come.  At the end of the day, those jobs will still be done, whether or not they empower the worker.  On the flip side, there are jobs that are fundamentally empowering, and this isn't always a good thing.  Racist doctors and nurses, for example, can feel empowered thanks to their jobs to save lives or end them.  Racist police can similarly feel empowered in their jobs to save lives or end them.  Beepy-necked conservative teenagers who rush to join the military so they can handle weapons and murder oppressed people across the world feel empowered.  Celebrities and business moguls like Donald Trump can feel empowered enough to run for president.  Writes Melissa Guerra Grant in Playing the Whore, The Work of Sex Work, sex workers, more than any other, are expected to justify their labor as a choice, as if the choice to engage in a form of labor is what makes that labor legitimate.  An even more insidious double standard is that sex workers must prove they have made an empowered choice, as if empowerment is some intangible state attained through self-perfection and not through a continuous and collective negotiation of power.  These demands to demonstrate one's empowerment only reproduces a victim class among sex workers, all of whom are already perceived to be disempowered.  For many people, sex workers are inherently victims because of the danger in the industry.  And because sex workers choose to keep working despite these dangers, their choices and voices are vilified or ignored completely.  Can sex work be dangerous?  Yes, as can plenty of other jobs where the body is the source of income, from athletics to mining to logging to steelmaking to farming to fishing.  In fact, loggers, fishermen, aircraft pilots, and roofers are among the most dangerous jobs in America.  Loggers are number one and their average income is a paltry $40,000 a year.  If you truly cared about the safety of sex workers, you'd want to foster an environment where poverty and rape culture is eradicated so that sex work can be as safe as any of those other dangerous jobs.  You may say this sounds impossible, undoable, irrational, But can't the same be said of expecting sex workers to starve, go homeless, or not be able to take care of their children so you can sleep at night?  If you are not going to provide a job with great income and benefits to every single one of the people who does sex work right now, then perhaps you should sit back and eat your food.  Instead of focusing on whether or not you would flash your pussy online or sleep with rich old women in the Hamptons, think of your position as a laborer in our economy.  Very few people get to do jobs they love, as in performing labor that they would do for free if they did not have to worry about bills, health care, or other financial responsibilities.  A 2019 study found that over half of US workers are unhappy with their jobs, meaning you are likely one of those people agonizing over your commute, hating your boss and coworkers, and being unbelievably bored with the tasks you perform.  Now imagine if someone called for an end to your job, even if it pays well, because they personally would not suffer the same drudgery and believe you cannot be trusted to make your own choice about it.  Wouldn't you be pissed?  Now ask yourself if you feel empowered as an employee of wherever you work to end world poverty, eradicate rape and war, or conquer any of the other horrible problems that exist.  Probably not.  You're likely collecting a check and taking your ass home to exist outside your occupational identity of truck driver, retail associate, factory worker, etc.  Sex workers are not afforded this luxury and it holds the entire labor movement back.  When you call for the criminalization of sex work, you are contributing to a hostile system that harms.  The same hostile system that harms black people for being black, the poor for being poor.  You're saying that sex workers should be harassed and assaulted by police with impunity.  You're endorsing the reality that sex trafficking victims often can't just go to police without themselves being arrested or harassed.  And you are encouraging the fact that sex workers often can't gather in the same space to organize politically for legislation that would actually make their jobs safer and more enjoyable.  You are the one taking away a laborer's ability to find empowerment in collective bargaining, safety, and security.  And therein lies the problem.  America hates organized labor, and many laborers are not empowered to fight for better working conditions and pay, not just sex workers.  When fast food workers are degraded for daring to ask for dignity and adequate pay, they're often told that if they wanted those things, they'd just go find another job.  Never mind the inaccessibility of other work or the socioeconomic or racial barriers they face or the gaping hole that would be left if every single fast food worker walked off of the job, the class trainers say accept it or find another job.  We must move past this, and it begins with the most marginalized laborers of all.  So ultimately, when you say that sex work is not empowering, as a trump card to sex positive feminists, as if that's what we're arguing, you are speaking on hella jobs, not just the ones involving the monetization of sex.  Shouldn't that make you angrier than the ewhores and call girls trying to survive or raise their quality of life? ",
