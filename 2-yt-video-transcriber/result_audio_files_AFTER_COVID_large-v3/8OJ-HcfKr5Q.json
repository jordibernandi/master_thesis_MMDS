            "text": "Howdy lieutenants and economists.  The most volatile, evil, disgusting things on the planet, humans.  If you have a video request, you can always go to assholeconsulting.com.  Yeah, I am gonna charge you kids.  And that is the importance of not fucking up.  You are such an asshole!  Can't be.  dynamite, got the flu.  How you guys doing?  Duh.  I was.  I went and played with the nieces.  Ah, the nieces.  The little nieces.  I didn't watch the Super Bowl with them.  I played with them and I got whatever disease those rodents were carrying around.  But there was a wedding.  Batman and Barbie got married.  And I got to see the wedding.  And it was a very nice procession.  And in Cappy Dime I got the flu.  Aaron, I need some help here.  I'm 40 years old, living in Metro New York.  New York.  I'm leaving New York and moving to New Jersey.  I'm a business owner, so I have little choice but to stay in that area.  Oh, that's too bad.  I was married a few years ago, but we grew apart and I filed for a divorce.  She contested it.  I always get, you say contest.  Oh, what, you want to stay married?  Don't you respect one person?  Well, you stay in shape.  But I won in the end.  We were married one and a half years.  Oh, that was quick.  Divorced two around the same time.  I was with her for eight years, and when I got out into the dating world again three years ago, it was like I was upside down.  I'm Jewish.  Welcome to the tribe.  But more agnostic than religious, like all Jews.  Oh, come on, Claire.  No, that's accurate.  It's very true.  Nobody knows.  It's illegitimate.  Are you practicing?  Are you just ethnically Jewish?  That's a question.  I finally met a decent girl who's 36.  Okay, so five years your junior.  Four years.  I told her in advance, I'm concerned with family court system, but I do not want a family.  She said, she said, okay.  She said, okay.  Words have meaning.  Except in a female world where they could just change it.  We've been dating nine months now.  I'm at a crossroads.  And so is she.  She offered to sign whatever I need to get married, but I still do not feel comfortable.  So she's going back on her word.  She said she was okay.  No, she's not okay.  This is only nine months in.  You're recently divorced.  Whatever we need to get married by still do not feel comfortable with the legal system and lawyers in family court.  Dude, you have suffered more than enough.  You have gone through a divorce.  You should have known, quote, unquote.  But, I mean, I don't know how any guys get married now.  I don't.  I just don't.  And I'm one of the more pro-female, there are good women out there.  Now, there's a very small percentage of them, but I see no reason at all to bring the state in on anything.  I mean, even if you were to find a traditional woman and whatever, it's like, no.  No.  No.  There's this word.  It's a great word, and you women use it all the time.  You don't like it when it's used on you.  It's called no.  Remember that song you girls sang back when you were young and I... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Uh... But I still do not feel comfortable.  Then the answer is no.  My last divorce, which my eff wife got nothing, cost me $22,000 in legal fees.  The courts and her nearly killed my business.  Yes, I... even though I transferred ownership to an irrevocable trust and we had separate assets.  Since I had to PG, Procter & Gamble, since I had to PG on business loans, the banks wanted her, since I had to personally guarantee on business loans, the banks wanted her signature and she refused.  I have no personal debt and I do okay.  I think you're talking about your ex-wife.  This woman is the salt of the earth.  She takes me places, shares expenses when we go out, really seems to care about me.  She said she loved me in the first couple months.  I didn't until last week, and I do.  But I just do not know how to approach this subject.  She wants to go to speak attorneys to see what she needs to do to ensure my assets are protected.  See, this is what gets me.  What, why can't, maybe it's just ignorance on her part.  Maybe she doesn't know.  Why can't you guys go through a ceremony between you two people for whatever respective religions you guys have, create your vows and vow in front of society.  you're going to do it.  That's what marriage was.  And I think the enforcement mechanism of that was you went back on your word and then whatever societal support was there was like, okay, that's it, Frank.  You reneged on your vows or Amy.  Everyone's Frank and Amy in my world.  It's the Chad and Stacey's of the Cappy world.  I don't know why she wants to bring the state.  If she's willing to do all this, then why the fuck is she just like, well, we could get married, but it ain't going to be the state involved.  Um... Speak to your attorney to see what she needs to do to ensure my assets are protected.  Pre and prenups are garbage, and yes, the trust should protect me, but the legal fees from attorneys are absolutely crazy.  I know, the last attorney was $450 an hour.  I know.  I did say I'm open for the religious part and a private marriage, but she wants a marriage certificate from the state.  This is like me saying, Frank, your name isn't Frank.  He knows that.  Frank, I want to go fishing.  And you say, really?  You want to go?  Yeah, I want to go fishing.  I show up with a gun.  And you're like, where's your fishing pole?  Well, I really want to fish with a gun.  Yeah, but we're going to get in trouble.  We can't fish with a gun.  But I want to fish with it.  I'll do everything you want, Frank.  I'll do everything you want.  But I bring my gun anyway.  This woman is lying.  Maybe not maliciously, because to lie, to consciously, that means that you knowingly do so.  But she's at least conflicting herself, which means there's an ulterior motive there somewhere.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  If she's willing to do everything and it's true, what, why?  See, that's, she wants a certification from the state.  Go fuck yourself, lady.  That's a huge red flag.  And you know what, man?  I am always more than willing to give the benefit, no, not more than willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  I'm willing to leave a line in the water for a good quality woman to come along.  I'm willing to judge people by, okay.  But then when it's like, well, I'll do anything for you.  But it better be through the state.  Whoa, wait, whoa, whoo.  That's the exact thing I'm trying to avoid.  And that's what I'm scared of.  New Jersey is not the friendliest towards prenups and post-ups and trusts.  That doesn't protect me from legal fees or the court making me pay off first.  Don't know.  Dude, this is way, here's another, this is way too fast.  Okay, she loves you in two months and now it's nine months in and we got a marriage.  No, no.  I know you said, we had a conversation before that I'm the lawyer.  And I said, look, I can only give you my opinion.  That's a non-lawyer.  my advice to you is to go talk to a lawyer because I'm sure you're aware a couple hundred dollars up front, a couple thousand dollars up front will be worth it in the end.  rdklegal.com, by the way.  Unfortunately, I don't think he's licensed in your state.  Get that coffee and use this in Cappy.  I'm sorry.  No.  We have to look.  If it wasn't today, if it wasn't the current year where divorce is such a high risk, it's cancer, guys.  This is worse than Russian roulette.  Russian roulette, there's a one, well, five and six chance you'll win.  This is regular roulette where if you're just betting odds, evens, black, whites, you know, whatever.  It's a 48% chance.  This is, no.  No.  She makes $110,000 a year.  I make similar.  However, I am self-employed, so my assets, my business, all rental properties I own and run.  She has to run $100,000 in savings, $40,000 in student loan debt from an MBA.  Well, wait, if she's got $100,000 in savings, why doesn't she just pay?  She doesn't want any money from me from 6%.  She has no debt.  No, you just told me she has debt right there.  She has no debt, around $60,000, $200,000.  What do I do?  Look, dude, I would... Hang on, did I ask you any questions?  Oh, by the way, everybody, check your spam mail, okay?  I answer all emails.  Check your spam mail.  And this one ended up in spam.  I do recommend rdklegal.com.  Dude, unless you guys are going to have kids, and even then, no.  You don't, no.  Look, I hate to use this phrase because it's misleading, but women have to learn that.  Well, men have to learn too.  But you cannot, the social contract between men and women in this country cannot be where women say, well, we will engage in this business contract where half the time you're going to get fucked over.  But vajayjay, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, look over here.  Vagina, vagina.  Yeah.  It's worth betting your life on 50% chance it gets destroyed.  No.  You gotta start thinking with this up here and not that down there.  And you know what, dude?  I know a lot of it.  It's really sad.  As I'm getting older, I'm starting to think men actually do care a little bit more than you.  You're thinking with this too much.  You can't afford that, dude.  And you, of all people, should know you just went through a divorce.  You gotta be thinking with this up here.  If she wanted to get married and have kids, she wanted to have kids, I would say... Go to a state that has the best laws.  Get your lawyer on the horn right now from New Jersey or New York, wherever you're going.  Say, where do I go to get married?  to get fucked over the least in the United States?  Or do I go to Sweden or something like that?  That one's an interesting curveball you could throw where you're married according to Swedish law, which I don't know if non-Swedish people can do that.  But that's something to consider.  And then you get married there.  You find the state that has the most agreeable marriage contract.  You set up your business contracts.  You moved out of New York to go to New Jersey, where the business climate is so much better.  But you made a business decision there, moving from one jurisdiction to another for better favorable treatment.  It's the same thing with marriage, if she wanted to have kids.  But she's 36.  The contradiction, I'll do anything, but I better have the government involved.  No.  That's the only way, is that there's going to be kids involved.  There's no kids, no.  You stand firm on this.  Because she's like, no, no, no.  I already, look, I know, dear, maybe you're the nicest, sweetest girl in the world, but one of your team fucked it up.  One of your team fucked me over.  And you know what?  No.  I've once bitten twice.  I'm terribly sorry.  And maybe, maybe, maybe you'll get a treat or read Shakespeare.  But maybe if enough guys, and they're doing it, if you send enough of a signal to the market, as men are not getting married, men are just delaying, or they're just like, well, maybe we'll cohabitate or something like that.  Maybe there'll be a big enough signal sent to both, the conscious legal, legislative entities in the world saying, whoa, wait a minute.  Now, this is pretty unfair.  Men are getting butchered.  We got to equalize these laws or make it so that marriage is a better proposition for both the men and women.  As well as send a signal to the marriage market, if that's what we're talking about, participants, namely the women, saying, look, hey, men aren't going to hear men proposing.  Is it pulling teeth to get the guy to propose?  There's a reason.  His old man might have gotten divorced.  He might have been divorced.  There's whatever ideal you have in your mind about marriage and da-da-da, you can't be thinking with this anymore.  Pour that down there.  I mean, maybe down there is your teens and 20s.  Here is your 30s.  But, dude, by the time you're 40, it's all got to be up here, man.  And not to say these two down here might not override you, but you got to really think.  There is no... You have a plan to achieve what both of your stated goals are, and that is to commit to one another without requiring the law.  Um, that's, there's this table, there's this, you can give her what she says she wants.  Now she's throwing this, this poison pill into the contract where it says, but, but I want to stay married.  Whoa.  Uh-uh.  Something's wrong.  And you gotta see it with this, man.  Not with this or that.  You see it with this.  No.  That's just my opinion, okay?  It's my opinion.  If she dumps your ass later on, you can't come back and sue me and say, oh, copy, oh my God, my life.  Well, really?  Is it?  Is it?  I thought she was all about you.  I thought she was going to put you first.  And all of a sudden she left you because you didn't want to get that.  You were offering her everything on the table.  She just wanted to make you happy.  But you didn't go with that marriage certificate.  That, my good sir, would be you dodging a bullet.  And then if you say, hey, no, I'm not getting married.  And by the way, you can go.  You may leave now.  I understand you want that marriage.  Boy, that certificate, that piece of paper is really fucking important for love.  There's some dope out there that will sign one.  Go find him.  Apparently, no matter, you know, one in two are getting butchered when we land soldiers on this beach.  There's still men signing up for that shit.  You go right ahead.  You go right over there.  I'm sure you'll find some guy.  But yeah, this is... I'm afraid.  Here's the problem, man.  It's under a year or two.  That's the other gals.  Dude, I knew this guy.  His wife kept up an act for two years before they got married.  And then once they got married, open can of bitch.  Weapons grade bitch.  And then they got divorced three or four years later.  Yeah, man.  I'm sorry.  That's just my opinion, okay?  No.  That's the word today.  No.  Alright, you guys got questions, Cassie Cappy's got answers at AssholeConsulting.com.
