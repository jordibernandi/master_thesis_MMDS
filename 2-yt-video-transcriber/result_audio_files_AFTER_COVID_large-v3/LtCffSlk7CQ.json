I'm going to leave the channel link in the description.  Go ahead and show his channel some support and subscribe.  You won't believe what this officer does in this video.  This officer has no business being a cop.  Let's get it. ",

Maybe about 50 years ago when it was nice and new and shiny and stuff.  Yeah.  They just told me y'all look like this over there.  Yeah, you can't do that, man.  You know that.  Yes, I can.  Here we can.  This is the property, y'all.  No, that is the property.  Show me.  Show me.  Show it to me.  Wait, wait, wait.  You see that sign right on that floor mat right there?  No, no, I'm not asking you that.  It says the county's insignia on you.  I'm not asking you that.  That insignia stands for public property.  I'm not asking you that.  I'm asking you to show it to me.  Come on, man.  Don't touch me.  Well, move then.  No.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  That is me.  That is me.  Call your supervisor right now.  Call your supervisor right now.  Call your supervisor right now.  No, you're not.  Call your supervisor right now.  Call your supervisor.  Get your hands off of me.  Get off of me.  I'm not stepping nowhere.  Okay, now that's what we were talking about.  Wow.  You got jelly for brains.  Don't touch me.  All right, see?  We got a problem now.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Why?  What else do you want to say, small?  What else?  Yes.  Small?  Smart.  Smart?  Yes.  Here's something smart.  Call your supervisor.  Tell me.  You're so smart.  That's what's smart.  Call your supervisor.  All right, let's step over there.  Y'all doing just fine.  I'm going to wait right here.  Call your supervisor.  That's all I ask you to do is stand right here.  Call your supervisor.  That's what I'm asking you to do.  Call 911.  Call your supervisor.  Thank you for looking at my super bots.  What is your name?  Stuart.  Stuart, sir.  S-T-U-A-R-T.  What's your employee ID number?  I'm a retired officer.  Oh, you're retired?  Yes, sir.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm asking for his supervisor and he won't call anybody.  He's assaulted me already.  He's grabbed hold of me.  I mean, I asked for his supervisor.  He won't get one.  Don't touch me.  I didn't touch you.  I grabbed your camera.  I just asked him to step right here.  That's all I asked.  Which is where I've been the whole time.  No, you was up here with him.  I wasn't up there.  Well, sir, can you step back down?  Boy!  Boy, I would.  I'm just trying to figure out how many laws inside of my head that you're violating.  I'm asking you to tell me.  I'm just trying to count how many in my head.  Count one.  Count one?  The assault that you grabbed ahold of me.  I'm asking to know.  That's it.  Oh, he didn't?  No.  It's been on film.  There.  There.  There.  Don't touch me.  Again.  You're trying to grab me.  What happens if I try to reach for you and try to grab me?  You'll shoot me.  Stay away from me.  You are unstable.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be armed.  Are you calling his supervisor or something?  I'm on the phone with DeKalb County right now.  Sir, how you doing?  How you doing today?  Yes, I am.  Supervisor, nice to see you.  Benton, I would like to make a complaint on Stewart over there.  He grabbed my camera.  He grabbed me.  He grabbed his camera.  He tried pulling me around.  He got it all on video.  He pushed, I mean, he was pushing into me and not to, but he was coming right up on me and he was nose to nose.  Like, he was like this.  And I was on the city sidewalk.  I wasn't anywhere.  I'm just trying to figure out everything going on.  So you all just fit in.  We're journalists.  We're out here for the day.  We're doing some early days.  I told these folks, I said the property tax office is a public office.  It's publicly accessible.  Anywhere, the Supreme Court.  Anywhere the public's allowed to go, the press is allowed to go.  Makes sense, right?  Because if the press couldn't go where the public would, then the public would just be the press.  Now, not someplace that's key-coded or secured access or an office.  Where were you all when this happened?  Right here, outside.  He walked up on me over out in front.  I hadn't even spoken to him at that point.  Here, he didn't want us here at all.  He said we couldn't stand on the sidewalk here because we were trying to talk to the gentleman to let him know that it's our constitutional right to go where the public can.  And all we do is we walk in, take a couple shots and walk out.  It would have been over three minutes.  Now, it's taken 20 minutes and all these resources because they don't understand something as simple as if the public's allowed to be there, the press is allowed to be there.  So basically, let me hear it correctly, they're trying to stop you all from going inside?  Yes.  Into the public area.  To the public area.  We don't want to go someplace where the public's not allowed to go.  Nope.  We understand the rules.  We understand the laws.  I do it all over the country.  I mean, seriously.  Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Alabama.  I've been all over the country doing exactly this.  All right, y'all give me a minute.  All right, we'll talk about that.  I gave information.  as far as the complaint.  We have what we call Office of Professional Standards.  In short terms, OPS.  I'm sure you all heard of it.  We got POST down in Florida.  Okay.  Yeah, POST.  Right.  No, no, no.  It's not POST.  Okay.  POST is... Police Officers Standards and Training.  Yeah, that's what... Yeah, that's... Normally, if I have a complaint, it's in the house.  POST don't really have anything to do with it.  Right.  Unless it's some criminal, you know, son.  But right now it's just in-house.  But we have what we call Office of Professional Staff.  In short term, OPS.  Okay.  They have all investigations, the claims, stuff like that.  Okay.  I can read that information.  For sure.  Yeah, because he shouldn't be grabbing people and stuff.  He shouldn't be.  Once you file that complaint, one of the investigators, one of the captains over the area, I'll be back in contact with you.  Okay, that's fine.  So it's a process.  Yep, agreed.  It's a process.  Yep.  I do it a lot, so I'm with you.  Give me one second.  All right, perfect.  See, I'll just stay right here until I finish, okay?  We're not detained, right?  No.  Okay.  So let me ask you this.  How long are you all trying to be here?  We're going to leave anyway because they're closed now.  But like I said, all we wanted was just a minute to come in, take a look around the public office, and leave.  So if they wasn't closed, then we would go in, take a minute, and leave.  It's closed, so we're not even going to ask to go in there.  We just want you to let them know that the press is allowed where the public's allowed.  You know what I mean?  Because obviously they don't, and that kind of stuff leads to this kind of stuff, which if an officer responds like that guy who doesn't know, all of a sudden I'm in handcuffs and the city's looking at a $100,000 lawsuit.
