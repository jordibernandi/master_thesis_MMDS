No, that's why we're coming to ask you.  So if you knew what was going on.  That'd be handy if one of us knew, wouldn't it?  Excuse me.  Hello.  Can we have a quick chat just for camera?

That's over 50,000 people who've died and bear in mind that's an underestimate.  There's over 70,000 excess deaths linked to the virus.  Lockdown's got overwhelming support from medical and scientific experts and it brought down otherwise escalating infections and death rates earlier this year and that's what stopped the NHS from being overwhelmed.  But it is easy to just dismiss anti-lockdown protesters as fringe conspiracists.  But while a minority, there are millions of people who do oppose lockdown, and they're boosted by right-wing MPs and shock jock journalists.  To try and understand this phenomenon better, I went to speak to Richard Seymour, and he's a journalist who's written a lot about it. ",

I've certainly been hectored by people who I would say used to share my politics, people on the left, who claim that lockdown is completely unnecessary, doesn't work, et cetera, et cetera.  I think it's a shame.  It's a real shame because if we get stuck on the argument about whether lockdown works, which most of the evidence suggests it does, we're not really thinking about a rigorous accounting of the pros and cons.  Some of the earliest anti-lockdown protests we've seen were in the Philippines because the government wasn't giving people the food packages.  And of course, Duterte said, shoot them all.  And then in India, when migrants basically said, we want to be paid and we want to go home.  So there are going to be these responses to injustice.  Just, I think, the day before yesterday in Manchester, the students were out protesting and they weren't denialists.  They were just saying, we've been fenced in with wire.  We don't want to be treated like animals and the students have been treated absolutely appallingly in this country and one of the problems that we on the left are going to face if we don't get ahead of this and start thinking about this carefully and discriminately is that you know how we've seen with the Gilets Jaunes and various other protest movements and I think this is a bit like that, these lockdown protests.  You know you can end up in a situation where the people who have a voice and who are thinking ahead of this and impress themselves on those movements will be fairly right-wing, fairly conspiratorial.  I'm not suggesting, by the way, that the left should start leading the anti-lockdown protests, but we do need to start talking about the problems and thinking more discriminately about how lockdown is done.

And I think it would be sociopathic in a way to sort of say, well, you know, we're not going to worry about that.  But in another way, we have to recognise that lockdown is coming down hard, hardest, as you said, on the poorest, on the working class people.  And I think that It must be hellish for people.  I've certainly found it quite difficult.  And I can imagine people who are ordinarily very lonely anyway, because physical disability, mental illness, or any number of other issues that might make you feel lonely, or might make you be alone, it's just got ten times worse.  So we need to come up with... ways to, first of all, challenge the government where they're not offering adequate support.  Second of all, I think we have to recognise this government's not going to get it together in the short term.  They're going to keep getting worse and worse and worse.  They're going to keep screwing it up.  So if we face up to that, then we can think about what is our survival mechanism.  I think at the start of lockdown, there was this outpouring of mutual aid.  And that was a great thing, but it was very short term.  If we could find ways to build mutual aid into everyday life, it would make it much more easy to survive.  Let's summarise this.  One, criticise the preconditions.  Why did we need lockdown in the first place?  Two, very conditional support for lockdown where it's necessary.  Three, absolute defence of the interests of the people who are at the bottom of this and suffering most from it, whether they're very poor, working class, mentally ill, whether they're suffering from racial oppression or anything else like that.  I think that that would be a good starting point.  But also I think we're going to have to be aware that there are going to be these protests.  People are going to get sick and tired of it.  Understandably, they're going to want to lash out.  And those are going to be terrains in which we should have something to say.  We should have an intervention.  So what are we going to say to people who, like those Manchester students, are sick of being treated like animals by the authorities?  What are we going to say to people who are miserable about being alone and aren't getting enough economic support?  particularly if you're unemployed in this situation, you're getting next to nothing.  We have to be sympathetic and on their side as far as that goes, and I think we have to absolutely oppose any repressive behaviour by the police.  We have to be arguing with them on a comradely basis, if I may put it like that, which is, you know, we need you to take care of yourself.  what you're doing out here in these protests is not good for you.  It may damage your health.  We need you to be part of society.  We need you to take care of yourself.  And we need you to look after us as well.  In other words, it's calling in, not calling out. ",
