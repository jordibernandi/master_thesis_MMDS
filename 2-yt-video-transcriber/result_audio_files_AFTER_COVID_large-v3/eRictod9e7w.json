It's not one of the rich and the famous, but it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't trade anybody for.  Yeah, I voted for Trump in 16, and I'll be the first to tell you I made a mistake.  Pandemic, it's been tough on everybody.  You know, President Trump, he's not responsible for this virus.  Nobody was going to be able to stop that, but he was totally negligent on how he informed the people.  I mean, the guy gets the blame for what's happening.  If he would have did things right day one, we wouldn't be where we're at today.  You know, with Joe Biden, I think we've got a person that's got some compassion and he's got a real plan to get things going, turn it around.  I made a mistake in 16.  I won't make a mistake in 2020.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. ",
