            "text": "Welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  I'm here with Pastor John, and we are going to answer a listener question, which you're obviously invited to send in anytime.  Info at RedeemerAZ.org is the way to do that.  Well, we got one, and a gentleman asked, what did Jesus mean in Matthew 18, verse 19, when he said, again, I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.  Now, I'm with the listener, and I assume this is where it comes from.  In my past, I used to think this meant, hey, if we just pray right now, and we agree here on earth, and we ask about anything from God, he'll do it.  So let's join hands right now.  We need to be touching, of course.  God is here, and he's going to unload heaven.  So blessings are coming, and miracles are coming, and all this stuff is coming.  Pastor John, help us understand what did Jesus mean here in this text? ",

            "text": "Good question.  This is not a fortune cookie and this is not a proverb.  So this statement is part of a larger paragraph.  That larger paragraph is about church discipline.  So the context of this whole passage is church discipline.  Now what happens is people start quoting verse 19 at the word if.  If two or three are gathered on earth.  But they don't go back to again I say to you that if.  So that word again is significant because it says that I'm repeating something.  Well, what is it that you're talking about, Jesus?  Where did you talk about two people interacting?  Well, you see that up at verse 16.  But if he does not listen to you, I'm sorry, verse 15, if your brother sins, go and show him his fault.  So here's you and your brother interacting, okay?  So that's the first thing.  The second thing that you see here is is this word, the context, so let's just make that clear, that's the authority of church leadership in church discipline cases where there's unrepentant sin.  That's the context that we're talking about here.  So this is, if by the way, this was talking about prayer, then why are so many prayers going unanswered when two people get together and agree on it?  Right?  There would be no unanswered prayer if that's what this was about.  Every time you got another person together with you, you'd pray about anything, because that's what it says, anything, and it'd be done.  The unanswered prayers of two people agreeing is proof that they're taking this verse out of context, right?  And so what is the context?  What is being agreed upon here?  This word anything is a key word.  This word anything is used in legal proceedings and legal documents.  This is anything of a legal matter, specifically this whole matter being talked about, verse 16, where there's two or three witnesses, where every fact is confirmed.  And so... This has to do with church discipline.  And when it comes to two or three agreeing on earth about touching anything, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.  jesus is not discounting the sovereignty of god here and saying this is the sovereignty of your prayers.  remember it's the father in heaven who says who will do this will do what.  well this i think is referring to either two church leaders who are who are dealing maybe three dealing with a church discipline case and saying okay you guys have.  You guys have gone through all of the steps that I've asked you to go through.  And you agree.  this is the decision you should make.  Well, my father is there.  And not only that, verse 20, but I'm there.  Two or three have gathered together for wisdom and prayer about church discipline. ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  So it's either two leaders who are saying, hey, we need to make sure that our decision in this case is of the Lord, so let's pray together, let's agree together.  So it's that, or it's the offended brother and the offending brother together coming to a resolution as the here's how we should proceed, and this is God saying, you do that.  Wow.  I'm in the midst of that.  I'm blessing that.  So this is actually an invitation and an encouragement to pray for wisdom in the midst of very difficult decisions.  I mean, if you've ever had a church discipline case, you know these are gut-wrenching.  These are horrible.  You need wisdom because you've got to take it to the church, it says in verse 17, if they refuse to listen.  And so this is a prayer, or this is an encouragement to for church leaders to pray, to seek the Lord's face, and knowing that Jesus is in the midst of those leaders when they're seeking, that Jesus is in the midst when there's reconciliation taking place, and that the Father will bless that.  So this has nothing to do at all with private prayer about whatever you want.  This has to do, the context is clear, this is church discipline, but people treat it like it's a fortune cookie saying.  They rip it out of context and they just say it, and then when a video like this goes on, they go, oh, there's no faith, oh, they're just Pharisees, oh, they're stuck with.  No, actually, if the Holy Spirit is the author of Scripture, what he is, then we have the spirit of this text and people that rip it out of context and use it for private prayer or start commanding God to do things because we have a promise, completely rip ",

            "text": "it out of context.  Amen.  That's a good word.  I do think one of the major critiques is, you know, what is the power in your prayer?  You know, you guys have no faith.  This is just stuck up kind of Phariseeism, letter of the lost up.  You know, I'll tell you what, the power in prayer is the model that Jesus gives us in the garden as he's about to go to the cross.  And he says, you know, if possible, let this cup pass for me.  The agony, the wrath of God, it's all going to be poured out upon him.  Sweat drops turning to blood, his own disciples falling asleep on him, nobody with him.  And he says, what?  Not my will, but yours be done.  That's a power prayer.  If you want to pray a prayer that is like Christ, it's that.  And this text about church discipline shows that even in those moments, God is still with us, but you can't take the Bible and make it whatever you want it to mean.  The question isn't, hey, what does this mean to me?  It's what does it mean, period.  And so there's Matthew 18, verse 19.  If you have more questions, again, you can send those in to info at redeemeraz.org.  And I hope this has been a blessing to you as you grow in God's word. ",
