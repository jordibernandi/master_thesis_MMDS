            "text": "Hello there.  Unless the European Union agrees to a deal with the UK, they should not get a penny of the Brexit divorce payment, says two former Tory ministers.  Firstly please subscribe and like this video to give my channel a boost, and I'm always uploading new content, so please do check back daily.  According to former Tory leader and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Sir Ian Duncan Smith, better known as IDS, and former Brexit Minister David Jones, the EU has not met its obligations to act in good faith in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal, so shouldn't get another penny of the \u00a339bn Brexit divorce bill.  This could also extend to the other provisions in the withdrawal agreement, which have been a growing concern to members of the Tory party Eurosceptic European Research Group, or ERG.  And the two Tories argue that with no trade deal, the obligations in the withdrawal agreement should fall.  There are worries that due to the pressures placed on the EU and Eurozone economies by the rather unexpected ravages of the pandemic, the withdrawal agreement treaty could leave the way open for Brussels to demand billions from the UK to help rebuild the EU or even keep it afloat.  This has led to a push from the Brexiteer Tories to get the withdrawal agreement opened up and remove any clauses that would lead huge payments, which some put as high as \u00a3160 billion, which the EU could take from us.  But if a no-deal outcome led to these obligations falling, then the pressure is off the UK.  Now under the withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK are under an obligation as follows.  The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours, in good faith and in full respect of their respective legal orders, to take the necessary steps to negotiate expeditiously the agreements governing their future relationship referred to in the Political Declaration of 17 October 2019, and to conduct the relevant procedures for the ratification or conclusion of those agreements, with a view to ensuring that those agreements apply to the extent possible as from the end of the transition period.  and in the non-binding political declaration it says of the future relationship.  it must also ensure the sovereignty of the united kingdom and the protection of its internal market and also on defence that the partnership will respect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the autonomy of the Union.  While on crisis management missions and operations, both civilian and military, it says, Such an agreement would be without prejudice to the decision-making autonomy of the Union or the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom will maintain the right to determine how it would respond to any invitation or option to participate in operations or missions.  So it seems quite clear to me that UK sovereignty is key in all of this.  And the question is, how can demands that the UK give up its fishing grounds and operate in someone else's level playing field be respecting our sovereignty?  Writing in a comment piece in the Express, IDS said, Importantly, David Frost, Boris' chief negotiator, made it clear he agreed when he wrote that in the negotiations the UK places sovereignty above all else.  It is in that context that the issue of how these outstanding payments to the EU impinge on the UK sovereignty which matter now.  And on this, fellow Tory David Jones said, It would be akin to the UK demanding unfettered access to EU cattle and fruit, or to go mining for fuel and minerals across the whole bloc.  And David Jones continued, So in my mind, there is no doubt that under international law the UK would no longer be bound by the terms of the withdrawal agreement.  And IDS also wrote, And in good faith to take the necessary steps to negotiate expeditiously the agreements governing their future relationship referred to in the political declaration.  These open-ended financial commitments, coupled with the EU's astonishing refusal to negotiate on services, 80% of UK GDP, mean the EU are acting in bad faith, in contravention of their own obligations.  The withdrawal agreement was always work in progress as at the end of the year the UK has a right to a comprehensive agreement, one which treats the UK as a sovereign partner.  A failure to observe this must lead to a rejection of the withdrawal agreement.  And ultimately, he said, a failure to observe this must lead to a rejection of the withdrawal agreement.  Now that would be good news.  Fully free, no financial obligations and no worries.  No concerns over fisheries or over the level playing field or any other ECJ nonsense.  It would also remove all those privileges and immunities for EU staff and former staff that are listed in the withdrawal agreement, covering all manner of things from taxation, social security payments like pensions, unemployment insurance and immunity of MEPs.  Remember all of that?  Now that would cause a stir in Brussels.  You'd hear the eyeball popping from here.  And on top of this, Number 10 says that Brexit independence over fishing will be respected.  That deal or no deal, the UK's status as a sovereign coastal nation will be respected.  With Boris Johnson's official spokesperson saying... we will ensure whatever agreement we reach with the EU on fishing rights, or indeed if we are unable to reach one, we will make sure our status as an independent coastal state is properly respected.  And that is part of regaining our true sovereignty, and something the EU must respect if it is to comply properly with the Withdrawal Agreement Treaty and the Political Declaration.  But this is all much easier said than done.  It would potentially tie us up in the courts for years to come.  as Brussels would be forced to take the UK to an international court to test its case, if the UK were to declare the withdrawal agreement null and void.  All very time consuming and expensive.  Much better, easier, cheaper and neater to agree a nice little trade deal with the UK that respects not just the EU single market, but also the full sovereignty and independence of the UK.  After all, that's exactly what's required of any agreement between the EU and UK as laid down in those exit documents.  And it also says that both sides should work towards it happening by the 31st of December.  It's not the UK that tried to slow everything down at the beginning of the year to force a one or two year Brexit implementation period extension, was it?  No, that was Brussels, egged on by our own in-house UK Remain campaigners.  The UK just wanted to get on with it.  So not much good faith there either from the EU side it seems.
