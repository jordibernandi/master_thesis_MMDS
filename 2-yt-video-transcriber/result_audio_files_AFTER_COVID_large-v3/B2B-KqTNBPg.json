            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Tel Aviv, Israel.  We're living in exciting and prophetic times.  There has never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted.  2 Corinthians 3, verse 16.  Then Jews are searching for the truth like never before.  There is a hunger in the midst of the coronavirus, in the midst of the demonic outpouring.  Jews are searching for truth.  They just don't know what the truth is.  We're living in a time that Amos spoke about.  Amos 8, verse 11.  The days are coming, declares the Sovereign Lord, when I will send a famine through the land.  Not a famine of food or of thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.  And that's happening right now in Israel and around the world.  And this is the time for the gospel to go forth full force.  Praise Yeshua, God.  The people in Israel take at face value what the rabbis have to say.  Even if they're secular Jews, they're not religious.  They may not even eat kosher.  Go to tattoo parlors.  They still take at face value what the rabbis have to say.  It's in the culture.  And the Jews... that are religious also take at face value what the rabbis have to say.  So they read the Bible under rabbinic interpretations.  So they have books that interpret the Bible, and then they have books that interpret the books that interpret the Bible.  These books are such as the Zohar, the Gemara, the Talmud.  These books are not from God, and it is the enemy's way, Satan, of keeping the Jews away from the truth of the Scriptures.  As it says in Romans 10, verse 17, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  And this is why the enemy keeps the Jews from reading the scriptures without rabbinic interpretations.  Even the secular schools, public schools here in Israel, that are not religious, when they study the Tanakh, the Bible, Old Testament, they have to study what the rabbis say.  But God has a master plan.  You can't stop the gospel.  Genesis 50 verse 20, you intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.  So the Jewish people want to know what the rabbis have to say.  God said, we'll let them know what the rabbis have to say.  And he had the most venerated rabbi in the history of Israel, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, to receive a revelation that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  And he left a note to be opened one year after his burial, revealing the name of Yeshua, or Yehoshua, Jesus.  And we are using that revelation through the evangelistic tool, the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah, to lead Jews to the written word of God and to salvation.  There is no revival without the word of God.  But because Jews all the time want to go to see what the rabbis have to say, this book, this revelation of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri that Yeshua is the Messiah, opens the door for us to search the scriptures and for the Holy Spirit to work on them.  All we can do is preach the gospel.  The Holy Spirit does the rest.  We are small people with a big God.  The Orthodox movement in Israel, the rabbis, have done everything they can, Yad L'Achim, the anti-missionary organization, to try to suppress the truth, to try to stop this revelation that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left.  that Yeshua is the Messiah, to try to stop the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah from hitting the streets of Israel.  But it's too late.  They can't stop it.  The hand of Yeshua has released the anointing for the message to go forth.  And when God opens Yeshua, no man can shut.  Yeshua, Jesus, has the key of David.  It's in his nail-pierced hands.  Isaiah 22, verse 22, I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David, and what he opens, no one can shut, and what he shuts, no one can open.  When God's hand is upon something, nothing can be stopped.  The gospel will go forth.  As the team were praying, I began to preach the gospel.  in the heart of tel aviv near the robin square area where the city hall of tel aviv and one block away from the main rabbinic courts of tel aviv mostly a secular area there was a young man walking with a mask on.  he came over to me and asked me i noticed you here talking with the people with a bible in your hand.  I said yes.  I introduced myself.  He introduced himself as Gidon, a computer technician from Tel Aviv.  He then said, I usually am not attracted to the Bible, but I found it very strange that you're standing around with a Bible and not wearing a yarmulke, a kippah.  A kippah yarmulke has a head covering.  I told Gidon, I don't wear a kippah because it's not in the Bible.  It's religion.  I don't have religion.  I have a relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He then turned to me, Gidon, and said, That sounds very interesting.  What do you mean?  you have a relationship without religion?  I then turned the Bible to Proverbs 23, verse 26, and read together with Gidon.  Does that Bible verse say that God wants religion?  Gideon said no.  I said God wants our heart.  He doesn't want religion.  He's searching for a relationship.  We need to trust in God and not on our own understanding.  I then read with him Proverbs 3, verse 5.  Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.  Those who practice religion are trying to lean on their own understanding.  We have a relationship with God.  And that's the reason I don't wear a kippah.  Because I'm not religious.  I have a relationship.  I don't follow man tradition.  I don't follow the rabbis.  I follow only the Word of God in context.  Praise Yeshua, Gidon was fascinated.  He told me that he was once a religious Jew, and because he felt bondage and he felt that it wasn't right, he left the Bible totally.  But this concept that God wants our heart and not religion is something new.  I then asked Gidon if we can sit down and talk and study.  He said yes.  We sat down in the center of Tel Aviv, in the Rabin Square, and began to study.  I shared my background with Gidon that I was once an Orthodox religious Jew, and I too did not feel the presence of God until I understood that He wants our heart.  And now the Holy Spirit lives inside of me.  Gidon looked at me and said, Holy Spirit?  What do you mean?  I thought only rabbis have the Holy Spirit.  I asked Gideon with love and compassion, if you believe that the rabbis have the Holy Spirit, then why did you leave being an Orthodox Jew?  He was speechless.  I told Gideon, the Holy Spirit is God, and only through the Messiah Can we reach the throne of God.  and then the Holy Spirit comes and lives inside of us?  There is no other way.  Gideon then asked me, where does the Bible say that?  only through the Messiah can we reach the Father?  I turn the Bible to the book of Tehillim, Psalms, chapter 2, verse 11 and 12.  Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling.  Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled.  Blessed are all who take refuge in him.  So God is saying, Kiss the Son, which is a form of worship, and if you do so, you will be blessed.  No one makes it to the Father, but only through him.  Gideon then asked, Where does it say that the son is the Messiah?  I turn the Bible to the book of Psalms, chapter two, verse one and two, and read together with Gideon.  Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?  The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed.  And when I read this in Hebrew with Gideon, the word for anointed in Hebrew is al-adonai v'al-mishichoh, it's Messiah.  At that moment, Gideon was in full shock.  Holy Spirit was working on him.  It was clear this was a divine appointment.  Gidon then asked me, but if this is so true, how come in school we don't learn this?  How come the rabbis never teach this?  I then asked Gidon, have you ever heard of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri?  Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri.  Gidon answered, Everybody has heard of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri.  He was the greatest rabbi that ever lived.  I asked Gidon, was he greater than the main rabbi of Tel Aviv?  He said yes.  Was he greater?  Then the main rabbi of Jerusalem, he said, yes.  I told Gidon, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri believed in the Messiah.  He believed that no one makes it to the Father, but only through Mashiach.  Gidon answered, that's impossible.  I then pulled out the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  There is a picture of a key on Gidon.  the front cover kind of looks like the key of David what God opens.  no man can shut.  I began reading together with Gideon several pages in the book and finally we reach page 53 and we read in Hebrew the note that Rabbi Yitzchak Adouri left.  in a decoded format we read the six words together revealing the name of Yeshua or Yoho Shua.  When Gidon read this, he said, this is impossible.  How can this be?  I told Gidon, the rabbis have done everything they can to suppress the truth.  They tried to hide this, but God is revealing it.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  Gideon then asked, let me see in the Bible where it says that Yeshua is the Messiah.  Once again, the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah is leading Jews to the written word of God.  Because without the word of God, there is no revival.  I turn the Bible to the book of Tehillim, Psalms, chapter 27, verse 1. and read together with Gideon.  The Lord is my light and my salvation.  Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the strength of my life.  Of whom shall I be afraid?  And in Hebrew it reads like this, The Lord is my light and my Yeshua.  Because the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  Gideon looked at the Bible verse again and again, and we read it again.  The Lord is my light and my Yeshua, my salvation.  Whom shall I fear?  I told Gidon, the Messiah Yeshua is everywhere.  He is the word.  Not only does the Bible say that Yeshua is the Messiah, it also shows us that Yeshua is God.  I turn the Bible to Isaiah 12, verse 2.  Surely God is my salvation.  I will trust and not be afraid.  The Lord... The Lord himself is my strength and my defense.  He has become my salvation, my Yeshua.  And it reads like this in Hebrew when I read it together with Gideon.  And once again, the word for salvation in Hebrew is the word Yeshua, Jesus.  So when I read together with Gideon in Hebrew, this is what he read.  Surely God is my Yeshua.  So we can see here that God and Yeshua are one.  After reading Isaiah chapter 12, verse 2, Gideon asked, I've never seen this before.  I told Gidon, it's because the rabbis don't want you to see it.  They want you to read books that interpret the Bible, and books that interpret the books that interpret the Bible, in order to keep you away from this supernatural salvation.  But as you can see, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri received this revelation, and he believed that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  And although they tried to eliminate the note, It was too late.  It was already on his website and screenshots were taken.  Gidon then asked, How can I receive this Yeshua?  We spent hours together studying the Word of God.  We read Isaiah 53, Micah 5.2, Jeremiah 23, Psalms 2 again, Deuteronomy 18, and many, many Bible passages.  After many hours of study, it was time for the full gospel.  I then told Gidon, Yeshua... is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  He died on the tree on the cross for your sins.  He rose on the third day.  And by His blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins and eternal life.  And then the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit fills you up and lives inside of you.  And you have a relationship with God, not a religion.  Gilon then said, this is a lot to grasp, but I want to learn more.  I see this is true, but I'm afraid.  I turned the Bible to Deuteronomy chapter 31 verse 8 and read together with Gideon, He will never leave you nor forsake you.  Do not be afraid.  Do not be discouraged.  God is calling you today.  The fact that you and I met is not a coincidence.  The word coincidence is not in the Bible.  This is a divine appointment.  I exchanged contact information with Gideon.  We'll be meeting for Bible study.  We pray for his salvation, that he'll come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  I then walked Gidon to his car after many hours of study.  On the way, as we were walking, he asked again to read Isaiah 12, verse 2.  He said, I can't get it out of my mind.  Surely, God is my salvation, my Yeshua.  I will trust and not be afraid.  The Lord, the Lord himself is my strength and my defense.  He has become my salvation, my Yeshua.  Gidon said, I can see here so clear that God and Messiah are one.  The Holy Spirit was hovering everywhere.  He then asked for a copy of the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  I gave Gidon a book.  It's a matter of time before he calls on Yeshua, as his Lord and Savior.  We continue to preach.  Many heard the gospel, and many contacts were made, as we will follow up.  One thing is certain, Gidon and all those that heard the gospel will never be the same again.  And for this, we give all the glory to Yeshua, Jesus, God.  And we will continue to preach the gospel no matter what.  And for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that the word for salvation is Yeshua.  her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  And we know that he's coming back with fire in his eyes like a blazing torch as the lion of the tribe of Judah to take back everything that the enemy has stolen.  And until that time, we will continue to preach the gospel.  until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11 26 let's continue to stand together as the one new man.  Ephesians 2 15 work the harvest together bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home until next time.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Tel Aviv, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
