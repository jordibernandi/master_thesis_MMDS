            "text": "Yeah, well, we did exactly what ancient Israel did in its last days.  Ancient Israel had seen this long decline from God, this long falling away.  And then he, in his mercy, allows the hedge of protection to be lifted on the nation, and he allows the strike to come to shake it up.  And and that people will come back to God.  And again, you're right.  You know, in the first days after 9-11, everybody was flocking to churches.  But without any repentance.  and without repentance, there is no revival if you don't turn your course.  So what happened is instead of getting better, coming back, America got worse.  I mean, look at where it was then.  Look at where we are now.  Now, look at our culture.  Look at all these things.  You know, we are watching.  The word harbinger means something that is yet to come.  So what the harbinger is saying is that 9-11 and all that, that's harbinger, not just signs, but harbingers of more of what is yet to come.  There's a biblical template.  And the point is, you know, you know, there's a mercy in it as well.  I was I was on a television program and, you know, people are praying for the virus, the plague, you know, and that's right.  We need to pray for that.  But the idea is not to pray so that things would just have prosperity again.  The point is to pray that God's will will be done through all these things.  And that is\u2014it is in his mercy.  You know, C.S.  Lewis spoke about the severe mercy of God.  It's his mercy that is for this, because when we\u2014the way America was before this calamity was not good.  We were racing away from God.  We are\u2014the culture was racing.  You know, what this\u2014 We're doing what ancient Israel did.  So the harbingers were saying that everything that Israel did, the signs that appear then have now appeared.  And the signs were a nation rising up, not in repentance, but in defiance.  And so we've done all those things and all those things were manifested, defiance, defiance.  Well, where does that leave?  You know, well, it's right there in the harbinger.  Jim Laurie, there's a chapter in the harbinger called Things to Come.  And when I looked at that, Again, things to come.  Let me just give you a little bit from it, and then we can, you know, we can go into it.  It's at one point, you know, that Noreal asked the prophet, what happens next?  You know, if the first stages of the pattern has come true so precisely, what happens after that?  And the prophet answers, as long as Israel continued its descent, you know, the judgment continue or the shakings and the warnings continue.  And so in the years after 9-11, you have this period where you have this.  There's actually, let me read to you words of a commentary on ancient Israel, Isaiah 9-10, about that whole thing.  And look what it says.  Listen to what it says.  And it's in the Harbinger.  It says, as the first stage of judgments, this is from a commentary on ancient Israel from Harvard, has been followed by no true conversion to Jehovah, the almighty judge, there comes a second.  So if the first stage doesn't lead to repentance, there will come a second judgment.  Now, listen to the, or second shaking, listen to the, here's another commentary on Isaiah 9-10, the harbinger scripture on ancient Israel, but look at how it applies to America.  Listen, it says this, that which God designs in striking us to turn us to himself and to cause us to seek him.  If this does not happen by lesser judgments, greater judgments may be expected.  Now that is in the chapter on things to come.  And then the man Noriel asks, are you talking about more calamities?  And says, yes, how will it come?  The prophet says in the Harbinger, they may take the form of economic disintegration or defeat, disorder, division, the collapse of infrastructure, man-made calamities, calamities of nature, decline and fall.  And in the case of a nation that's been so greatly blessed by God's favor, like America, it means the withdrawal of those blessings.  It says the withdrawal of prosperity, protection, and peace.  Now, listen to one more thing here.  There's far more to say, but one thing about this.  It says, in the case of a nation like America that has been preeminent among all the nations\u2014 It means the collapse, but it means the removing of the crown.  So the prophet speaks of shaking and the crown.  Well, in Latin, the word for crown is corona.  That's true. ",

The next verse, 9-11, says, Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries against him.  They shall devour Israel with an open mouth.  For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.  So in other words, because they didn't come back it says that it's going to continue shaking the land and then it goes.  the land is burned up.  what will you do in the day of punishment?  and that this is all from.  this is all.  this is isaiah and this is the harbinger in the desolation which is going to come.  so so the the in the harbinger.  the man asked the prophet is it a prophecy of national destruction?  And so what the prophet says is, yes, Isaiah 9, 10 ultimately leads to destruction if the people don't repent. ",
