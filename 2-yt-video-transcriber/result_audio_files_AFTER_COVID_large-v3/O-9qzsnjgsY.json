I just want you to consider for a moment that the information we receive might be manipulated and not all true.  We all have this inner voice, the child that can spot the bullshit, But that intuitive voice is suppressed by the mass manipulation of the media machine making you doubt your intuition in favor of the opinion of those faceless experts and fabricated statistics reshaping your perception of reality and in turn controlling your behavior.  We all feel something is off here.  I don't think we get back to normal.  We get to a new normal.  And a lot of it doesn't make sense.  But then you pinch yourself and say, Nah, why would they do that?  What I'm about to show you now is the holy grail of information on their plan and what's in store for us in the next decade or so.  How would you look your children in the eye when they ask what you were doing?  Have some shame, and at least spread the word.  Spread the word. ",
