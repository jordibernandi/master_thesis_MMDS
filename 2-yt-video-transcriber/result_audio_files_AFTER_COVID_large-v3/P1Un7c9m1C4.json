But not until black lives matter.  So I should be dead?  So I don't matter?  Did I say that?  But then not until black lives matter.  Your life doesn't matter.  Until black lives matter.  So I can be dead in the street and you can walk right over me and I don't matter?  Your life does not matter until black lives matter.  So when did black lives never matter?  When did that start?  Yeah.  When the first slave came over on a ship to this country that we took from Native Americans.  When did you tell me that the black Africans that sold the slaves, why don't you go?  It's the black Africans' fault.  They sold their own people to the Europeans.  Ma'am, ma'am.  We can agree to disagree.  I'm not here to argue.  Black lives matter.

So does my Irish American history.  So does my Nigerian history.  So does all the other history that's inside me.  Why doesn't that matter?  I didn't say that.  I said black lives matter.  So does European lives matter.  No, but the sign doesn't say that.  The sign says black lives matter.  Do you agree?  Do you agree?  They dropped a bioweapon of.  We all are part of something.  Ma'am, I know you mean well, but all I'm saying is Black Lives Matter.  Why do you have a problem with that?  When did they not ever matter in the matter?  When we brought them over as slaves.  There's a pandemic going on.  Yeah.  And again, you can do that.  You can choose not to wear a mask.  No, my body, my choice.  100%.  And you feel the same way about abortion rights, correct?  No, I'm for life.  All right.  Hey, I love you as a human, but figure it out.  Black Lives Matter.  All lives matter.  It doesn't until Black Lives Matter.  and the born and the elderly that you guys might choose to kill.  Your body, your choice, correct?  Your body, your choice?  My health, my freedom.  Correct.  We agree.  Your body, your choice.  Get one of my cards, please.  Fake?  Are you in disguise?  What's underneath that mask?  It's a pandemic.  He don't want to show his face.  Wait, hold on a second.  Because he's being filmed, which I already got your face.  This is why I don't come over here, man.  This is why I don't come over here.
