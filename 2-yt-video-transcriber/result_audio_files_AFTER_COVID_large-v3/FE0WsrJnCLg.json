I don't really cosign with the red pill moniker, and I don't really cosign with the black pill moniker.  I'm not a MGTOW, and I'm not an incel.  But I do find a lot of truth and value in a lot of these different ideologies.  quite a bit.  Now, Red Pill moniker has the umbrella of, like, MGTOW, but you've got the pickup artists in there, and then you've got, like, the dating coaches, I guess you can slide in there, and you've got, like, the alpha dudes, I don't know if those are, like, pickup artists or, like, dating coaches, or they're, like, somewhere in between there, but I don't know, you've got all that mon- you've got a huge moniker of this philosophy, because this philosophy of the Red Pill can really be, applied in numerous different ways.  Now, the philosophy of the black pill, not so much, but we'll get into that in just a second.  And the reason why I'm making this overview video is because I'm going to break down each ideology and my contentions with them in their own separate videos, of course, but I think that a good general overview of like what's similar about them and like my overall, you know, I wouldn't call it a disdain but disagreement with them might be well, you know, as a good starting point.  So let's start off with this. ",
