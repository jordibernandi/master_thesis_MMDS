            "text": "It took tweets from parents and then crucially their boosting by Marcus Rashford to make this government act on the meagre parcels being sent out to Britain's school children.  And if there was any doubt Marcus Rashford is the nation's real opposition leader, he tweeted the following today.  Just had a good conversation with the Prime Minister.  He has assured me that he is committed to correcting the issue with the food hampers and that a full review of the supply chain is taking place.  He agrees that images of hampers being shared on Twitter are unacceptable.  Boris Johnson got in on the act.  He quote tweeted Rashford and said, I totally agree with you, Marcus Rashford.  These food parcels do not meet the standards we set out and we have made it clear to the company involved that this is disgraceful.  The company concerned has rightly apologised and agreed to reimburse those affected.  Now, this is all very well.  I'm glad that Boris Johnson has come to his senses and there will be some pressure on these companies to either put more food in the baskets or schools will be told, you know, if you want, you can get the vouchers if that's what the parents want.  But this U-turn, as with all of them, it's not a one-off event.  This is not the first time that action from Rashford was needed to intervene and to make sure that our government paid sufficient due to the welfare of Britain's kids.  Of course, back in June, the government had planned to end free school meals for students over the summer holidays.  It was only after Rashford's intervention they were forced into a U-turn.  Now, as is often the case during this pandemic, Piers Morgan did a brilliant job this morning skewering Matt Hancock on why he had opposed basic measures to ensure won't go hungry until Marcus Rashford got very publicly involved.

Alongside Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson, I'd say he's probably the most identifiable politician for the general public right now.  And he just comes across just appallingly.  And like you say, firstly, it's incoherent what he's saying.  It doesn't make any sense.  But secondly, the Tories love to talk to working people.  Take some responsibility.  Take some responsibility.  Take some ownership over your decisions and how you voted.  You could just say, yeah, I don't think that was the right call.  You're a politician.  You can say things in ways which perhaps are a little bit more palatable to the powers that be, to the chief wit, to Boris Johnson, to his various advisors, to Rishi Sunak.  But he just comes across just... like a little snake.  And it applies to so many politicians, but I think Matt Hancock in that particular moment was supremely snake-like.  I mean, it's just embarrassing.  You know, I don't think Labour are doing a great job as opposition, but you look at the Tories polling 40%, I-30s, you think, who the hell are these people?  To look at Matt Hancock in that moment and go, yep, that guy's done a great job.  Yep, really, really professional, responsible guy.  It's shambolic.  It is utterly shambolic.  How can the health secretary say that?  He's the person who's in charge of this country's health.  By the way, he's obviously doing an appalling job because we've literally just passed the death toll of 100,000 people.  you know, but my God, my God, how many car crash moments do you need with one guy before his political career is over?  10 years ago, one thing like that, that was it, Matt Hancock, gone from sort of public life.  It's gonna take years to recover from that.  These are happening every day.  We can't keep up.  There are so many.  That's the first time I've even seen that, heard about it, hadn't seen it.  And yet there doesn't seem to be any sort of major political overhead.  A lot of that is because people have goodwill to the government because, of course, there's a national crisis and COVID was happening.  This isn't entirely because of them.  But I think also that's giving them a bit too much latitude.  You can't have politicians not even owning the decisions they make like a month, two months ago.  Unbelievable. ",
