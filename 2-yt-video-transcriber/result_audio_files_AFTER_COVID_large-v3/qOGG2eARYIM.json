I had a mentor, Stella Curran, I always give kudos to her because she said, she's, well, Carol, acting's for young people.  As long as you have your hands and your eyes, you can be an artist.  And so I said, well, then I'll do the first half of my life as an actor and then the second half of my life as an artist.  Well, of course, it doesn't really all fall together like that.  I mean, acting took a long time to manifest itself as a working person.  And then all of a sudden it was there and it was there relentlessly for what now?  45 years straight.  So I haven't stopped acting.  professionally and while I was doing that I started to introduce my friends who were artists to people who did movies to people who became chefs.  so immediately there was a kind of you ought to know so-and-so and she ought to know you and he can put that up on your wall of your restaurant, and we had this wonderful sort of symbiotic activity going on within the arts.

And so now there's this sort of like, where do you start?  And if you're in a bit of a hurry, then what museums are trying to do is create the sense of who this artist is, give him a sense of place and what he paints and what his emotion is, et cetera.  So this is something that's happening.  I collect from a completely different place.  I collect seeing myself reflected in a painting.  I collect because of a certain type of color, thickness, pasto, the materials used.  I've spent a lot of time in Africa and I am amazed at the materials that are used because that's the materials that they have and what they create from it.
