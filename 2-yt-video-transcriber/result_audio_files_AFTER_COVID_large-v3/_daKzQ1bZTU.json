            "text": "This is Richard Wolff from Democracy at Work with another Wolff Responds and in this case I want to respond to the July 30th announcement by the United States government of one of the worst collapses in our economic system in the history both of the United States and of capitalism itself.  Over nine and a half percent drop in the output of goods and services in the second quarter of this year, April, May, and June.  Alongside that statistic, another one, that continuing unemployment, people who can't get a job, has gotten worse over the last week or so than it was earlier.  All in all, a grim picture of economic breakdown.  What does it mean And what should we do about it?  Let me begin briefly with what it means.  We have a capitalist system.  And what that means is that we put the dominant decision-making power, economically, into the hands of a small minority of our people.  They have a name.  They are called employers.  or if you like, capitalists.  It really doesn't matter.  Those people are driven by what they themselves refer to as their bottom line, the thing they are in business to achieve, profits.  The bigger the profits, the more successful they are.  And they will explain to you, sometimes quoting Milton Friedman, the economist, that the job of the businessman or woman is to make for a profitable business, nothing else.  We have an economy in which those people decide when and how and where to use whatever capital they have or whatever capital they can get others to give them to go into business to make a profit.  If they see a profit opportunity, they can choose to pursue it or not.  If they don't see one, we know that they will not.  Their decision based on profits for themselves will determine whether the vast majority of people have a job, what income they earn in that job, what the conditions, benefits, costs associated with that job are, where you will have to move to live if you want that job, and so on.  We all allow, we the majority, who are employees, the vast majority, allow the fact of whether we have a job, and what benefits go with it, and what conditions of life go with it, to be determined by a minority of our fellow citizens who are in a position of employer slash capitalist.  When we can get jobs and incomes and decent benefits and enough to live properly, we have allowed this blatantly undemocratic system in which a small number of people, unaccountable to us, We never voted for them to be the capitalists.  We never voted to approve or disapprove whatever they decide to do with their capital.  They made the decision and we hope to get the job.  Okay, if that system provides, it's understandable that we would allow, we the people, this system in which our jobs, our incomes are very existent, is held hostage by a small, unaccountable minority.  But now we see where that system leads.  It leads to a system that was unprepared for yet another virus, even though we've had many.  We live in a system that, having failed to prepare for it, is now in the process of failing to contain it.  And because it failed to prepare for and it is failing to contain, we have an economic crash on top of it.  Capitalism crashes every four to seven years.  We're in the third one in the first 20 years of this century.  One every seven years.  It would have crashed for another reason if it hadn't been COVID-19.  So we weren't prepared for the crash, we weren't prepared for the pandemic, and we're obviously unable to cope with the two catastrophes together.  That's a system problem.  That's the point.  It's a system problem coming to a head.  You see it all around you.  Many of our problems kicked down the road, postponed, because we hoped, we dreamed, we imagined that capitalism would find the solution.  Global warming?  Don't worry, it'll be solved.  Race relations?  Don't worry, it'll be solved.  Continuous poverty?  Don't worry, it'll be solved.  Threat of a pandemic?  Don't worry, it'll be solved.  They weren't.  they're all coming to a head now.  And the system that couldn't handle them individually certainly cannot handle them all together.  So we need to get out of a state of denial.  Denial that our system has real problems.  Denial that, like every other system, that was born, evolved over time, and died.  Capitalism was born in the 18th century, evolved over time, and became global.  The next step is for it to die.  And the real question you have to face with me is whether the death is coming, and coming soon.  And if it is, Will we let capitalism take us down with it?  Or will we finally do what we should have done?  Ask the basic questions.  What's with this system?  Can we do better?  Are the mechanisms of self-healing exhausted in capitalism?  Is that what we're seeing?  Let me conclude with one key idea.  Maybe we should never have, and maybe now for sure we should no longer, allow the decisions about whether or not we work whether or not we have an income, whether or not we have decent benefits, whether or not we can raise families, instead of letting those issues be decided by a small group of people who will make the decision based on the question of whether there's profit in it or not for them.  Maybe that's what has to change.  Maybe the first priority, the bottom line, has to be we all work.  We all give back for the goods and services we take out.  We all have a right to a job.  We need it as a group, and we need it individually.  And we all have right to an income.  And we all have right to decent job conditions and decent benefits.  Maybe that should be the bottom line.  And if we make a profit, good.  And if we don't make a profit, that's not the bottom line.  That's not the be-all and end-all.  There's no small group that will make a profit and then do something good or not make a profit and then not do something good.  We're going to make the good things happen for the vast majority of the people because that's what democracy always intended.  We better ask the basic questions.  because we are in a basic breakdown of our system.  And pretending that that's not happening will not make it go away.  Thank you very much for your attention.  This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work. ",
