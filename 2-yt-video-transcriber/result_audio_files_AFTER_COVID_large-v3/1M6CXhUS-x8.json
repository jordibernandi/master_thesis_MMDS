            "text": "Well, howdy there, Internet people.  It's Beau again.  So today, we're going to talk about understanding.  This is a requested video.  Somebody asked me if I would be willing to just once on Trump's last day catalog his accomplishments the way his supporters see them in hopes of promoting understanding.  I'm all about understanding.  And I actually think this is going to be a good exercise.  If you have a Trump-supporting friend, get them near you.  Let them listen to this.  Because I'm going to, in good faith, try to outline things that his supporters really liked about him.  But since it is my channel, I'm going to do it six good things, and then I'm going to say one bad thing.  that I think all of his supporters will be like, yeah, he totally did that.  And then I'm going to name six more good things.  And then one bad thing.  Watch to the end.  Okay.  His supporters loved the fact that under him, nobody had to be ashamed that they loved the American flag.  or the bald eagle, those symbols of the nation.  He brought nationalism back.  He made it okay.  They liked that.  He enforced, or at least promoted, traditional family roles.  He made national security paramount, a really important thing, and he focused on that.  Because he was doing that, he didn't wobble.  When it came time to call a bad guy a bad guy, he did it.  He let us know who our enemies were.  Because he knew who our enemies were and knew that we had opposition out there, he didn't care about conventions or rights that they may have.  Now, to the liberals watching this, I know y'all, that's not a good thing.  To them it is.  To them it is because they want to win.  And they don't care how they do it.  When it comes to something like that, when it comes to national security issues, they want to win.  Period.  Because of those opposition groups, he made the military supreme.  The most important thing, bar none.  Six positive things.  So here's my negative one.  He engaged in cronyism.  I think everybody would admit that.  He hired his family members who were less than qualified for those positions.  I don't think anybody would deny that.  That's my negative one.  He didn't let the media run him.  He ran the media.  He called them out.  He didn't let them get away with anything.  If he thought they were lying, he said they were lying.  And he told his supporters which outlets they could trust.  He protected our business interests, American business interests, at home and abroad with the full force of the U.S.  government.  He established mutually beneficial relationships between government and the private sector and used the U.S.  government to make it happen, to make things run on time.  He did not let the lefty labor groups gain an inch.  He didn't waste time, money, on horrible art or impractical, unmarketable, liberal arts type of intellectual activities.  He didn't push that.  He focused on law and order, crime and punishment.  It was a big focus of his, and his supporters loved it.  And he brought religion back into the forefront.  God back in the White House and all of that.  His supporters loved it.  Now my negative thing.  He undermined the elections.  To what extent his supporters may argue, but there is no doubt that he did.  So I just named 12 positive things and two negative things that I believe most honest supporters of Trump would admit were true.  14 things in total.  So now you have a clear picture of what they believe.  Now for the Trump supporters, here's why liberals and leftists and a lot of centrists were so opposed to this.  These 14 points are the 14 characteristics of fascism.  You were nodding your head throughout the whole thing, I imagine.  There will be a link down below with this list.  You can listen to it again and read along.  I didn't do them in order, but you'll be able to find them.  It's a short list.  That's why there was so much opposition.  That's why people were so worried about the amount of power he was gaining.  The 12 points that I just mentioned that were great things for Trump and the two negative things that they would concede are the 14 characteristics of fascism.  Yeah, you were holding the monkeys, Paul, when you asked me to do this video.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  Y'all have a good day. ",
