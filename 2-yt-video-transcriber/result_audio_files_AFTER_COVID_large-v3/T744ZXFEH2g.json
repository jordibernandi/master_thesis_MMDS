            "text": "Let's just get started.  This is two days since our last call, right?  Here it is Thursday.  We had our last call on Tuesday, and we had a lot of good things that I think I brought out that we should consider.  There's not a whole lot new other than the fact that most of our Intel sources have all but dried up.  They've really gotten quiet.  I could take that as a good thing because less is more sometimes.  In this particular case, we're always curious as to what's going on.  Do we have anything new?  What should I bring to the listeners?  And I have a few things, but not a whole lot.  So let's look at it this way.  the payouts of the tiers 1, 2, 3, and I know you guys don't care about this, but it's just in order to tell you sort of what's going on.  They did sort of cherry pick over 600 in tier 3 and paid them out their 1%, but they did not pay out the bulk as far as we know yet.  The bulk of those Tier 3s we were looking to have paid out.  I don't know whether they have been yet or not, but I know they were paying, you know, cherry-picking certain of those individuals and paying them.  So that's an interesting prospect is when will the rest of those and when will the intermediates actually be paid out?  We heard they were all ready to go, ready to be paid, lined up, but for some reason they had not yet been released.  Well, it may be that what they're trying to do is let the majority of those, even those in the intermediate groups, get paid out essentially when we get started.  It's possible.  they're waiting until that time.  It seems a little bit hard for me to imagine.  Now, The groups, as you know, we're for B, that's the Internet group, for A, regarding the groups that are based out west, the cores, and the rest of the other groups have always been considered.  as for A, but because they're fixed-rate groups, some people have rolled them into Tier 3 groups.  I haven't really done that.  In my mind, there's still Tier 4A, but I think Tier 4, which is them and us, will probably pretty much go together.  Pretty much go.  They might get a little head start on us, but I don't think it'll be much.  Now, as far as the email that is going to go out under the Wells Fargo servers, and they're just now I believe over 500,000 emails in that group of emails to go out.  This doesn't mean it's the Wells Fargo group from years and years ago.  Yeah, I'm sure they have some of those emails that might still be good, but this is everybody else that has bought currency through a dealer or somebody that has asked for your email.  Okay, so if so, they have your emails.  And that's who is going to receive those.  Now, those emails are supposed to come with, I'm going to call it an attachment.  It may be the actual email itself.  But my way of thinking is it should be an attachment to the email or a page two of the email.  And my understanding is, and I've had it confirmed from three other sources already, that this email that comes out, when you print it out, there'll be something you can print out to take with you in your car as you're driving or someone is driving you to the redemption center in case you got pulled.  It's not that likely, but it'll probably happen to somebody in case you get pulled on the way to the redemption center.  You have that piece of paper that you can give the officer and then he can say, okay, I can see that this is authorized.  This is considered essential.  Obviously, they do want us to come in at the exact time for us, you know, for our exchanges, our Zim redemption.  You are perfectly welcome to go to your redemptions.  It's all This is all for us to do.  So you're going to have a printed version.  If you get that email and can print it out, take it with you.  If for some reason you don't have a printer or you don't get the email, the thing to do would be just to have the information on your phone.  If you did get an email and you have it on your phone, Obviously, you have it there on your phone and you could actually show the officer if it came to that, you know, that you have authorization to go for this bank exchange.  It's considered essential business.  Essential business.  You like that?  I like that.  I just thought of that.  Essential business.  Now, I don't think it's going to be a big deal.  It's just sort of a precaution that I understand they are going to send out with those emails that are going to come out in bulk to us.  Now, so that should help you guys to navigate that.  As far as, let's talk just briefly.  Our understanding is that the, and I've given up on trying to find out, find the denar rate.  It supposedly has already reinstated it will revalue, and I understand that the value that it comes out at may not be as high as we thought initially.  It could be in the mid-fours, and what they're saying is it will escalate over a period of 10 or more days to a much higher rate, possibly to two and a half times higher.  So if you're only a dinar and dong holder, you may want to consider setting your appointment.  It's hard to do.  Slightly later than sooner.  Slightly later.  I wouldn't go super long, but it's possible that the rate, if you're just a currency holder, could be higher for you a little later in the game rather than sooner.  This is not a new concept.  This is a concept that came out.  oh, I'm going to say at least six or eight years ago, maybe much longer, a concept that the rates would go up.  It's a game.  It's a game that you would be playing.  You know, do you want to get in and get out and go?  Yes, you do.  But if you're just holding dinar, especially if you're not holding that much, or you're just holding dinar and donk, then, you know, you might want to consider when you go in for your appointment based on these rates.  And, you know, the thing about rates is one moment it's this, the next moment it changes.  It's hard, it's very hard to predict exactly where they're going to be on any given day, just to let you know.  It's very difficult.  And for a long, long time we've had nothing on certain rates, and then all of a sudden we'll get a rate.  or we'll see what they anticipate the rate to be, et cetera.  So it's still a very inexact science, believe me, when it comes for us trying to predict what we're going to be looking at.  And let's see if there's anything that is relevant to that.  I gave you pretty much the rundown of what to expect at the redemption centers.  I don't think anything has changed as far as I know since Tuesday night's call.  I believe that was all pretty well laid out for us.  I would say as far as the timing, what I'm hearing, you remember we talked a little bit briefly about the three days of darkness, right?  And we talked about it in terms of it not affecting us.  It is designed for the deep state and their affiliates.  And I believe that we will be in the clear when it comes to that.  And immediately after the three days of darkness, we should have... days and days of disclosure, which should bring us a lot of truth that we've missed out on in a lot of different things that have happened in our history and that are continuing to happen.  And these are supposed to be on eight-hour segments.  that would be, I believe, televised or at least the audio portion put out on the emergency alert system or the emergency broadcasting system.  I hope there's video.  I hope they're visible on television and not just the audio of this on radio or telephone.  But we'll see.  We'll see how they're going to do that.  The plan would be to have these run in eight-hour segments three times a day.  That's 24 hours a day for 12 days.  You think we might get a little tired of that, but the object is to make sure it catches everybody, that everybody gets a chance to listen and be up to speed on what has really been happening.  Many of us know some of it, but a lot of us don't know enough of it.  So that's going to be something to hear, I'm sure.  That could be really, really interesting, that type of disclosure.  Now, that is supposed to happen immediately after the three days of darkness.  So it's like you've got darkness and then you've got a great light.  And it's a beautiful thing that we should witness here.  I don't know exactly when the three days, well, I do know when I believe they're going to be, but I can't tell you I absolutely know it.  And right now, my understanding is they're set for the 7th, 8th, and 9th of April.  So, does that mean, what does it mean as far as us and our start for our exchanges and redemption of sims?  I believe what I've been told, and I've got three or four different sources that are agreeing with this, that we are to start on the day of that first day of disclosure.  Bob, I'd say whenever you're ready. ",
