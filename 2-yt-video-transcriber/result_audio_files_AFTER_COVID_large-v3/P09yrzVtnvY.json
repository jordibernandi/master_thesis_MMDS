            "text": "Welcome back, everyone.  I'm again here broadcasting from my apartment in Queens, New York, continuing our daily coverage of the coronavirus, the CCP virus.  Again, we're doing this five days a week, Monday through Friday, so please tune in.  Starting off, well, you all may notice I have a better camera set up.  One of our staff members from Epoch Times was nice enough to come by the apartment and show me how to work this camera.  But on that note, too, we're going to jump into some things about this Epoch Times documentary.  I'm sure you all saw, followed my investigation into this Wuhan coronavirus, this CCP virus.  And of course, as many of you pointed out, Facebook labeled it as fake.  Now, we'll be having a more official response to that.  I think you'll find it interesting, hopefully.  Now, meanwhile, in the last episode I mentioned this.  This is off the note of the virus to some extent.  It does tie in a little bit because I've been talking about Huawei, big Chinese companies, and noting something weird is going on.  Now, I mentioned there was this story of a child trafficking ring that was allegedly found in China.  Apple Daily had the story on it, and I noted that the story disappeared.  The link was gone.  And I, of course, asked if anyone could help me find it.  I did mention the link.  So it turns out the sister media of Epoch Times Entity Television had a story on it as well.  Now, the story starts with an individual named Bao Yumin, and he was allegedly found to have violated his adopted daughter.  Now, Bao Yumin is not just any person in China.  Bao Yumin just so happens to be a top executive at Chinese telecom company ZTE and is vice president of energy company Jerry Group, which is a big company in China, and also has some ties to Cisco.  So not a minor figure.  There were, of course, a couple stories about him sexually abusing his adopted daughter.  We have the links on this, archived links.  What I found very strange was, in addition to this Apple Daily story no longer being there, which I noted in the last episode, that the wiki page on this individual was also removed.  Luckily, there was an archive of it, which I've included.  Now, according to the NTD report, investigations into Bao Yumin, uncovered in many online marketplaces for children, fetuses, infants.  I mean, terrible stuff.  And they're being trafficked under the guise of adoption.  It says that you can buy a human fetus on these markets for about 40,000 yuan.  You can buy an infant starting at 100,000 yuan.  And they found a QQ group, which is like an online chat group, called Love Aid Station 2.  It was one of many that were uncovered.  showing that women were working as breeders for these traffickers.  And they had documents that even showed how many weeks these women were pregnant for.  And now I apologize, I know this is disturbing stuff, but let's go into a bit more.  Now this is from NTD.  It says that there was another group revealed and that, quote, the adopters not only have unmarried mothers, the traffickers, not only have unmarried mothers working for them, quote, but also have second and third births.  In other words, women apparently not just giving birth once for these traffickers, but giving birth two or three times.  It also adds, quote, the report pointed out that due to the gray zone of illegal adoptions in mainland China, the sale of babies in the name of adoption has formed an industrial chain And some people even raise a group of pregnant women just to sell children.  Other than just being disturbing, honestly, what I found very interesting about this is the tie to ZTE.  You may remember in the last episode I talked about how there are weird things going on with major Chinese telecom companies.  ZTE, Huawei, and China Telecom are the three biggest ones in China.  All three of them.  Well, at least Huawei and China Telecom are being hit by the United States.  ZTE has been kind of quiet for a long time.  But during the Obama administration, ZTE and Huawei were called out as being national security threats.  We haven't heard a lot from ZTE since.  One of the few cases we have heard from them was early on in the trade war when Trump restricted the sale of chips.  to ZTE, which just about crippled China's high-tech market temporarily.  And so it's interesting now that ZTE is getting swept up in something.  And I noted as well in the last episode, you can watch it, that there has been a long chain of anomalies, very strange incidents, with a lot of these big Chinese tech companies.  Now, on to the virus again.  The Chinese Communist Party was found to have been listing asymptomatic cases falsely.  Now, of course, in China, here's what's happened with this whole narrative that the virus is over.  Now, long story short, the Chinese Communist Party was reeling from the virus.  All the major cities were closed down.  Factories were shut down.  It was a huge issue.  You know, all the media were talking about it.  And then suddenly what happens?  Xi Jinping comes out ahead of the Chinese Communist Party and states people need to go back to work.  That was because the Chinese economy was failing.  Chinese businesses were going out of business.  Close to a third were about to go to business, and another third would have gone out of businesses soon after.  So Xi Jinping declares people need to go back to work, and what happens?  Right after that, almost immediately, all the Chinese state-run media state the virus is over, it is now safe to go back to work.  And again, while they declared it was safe for everyone to go back to work, all the regular people, they still delayed the party conference.  meaning it was safe for everyone else to congregate, but if you were a party member, it wasn't safe to get together.  And of course, the Chinese Communist Party has been doing two things since then.  One is its warning of asymptomatic cases, in other words, keeping people on their toes that the virus is still spreading.  And two, claiming that a lot of the new cases found are being exported from other countries.  They're talking about a second wave now.  Of course, I mentioned on this channel that that was going to happen.  Now it's happening.  They're saying there's a second wave outbreak in China.  And with this case in Heilongjiang province, long story short, they've reported new asymptomatic cases on April 10th.  But two of the three, and of course they're keeping the numbers low, had symptoms.  They were not asymptomatic, even though they reported as asymptomatic.  These individuals had tried seeking medical help.  They were still listed as asymptomatic, even though they had symptoms.  And people on the Chinese internet are now questioning whether the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, is using this line of asymptomatic cases as a cover-up.  And of course, this raises additional concerns as to whether people are being tested at all who are being listed as having asymptomatic cases.  In other words, if the Chinese Communist Party is warning of asymptomatic cases, that means that you have the virus, you're transmitting it, you're able to pass it on to other people, but you do not have any symptoms of it.  You're not showing any signs that you have it.  Now on the note of the Chinese Communist Party's cover-up of what has been happening with this virus, the Epoch Times interviewed a woman, she's a mother of a family of four, who fled Wuhan before the city was locked down.  And so she fled from Wuhan to the U.S.  in February.  She witnessed pretty serious things that had happened in China.  She tells a pretty harrowing story.  Now, this piece was in our Chinese edition.  I won't go over the whole thing, but I will read some of it here.  Long story short, she says the situation in China, as we've been told now, is much, much worse than the Chinese Communist Party has been reporting.  That the whole families were dying, that the situation in the hospitals was packed.  You couldn't get treatment, even if you had the virus.  She said, quote, we came from Wuhan and we all know the tragic situation in Wuhan before.  Many families in Wuhan cannot get medical treatment and cannot go out, causing the whole family to be infected.  She noted in some cases there were entire families who died.  She said, quote, the data is all fake and is censored.  Many people died in the early stage.  Many of them were not diagnosed, and they were all suspected to be written off because the testing kits were not allowed.  Now on the note of the Chinese Communist Party's cover-up of the number of infected and dead in China, AEI has a report stating that the number of infections in China could be around 2.9 million, and this is on a low estimate.  Now they write in their report, quote, in late January, Chinese media provided information about migrant outflow from Wuhan before quarantine, using a lower number than theirs.  then conservative figures for migrants infection rate and time and circulation before national lockdown generates an estimate of 2.9 million cases.  China's COVID-19 figures are not arithmetically sensible.  The Communist Party has deliberately made estimation difficult, but outside of Wuhan city and Hubei province, which is where Wuhan is, cases are low by a factor of 100 or more.  And now on the note of how they rounded down their data, the report conclusion states that when coming to the 2.9 million infection estimate, they started with information from Chinese state media, used the lowest available infection rates, and rounded down using international data that we know about now on the virus.  It's a low estimate, but the report notes, quote, Or you can believe that 1.2 million travelers from ground zero of a pandemic, some freely circulating for weeks, resulting in a national contagion of a little over 15,000 cases, which would be the number if we believe the Chinese Communist Party's numbers.  Of course, there were mixed estimates too on how many people actually left Wuhan.  Some put it at 5 million.  who left Wuhan before the lockdown happened.  Now, the Epoch Times noted that when it came to the, say, giving out of urns of families' ashes to their family members, the number of ashes given out far exceeds the number of deaths reported in Wuhan, around 40,000-ish.  I mean, even then, they were limiting the number of ashes they were giving out, so who knows how many there were.  And, of course, people were reporting... that when they got their, you know, the boxes of ashes, or however they gave it to them, that there were items in the ashes that did not belong to the family members, very likely suggesting that these, let's say, cremation facilities were not properly storing ashes, not keeping track of them because they were overloaded.  And of course, Epoch Times, we were doing interviews with a lot of these cremation facilities early on, and they said they were operating 24-7.  In fact, the Chinese Communist Party even brought in mobile incinerators that were playing an unknown role in Wuhan, allegedly destroying fabrics and things like this.  Who knows what they were being used for?  We also reported there were 21 million cell phones suddenly in China during a time normally when the number of cell phones would be rising.  Now, this doesn't mean 21 million people died per se, but that is a factor that should be considered when looking at the number of dead.  In China, you can't just get rid of your cell phone account.  Your cell phone account right now especially is tied to your health code.  If you have a red health code, you can't go out, you can't travel.  If you have a green health code, you can go out.  It's also tied to your social security number.  It's also tied to your bank account.  You cannot just get rid of it.  And in addition to this, aside from the fact that normally during this time of year, cell phones, they've been rising in China, not going down.  In addition to that, right now, children need cell phones to join online classes.  And so we would have thought that the number would go up, not down, and they've gone down.  Now, British lawmakers in other news are saying China is trying to exploit the COVID-19 or CCP virus crisis.  Now the Straight Times reports, quote, China is trying to exploit the global crisis triggered by the novel coronavirus outbreak by wrestling control of companies such as Imagination Technologies and changing the way the internet works, a senior British lawmaker said on Wednesday.  Now Imagination Technologies again fits into this broader picture of these Chinese telecom companies.  Now I mentioned before this weird child trafficking case with this top exec at ZTE.  Trump had early on restricted sale of chips to ZTE and it just about crippled the Chinese high-tech market.  He's now talking about restricting chips to Huawei.  Of course, the Chinese Communist Party has been talking about retaliation, Huawei being one of the largest telecom companies in the world.  With news of this coming out that they might restrict the sale of chips from a Taiwanese company to Huawei, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to rein in chip companies, Imagination Technologies in the UK being one of them.  Now, the article notes from The Straight Times that the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee told Sky News, quote, We're seeing quite a lot of action by the Chinese state or state-owned companies that seem to be exploiting this moment.  Now, also in the UK, Dominic Rabe, First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, has allegedly guaranteed the Chinese Communist Party that the virus outbreak will not be politicized.  Now, the Times reports, the, quote, the Foreign Secretary was also said to have, quote, fully agreed, quote, unquote, with Beijing that the source of the virus was a, quote, scientific issue that requires professional and science-based assessment.  And Sky News had a bit more on that.  They stated that the UK, quote, made promises to China over how it would refer to COVID-19.  Now, you may remember that the naming conventions for this virus are controversial.  The Chinese Communist Party has been trying to hide the origin.  The WHO came up with COVID-19 instead of the Wuhan coronavirus.  which is what a lot of media were using before that.  And it says, quote, if the UK has made such assurances, it will be seen as siding with China in a growing international row over the country's handling of the fallout of the pandemic, which began there.  And as a last story in Chile, in Latin America, the health minister announced it has been listing the dead in the country as recovered since they're, quote, no longer contagious.  And a new report from Thailand suggests that actually bodies can be contagious.  They found this isn't true, so a new study says the virus can jump from the dead to the living.
