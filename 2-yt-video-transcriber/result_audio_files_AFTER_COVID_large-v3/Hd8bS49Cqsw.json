            "text": "How you doing, Sam?  I don't answer questions.  Okay.  Alright.  Well, hold on.  Am I detained?  What's that?  Am I detained?  Yes.  Oh.  For what?  Did I break the law?  You might be.  I'm here in Wynn, Massachusetts at the National Grid.  This is also the ferry entrance.  The ferry comes in and out from here over to Boston.  As you see, there's no trespassing signs after dusk.  And no trespassing signs on the fence.  As you see over here, the sun is still up and out.  You're gonna call the police on me?  Oh no!  For heaven's sake guys.  Not one sign out here says no filming.  Not one sign says no photography.  Sun's still up.  As you can see, there's plenty of people down here.  Beautiful sight down here.  This is Nahant over here.  So you said you were going to call the police on me?  I'm just coming down here for a second to get to the video.  You see this kid's taking pictures of his vehicle.  Let's get this camera away.  You got this kid whipping around in the pipeline, yeah.  This kid taking pictures.  Sound me along, guys.  Sound me along.  How you doing, Sam?  Bro, you don't think I realize that?  You don't think I know that?  I don't give a shit.  You don't need to talk to me, bro.  You don't need to talk to me.  I'm doing everything legal.  Everything's legal.  You have no authority outside that fence, bro.  I don't need to hear it.  Are you calling the cops?  Should I wait or what?  Yeah, and it's perfectly legal.  Is there something that you're filming for?  I was just down here taking pictures over here.  And I decided to film this place because it's pretty awesome.  It's pretty big.  And he flipped out and said he's calling the cops.  I mean, is there something specific?  you're filming on NASA?  I don't want to answer any more questions.  Thank you, sir.  This guy's really triggered right here.  He's really triggered.  We got this guy sitting on the wrong side of the road out here in public.  Who's breaking the law right now, me or you?  Me or you breaking the law?  You're on the wrong side of the road right now.  Who's breaking the law right now?  He's breaking the law right now.  You don't need to tell me anything.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  Not sure what was going on with that, but it came from that number, so she would be rich.  Okay.  Are you able to locate where we're going?  I think there's many on the side, but I don't know if that's happening.  Sorry the lighting's so bad, guys.  I have to look more at the ground for the sun not to take away the lighting.  See, I go to the ground, it lights up.  It's just like a jail.  Those trees between the double fences.  I wonder if there's another entrance.  See with the sun not in the picture, the picture is so much better.  Sorry guys.  Alright, we're going to go right back here for a couple more minutes.  See if he flips out anymore.  I need to make sure he's not calling the police because I don't want to run.  No trespassing after dusk.  Sun's still out.  Thank you.  This is a federal facility.  All right, guys, we'll see if the cops come.  I don't think they are, but we will see.  The sun is shining.  All right, guys.  If they come, of course, I'm going to continue to record.  Thank you for watching.  We'll see what happens.  Think that might be me guys.  Suspicious party.  Ready?  What's going on?  Nothing.  Any particular reason you're filming down here?  That's a strange question.  Okay.  Okay.  But is there any particular reason you're filming down here?  I don't answer questions.  Okay.  All right.  Well, hold on.  Am I detained?  What's that?  Am I detained?  Yes.  Oh.  For what?  Did I break the law?  You might be, because that's... I'm not.  I'm on public property, correct?  This is no trespassing right behind you.  You want to get that on camera?  Yeah, it's on the fence.  It's on the fence.  Is this not a public parking lot?  Is this not a public parking lot?  It's a public parking lot.  Okay, thank you.  It's a city property.  Thank you.  So we have the right to trespass anyone from a city property.  Really?  Mr.  Bauman does.  You have the right to ask me to leave first, and then you can trespass me.  Yeah, but I was just wondering if there's any reason why you're filming a potential terrorist target.  I was filming down here, and I was filming this because it was down here.  Are you aware that this is a potential terrorist target?  That doesn't trump my rights, sir.  No, it doesn't trump your rights.  Exactly.  This is my First Amendment right.  And you're violating my rights by illegally detaining me right now, sir.  I'm not illegally detaining you.  Yes, you are.  Because what is the reasonable, articulate suspicion of a crime?  Yeah.  What is it?  You're taping a potential... That's not a crime.  That's not a crime.  No, I know, but we... Okay, so you're... You're detaining me illegally right now for a lawful... But are you leaving?  Yes.  Okay, you can leave.  Absolutely.  I'm going to go this way, though.  Yes, I'm going to go right over here.  As long as you're leaving.  Yeah, I'm leaving.  Yeah.  Are you going to arrest me if I don't?  Okay, awesome.  Thank you for getting that on tape.  Oh, wait, can I get your name and badge number, sir?  Officer Hilton.  Hilton?  Officer Ruggiero.  What's your badge number, please?  99.  99 Hilton?  Officer Ruggiero, 257.  257 Ruggiero.  You know your qualified immunity just fucking broke right there, right?  Yeah, after dusk there, smart guy.  Thank you.  Fucking asshole.  No trespassing after dusk.  Does it look like it's dusk?  Does it look like it's dusk?  No trespassing.  Car 25.  I only walked back onto the property to prove a point.  Not quite sure yet.  Roger, section old.  Cut that out on camera, huh?  Thank you. ",
