            "text": "Hello, Pastor Dana Coverstone, Living Word Ministries, Assembly Guide in Berksville, Kentucky.  Finishing up the book of Hebrews today, going to be in Hebrews chapter 13, verses 18-25.  Just to kind of review, the very first chapter of Hebrews, the author tells us that Jesus is the exact radiance of the Father's glory.  If we've seen Jesus, we've seen the Father.  In chapter 2, it begins to talk about that we should never not neglect so great a salvation.  Seven different times the author of Hebrews warns this congregation, the people he's writing to, that they need to stay faithful, stay on top of things, keep watching, keep living.  And especially one major point, leaving behind the elementary principles of the Word and leaving the milk and going on to the meat.  So one of the whole purposes of this epistle that is written by someone we're not for sure who it is, I do believe it was Apollos, myself.  I do not believe it was Paul based on the fact that Paul knew what the Word said, where it was found.  I knew the author was Isaiah or whatever.  But the author of Hebrews, several places, says that somewhere it says this or that for the Old Testament.  So it's very hard for me to believe that Paul wrote that.  The Greek, I do know Greek and have said it for many years, the Greek does not line up with that of Paul's either.  There are some places that are similar, but for the most part, it is not.  But nonetheless, let's read the verses 18-25.  Now, the God of peace... who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord, equip you in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.  But I urge you, brothers, bear with this word of exhortation.  Bear with this word of exhortation.  For I have written to you briefly.  Take notice of our brother.  Timothy has been released.  So the first thing he talks about is now the God of peace who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep.  See, the resurrected shepherd confirms this eternal covenant we have with God, and it doubly equips us to accomplish His will.  The reason that Paul wrote any letter, whether to the Corinthians or to the Ephesians, the Philippians, the Colossians, the Galatians, the letters to Timothy or Titus or to Philemon, he wrote these letters as a way to encourage us to know something, to learn something, to change something, to shift something.  Here he reminds the people he's writing to that the resurrected shepherd confirms that covenant.  And because He rose from the dead on the third day, we have access to the throne and now have help in the walk that we live for Christ.  The God of peace also equips you to do what you were created to do where you are in life.  You know, as we're in this coronavirus situation, major lockdowns, not having church like we normally do, I'm doing a lot of counseling with people who are frustrated and aggravated because of schedules and routines that are no longer being part of their daily routine or schedule.  And so people are getting kind of mixed emotions.  We're seeing suicide increase in several states, even Tennessee just south of where we are.  We're 12 miles north of the Tennessee line.  Tennessee has had a huge spike in suicides.  People are home.  They've lost their jobs.  The economy is hard.  A lot of folks have no idea what they're going back to.  I was watching our governor's speech just a few moments ago here in Kentucky.  And, you know, we'll be going back to work.  But he did make the statement that those who are vulnerable and have pre-existing conditions that may lend themselves towards difficulty, you may have to stay at home and work longer.  Well, what happens if that person's job has to be done there?  So we're setting ourselves up for people who are going to be worried, concerned, and depressed over the new work environment, the new home that we have, the new kind of lifestyle that we have.  But he says the God of peace.  The God of peace.  Now the God of peace.  Not in the future.  Now.  Right now.  Not ten years ago.  In other words, you can seek his face right now and just like that he's there.  And he'll give you the peace that passes all understanding.  That Peter talked about.  And fulfilling the purposes that God has for us.  It pleases the Father and it pleases the Great Shepherd.  We obey the Father.  Obedience is the seed of faith.  And when we begin to obey Him and live our lives for Him, it makes a difference in how we are, how we live, and who we are in that regards.  But then he goes on to say this, Bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.  The writer says, look, please pay attention to what I said and what I wrote, because I took time out of my day, out of my life, And I briefly, I spent a brief amount of time writing to you and encouraging you to do certain things.  And he basically is saying, pay attention to what you have heard.  And once again, we go back to the warnings that this writer says.  And this is the very last one.  Bear with this word of exhortation.  To exhort somebody means to encourage them to do the right things.  Go the long way.  Do the hard thing.  But to do it with the best intentions and the right will.  Do you understand me?  So pay attention to what you've heard.  What every Bible writer recorded and wrote was what the Holy Spirit spoke to them.  They pinned it down.  They wrote it down.  And they want you to live out what they encourage you to live out.  So assess your life daily.  Ask yourself who you are, where you are, what you're doing.  I put something on Facebook this week.  I was really disappointed in the number.  I only had three people that responded.  But my question basically was, okay, how has the lockdown affected you?  What's it done to your spiritual life?  How has your time in the Word?  How has your time in prayer?  How has it impacted your routine?  And most of us who aren't doing as much as we used to do should have had a whole lot more time to explain what that is.  But nonetheless, we are to strive to please God in all that we do and all that we say and how we live.  That matters.  He was on the same base.  Know the people you serve Christ with.  Pray for them.  Support them.  Help them in their walk.  We find at the end that the letter was written from Italy.  Even though it was written from Italy over 2,000 years ago, we can know right now that that same word that came to those people that he was writing to can apply to my life.  The way we interpret the Bible is.  we say, okay, what did this mean for those people in that day and age right there and right then?  And then we apply the principles of that Scripture to where we are today in our world.  And some Scriptures are a lot easier to do that with than others.  But the point was, the Word was given as an exhortation to encourage us to live in the right way and have the right manner of living.  in that suggestion, more than a suggestion.  So we're supposed to make the Word be seen in our lives while we're doing it, every single day.  We're supposed to be living it out, fulfilling it, before we watch it in the world.  And once again, the writer of Hebrews gave several warnings.  He said, do not neglect so great a salvation.  He warned the Hebrews to stop chasing childish dreams.  He said, get away from the childish things.  Stop drinking the milk and start eating the meat.  Give your jaws some action by chewing on something that actually causes you to work at it.  work at it.  And that's what this writer wants us to understand.  As we end this book, he is literally saying, folks, it's time to grow up.  It's time to become something more in Christ than we ever were before.  And I believe where we are in history and culture and time in America right now is this.  We are an incredible nation.  A very, very independent nation.  We are several hundred years old.  We have an incredible Democratic Republic, basically.  We're a democracy.  We have a Bill of Rights.  We have a Constitution, a Declaration of Independence.  We basically fled from England because they started coming down and pushing the thumb and the boot down on the backs of our American fathers in this country.  When they did that, they set themselves out as being very, very different, distinct, and unique from every other country on this planet.  I can carry a gun.  I've got the right to assemble.  I can petition my government.  Why?  Because we have a Bill of Rights.  No religion can be endorsed, but we have the freedom of religion.  I'm free to believe whatever I want to believe, no matter how crazy, stupid, or exceptionally way off it is, or very solid.  I can make that choice.  And if anything else in our time that probably gets at the heart of those that are globalists who want democracy gone is the conservative values that we have in this country.  Think about it.  How easy would it be for the globalist agenda to just happen like that if we weren't here?  So if they can get America out of the way, if they can get the American dollar gone as the currency standard, the reserve standard for currency in their countries, they've accomplished something.  If the world at large, which complies mostly of socialists, communistic and undemocratic, non-conservative, hostile towards all sorts of various people groups, those are the governments that represent the majority of what's outside of our country.  Although, yes, we have our fair share of those things in our own government.  We are still a government by the people, for the people.  Because it's we, the people, endowed by our Creator with certain and amenable rights.  We are unique and different.  At this time in American history, I see that as a major, major identifying point of who we are.  And why eventually the Antichrist will have to get us out of the way.  Because, democratic values A bill of rights will have no place in an anti-Christ world.  That's where we are.  And so if we ever need to adopt the principles of Hebrews for our own today, for any time in history, it is today.  That we live it, and we breathe it, and we do it every single day.  So keep living it, folks.  Take the words of this letter written to the Hebrews by whom we know not exactly.  But we can take their words, we can take their warnings, we can take their promises, and we can stand on them.  Let me pray with you.  Father, help us today to recognize who you are.  See you in a greater way than we've ever seen you before.  And especially, Jesus, in our day and age.  Right now.  Help us to be vibrant and real and live and relevant.  Help us to truly, truly be everything that you need us to be.  Because the kingdom is at hand.  And the gospel needs to be preached and lived out in front of a dying and watching world.  So Jesus, use those that are listening and help us to be an end times church that glorifies you with everything we say, everything we do, even how we act.  When we get back to church, when we get back to normal things, Lord help us.  And I pray this in Jesus' name.  This next Sunday on Sunday morning service, my son Michael will be preaching.  And then I will be starting a series going to the book of Lamentations.  which will be very, very timely in regards to what we're doing here.  So Wednesday nights I'm talking about dreams, and we'd love to have you checking in with that as well on Facebook.  So God bless.  Thanks for stopping by. ",
