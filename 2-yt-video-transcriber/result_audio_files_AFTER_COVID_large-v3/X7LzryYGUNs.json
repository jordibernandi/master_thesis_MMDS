            "text": "Senator from Kentucky.  I wrote a speech for today.  I was planning to say that I fear the chaos of establishing a precedent that Congress can overturn elections.  Boy, was I right.  Chaos, anarchy.  The violence today was wrong and un-American.  The vote we are about to cast is incredibly important.  Now more than ever, the question is, should Congress override the certified results from the states and nullify the states' rights to conduct elections?  The vote today is not a protest.  The vote today is literally to overturn elections.  We've been told that this is a protest or this is about an electoral commission.  No, it's not.  It's about whether to seat the electors that have been certified by a state.  It's not about an electoral commission.  It's not about a protest.  You can go outside if you want to protest.  This is about overturning a state-certified election.  If you vote to overturn these elections, wouldn't it be the opposite of what states' rights Republicans have always advocated for?  This would doom the Electoral College forever.  It was never intended by our founders that Congress have the power to overturn state-certified elections.  My oath to the Constitution doesn't allow me to disobey the law.  I can't vote to overturn the verdict of states.  Such a vote would be to overturn everything held dear by those of us who support the rights of states in this great system of federalism that was bequeathed to us by our founders.  The Electoral College was created to devolve the power of selecting presidential electors to the states.  The Electoral College is without question an inseparable friend to those who believe that every American across our vast country deserves to be heard.  If Congress were to give the power to overturn the state's election, what terrible chaos would ensue every four years?  Imagine the furor against the Electoral College if Congress becomes a forum to overturn states' Electoral College slates.  It's one thing to be angry.  It's another to focus one's anger in constructive ways.  That hasn't happened today, to say the least.  We simply cannot destroy the Constitution, our laws, and the Electoral College in the process.  I hope as the nation's anger cools, we can channel that energy into essential electoral reforms at the state level.  America's admired around the world for our free elections.  We must, we absolutely must fix this mess and restore confidence and integrity to our elections.  We must. ",
