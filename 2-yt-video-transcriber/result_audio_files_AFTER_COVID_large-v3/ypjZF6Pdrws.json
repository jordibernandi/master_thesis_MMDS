            "text": "But there's something almost paradoxical about this microwave background.  It's telling us that there was something like the Big Bang there.  But it's also telling us, because the observations of the microwave background, you can plot the frequency, you can plot the intensity against each frequency, and you find this wonderful curve.  It's the the Planck curve, black body spectrum.  And it agrees with that to an extraordinary precision, much better than you could produce in the lab.  And this is telling us that the very early universe must have been in what's called thermal equilibrium.  Now thermal equilibrium by definition, is the maximum random state.  It's the state that the second law tells us we're going to get in the future, if you like.  But there it is in the past.  So why is it that the very special state that has to have been there at the beginning, otherwise we don't have a second law.  The second law of thermodynamics tells us things get more and more random.  And that tells us you go back in time, things get less and less random.  So it must be very, very special in the initial state.  But what we find is that the matter, what we're seeing in this radiation is radiation that's light.  And that's been in equilibrium with matter.  So that's what you're looking at.  And that's at this maximum random state, maximum entropy state, we say.  Something special about that was in the gravity.  What you're not looking at is gravity.  And the thing is that the universe was very, very uniform in the early days.  And we think of uniform as, OK, consistent with being random, if you like.  But that's not true when gravity is apparent.  principal ingredient because it tends to clump things together.  the Sun is out there for instance because it's clumped together out of a previously uniform distribution of Gas and that Sun gets hot.  the background sky is cold the Sun is hot and it's the difference between the hot Sun and the skull cold sky that we live off and that's why we're all.  life comes from that.  so it's it's that's the key thing.  and Now, so the universe was very special, but it was very special only in the gravity.  Somehow gravity wasn't thermalized with everything else.  And that's something which needs to be explained.  To me, it's the greatest puzzle about the Big Bang.  Now, I don't see most of these theories making any attempt to answer that question.  Certainly, the inflationary model doesn't.  It only, in a certain sense, makes things worse.  The argument is that it smooths out the universe and things like this.  But it doesn't do that unless you're already special or even more special in the early stages.  So if you follow the argument through, you see that it really doesn't explain this initial specialness.  And it can't.  because it's all consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, which says things get more and more random.  So how can you have got more and more special in the early stages?  There has to be something else.  Now, for a long time, if anybody had asked me what happened before the Big Bang, I would have given the conventional answer, which is, The Big Bang was this singular state when all our equations go haywire and time and space doesn't make any sense.  Even the question before doesn't mean anything, you see.  So that's the conventional answer.  You say, you can't talk about it.  It's just a meaningless question. ",

            "text": "There is no before.  Now, I now have changed my mind.  I'm not sure it's fair to say I've changed my mind, but I have another idea which I'm pursuing, which I think has a reasonable chance of being right.  And this depends upon how you characterize the initial state of the universe.  So what I'm saying is that the gravity was special.  Everything else seems to have been as random as it could be.  Now, can you characterize that in some geometrical way?  A colleague of mine, Paul Todd, who is at the Maths Institute here in Oxford, has had a particular way of characterizing this.  And I've worried about this for a long time.  And I've formulated a thing I call the vile curvature hypothesis.  Let's not worry about what that means.  But it's something about the particular type of spacetime curvature that could have been present in the early universe.  Now, my colleague, Paul, has a way of phrasing that in a nice geometrical way, which is to say that you could extend the universe to before the Big Bang.  Now, this is just a mathematical statement.  You're not saying you believe any physics here.  It's saying this mathematical statement.  You can extend it before to as long as you're somehow allowed to stretch the universe out.  So I think that's the best way of explaining this.  I think there are some nice pictures that Escher has of a universe of angels and devils, and they're all within this circular boundary.  And at the edge, you see, that's infinity.  And the whole universe is squashed into this disk.  Now, if you forget about the size of those angels and devils and just worry about shapes, then it doesn't matter how big they are.  The little ones at the edge are the same sort of shape as the ones in the middle.  But But if you are prepared to stretch and squash in a uniform way, okay, then you could stretch that boundary out to infinity, or you could squash it back to this finite boundary.  Now, there is a universe, and the universe in this picture goes, stops at the edge, that's infinity.  But you could imagine extending it to the other side and preserving this kind of geometry.  It's called conformal geometry, that's a mathematical term.  which means that, okay, you know about shapes, small shapes, but you don't know about sizes.  So small and big count as the same, but different angles count as different, or different small shapes count as different.  So if you don't mind stretching or squashing, then you could step outside this universe to another side to it.  So I want you to imagine the same thing here, that you've got the Big Bang, which is somehow stretched out to be a, surface, as though that's a one-time surface, but you could go before it.  Now, this mathematical trick is, I'm not saying this is real, I'm just saying it's a mathematical trick.  This mathematical trick, if you phrase the condition on your universe in this way, you say you could extend to before, then that is a way of characterizing the initial state of the universe.  The universe seems to be like that.  It seems to be that the gravitational degrees of freedom are killed off, which is what this picture is expressing.  It's hard to say this without being sort of technical, but I hope this sort of idea gets across.  Okay, now that's one side of the picture.  And if you like, the physical justification for this is that in the very early universe, the temperature was so high.  The energies of particles were so high that it didn't matter a hoot what their masses were.  See, mass is what you use if you want to build a clock.  There are two fundamental equations in physics that I'm referring to here.  One is the famous Planck law, which tells you energy equals E equals h nu.  So the energy is proportional to frequency.  is the famous Einstein, even more famous Einstein equation, E equals MC squared, which tells you that energy is proportional to mass.  So if you put those two together, it says mass and frequency are basically the same thing.  So that means that there is a clock, which is the frequency, is a measure of mass.  Now if you don't have any mass, or if mass becomes irrelevant, you can't build a clock.  So in the early universe, the universe didn't know how to keep time, you see.  It just lost track of how fast things were going, you see.  And if you take that seriously, you can imagine going to before it.  Now, it's a difficult idea to grasp, but it's mathematical.  It makes mathematical sense, but it's hard to sort of think.  this is real physics, you see.  But okay, that's one side of it.  Now, the other side... Just think of the very remote future.  What do we expect in the very remote future? ",

But still, we don't know why it should be there, if you like.  But in this picture, you need it.  So I want to say, what's the remote future in this picture?  Well, the universe expands.  It exponentially expands.  And OK, there's black holes lying around, which have got lots of mass in them.  According to Stephen Hawking, these things will, in a very remote future, the universe will cool down to lower than the temperature of any given black hole, even huge ones which have a very low temperature.  Even huge ones which have a very low temperature, and they will evaporate away, get smaller and smaller and smaller, and eventually go off with a pop.  Now I'm accepting that.  I think that's probably right, although there's some conjectural aspects to this.  and eventually all the matter in the universe will disappear apart from radiation. ",

Now, how do you talk about the very remote future?  In fact... The picture I'm trying to describe is a sort of result of my worrying about how boring the universe is.  It's going to get pretty boring, you see.  And I can't think of anything more boring than waiting around for a black hole finally to disappear.  It sounds incredibly boring.  But then I thought, well, who's there to be bored?  Not us, you see.  The only things around will be these photons and things, and it's pretty hard to bore a photon.  A photon doesn't experience any passage of time.  So eternity... Eternity is no big deal to a photon.  It just, whoop, there it is, you see.  And this is, there's a sort of mathematical trick, another mathematical trick, which I've certainly been involved with for a long time.  How do you talk about infinity in relativity, in Einstein's theory, in Einstein's general relativity?  How do you talk about infinity?  Well, you'd use the same conformal trick.  But now, instead of stretching out, which is what I did for the Big Bang before, I'm squashing it down.  So I'm saying that in the remote future, there's nothing left which has any mass.  If that's the case, somehow the universe doesn't know how to keep time in the remote future.  It doesn't know how big it is, you see.  So the universe forgets how big it is, it says.  And it might as well be a small new universe.  So the picture, okay, it's crazy. ",

How would you ever know whether there was a previous universe, you see?  But it's not so hopeless.  The first point is... that I mentioned inflation.  Inflationary universe is that in the early stages, there was this exponential expansion.  But in this model, the exponential expansion took place in the very remote future.  And that is quite consistent with our present day view.  Universe will expand exponentially.  And so you will get same features that you get with inflation, but without inflation.  And so then the idea is that that exponentially expanding universe forgets how big it is, and it becomes the big bang of the next scale.  Now, how do you observe, as I say, is the observation apart from agreeing with the, well, there are these things called scale invariance, which is one of the observational supports for inflation.  So I'm saying that that will... I think, will carry over to this particular model.  Now, the other thing is that there will actually be a little bit of disturbances which will come about from, I'll say there'll be in the remote future lots of black holes before they finally disappear with POPs.  They'll be around for a long time.
