In 2012, Dolly, the Evenflo engineer, urged the company to stop selling booster seats for children weighing less than 40 pounds.  But the company's marketing department resisted the change.  And Evenflo made a corporate decision not to increase the weight recommendation.  Evenflo's attorney said the company wanted to make the seat available to kids who were too tall for harness seats, but not yet 40 pounds.  Evenflo said it increased the weight requirement to 40 pounds on some of its booster seats, but their labels are inconsistent.  We ordered these three in January 2020.  Two of them are labeled as safe for 30-pound children, but this one is labeled as safe only for children who are at least 40 pounds.
