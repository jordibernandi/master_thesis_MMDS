We are going to topple the patriarchy, and what is the patriarchy?  Jeff Goldstein.  Jeff Goldstein, who's fucking my ex-wife, correct.  We're going to dismantle capitalism.  And what is capitalism?  Any hedge fund that's bigger than yours.  Any hedge fund bigger than mine, correct.  I have heard that certain people at the IRS are transphobic.  What we're gonna have to do is get in there and let them know that this is unacceptable behavior.  The IRS or the cops too.  You will all have a mini child's golf club for self-defense.  We will train on a plush giraffe that I bought for my daughter before my wife won custody of her.  You're trying to fuck my ex-wife?  Is that what you're doing?  You're trying to destroy a family?  You will train day and night on the giraffe until you are ready for hand-to-hand combat.  My commitment to social justice is unparalleled.  I don't care what I have to do.  Everybody that doesn't have a club has a pool noodle because you cannot handle the clubs yet.  You will graduate to club.  Now remember, you don't work for George Soros anymore.  You work for me. ",
