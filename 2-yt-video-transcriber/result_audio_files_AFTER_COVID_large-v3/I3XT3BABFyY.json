Now, take a step back and look at the big picture.  What's changed in between the two events?  Before I carry on, I want to make it clear that it goes without saying, the death of George Floyd was a tragedy.  We all know that many police forces are corrupt.  But I want you to know that what is happening now is a trap and we are all being duped again.  It is easy to get carried away with sentiment.  I am all up for protesting, holding the police accountable and ending any systemic racism or abuse of power.  But we must be alert to their tactics.  The biggest giveaway is the media.  Watch the media.  It works exactly like a magic trick does.  It's all about misdirection.  The media's job is to get your attention and divert it from what is really happening.  And what is the media doing now?  They completely change their rhetoric from stay home or we will all die to.  now is the time to protest or never in a matter of two weeks.  Look at the recent tweet from the United Nations.  Again, a big change from two weeks ago.  There is also the shaming campaign going around on social media for anyone that chooses not to participate or have an opinion and labelling them as a racist.  These are just examples of how the media arm helps with creating the new narrative of fear and chaos.  That brings me to the second part, which is the action and the streets part.  There are a number of organisations that are working on the new narrative.  They hijacked peaceful protests and preyed on the public's emotions, and especially the youth of today who are already feeling disfranchised and angry.  One of the most notorious provocateurs right now is Antifa, an allegedly anti-fascist movement that is known for their violent and ironically fascist tactics.  The organisation has been infiltrated by journalists previously and exposed for their highly organised violence.  In the recent riots there has been a lot of footage showing Antifa members being confronted by the public when looting and damaging property. ",

She got in her car to leave, and she was killed by a stray bullet, shot dead.  Jose Gutierrez was a bystander.  He was watching as others looted the Chicago suburb of Cicero.  For being there, he was shot in the head and killed by this man, Zion Haygood.  That's what police say.  Another victim in Cicero, Illinois was Victor Cesares Jr.  He was 27.

Remember this is a long term plan and we are all in the early phases.  We don't think they will give up this easily, do you?  The road is long, so let's all remain vigilant and united.
