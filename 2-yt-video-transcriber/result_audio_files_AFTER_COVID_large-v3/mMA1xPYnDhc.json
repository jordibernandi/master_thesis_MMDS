            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is that she's never worth chasing.  reappeal dosage short videos right to the point now after three calls man.  If she doesn't show high interest after I give her three calls, man, then I'm gone.  If she isn't showing high interest right off the back, odds are that she will never have high interest again.  There are subpar fee fails out here waiting to be chased, waiting to be courted.  Most of my.  I don't want to call them failures.  I'll say waste of time with the fee.  fail has been because I refuse to court.  I don't date.  I recreate.  Right.  But what I mean by chase is that she wants to do all the calling, all the texting.  Start all the conversations, take her out for a day, show her a good time, impress her, sweep her off her feet and all of these things.  And I've encountered such an expectation from fee fails that were 30, 40 and even 50 plus who felt that I should be pursuing and wooing.  And I refuse to do such a thing when you chase her, which I don't.  But when you chase her and she shows you very little interest anyway.  And you're showing her a whole lot of interest.  This immediately and automatically shows for she knows that in her mind that she's the prize and you're showing her that she's the prize in your eyes as well, which automatically now lowers your value.  In her mind and what she wants is to deal with the guy in whom she sees his value as high.  Sometimes if she's interested, she'll play a game just to see if you will chase.  But don't worry, because if she is into you, ignoring her will make her want to chase you.  But that's only if her interest is already high in you.  You only got so much time and so much energy in this lifetime.  So do not waste it on a fee.  fail that does not start off with high interest.  Because most likely, if her interest is low, it will stay that way.  While you're trying to pursue one, you're letting others get away.  But I don't say that you pursue anyway.  But your attention spent on this one is less time and attention on another.  When you deal with a fee fail, it should be smooth and easy.  an easy transition most of the time from the number to her phone to the bedroom make the seduction quick no more than a few weeks.  if nothing happens in a few weeks get out of there.  you're doing this thing most times with speed because you don't want to waste your time and energy which is too precious and too valuable.  so hurry up.  i didn't say be thirsty.  I'm just saying that she's not worth your time and patience in most cases.  And I'm saying this because I'm being nice on the tube.  But never allow a fee.  fail to waste your time because it's worse than wasting your money.  You hear me?  For me, I refuse to sit through a movie that I don't even find entertaining just for a shot at the V. You should also be refusing any type of courtship with the average fee.  fail who is definitely not worth entertaining and spending large amounts of time with.  that doesn't involve the bedrooms.  Realize that she doesn't offer anything of real value unless she's exceptional.  And we don't argue for the exception here.  So make your seductions quick.  A couple of conversations on the phone, a couple of face-to-face meetings, then it should be on, man.  If she's looking to be whined and dying and dated and courted, walk away.  Because rest assured that all the other guys that she's monkey danced with did not have to do such things.  So why should you?  Do what others did not have to do to get the same vag that they got, especially knowing that her body count is high.  I don't care if you talk to 100 fee fails in a month to sort out just one that has high interest.  That's way better than chasing one or two who really have no interest in you because she is not worth chasing.  One thing that I know, man, for sure, one thing that I know for sure, as sure as the day is long, as sure as water is wet, is that if she likes you, she's going to make herself more than available for you no matter what.  For the D that she wants, there is no distance far enough.  There is no price too high.  There's nothing that she wouldn't sacrifice for the D that she actually wants and likes.  How many of you guys have dealt with fee fails who live eight, 10, 16 hours away from you, but she made it a point to come see you whether by car or by plane.  And yes, many fee fails have got on the plane for the D because quite a few has done so for me.  Understand that if she likes you, your distance is not a problem.  She'll swim your way if she has high interest, if need be.  Trust and believe that.  So in closing, when she has high interest, you don't have to chase her.  You don't have to guess about her interest in you.  She makes herself readily available for you.  If you're not getting immediate cooperation, then you probably won't ever get the cooperation.  So then it's time to bail right away and then on to the next one.  If you give her a call and she doesn't return your call to text the first time, then maybe after the second time and definitely by the third, never call or text her again on to the next one.  Preserve your time and energy because it's valuable.  No fee failed is worth the chase.  It's like being on a hamster wheel, spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning, but going nowhere.
