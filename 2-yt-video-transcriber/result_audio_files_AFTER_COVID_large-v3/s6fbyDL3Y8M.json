I don't care what the conclusion is.  I'm not gonna try to explain it away.  I'm not gonna tell you that when it says black it really means white or when it says swarthy it really means dark white people.  you know the ridiculous stuff you guys have probably heard from the other side over there.  you're not gonna get any of that.  the information leads where it leads.  if he saws white he saws white.  if he saws black he saws black.  if the Arab the Arab wherever the information leads is where this book is going to end.  so again it is available for pre-order on Amazon Kindle only right now.  the Kindle version is the only version available for pre-order right now but there will be a paperback version.  I promise you that it will either be released on November 15th which is my birthday or it might actually get released a couple days early depending.  but anyway go check that out.  pre-order your copy you will see.  you'll probably see like little updates and stuff like that as I as I update the book.  anyway you'll see that.  So now let's get into Nefertiti's false claim.  Now, shout out to Tao Ministries, Pastor Kelly and Pastor Majors again.  And a shout out to Sister E for hosting them on her platform.  Now, Tao Ministries pointed this out already.  So I'm not going to keep you guys long.  I'm just going to hit the main points on this because there's one bigger point that I want to get to at the end.  So Nefertiti made the claim that the entry in the Zondervan Bible dictionary that says the Negro is not from Ham is because of this book, The Negro, a Beast in the Image of God.  Now, this book was published in 1900.  The author was Charles R. Carroll.  publisher.  the original publisher was american book and bible house.  the new publisher.  in 1969 they did a reprint.  i think that's nem nemocene publishing company.  so those are the publishers of this book.  i'm not sure if teo um or pastor kelly or pastor majors mentioned the publisher of this book.  now nephronity has made the claim that zondervan goes by the ideology of this book.  so tail ministries pointed out that Zondervan compact Bible dictionary was published in 1967 and it was published by Zondervan academic specifically.  now Zondervan's parent company from what I saw is Harper Collins Christian publishing.  The question I have is what is the link between these two?  Does Nefertiti offer a clear, undeniable link between these two and that the passage or that the entry in Zondervan's compact Bible dictionary is based on the ideology found in the book, The Negro, A Beast?  She didn't answer that.  But here's what's more important.  And this is why I'm not going to keep you guys too long.  It's simple to get an answer for that.  So here's what we need to do.  We need to contact Zondervan Publishing.  Here is the information to contact Zondervan academics specifically.  The contact person is Amy Bigler.  The phone number is 616-698-3514.  Her email address is amy.bigler, B-I-G-L-E-R, at harpercollins.com.  now this information is freely available on Zondervan's website so I'm not giving out this woman's personal information or anything like that.  this is on Zondervan's public website and this is for contacting them in their different departments.  so all of us out here that know about Nefertiti's video.  we need to contact Zondervan academic and ask them their entry in their Bible dictionary based on the racist ideology of the Negro a beast.  this is a simple contact question.  get an answer and the more of us that contact them the more likely we are to get an answer.  because see now Nefertiti has dragged a major Christian publishing company into her lies.  she has no proof that zondervan in 1967 as tayo pointed out during the civil rights movement.  she has no proof that zondervan was using the ideology found in the negro a beast.  But in addition to contacting Zondervan Academic, once again, for those listening, the contact person is Amy Bigler, B-I-G-L-E-R.  Her number is 616-698-3514.  Her email address is amy.bigler, B-I-G-L-E-R, at HarperCollins.com.  She's with Zondervan Academic.  Contact her and ask her if the entry in their Bible dictionary is based on that 1900 book.  The Negro, a beast.  Ask them if that is their racist ideology in their current viewpoint, because the book is still being published.  And if not, let them know that Nefertiti and some of her people are sharing this and pushing this narrative in order to defame their company, because that's what it is.  It's a defamation or a slander issue.  Nefertiti is not telling the truth and if Zondervan says yes we do believe that ideology that becomes a multi-million dollar media problem for them for a company in 2020 to still say that they believe the ideology of the Negro a beast published in 1900. so it's gonna come down to either Zondervan admits to being a racist company they take millions of dollars in losses possible lawsuits as well possible or they say no that's not true and nephronity loses all credibility.  i keep telling you guys she was a liar and she runs her mouth way too much without doing the proper research and this woman is a lawyer.  i feel sorry for anybody who is represented by this woman in court.  i don't even know what type of lawyer she is but i feel sorry for the person represented by this woman in court.  So please contact Zondervan.  Now, in addition to Zondervan, we also need to be contacting HarperCollins, the parent company.  Now, again, this isn't just a Zondervan issue because if HarperCollins is the parent company, that means that Neffernity is out here trying to slander their company as well, HarperCollins.  And so the contact information for HarperCollins Receptionist is 212-207-7000.  Again, 212-207-7000.  You can write to HarperCollins.  Their address.  This is for the people that are listening.  For those of you who are watching the video or if you plan to go to the description after the video, all of this information will be in the description as well.  So their address, if you want to write them.  HarperCollins Publishers, 195 Broadway, New York, New York, 10007.  Again, HarperCollins Publishers, 195 Broadway, New York, New York, 10007.  They also have an email contact for general inquiries.  Orders at HarperCollins.com.  Let's see.  There are some other email addresses here for questions about books.  Yeah, the author.  That's that's the general inquiry email.  If you guys want to try some of the other emails, feel free to do so.  But again, we all need to contact Harper Collins and Zondervan Academic.  because nephronity and those that are with her out here slandering that company pushing this narrative as if she has some concrete connection between the two and she does not understand this that the more the urban apologists community tries to fight the awakening the more they fight these facts the bigger the hole they dig for themselves.  they have backed themselves into a corner because Harper Collins and Zondervan now have to either agree with Nefertiti that they are racist or they say no we're not racist and that woman is lying.  we we have an idea of which one they're probably going to do and understand Nefertiti's credibility after this is going to be done.  vocab Malone's credibility after this is going to be done because he keeps sharing stuff from this false teaching woman.  she is a false teacher and vocab Malone insists on sharing her false teaching.  you guys saw the video he reposted.  after she got more dislikes than likes on her video after she got called a liar multiple times with time stamps by people from all different points and walks of life This woman was called a liar over and over and over again.  So what does vocab do?  He renames the videos and repost them on his channel.  They're doubling down on losses because they are desperate at this point.  So they're going to have to take this L that's coming from Zondervan.  They got to take this L that's coming from HarperCollins.  All of y'all, as many of y'all as possible, contact Zondervan and HarperCollins.  Let them know that Nefertiti is putting out this information and trying to slander their company, trying to defame their company.  Give them the links to her YouTube page.  Give them the links to her Facebook, her Instagram, her Twitter and everything else so that her so that their lawyers can reach out to her.  because what she's doing is lying not only on Israel, but she's lying on these major respected Christian publishers.  And I guarantee you they're not going to overlook it.  I guarantee you she keeps running her mouth and pushing this false narrative that they are going to take action against her.  So, again, as many of you as possible, go ahead and contact Zondervan.  Go ahead and contact Harper Collins as many times as we need to until we get an answer.  And if you do get an answer, please share that with me.  Post the link in the description or contact me on Facebook Messenger and I will get back to you as soon as possible.  so if you haven't done so already please click the thumbs up.  if you've already clicked the thumbs up please subscribe because there's a lot more coming.  Eric Mason has something coming too.  I ain't forgot about Eric Mason but yeah go ahead click the subscribe button.  if you're already subscribed go ahead and click the notification bell to make sure you don't miss anything.  that's coming very very soon.  so anyway with that said until next time I'm out.
