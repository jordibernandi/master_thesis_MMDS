Yes, but let's not get into that.  Do I have complicated feelings about Bethel's Wake Up Olive campaign in 2019?  which brought Bethel nationwide attention for praying for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.  Yes, but let's not get into that.  Do I have a problem with Chris Vallotton's ignorant misrepresentation of LGBTQ people? ",

I consider myself a patriotic American and a Christian above all.  But being both, I refuse to idol worship political leaders, which we've seen happening all across American churches.  And I do think the law matters, especially when it comes to protecting the marginalized.  But now some of our most prominent religious leaders have their hands all over politics while being wealthy and powerful as hell.  And before we begin, let me be clear.  I'm not opposed to religious leaders praying for political leaders or even being close to or friends with them.  However, the churches I'm about to show you are blatantly using faith and spiritual manipulation to coax their congregations to vote a particular way.

            "text": "So let's dive in on two points.  One, Bethel Church, please correct me if I'm wrong and I will issue a retraction, but according to my research, Bethel is a 501c3.  meaning they are automatically considered tax-exempt.  According to an article by Annalise Pierce, a graduate of Bethel's ministry school, who received comment from Bethel Church communications director Aaron Tesoro, in fiscal year 2017-2018, Bethel church reported almost $60.8 million in overall income.  Bethel church communications director, Aaron Tesoro clarified that the church pays sales tax on all product sales, but sales service and royalty income reported by the church does not include royalties.  from the many books written by Bethel leaders or the fees paid for these leaders speaking engagements around the country and the world quote, this income goes directly to individuals or their personal nonprofits.  and the amounts are not reflected in Bethel Church's  numbers.\".  I, of course, would be curious to see where all these millions of dollars go.  The pastoral staff has often been accused of driving high-end sports cars and living lavishly, while the church itself claims its missions and finances are above reproach.  However, the IRS explicitly states that a tax exempt church may not be an action organization, i.e.  it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities, and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.  Meanwhile, the leadership at Bethel flagrantly promotes Trump, which from my understanding should immediately disqualify their tax exempt status.  Which brings us to number two, spiritual manipulation.  There are few things that upset me more as a Christian than to watch pastors impose their personal opinions to manipulate and force their congregation to behave or vote a certain way.  Watch even here as Benny Johnson, senior leader of Bethel, condescends a town requiring masks in the midst of our global pandemic while her daughter claims to have a medical condition.  So we're standing in the line to get our food outside.  No mask on.  Like 12 feet away from people. ",

Quote, school co-founder Chris Vallotton addressed the spike in cases among students and staff in a Facebook video.  He mentioned Johnson's video and said she was speaking for herself, not for Bethel church or the school.  Vallotton said masks are the law.  And also we personally believe it's more than law.  It's about love.  So Bethel's Chris Vallotton is comparing wearing a mask to an act of love while Bethel's boy, Sean Foyt is out there saying something completely different.

I am really not.  Truth is, Sean Foyt is receiving international fame for leading unmasked crammed together worship services in cities across America during a pandemic.  And I am devastated to say my girl Lauren Daigle showed up in New Orleans and say what you will about Sean's intentions.  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume he didn't believe coronavirus was real.  But this post says otherwise.  For all the pro-life rhetoric Sean claims, he wrote, quote, don't let a virus with 99% recovery rate hold you back from bringing Jesus to people that need, desperately need him.  So what of the 242,000 deceased Americans?  There is so much more I could say about this and none of it would be nice.  And I really just want to stop with all of this division and hate, a lot of which is being perpetuated by divisive attitudes and actions by people and churches like this.  My closing thoughts are, why are you as pastors and worship leaders choosing to be divisive and political?  Sean Foyt, are you trying to gain fame and clout in a nation where many poor and marginalized people don't have access to healthcare, healthcare that could save them from coronavirus?  Benny, too, you are looking mean and angry, actually reveling and blocking and deleting people of opposing views. ",

And I beg you to learn more about LGBTQ plus people so you stop misrepresenting them.  And lastly, I want to leave us with a Bible verse because Jesus did come and divide, but the divisive thing he brought was love.  Galatians 5.13, You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free, but do not use your freedom to indulge in the flesh.  Rather, serve one another humbly in love, for the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command.  Love your neighbor as yourself.  If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  Against such things there is no law.  Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.  Let us not become conceited, provoking, and envying each other.  And that's it.  Please like, subscribe, share with your friends.  Go pick up your copy of On Her Knees.  I love you all so much.  God bless. ",
