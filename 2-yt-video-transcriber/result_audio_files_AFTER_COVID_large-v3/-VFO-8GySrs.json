            "text": "Oscar Nunez.  Oscar?  Hey there, human.  With me, Rainn Wilson.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to SoulPancake.  It's a company I co-created and has been a big part of my life for the last 10 years.  I was thinking about today about we have a hard time as a species, I think, living in dichotomies.  If I could create a Venn diagram, and maybe I'll try and create a Venn diagram.  I'm not really very good at it, but I see a notepad sitting here and maybe I have a Sharpie.  as I have a Sharpie.  It would be that this time is equal parts terrifying.  I mean, people are dying.  And some of the numbers that you read about in little areas like New York or Italy or Spain, it's very scary.  We're getting into the hundreds and thousands of mortalities.  So it's not a joking matter at all.  It's equal parts terrifying.  And then it's also equal parts like connected.  Like I feel more connected than I have previous, you know, in the months before this, because I'm reaching out more.  I'm texting friends.  I'm connecting with people online a lot more.  I think disconnected is one maybe.  And then one more is strange funny.  So where they all meet up is in the middle.  right here.  So it's, this is where we're living right now.  And this is hard for me and other people to process.  Connected, terrifying, disconnected, and strange slash funny.  It's kind of funny.  There's been a lot of very funny memes going on at the same time.  So One of the things I think we struggle with as human beings is living in a dichotomy, living in two things that don't necessarily sync up in a space where we've never lived before.  And I think it's okay to allow for the fact that this is terrifying and it's also funny.  It's both of those things.  If you're being funny, it doesn't mean you're neglecting the terrifying.  And if you're being terrified, it doesn't mean you're neglected the funny.  And we're getting more connected.  Look at this show we're doing right now.  Look at how connected we all are.  And we're also really disconnected because I can't hug people.  We can't go to coffee shops and we can't drop by and see our neighbors and we can't go to our church gatherings, you know, and and there's probably more I could add to this list.  But for now, we'll just leave it at these four that we're living here.  in a very strange time that's between strange, funny, terrifying, connected and disconnected, all at the same time.  That's how I feel.  And isn't there kind of a life lesson in there about the fact that life sometimes has all of these dichotomous angles kind of interblending and knocking up into each other?  Sometimes you're at a funeral and you'll see something that's the funniest thing you've ever seen in your life.  You know, sometimes you're at a wedding and you're the saddest you've ever felt in your life.  Like this is part of the human experience.  And we have to accept that and embrace that.  But right now we're going to talk to Ms.  Angela Kinsey.  And look who's here.  Can you believe it?  Hey, Ange, how you doing?  Hi, buddy.  It's so good to see you.  Hey, it's great to see you.  So you saw my little Venn diagram that I did, Angela. ",

It's hard because I feel like that.  I'm trying to keep things not scary for them, but also things are scary.  That has been kind of interesting because I want to be truthful to them.  I want them to know the stakes of what's happening in the world and how we need to be responsible.  Right.  But I also don't want them to live paralyzed by fear.  It is one of those things, Rainn.  It's like what you were saying where you can be at a wedding and it's a happy occasion and be sad.  Or you can be somewhere where you're supposed to be sad and you and your friend get tickled about something.  You know, all those emotions converge.  You don't stop having all the feelings you always have.  Your environmental life is changing, but you are still you and you're still trying to process all the information.  And some days you're going to be scared and some days you're going to feel triumphant like you've got this.  And other days you're going to laugh because if you don't laugh, you'll cry. ",

I was like, I should be writing poetry.  And there were people taking photographs of like birds in the spring.  I'm like, I should be taking photographs of birds in the spring.

Even though everything that I thought in my head I'd always wanted, I had.  So it's really been a lifelong journey.
