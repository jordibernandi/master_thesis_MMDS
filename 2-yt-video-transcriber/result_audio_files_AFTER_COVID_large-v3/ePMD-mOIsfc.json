            "text": "Welcome.  In this guided meditation, we are going to be giving ourselves a light bath.  So what is a light bath?  A light bath is where we bring ourselves into our physical bodies.  We invite in our families of light, our guides, angelic realm, ascended masters, any higher dimensional beings that are working with you.  now We will bring into the space with us and we will ask them to give us a light bath where they will bring high frequency light all down our physical bodies and all inside of our physical body.  So a massive cleaning inside and out.  Now this doesn't take away from any emotions and belief systems, traumas, behaviors.  It doesn't allow us to escape our human journey.  What it does is it provides us with a moment where we feel lighter, where we feel that perhaps anxiety or stress, worry, fears, anything that we may be feeling consciously in the now.  A light bath allows it to sort of settle and move through us with more ease.  Imagine that something is clogged in a drain, and if you pour some sort of liquid Drano or something, even though that's not good for it, right?  But if you pour hot water or something liquid down through that drain, it clears it, right?  It moves it through.  I want you to visualize and imagine that a light bath is the same, right?  It allows us to feel the high frequencies that are in our bodies and have high frequency light poured throughout our bodies so that we can more easily allow the consciousness we don't like to feel that sort of sticks and kind of moves its way through our body slower than we would like, it sort of pushes it through, okay?  So I encourage you to use this guided meditation as a practice throughout your day.  In any now moment when you are feeling stress, anxiety, worry, fear, lack, anger, right?  Anything that is coming up that your physical body is like, oh, here it comes again, right?  It's crunchy.  It may take a while to move through.  It doesn't feel good.  do this practice quieting yourself moving into your body calling in your guides and having them give you a light back and it will literally move that consciousness through.  the fear anxiety worry stress all of these things are consciousnesses spinning in a lower frequency which is why it feels a little crunchy when it moves into the body.  when we feel it it kind of can cause some tension or It can make you feel like you are restricted, right?  So let's do a light bath.  And let's do a light bath as much as we need to.  A light bath is not escaping your humanism.  A light bath is not escaping your emotions.  A light bath is not escaping what you are feeling, experiencing, and moving through.  A light bath allows it to move through with more ease.  So let's begin.  You can lie down or sit up for this guided meditation and practice.  It's completely up to you.  Begin with your eyes closed, palms facing up.  Find your breath by breathing in and out through your nose.  As you begin to breathe in and out through your nose, I want you to move your awareness into the body where the breath is.  And I want you to feel the expansion and contraction of your breath.  So you can feel your belly rise and fall, your chest rise and fall.  And then I want you to drop your shoulders, completely relax into your body.  Let everything go.  Just be here now in this moment.  Okay.  So let's open up our root energy center.  The very first chakra, the root chakra.  Bring awareness to your sit bones, the very bottom of your spine.  Intend out loud.  or in your own mind, that the root chakra, the root energy center, open up.  I am intending and opening my root chakra.  The first energy center is opening.  By setting the intention, it opens.  Don't worry about feeling or seeing anything.  And as that energy center opens, there's a huge amount of light, like an anchor, or a tube that moves straight out of your body right down onto the earth plane and right down into the earth plane.  now bring awareness to the top of your head where your seventh energy center is your crown chakra.  ask for that crown chakra to open.  I am opening my crown chakra.  I am opening my seventh energy center and just allow it to open and as you do light will start to move through and into your body.  And what I want you to be aware of is that all of your energy centers are open right now in your physical form, regardless of your belief systems.  All seven energy centers inside physical form are open, spinning, and clear.  There's light moving out the bottom, light moving and coming in from the top.  It's like a beautiful figure.  eight Finding the breath again.  Staying in your physical body with your breath.  If you don't know if you're in your body or not, find the breath.  If you connect and attach to the breath, you're in your body.  It's that simple.  Great.  Now let's bring in our family of light and our guides.  So, it is okay if you do not know the names of who it is that is with you, guiding you.  If you know the names of the beings that you currently work with or that are with you, call them in now.  For those of you that don't know the names of the beings and the guides that are with you, here is what we will say.  I am calling in my family of light.  I am calling in the angelic realm.  I am calling in the ascended masters that are here to work with me now.  Perhaps you want to call in your star family.  Or perhaps all you want to say is, I am calling in the most benevolent light beings that are here for my highest good right now.  I'll repeat that.  I am calling in the most benevolent light beings that are here to assist me now.  And let's just drop and allow these beings to come into our field, into our room, and into our space.  Do not worry about seeing, feeling, or hearing any of them.  They are right here, right now, with you, regardless of whether you see, feel, or hear them.  Now let's find our breath and breathe.  The crown is open.  The root is open.  Now let's ask to receive a beautiful light bath.  So, whoever you called in, Whatever name you used, let's ask them to give you a light bath right now.  So, here's what you say.  I invite, and then you invite the names.  For me, it's going to be the Galactic Federation of Light.  I'm inviting the Galactic Federation of Light to provide me with a beautiful light bath.  You may be saying, I'm inviting my star family, my family of light, the angelic realms, Jesus, Mother Mary, whoever it is, right, to provide me with a beautiful light bath.  And after you say that, after you intend, these beings are going to come up to your body, lovingly circling your physical body, And they are going to begin to literally pour beautiful high frequency crystalline light all over your body and all the way inside your body.  It's going to move into the top of your head, going down that channel, moving into your body, going out your fingertips.  the way down your legs your knees your ankles your toes staying inside the body by feeling your breath.  as all of this occurs letting yourself just relax and drop.  perhaps you put a you release a big sigh out your mouth letting it all go Just receiving in this now moment.  Letting your body's frequency increase.  Letting whatever stuck consciousness inside your body begin to release and break up and move through and into this high frequency light.  Literally dissolving into the light.  And just sitting for a moment.  Maybe you're tapping into the beings.  Maybe you're just feeling your own frequency.  Maybe you're starting to feel relaxed, peaceful.  Maybe you're starting to feel things in your physical form.  Starting to break up.  break out and apart from your physical body and start to dissolve into this light.  What I want you to notice is that your breath will really assist in moving anything through.  And as we continue to allow this to unravel, you can see that you can just lay here for quite some time or sit for quite some time.  Maybe your mind starts to wander off.  But recognizing that by receiving this light bath, you are moving denser consciousnesses through the body quicker.  You're moving back into your body and reconnecting to the frequency that you are.  You're recognizing the ascension that you are going through by feeling the high frequencies in your body.  You're remembering that everything is energy and consciousness, including your emotions and thoughts and beliefs and behaviors.  Fear, anxiety, worry, stress, lack, that's all energy.  It buzzes.  It moves.  And when it moves into your body, it creates this internal sort of buzzing frequency that can be very unsettling and yet very quiet.  This light bath disrupts that buzz.  It disrupts that frequency and currency and it moves it through.  So very easily you can bring yourself here.  And you don't need to have a long light bath.  It can be five minutes and you're good to go.  Off you go.  And when you feel the need, you come back for another light bath.  You can sit or lay here as long as you would like.  You can push pause on this record and just lay When you are ready to come out, we are going to thank the beautiful, beautiful beings that came in to assist us right now that are with us every single now moment.  Thanking them, honoring them, loving them.  If you choose, you can close up the seventh energy center and the first energy center, or you can keep it open.  You are safe to keep it open.  And when you're ready, this just very gently begin to open your eyes.  So this light bath is a very quick, very easy and simple practice that you can do every day.  It's different than clearing the energetic field.  The reason it is different is that this is an energetic cleanse inside.  So it's literally pushing the consciousness out of you.  It's cleansing the inside of you.  And you can do this every morning when you wake up.  You can do it throughout your day.  The moment that you are starting to feel any anxiety, stress, worry, concern, lack, fear, sadness, whatever it is, right?  We don't want to dismiss what we feel.  but we can assist it in moving through us by giving ourselves a massively beautiful light bath.  I encourage you to do this as often as you need.  I love you so much.  Thank you for being here.  Give yourself a big hug for everything you have gone through in your human journey, for what you are navigating right now, and have compassion for you.  Thank you. ",
