            "text": "There is no such thing as a spontaneous large-scale riot.  And there's absolutely no such thing as spontaneous uprisings in multiple cities and states across the country.  So what is driving the riots we've seen over the past several days?  The same thing that occurred in our country in the 1960s and early 1970s.  They were planned and just needed a spark to get them going.  If these were not spontaneous, what was it that drove the people into the streets to riot, loot, and burn down businesses?  To answer this question, we ask that you view a video of a movie that was produced in the mid-1960s called Anarchy USA that documented what was going on at that time.  In those years, it was obviously coordinated mayhem and violence.  But other than the John Birch Society, nobody was exposing it.  particularly the media.  That is until we spread the information far and wide enough for many to no longer ignore just what and who were behind the riots.  Such activities are planned, awaiting a reason to get people into the streets and then manipulate them into violence, making it appear as if it is a revolution.  We have documented the fact that the pandemic shutdown across America was well planned in advance.  We were the first to point this out to the people and still the mass media ignores the story, even though more and more people have taken up the cause.  One of the things that we're going to show in a forthcoming book entitled China, The Deep State's Trojan Horse in America, that the Chinese communists have a great deal of influence in community action groups and have been increasingly involved in electing leftists in many large cities and state governments across America.  The organizations seen in recent years in street demonstrations have a Maoist influence within their leadership, like The Revolutionary Communist Party, shortly known as REVCOM, and all their signs and demonstrations.  Antifa, Black Lives Matter.  Such groups may look like independent, but they are not.  They follow a Marxist ideology.  You can be sure that organizations like these are involved, and like in the 1960s, the media, including the conservative ones, with only one exception at this time, are ignoring who's behind the current mayhem.  You might say that the gathering of a crowd in the streets can be organized by using social media, but someone had to make the decision of where a crowd needs to gather.  The primary purpose of these riots are, one, to destroy areas of the city to make the life of the citizens in that area more miserable.  This will increase the opportunity to get them involved in government programs rather than the free enterprise system.  Secondly, to create the condition for controls over all the people.  A curfew, for instance, is enforced over all citizens, not just the rioters.  Three, create the condition of separating the local citizens from their local police.  Now, we abhor bad policing, but it is rare, and we need to support those who protect our citizens and our communities.  Fourth, once the local police lose support of local citizens, the call begins to have a national presence over our local police, where local citizens no longer have jurisdiction over their own police.  The danger of this is that the totalitarian governments have national police forces.  They then control the law abiding to conform to the edicts of the state.  So you want local police, not a national police.  you will notice that the worst problems are those in cities run by leftists, who, by the way, were put into office by the very organizations and people behind the rioting in the streets.  It is a pincer's movement, with pressure from above and pressure from below, with a law-abiding citizen caught in between, wondering what's going on.  Only by educating the local citizens about what is behind the mayhem will it stop, since the people will take care of the problem at the ballot box.  We would like you to do a couple of things.  One, watch Anarchy USA and then think about how it applies to what is happening today.  Then get your friends and neighbors to watch it as well.  It won't hurt to get any policemen and firemen you know to watch it so they will better understand what they're dealing with.  Two, get involved in a Support Your Local Police and Keep Them Independent committee.  Contact us here at our headquarters to find out how.  In this manner, you can engage more people into local activities designed to spread the word in your town and enlist more people in doing something effective. ",
