            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor here.  We're going to consider a very important question that a lot of people wonder.  The Bible is pretty clear there is going to be a great tribulation in the last days.  Where churches diverge in their understanding is on the question, will the church be in the world during the great tribulation?  I believe what the ancient church fathers used to teach and believe, yes, that the church will be here.  I think it's very dangerous when Christians are being taught now in the last days that before this great trial comes upon the world, that all the Christians are going to be raptured out and they won't need to experience this, or they don't need to have a faith that will help them endure unto the end.  but let's find out what the bible says here.  i've got some scripture quotes and some principles.  now many people believe that the secret rapture takes place and then after that the great tribulation comes.  and there are seven years of tribulation.  a lot of this has grown out of the left behind books.  you will not find the phrase seven years of tribulation anywhere in the bible.  this is a doctrine that has been manufactured.  it is true.  there's going to be a tribulation.  The Bible doesn't say how long it's going to be.  Some have wondered if it would be three and a half years, like that time period of drought in the days of Elijah, or that three and a half year period of time that you find during the dark ages when the woman flees into the wilderness.  Now, when you talk about the Great Tribulation, you really need to look at Matthew chapter 24, where Jesus is talking about this time of trouble.  And he says there, and you begin in, oh, you could say in Matthew chapter 24, start with verse 21.  Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world.  to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  And except those days should be shortened, no flesh will be saved.  But for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.  Well, clearly, God is shortening the time of trouble that the elect might survive.  And then some dismissively will say, well, the elect, that's the Jews.  Well, no, the Bible tells us all through the New Testament that believers, Jew or Gentile, those who accept Christ, they are the elect of God.  It's not just Jews.  And it says he sends his angels to the four corners of the earth to gather together his elect.  All the redeemed are called the elect of God.  So In Matthew 24, Luke chapter 21, Mark chapter 13, talks about this great time of trouble.  You can read in Daniel chapter 12, where it tells us there that at that time, Michael will stand up, this is verse one, the great prince that stands for the children of thy people, and there will be a time of trouble such as there never has been since there was a nation, even unto that same time.  And at that time thy people will be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book.  And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.  That's the resurrection that's happening after this great time of trouble.  And the resurrection also happens when Jesus comes, which is after the tribulation.  Will there be a great tribulation?  Yes.  The great tribulation is synonymous with the seven last plagues that you find in Revelation chapter 15, where it talks about.  in them is encompassed the wrath of God.  And so let me give you a few reasons through Bible principles why I believe the church is going to be here.  First of all, Paul tells us all that live godly will suffer persecution.  So the idea that God loves the church too much to allow her to suffer trials, I don't find in the Bible.  Furthermore, Paul says Acts 14.22 says, He said we must, through much tribulation, enter the kingdom of God.  He didn't say he's saving us from tribulation, but it's through tribulation.  Listen to what Jesus said in John 16, 33.  These things I've spoken to you, that in me you might have peace.  In the world you will have tribulation.  But be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.  I'm not the least bit afraid of the tribulation.  Keep in mind, the great tribulation is the seven last plagues.  Most groups believe in this.  The pre-trib, mid-trib, post-trib, those three groups.  Some believe that the church is going to be raptured out before the tribulation.  Some believe it's in the middle.  They're called mid-trib.  middle of the tribulation, the rapture takes place, and then there's those who believe Christ comes and we're caught up at the end of the tribulation.  That's the group I'm in, and that's the group that most of the great reformers were in.  This idea of the secret rapture taking place before the tribulation is a comparatively new doctrine.  It sprang out of Darbyism 150, 200 years ago, but prior to that, the church always believed there was going to be a great tribulation and the church would have faith to take them through this during the seven last plagues.  Now notice the Israelites, I pose this to you as a question, were the Israelites in Egypt when the 10 plagues fell on Egypt?  Yes.  Did God protect them?  Not through all 10 plagues, but God protected the Israelites through the last seven of the 10 plagues.  And you'll notice there's great similarity between the seven plagues in Revelation, chapters 15 and 16, and the 10 plagues that fell on Egypt.  You got blood in both, you got darkness in both, and noisome sore in both.  So there's several similarities.  But the Israelites were in Egypt.  His people were there.  He protected them through the plagues.  It's like Paul said, it is through tribulation we're saved.  God did not save Noah from the storm.  God was saving Noah through the storm.  God did not save Job from his trials.  God saved Job through his trials.  God saved Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego through the fiery furnace.  He saved Daniel through the lion's den.  And Joseph and others in the Bible were saved through their trials.  And the Bible says it is through much tribulation.  God is coming for a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.  God gets out the spots through hot water and he get out the wrinkles with a hot iron.  And so I think it's dangerous for Christians not to realize that now.  we need to fortify our faith and strengthen our relationship with God.  Jesus said that we need to be building on the rock of Notice.  in the parable, when Jesus talks about the wise man building on the rock, the foolish man building on the sand, there's a difference on what they build on.  But the storm comes to the wise man and the storm comes to the fool.  The Bible does not say if you love Jesus and you're wise, you don't go through tribulation.  Yes, we will go through the tribulation.  We're not to worry about it.  There's many promises in the Bible.  He'll take care of us.  You know an amazing fact, I like the bristlecone pine.  It's the oldest tree in the world.  They've got some that are 4,500 years old or maybe even 5,000 years old when they do the core sampling, the dendrochronology.  These are very ancient trees.  Funny thing is they're not very tall and they live on top of windy mountains where there's a lot of storms and lightning.  But the reason those trees endure is because they put their roots deep into the rock.  So they survived the storms.  If we are rooted in the word of God, we don't need to be afraid of the seven last plagues.  I have absolutely no concern about being here in the world during the tribulation.  I want to be building a faith now that will help me survive that.  But you got a lot of promises in God's word.  You can read, for instance, in 1 Thessalonians 3, 4, For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we would suffer tribulation even as it came to pass, and you know.  And Jesus says in Matthew 24, verse 29, And he will send his angels with the sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  Those four winds, north, south, east, west.  Jesus said, he that endures to the end will be saved.  Endures what?  The Lord's people need to have a faith that can endure trial.  We can endure the storms of life.  We don't need to be afraid.  God says, when you go through the water, I'll be with you.  When you go through the fire, I will be with you.  And I especially like the promise that God gives in Psalms chapter 91.  And you can go to verse seven.  A thousand may fall at your side, 10,000 at your right hand, but it will not come near you.  Only with your eyes will you see and behold the reward of the wicked.  We're here.  We see the reward of the wicked.  It says it will not happen.  A thousand may fall at your side, 10,000 at your right hand, but it won't touch us.  neither shall any evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.  He says no plague will come near our dwelling.  We don't have to be afraid of the seven last plagues, friends.  Will we be in the world during the tribulation?  Yes, the Bible teaches us from cover to cover that God's people may experience trial.  But the good news, you read the last part of Revelation And it says, Christ stands up.  He comes and he fights for us.  Read Revelation 19.  He delivers his people.  There's a great salvation.  We stand with him on the sea of glass and we don't need to be worried about this tribulation.  So now's the time to be building on a rock and develop that faith.  Don't go away.  You still there?  I forgot.  I've got a special offer I want to make available.  I wrote a book on the subject of the tribulation in the secret rapture.  We'll send you a free copy.
