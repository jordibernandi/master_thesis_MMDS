We marched in, we sang then, we held up signs, and we even came here like we did today so we could all be on one accord, so we could all be unified.  But I want to let the person know who invented the term Make America Great.  What you meant was take America back to a time when it was great for you, but it was a nightmare for us.  So you can't bring back part of the 60s unless you bring back all of the 60s.  So don't ask yourself where the NFAC came from.  The NFAC was born out of all those groups of people that understand that we know why you protest.  That's your right.  But we also have a right to respond to people shooting us in the back, killing our kids, shooting down our women.  disproportionately putting us in prison, using physical force against us.  So while we support everything that we've seen today, and while all of the speeches were heartfelt, we want to let y'all know that the NFAC is your new Black Panthers.  So wherever you go, say what you want to say, do what you want to do.  Just like Malcolm said, be courteous and peaceful.  But if they put their hands on you, you send their ass to the hospital or to the morgue.  And we don't expect all of y'all to do that.  That's what we for.  So we came here today, NFAC standing right along with you.  We don't sing, we don't chant, We don't wave signs.  We back you up.  so when you try to do it, if anybody has a problem with it, we handle that.  Not you.  Black power?  Black power!  Y'all sound like y'all just learned that.  Black power?  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Black power.  Y'all seen us marching to Louisville for Breonna Taylor.  But guess what?  You are our brothers.  You are our sisters.  And we love every last one of you.  And if they do something to one of us, they do something to all of us.  Y'all don't have to have the nerve that we have, but you got to back us up.  You got to support us.  You can't stand there and look like you ain't never seen nothing like this because you haven't.  Not in the last 60 years.  And as many of us as it is, you ain't seen nothing like this in the 400 years that they made us slaves.  Then y'all got to remember one thing.  Yeah, they doing us wrong, but we doing each other wrong too.  So we can't fight in a house where we killing each other.  We can't fight nobody that look like us when we trying to stop people who don't look like us.  So y'all either got to get on one page with the NFAC and all the other elements out here today.  Y'all all got to remember, we don't have to be the same, but we all got the same enemy, don't we?  To all my white allies out there that say, well, he ain't talking about me.  Let me help you out real quick.  Malcolm X said, you can't join us, but you can help us.  But I don't think nobody ever told you what kind of help you can give us.  You see, we appreciate you being out here chanting with us and putting your fists in the air and feeling empowered.  We love all that.  But if you really want to help us, talk to your people.  Talk to your people.  In your house, in your church, in your club, talk to your people.  It may not be all of y'all, but it's a lot of y'all.  Talk to your people for us.  We've been marching and singing just fine for the last 60 years.  So we're glad y'all finally got on board, but talk to your people.  Talk to your people.  And then you can help us.  Then you can join us.  But until we can learn to love each other, we can't learn to love you.  NFAC.  Right here.  Black Power.  Oh, one more time for everybody that has died at the hands of law enforcement or died unjustly and hasn't gotten justice yet.  For all the families that's out here and for somebody that knows it could be you next.  Black power!  Black power!  Black power!  Let's make some ancestral noise out here in D.C.  And we out this motherfucking in D.C.  Hey!  Hey!  Thank you very much. ",
