            "text": "When you think of pirates, you probably think of rum-guzzling, treasure-hunting, eyepatch-wearing, yar-swearing bad boys of the high seas.  But did you know that centuries before Johnny Depp suited up as Jack Sparrow, there were Jews who operated under the swaying Jolly Roger?  Who were these Jewish pirates of the Caribbean?  What motivated them?  And what kind of semi-kosher mayhem did they get into?  It all started in 1492, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain expelled 200,000 Jews.  This purge of the Jews came from a Christian clerk who wanted to stop traditional Jews from influencing conversos, Jews who had converted to Christianity.  Oddly enough, the clerk himself had converso ancestors, But we guess that didn't stop him.  A number of these exiled Spanish Jews decided to seek revenge from their anti-Semitic monarchs on the high seas.  Jewish pirates tended to form partnerships with leading non-Jewish pirates of the day.  This often led to remarkable crossovers of Jewish and pirate culture, including treasure maps written in Hebrew, ships with names like the Queen Esther and the Shield of Abraham, and tombstones in Jamaican Jewish cemeteries that bore the skull and crossbones.  These sea-bound raiders fought for decades against the Spanish, attacking ships and sharing Spanish naval secrets with Spain's enemies, all while building up a mercantile network connecting trading posts around the globe.

            "text": "Yeah, so this is obviously a huge aspect of what I write about.  And the reason I write about this so much is because it was a very conspicuous aspect of the wills.  As I was reading the wills, you find that slave populations are being bequeathed en masse.  and that they're being named individually.  And also you see a lot of evidence, sometimes very direct and articulate, of concubinage or sexual relationships with women of color, both enslaved and free, and then incorporating their children to some extent into the family through voluntary inheritance.  So that all made me realize that we need to address the issue of Jewish slave ownership.  So in fact, I crunched the numbers in my wills and I found that that slaves were about 11 times more likely to be bequeathed than they were to be freed by Jews.  So it was very uncommon to actually free, manumit slaves.  And there are cases of Jewish abuse of slaves.  And then there are plenty of cases of manumissions.  In one case, he manumits a Jewish slave owner, manumits his quote-unquote mulatto son because of the love and affection he has for him. ",

            "text": "As a matter of fact, a Jewish historian has done a study of the 1830 census in the South and has come up with the conclusion that something like 75% of Jewish households in the South in this country in 1830 owned slaves, whereas the percentage for white households generally was only something like 36%.  So the Jews were approximately twice as likely as non-Jews, as the white population, to own slaves in this country in the South in 1830.  So again, we're talking here about, you know, proportions rather than absolute figures.  Some of the most important slave ship owners in colonial America were Jews.  You know, perhaps the best known of these is a man called Aaron Lopez.  And notice that many of these persons had Spanish or Portuguese sounding last names, and that's because they were Sephardic Jews.  When this whole question arose, you know, around my involvement in all this, Many Jews were heard to say that there were no Jews in America prior to the 1880s.  In fact, Nathan Glazer, a very famous academic out of Harvard University, who should know better, he actually wrote that there's no way that Jews could be responsible for the slave trade in America since there were no Jews here, he said, before 1880.  Of course, there were European Jews in the 19th century before 1880.  German Jews and so on.  But there were Sephardic Jews here from the very beginning.  From the 17th century, there were Sephardic Jews coming in here to New York, related to other places.  So hence the Spanish-sounding names.  Names like Nunez, names like Lopez, names like Castro, interestingly enough.  Names like Ferreira, Herrera, Holmes, Gomez.  All of these names, interestingly enough, suggested Jewish origin in colonial times.  Somebody was saying to me yesterday, You could usually get a hint of the Jewishness from the first name.  The last name might be Gomez or Nunes or Castro, but the first name might be Jacob or David or something like that.  Aaron.  So Aaron Lopez was out of Newport, Rhode Island.  He was one of the largest slave ship owners in colonial America.  This man had a fleet of ships for many years.  He sent his ships to West Africa.  They traveled from West Africa to the Caribbean, to Barbados, to Jamaica, St.  Thomas, places like that.  He had members of his family situated in the Caribbean.  He had a whole network going on.  And he brought slaves back here as well.  Many of his slaves helped to build some famous synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, in colonial times.  .  .  Thank you. ",
