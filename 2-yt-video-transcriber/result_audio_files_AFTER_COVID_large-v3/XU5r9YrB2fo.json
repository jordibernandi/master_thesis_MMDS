            "text": "Because you're bigger and you're stronger.  And so when I say that I thought you could kill me, That doesn't mean you count her with you also that you lost your own finger.  I am not trying to attack you here.  I'm just trying to point out the fact of why I... showing how she admitted to physically striking and attacking Johnny Depp.  Now, she didn't punch him, guys, so it's totally okay.  Johnny Depp's being a baby, so we can't take him too seriously.  Except it happened over and over and over again, and I heard that there's about 80 tapes of this occurring.  Now, originally I wasn't going to touch this story, mostly because a lot of other people have, and there really wasn't much else I don't think I could have added to this story.  Except a couple of things, which is why I'm here.  So, someone asked me to talk about Me Too in general.  And I've already talked about Me Too a few times, so let me just catch everyone up to speed.  for those of you who are wondering what my opinions are.  I think Me Too is a hilarious waste of time and effort and energy.  And I think it is one of the most awful things to ever happen for lots of reasons.  Now, not only is Me Too the silver bullet to any high-profile man's career, not only is Me Too a complete admission to just female sexuality in general, it just completely ignores the nature of female sexuality to some degree.  And we'll get to that.  Don't worry, guys.  We'll get there.  But it's something, and this is the most heinous thing about Me Too.  I'm going to start with the most heinous thing about Me Too.  And it's not even the destruction of a man's career.  That's the second most heinous thing.  But it's the fact that Me Too is a movement that in principle is amazing.  The principal idea is that if someone has been hurt, if someone has been sexually assaulted, then they will have individuals coming at their back and supporting them and helping them out and giving them resources and affirming them and telling them that they are okay and it's not their fault.  That is a wonderful thing for women who have actually been assaulted.  It is a wonderful resource to have people at your back after you've been hurt or harmed.  But because of the Believe Woman nonsense behind it, not only is Me Too a movement that is primarily found up with women doing this, that even when men try to use Me Too, a la Terry Crews, They get lambasted.  They get made fun of.  They get mocked and ridiculed.  Now, I mean, Terry is a big guy with a lot of muscle, so it is pretty easy to make fun of him for being sexually assaulted.  I can see the humor there, but of course, there's a lot of ignorance surrounding that.  Again, with Terry Crews himself, I think there was a really good interview VladTV did with Michael J. White.  that kind of goes into that a little bit more.  I'll link it in the description box.  But a man uses Me Too and he gets lambasted.  So Me Too is a mostly feminine product.  I mean, accept it or don't accept it.  It's just the reality of the situation.  So talking about Amber Heard in particular, we have a woman who went on quite the defamation.  And there's quite the lawsuit coming up for Amber Heard.  But we had a woman who admittedly, in these voice recordings, say that she attacked Johnny Depp.  We have evidence of her gaslighting him.  And here's the thing that's crazy to me.  I want to highlight this one.  Johnny Depp did everything right, quote-unquote.  He actually didn't.  I mean, he picked Amber Heard.  I mean, his hands are, he isn't totally innocent.  He did pick her, but victim blaming aside.  Whenever the situation got violent, he tried to remove himself, which is the most rational thing you could do.  And it's hilarious to me that Amber Heard decided to criticize him and chastise him for, as she said, quote-unquote, splitting.  He did the most adult thing to do.  He left a bad situation.  He saw what was going south.  That's exactly what you need to do, and then you need to come back when cooler heads prevail and figure it out.  Now, the most reasonable thing he should have done is just straight left her, but, you know, that's not, you know, that's what the rest of my channel is for.  we're going to use this video in particular to talk about me too.  i think again it's awful that a woman who could be so abusive and cruel and maybe if it's not even cruel but certainly damaged there's there's certainly a lot of emotional issues going on with her now.  this doesn't like exonerate her from her actions.  so don't get me wrong.  i'm not saying that she's justified but I am saying that it's interesting to me that such a woman could do all these things and then heel-face turn and pretend that she was the victim.  Now, I mean, of course she's acting.  I don't know how.  it is indeed an actress.  Acting isn't too far out of, you know, I mean, that's what she gets paid to do, so you can't be too surprised.  But it is still interesting to highlight the fact that she was able to do it so crisply, so easily.  Me too.  It's an awful movement because it comes from something that should be positive, and it gets turned into this silver bullet that just destroys high-profile men, but does nothing.  Nothing.  To protect normal women, nothing to protect these Hollywood actresses, because a lot of them were on the casting couch.  That's how some of them got their roles.  So they're going to pretend that they didn't get anything out of that.  You know what I mean?  I don't like that.  I hate that.  But it does nothing to protect normal women.  Normal women might feel solidarity after making a tweet, but it does nothing to keep them safe.  It does nothing to fix any problem.  All it does at this point is just obliterate careers without any evidence, without any reason, without any rhyme or reason, without any defense.  And the thing that is really heinous with Johnny Depp, and this perfectly encapsulates the issue with Me Too, by the way, guys, the fact that Amber Heard could have been the one who abused Johnny Depp, but because she hit the Me Too button first, everyone looked at him as if he was the awful human being.  And the truth of the matter is, here's the interesting thing.  A lot of people don't realize this, but domestic violence takes two to tango, usually.  Most people have this idea that abusive relationships is the man shouting, being emotionally controllable, hurting the woman, beating the woman.  And that's true, that does happen, 100%.  But a lot of the time, most of these abuse relationships fall in the middle with the two people going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, on and off.  She starts to start a fight.  He retaliates back and forth.  That's how it usually is.  It's usually both partners are hurting each other in some particular way.  It's not always one sided.  Usually it's not one sided.  Most of the time it's, I wouldn't say it's 50-50, but it's definitely the two people are going at each other.  And that's the thing that's really missed.  And this is why it's a very dangerous stereotype because not only do we see a lot of young men who get abused by women get laughed at, not only is there like an ignoring of domestic violence or of abuse relationships of the woman's point of view, so the man never gets any justice or he never gets any help even though he's also an equal participant in toxicity.  But then we have situations like this where Johnny Depp is being abused.  And he's also part of the participant.  But it's not just that.  But he gets lambasted and destroyed by this hashtag.  And he gets no protection.  And he's got no one on his back.  Even though he was the one being hurt and harmed and gaslighted.  Now, of course, again, it takes two to tango, but she's the one who's got like 80 different voice recordings of her admitting to striking him.  At the very least, 80 voice recordings of these arguments.  I don't know if every single one is her admitting to hitting him, but I know that first one, she certainly did.  Now, going back to my general thoughts on Me Too, I hate the fact that It pretends that women are not sexually attracted to men who are stronger than them, who are more powerful than them, who are dominant.  It pretends that women do not find these men attractive.  And they do.  And a lot of women are not being assaulted, but they are choosing to go into these situations with these high-profile men who have a lot of power, and they think that they can get something out of it.  So now that they realize that they ran their ticket of getting anything out of that sexual favor, they cast their Me Too check in, and they're like, oh, wait, hey, hold on, wait a minute.  No, I actually didn't want this.  I reneged.  I hate that.  Because it does nothing for honest victims.  And all it does is it's just a vindictive tool used to destroy people.  It doesn't help anyone.  It should be.  And that's what's so painful about it, man.  It should be a tool.  To give women and men, anyone who's been sexually assaulted, a leg to stand on.  But instead, it's just used as a Twitter hashtag war to destroy people and get them fired.  Like Evig Minagia.  I can't say his name correctly, but you guys know him.  He was the voice of Broly.  He was Crow and Ruby.  I don't know if anyone on my channel watches Ruby.  I'm pretty sure you guys have seen the Broly movie.  Yeah, he did Broly, I think, in every single movie, in every single English dub.  Vic is currently fighting a lawsuit right now.  And of course, this video is more focused on Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, but let's be real.  This happens to way too many men.  Way too many people in general.  Now, this is only happening to men.  I'm only seeing men get obliterated.  Now, maybe there are stories of young ladies who have been Me Too'd and they're getting destroyed career-wise, but I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen any examples.  You guys can show me the comment section.  But Me Too is protecting... Dangerous women like Amber.  You guys have to, like, we have to accept that.  That Amber Heard is so manipulative and so deceitful and so even, and it's honestly kind of, it's honestly kind of like evilly intelligent what she did, what this woman did.  On the one hand, I was thinking maybe her relationship with Johnny Depp was mostly just emotional turmoil in her own life or her personal life, and she's taking it out on him.  Maybe between them, she's a victim of circumstances too, even though it doesn't exonerate her from her own actions, but I'm thinking that that's what could have caused that psychologically.  But what isn't a defense is the fact that she used this hashtag, she used the article she wrote, she used all that different stuff to misframe Johnny Depp and take no responsibility for her own actions, even though she was an equal hand, if not also, if not more abusive than the man she lambasted.  It's evil.  that is the element that makes it evil.  she pretended that she was like all those other women and all those other women who've been sexually assaulted and have been hurt and have been abused should be living.  they should be beyond furious with the fact that they got deceived by this woman.  that in my opinion personally is what makes her heinous.  it's the fact that She was so cruel, if not cruel, definitely abusive and deceitful that she used Me Too as a mask to cover up and protect herself from the fact that she was an equal participant.  It's almost it's like a comic book, man.  It's like a movie.  And the unfortunate thing is there ain't really much of a solution to this.  Even though we have example after example.  We have Vic.  We have Johnny Depp now.  Lots of different men.  The silver bullet's not going to stop anytime soon, I don't think.  Even with this.  I've seen so many articles.  People like, you know, Me Too is over.  Me Too is dead.  Look what Me Too did.  Nah, dude, man.  And the thing is, I think the worst part about Me Too.  In my humble opinion.  Well, I already said the worst part.  There's lots of worst things.  There's lots of awful things about this hashtag.  It just does nothing to help anyone.  At the end of the day, all it is, it's just so destructive.  It's just so destructive.  And it's not giving women the resources they need.  It's not helping men who have been victims of this, of assault.  It's not helping anyone.  It's just destroying careers.  And I honestly think that it's time we just, we need to make, we need to kill Me Too.  Me Too's done.  The social spirit of Me Too has failed.  It is not supporting anyone.  It's just destroying us.  And that's my honest and ultimate opinion on Me Too.  So, with that being said, I just hope you guys got something out of today's video.  And if you did, man, go and click the like button.
