It might be the most perfect video I have seen.  a citizen display at a traffic stop.  The mannerisms.  His inability or his unwillingness to back up an inch.  He doesn't take a step back.  The cop tries to put the bullion, the hard hand, down on him.  He doesn't move an inch.  He tells him from the beginning, I'm not giving you anything more than I'm required to by law or anything less.  You're going to get exactly what you got coming to you and nothing else.  So, I'm not going to interrupt this because it would be like putting a stroke on the Mona Lisa.  My name is Disordered Product News.  Go on and subscribe to Ensuring Transparency.  Watch what he's about to do. ",
