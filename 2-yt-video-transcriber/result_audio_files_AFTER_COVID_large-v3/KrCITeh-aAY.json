            "text": "Right, good afternoon, good evening, good morning to you all.  This is Catania Albin, still in Canada, and in actual fact I've decided to stay somewhat longer, just because there's quite a lot of uncertainty about flights back, and I was planning to go back at the end of this week, on the 15th of March, and my daughter's and her partner's garden is growing and i enjoy gardening and so we thought well rather than go back after the six weeks being here i'd say a bit longer.  i don't know how much the bit is but it's longer which is great fun thoroughly enjoying it.  now this is part five and sherry edwards is a well-known.  Her work is well known.  I have actually used her services after Colin passed over.  I sent her a soundbite of my voice and I got a, analysed it.  and then gave me information as to what nutrition I should be taking.  Wonderful woman, I'd listened to her many times before.  So here she's talking about this virus called the corona, a novel approach, proof.  all or some of you will know about what we call ascension.  well that's just not sort of flying up into the clouds but actually it's clearing out our fear and our negative thought form and living as more and more, our divine selves.  So we'll start with Shari Edwards.  But before we do, let me say thank you from everybody for your comments and your likes and your shares and for any of you that have donated.  Thank you very much indeed.  Your presence is very much appreciated.  I don't always have a chance to answer everybody.  Here we go. ",

            "text": "Laura Pell, I think, sent me this information today.  She's been sending me lots of information, and Georgia also, from many different perspectives.  So just from my perspective, I run the Institute of Bioacoustic Biology and Sound Health, and I have been working on this kind of information for about 40 years now.  We're located in an old school house, And it turns some ideas about medicine and biology on its head.  So what we're going to share may not be found in your books, but it's a lonely idea of math as medicine, that we are all frequency.  Frequency is everything. ",

            "text": "Now, I'd like to just come in here and absolutely agree with her.  If you go into the description box, you will not only see her video, but in ones that I'm sharing with you, but also you'll see More Energy for Life, my website, moreenergy4life.com.  And if you go onto the tab that says More, either musical revolution or a revolution in music, and listen and go through that, and listen to that, because one of the reasons why they changed the musical note of A above middle C, and the tuning of that, The tuning was done originally from the voice.  and then apparently the violin took it over, and I believe now the oboe is the core of the tuning of an orchestra, etc.  But in the 1950s and the 1970s, the Standards Institute in England set the A, The pitch of A at 440.  Now, 440, as opposed to 432, 432 cycles per second, that's the spin it's going.  We see it as a waveform when it's drawn in 2D, but actually it's a cycle.  it's the spin.  so when you get a low note boom that's a slow.  it's a low big spin showing as a big quite a big waveform.  but actually as you get to the higher higher higher higher sounds it's.  actually you're getting a faster spin and so it's smaller.  okay And it's a spin.  It's not a wave, although it's called a waveform because in the 2D, when you draw it, it looks like it.  But it's actually cycles per second.  It's going round and round.  So if you go onto my website, you'll see a lot about the musical revolution.  And the tuning that we're getting, musical tuning, throughout... We're being bombarded by a tuning that takes us out of consciousness.  It takes us out of consciousness, disconnects us.  But when we tune to 4-3-2 as A, then we actually get back into harmony.  However, we'll go on with Shari Edwards.  Now, Shari Edwards is just going to talk about somebody that came to her who was a composer, and that I have got moreenergyforlife.com.  And if you go onto that website, you will see a link of musical revolution or revolution of music.  And the British tried to, and did, in fact, establish the 1950s and then they that set it even more so that actually we would be concert pitch or the.  the main pitch of a above middle c was would be 440. well that takes us out of harmony because 432 you will see in that article is aligned to the whole planetary frequency, or so I discovered, and I've written it in that article.  I've compiled a lot of other people's work so that my children, my daughters, my grandchildren I gave it to as a birthday, no, Christmas present, writings for them.  It was just after Colin had passed over, and I'd got no money, no nothing.  So I wrote this.  And so they've got that information.  When we understand that everything's frequency, this is why very often I say to people on my videos, do look at, under the personal empowerment, and look at what Leslie Fieger is saying in his various videos and say, Do subscribe.  Now, at the moment, maybe some people don't feel that they can afford the subscription, but we're very close to the GCR, the global currency reset.  So there will not be any problem with money, but there are still problems with health.  And so when you have this core value information, when you have this core information, of how you can master your life, how you can master your thought form and bring yourself from a negative thought form into a joyful or grateful thought form.  And from that, maintain or improve your health until you can maintain good health.  So we'll go on with Shari Edwards.  Here we go.  She's just talking about this man who had stuff he took caused his intestine to either be eaten away or to fail. ",

And I reversed macular degeneration and arthritis and all this stuff.  And we did it by the seat of our pants.  We totally didn't know what we were doing.  We were just trying something out.  And he said, well, I've been sent home to die.  Do you think you could help me?  And I said, I don't know.  And I don't know how much he weighed at that time because I think his weight was about 80 pounds.  And it's because he couldn't absorb anything out of his gut to where we get our nutrients.  And so we started giving him nutrients by sound. ",

But there's a lot of things that go on with him that have to do with helping you.  Because when we helped him and he was getting well, he said, I want to do something for you.  And I said, well, I'm not musically inclined.  And I have all of these eyeball notes and the frequencies.  Because frequency is a note, and notes are frequency, like 220 and 440.  It's our scale, mostly, that we use music as a note of A. And so he said, well, maybe I could write a song.  And so I sent him the frequencies, and he was like, oh, my God, I can't make anything out of this. ",

The sacred frequencies, sacred solfeggio frequencies, for instance, and I don't think Sharia is talking about those, I'm not sure, but the sacred solfeggio frequencies, the do, what we reference as dough, or one of the, it's not a fixed dough, it's the movable dough, and so you can take it at any frequency.  But in the church in the ancient, it was three, six, nine.  And that frequency, that was the do, or the ut quent laxis, and that frequency would heal grief and sadness.  Grief and sadness.  And then you had the re, which was resonare, and then the mi, mi ragustrum, which was five, two, eight.  So each of the frequencies had a specific frequency. ",
