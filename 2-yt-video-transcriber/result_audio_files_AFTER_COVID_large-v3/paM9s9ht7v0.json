            "text": "This is Jane Doe.  She earns $60,000 a year.  She's quite content.  Little does she know that nearly 20% of that paycheck is going to be spent on health care.  You see, Jane lives in the United States, and the United States spends double what other similar countries pay per person on health care but has worse health outcomes, declining life expectancy, higher maternal and infant mortality rates, higher rates of medical error.  Just last year, the United States spent over $3 trillion on health care expenditures.  $3 trillion with a T?  Yep.  An ambulance ride to the nearest hospital in America can cost thousands.  Jane Doe's trip cost her about $1,300, but her insurance is going to cover $1,050.  In essence, Jane Doe, before even stepping foot in a hospital or meeting a doctor, has already racked up a charge of $250.  Once admitted, a nurse conducts an electrocardiogram.  That costs $400.  A doctor orders a few tests to rule out a heart attack.  Blood tests cost about $1,000.  Blood tests means venipuncture, $20.  Urine tests, $83.  Chest x-ray, $348.  The overall ER admission fee, $2,961.  So that's $4,812 for the hospital visit on top of the $250 for the ambulance.  Now, the hospital was in network, so her insurance negotiated it all the way down to $3,711.  But that's not all.  Jane Doe's insurance only covers a portion of the ER doctor's bill, leaving her with another burden of $250.  So that's $3,711 for the hospital visit, $250 for the doctor, $250 for the ambulance.  That leaves Jane Doe with a grand owed total of $4,211.  Luckily, Jane Doe pays $442 a month, over $5,300 a year in health care premiums, so her insurance should kick in and lighten the financial load, right?  Not quite.  Jane Doe has a $4,000 annual deductible with Blue Cross Blue Shield that she hasn't yet met.  That means she's responsible for all the medical costs until she has spent $4,000 that year.  That means that anything less than $4,000 is hers to handle.  In this case, that's all $4,000.  In 2017, nearly half of all insured Americans said it was difficult to pay their medical bills before their deductible kicked in.  Why are we like this?  Well, it's mostly because insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the rest of the healthcare industry are able to charge what they want and increase prices. ",
