It's where you use questions to explore a claim that people make because they think that it's true.  I just had a really good talk with somebody Who was saying it was kind of weird.  Well, it was unusual in that Their perspective was that if you have a narrative about what the situation is Then it's factually true to be the case.  so if you have a narrative that there's an even number of pieces in this container, and we count them up, we count up the total number of pieces, and we actually come up with an odd number, the narrative is correct.
