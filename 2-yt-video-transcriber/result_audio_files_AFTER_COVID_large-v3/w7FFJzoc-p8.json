            "text": "Here's how I want to start.  I just want to apologize.  And I just did this to our board.  I've done this to our pastoral staff.  And let me tell you why, okay?  This has been a crazy bunch of months.  The last four months, and you've probably felt the craziness with me.  And I'm in global pandemic.  Another pandemic hits on top of that about race reconciliation and heartbreak.  And then... There's also government.  It's just crazy stuff.  And as the senior lead pastor of Bayside, I'm over all of our churches, and I realized something a couple weeks ago.  If you're a leader, which that's the way God's wired me, and it's the position he's put me in, when it's time to lead, you should lead.  And to be really honest with you, I just don't feel like I have led out front enough or wisely enough or strong enough.  And I actually met with our board the other day and apologized to our board.  I said, you want to replace me?  Fine with that.  It might not be a bad idea.  They went, no, you're not going anywhere.  But I apologized to our board.  And I just said, I am really sorry.  And what happened to me was this.  There is nothing like having God's word get unleashed in your life.  And I prepared a message on the book of Joshua.  And whenever I prepare a message, God speaks to me far the more than he does you.  And I was reading Joshua chapter one and I was studying the children of Israel and they got stuck.  And they were stuck for a long time.  And the reason they were stuck for 40 years was fear on the part of the leaders.  And it wasn't the fear that kept them stuck.  What happened is the fear paralyzed them.  And as I read that, this sense came over me and I felt like God said to me, you have not led with courage, you have not led with conviction, you have been far too silent on almost everything, on almost every front, and three times, in the book of Joshua, it says, be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous.  And after reading that, I was deeply convicted.  So Global Bayside and every single Bayside person, I would hope you'd give me some grace on this and accept my apology.  I feel like I have been paralyzed.  I have not led strongly enough, I have not led out front enough, I don't think I've said enough, and I felt like I was stuck, and Joshua kicked me out of that, okay?  And so what I'm here to say is this, Wednesday night, we have been working for the last couple weeks on this, because those days are over.  When Joshua said to me, Joshua says three times, be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous, he's literally saying that, Because leaders are supposed to lead people to a place that is better, okay?  And we are going to do that on this Wednesday night at 6 o'clock, okay?  We are going to do a global call.  You can come on to that call in almost any form you want.  Major two ways we're going to do this.  We will have a Zoom call that has room for all of you, okay?  You can be on this on Facebook.  It is this Wednesday night at 6 o'clock.  Matter of fact, if you want to get on that, all you have to do right now is this.  Text Facebook.  family to 56316.  And when you text in this, it will be a global message from me and our pastors.  It will be ministry updates and you'll get an inside look at every single thing going on, including what we are going to do about race and reconciliation.  Okay.  Here's what's happening around America.  Most, the vast majority of Christian churches will make a statement, which it's my fault we haven't done.  We will give God's perspective on it.  It's my fault.  we have not done.  But most churches will make a statement and then they're kind of done with it.  Our goal is to tell you what we believe God is telling us, but not to stop there, but to develop a full on plan.  because here's the deal.  We believe God can work.  We believe God can make this country a place where every single person has equal access to everything they need to thrive, walk with God, and live a great life, regardless of race or address.  We believe that.  However, we don't want to just make statements.  We want to put a full-on plan.  We are going to lay out the components of that plan on Wednesday night, and we are going to actually invite you as a church to help us develop the plan.  so Global Bayside, we are coming together with one goal.  how do we make this country better?  How do we make our communities better?  How do we make every state better?  And how do we create a world where every single child that was ever created by God can have an unlimited future and the ability to thrive?  That will happen on Wednesday night.  That's not all that's going to happen on Wednesday night.  You will get an inside look at what God is doing on our campuses.  When the We have not shut down.  Almost all of our campuses are wide open.  I'm delivering this from the Granite Bay Campus.  Our services have been absolutely packed.  We are putting up more tents.  Matter of fact, we were at the service last week.  People are meeting Christ.  People are recommitting their lives.  Everybody's walking on.  They're in tears.  And somebody said, this is like a tent revival four times every weekend.  You'll see pictures on that on multiple campuses.  You will hear a... You'll hear a full-on report on what we are doing to small businesses.  Most small businesses have been crushed by this more than most churches, okay?  And our churches have sprung into action, developed a plan to help small businesses, and that has happened so much.  Six other churches from six other cities are taking our planning and using it to help small business.  You'll see reports on that on Wednesday night and hear about that, okay?  Our youth ministries, they all ran an in-town retreat for high school students last week.  You'll see pictures of that.  Hear a report on that, okay?  You will hear what our plans are to keep our churches open, launch children's ministries again.  And really, what you will hear, and I want you to hear this heart to heart from me, okay?  You will hear us passionately believing that God is still alive, passionately believing that God wants to work in all churches for all people.  You will hear me to lay out a plan because we actually are praying for the day, and you've heard this before, we are praying for the day where our country looks like More like heaven than the divided states of America.  And that's all Wednesday at six o'clock.  Please join us for that. ",
