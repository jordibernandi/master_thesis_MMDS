You have a good day.  Excuse me?  You can call me good citizen, yeah.  Thank you.  We'll go to the back gate.  Good.  What's your name, sir?  I don't wish to speak, sir.  I'm doing a story.  Okay.  Jeffrey?  Jeffrey?  Yeah.  Are you Jeffrey?  Did you talk to Oscar Geiger yesterday?  Jeffrey?  No.  You weren't at the North Station yesterday?  I don't answer questions, sir.  What are you doing here?  What are you doing here?  Here to investigate what you're doing.  A lawful act?  And such as?  You tell me.  You're the one that has to have the reason of articulate suspicion, sir, not me.  We're consensually contacting you right now.  All right, you have a good day.  You have a good day.  You can drive in and out.  I can get a good shot of a car going in and out, and I'll be out of here.  You can get a good shot of us right here?  No, no, your car going in and out.  It's usually good for, like, the beginning or the end of a story.  What's your story about?  Henderson.  About Henderson?  The city?  Yeah, I just, I went and took a picture of the city hall and everything else.  Okay, so you understand that that's like a security concern?  You understand that's the First Amendment, right?  And your security, I know, but your security concern doesn't trump my rights, sir.  So please don't go there.  Never said that.  I'm just saying, please don't go there because a lawful, but a lawful act, how is that, how is that concerning?  I thought you said you were doing anything unlawful.  Well, what is concerning?  You taking pictures of... A lawful act, that's a lawful act, right?  It's not a lawful act?  No.  No, because I'm 50 years old, man.  I don't want to be your dad.  I don't need an education from some young kid.  I don't know, but you're not willing to give me a lecture.  That's for damn sure.  Well, then you can get your cargo and your money, man, please.  I don't care, man.  That's like intimidating a hockey player with a hockey stick, bro.  I'm around cameras all the time.  That doesn't mean nothing.  You didn't get it because it was smart.  It was a smart quote.  Actually, I was trying to gather intelligence, but then you showed up.  I just said I was trying, but you showed up.  All right, here you go.  Here's your police officers.  Got nothing better to do for your money than to stand around and bug.  I don't know.  You tell me.  Your shirt says police, but you're not acting like a public servant.  Not by standing here after I already told you I'm doing a story.  I mean, I don't understand what more you need to know.  You are nobody that I would consider an authority.  Actually, you're under me until I break the law.  You serve us.  And then when I break the law, then your jurisdiction, then you could take over.  Until then, you can just leave me alone and you have a good day.  You're the one still standing here?  I was standing here.  You pulled up with me.  I never came to you.  How you doing?  All right.  What's going on?  You got your I.D.  with you?  You know I.D You know the I.D.  laws, right?  You have to have a read-through while taking a suspicion, sir.  Were you inside taking pictures inside the station?  I don't answer questions, sir.  You're being live-streamed on the Internet, too.  You don't like the First Amendment, sir?  What is your sworn oath to?  This is a lawful activity, sir.  I'm a journalist, so leave me alone.  I can talk to you if you want to talk.  No, thank you.  I can already tell you're a tyrant.  Okay.  I'm a tyrant?  Okay.  First thing you get out is you want my I.D I asked if you had the I.D Let me see your I.D.  where you live.  Okay.  No, thank you.  No?  No, thank you.  No, thank you.
