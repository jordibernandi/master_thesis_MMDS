Their denial and the cowardice of their unwillingness to face the reality that we live in dark times, and sometimes the monsters are indeed real, is precisely what has allowed these monsters to thrive and to prey on our children in the first place.  And I think it's only fair that we hold these cowards responsible for looking the other way and allowing it to continue. ",

And if something like that was really happening, they would know about it.  Certainly, law enforcement would stop it.  You see, it makes them feel unsafe to think that they might live in a society where these kinds of things happen, and they certainly don't want to believe that.  They don't want to believe that these things might actually be facilitated by the same people that are supposed to be protecting them from evil.  That's an extreme inconsistency in the official narratives.  Something like that might force them to question other aspects of the narrative.  Weak people like that need to maintain their suspension of disbelief.  They need to hold on to it for dear life, because life might be a stage, but for these people, they're just the audience.  Audience members that squirm at the thought of having to actually participate in the play.  They'd rather just sit back and watch and look away during the scary parts.  But as I said, looking away makes you complicit.  Looking away is what people have done year after year as children have been abused, tortured, and murdered, and the monsters allowed to run amok.  Looking away is what people have been doing all over the country for decades, including in the case of Leo and Ella Stein.  and their Circle S Ranch.  In the early 1950s, Leo Stein, a Jewish student of Freudian psychology, and his wife Ella Stein, founded a boys' ranch in the Arizona desert outside of Phoenix.  Stein had previously been fired from the local school board and even investigated by the FBI for attempting to teach atheism, communism, and sex ed with a weird focus on what he perceived every boy's desire was, having sex with their mother.  But for some reason, and somehow, this man with no psychiatric training whatsoever was the man that, for some reason, the system in both Arizona and Southern California decided to send their troubled teens to.  They sent boys from ages 12 to 18 to his secluded compound in the middle of the desert.  His compound called Circle S Ranch for nearly 25 years.  And for nearly 25 years, Leo and his wife Ella abused and molested young boys repeatedly.  And despite several complaints with matching stories from boys who didn't know each other that spanned decades, who had been at the ranch decades apart, it was allowed to continue because nobody wanted to believe it was happening.  Even after a boy, Larry Middleton, who was staying at the ranch, was found dead in the desert in 1958.  And nobody was annoyed by the Steins' uncooperative nature.  And for some reason, nobody investigated further.  You see, the boy had simply wandered off into the desert.  He had simply wandered off in the desert and died of heat stroke.  And nobody bothered to investigate further when witnesses told investigators that Larry Middleton... had been beaten severely by Leo the day before his disappearance.  Nobody investigated further when another boy was told by Ellestine, Run away if you want.  You'll end up like the last guy who tried to escape.  In fact, this abuse was allowed to go on for 20 more years at Circle S Ranch.  until Arizona finally revoked Leo Stein's license in 1978, after a boy did manage to escape and finally found a social worker who would listen.
