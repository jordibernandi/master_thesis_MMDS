            "text": "Have a good night.  Do I think this is all going to play out like I hope it does?  Probably not.  But it's interesting because, look, I don't care what your position is.  If you're just a regular person or you're a big Hollywood movie star who stars in Aquaman and dates people like Elon Musk and Johnny Depp and have the power to get Disney involved.  to simply fire Johnny Depp based on what appear to be, in my opinion, blatant lies.  Justice should be, although it isn't always, blind.  And when you look at The situation here for Amber, it's very, very interesting because some of the claims of using makeup to fake bruises on her face seem to have a bit of... uh validity.  and now it looks like she's facing up to three years in the clink for it.  the story continues to develop but as of april 7th amber heard faces lockup if found guilty of falsifying evidence against johnny depp The legal drama surrounding Aquaman star Amber Heard and her ex Fantastic Beasts star, yeah, that's what you pick, Fantastic Beasts.  I'm pretty sure everyone knows him from Pirates of the Caribbean or, I don't know, Edward Scissorhands or literally anything else.  But any whoozle has taken another turn following allegations against the actress who has claimed that Depp had raised his hands to her during their tumultuous 18-month-long relationship.  Depp is currently suing Heard for defamation due to her claims, and there appears to be new evidence that Heard faked some of her alleged injuries at the hands of Depp that allowed her to obtain the order against him in the first place and could now be facing up to three years for falsifying it.  Oh my God.  If she did this, please, please, please.  I don't care that this is going to come across biased because it is, but I know personally men who have had women lie to deprive them of visitation for their children, among other things.  I am certain that men have done the same.  But boy, does it seem like there's a disparity in who actually gets caught and who actually gets punished for these things.  I know it's anecdotal and I know it's an emotional take, but it sure seems like men get the short end of the stick with this type of thing.  Now, obviously, the two actors who met while filming Rum Diary, we don't care about any of that.  However, in December, Heard wrote an op-ed piece for The Washington Post where she spoke about Depp being very, very bad boy.  Soon after, Depp filed a $50 million defamation suit.  against the wife.  Interestingly, Heard did not use his name, but everyone knew, everyone knew who she was talking about.  At issue now are Depp's claims that Heard used makeup paint on her face, which she used as evidence to get the TRO against him in 2016.  Actor James Franco has become a key figure in the case since he was filmed on surveillance spending time with Heard in the days before and after.  It was obtained.  Heard also claimed that Depp gave her two black eyes before she appeared on The Late Show with James Corden in 2015.  But her stylist, Samantha McMillan, has stated, Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face.  Oh!  Please charge her.  Please.  Please.  The penal code establishes that if it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, or conceal, or move a matter of attention causing to be, obviously, we know, you can't tamper things.  These charges have a maximum of three years.  Now, this is all via the International Business Times, who has actually covered many other things.  How about this weird story?  Amber Heard dressed up her girlfriend, Bianca, like Johnny Depp.  Creepy.  Twitter users accused Amber Heard of dressing her current girlfriend, Bianca Beauty, up like ex-husband Johnny Depp on March 6th.  They were spotted arriving at LAX in LA.  They were photographed holding hands while walking.  However, what many noticed was the appearance of Heard's companion.  Many mistook her for Johnny Depp.  Oh my God, that's so funny.  I mean, come on.  This woman is... Look at that!  Look at... Look at... It was reported last month that she's happier than ever.  Well, yeah, because she gets to use this shield, by the way.  Isn't that interesting?  how, you know, all of a sudden, no, I'm not saying, I don't know, maybe she's got a history of it, but she sure jumped to women really fast and apparently dresses them up like her ex.  How about this?  Elon photographed with a black eye.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Elon.  Hmm.  Elon Musk was photographed with a black eye with Amber Heard, and it only inflamed the latter's history of bad behavior.  Well, of course.  Of course.  This isn't the first time.  If you go back, she'd actually been put in the clink before.  Amber Heard was put in the clink.  Her ex-wife, Tassa Van Ree, raising her hands to her at an airport.  She was the one that was put in the clink, not her ex.  Although not much is known about Heard's relationship with Van Rie, the Aquaman actress came out as gay when she attended the 25th anniversary of GLAAD.  How convenient.  She's beautiful, she said at the time.  I mean, you'd have to be crazy not to go out with her.  They secretly got married at some point in the relationship and began their partnership.  Heard even changed her last name to Van Rie before changing it back after their split in 2012.  Wow, two years.  In 2009, Amber was wrongfully uh put on into a situation where the two individuals in a power position i recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us.  blah blah blah blah blah.  Isn't it funny how every Hollywood celebrity seems to just suffer so greatly for our entertainment?  They have to go to bed every night on their piles of money next to their shark tank and with their servants, and it's just so difficult to be them.  How about this little piece of information, a little nugget, might you say?  How about it looks like It looks like somebody pooped the bed.  Somebody put poop in the bed, a feces prank details, a feces prank.  I don't know why you would do this unless maybe like you put it in a cellophane or something like that.  Why would you put it in your bed?  Again, he previously stated that they found everything a pristine condition at their house and surveillance videos and eyewitnesses, including the building security, have shown the same as most recent filing.  Depp said that she appeared at the courthouse days later with painted on bruises to obtain a temporary order against him.  I believe this.  I believe everything that Johnny's saying.  I'm not kidding.  And it's sad that Disney acted so quickly and with so little evidence to remove him from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but at no point has been interested in bringing him back on, even as continued evidence comes out that this woman is insane.  That she has a history of raising her hands to people.  And I wholeheartedly hope he wins this $50 million in full.  I hope that... Oh, little Annie.  Yeah.  Sorry, my cat's visiting.  I hope that they pursue this all the way because she ruined his career.  Disney took the word of her without any evidence and fired him from the movie.  he will forever be labeled a terrible man, even though there appears to be literally no evidence of it.  This has to stop.  There has to be an example set.  And I don't think there'd be a better person for it than Amber Heard.  By the way, DC, Aquaman 2, Jason Momoa, all these strong woman respecters, they've all been suspiciously quiet on this.  Rumors have swirled that she may be removed from the Aquaman 2 film, but I've seen no evidence of that.  And to be honest with you, Amber Heard embodies everything, everything wrong with the imbalance in the justice system against men, in my opinion.  She has all the power, all the privilege.  She is presumed to be telling the truth immediately and has never had to provide any kind of proof for her claims.  Meanwhile, on the other side of it, Johnny Depp has had his career ruined.  His name, his good name, will forever have that stain on it because of this imbalance.  And it sure would be nice to see it flip back and be fair again.  What would be fair?  Well, Johnny Depp winning his lawsuit, him getting his job back with Disney, receiving a public apology from Disney, having Amber at least held accountable for faking things.  I'm not saying you got to throw her in the system for three years, but I'm saying Johnny Depp has been repeatedly wronged here.  It would be nice to get some of these wrongs righted.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
