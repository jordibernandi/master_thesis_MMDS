Jeez, don't ever anyone get so excited to see me.  What do you want, not Muhammad?  Jesus, the one and only reason I came here too was how you say, apologize for all the jihads and to let you know that there's no hard feelings for all the crusades.  Really?  Really?  That's the only reason you're here.  Uh, yes indeed it is.  Oh, well in that case, I forgive you, not Muhammad.  Excellent!  BTW, it is my understanding that you are having the, how you say, healing powers.  Here we go.  For instance, in the Bible, there were certain people you laid your hands upon and healed them and I was wondering if maybe you could do the same for me, but without any actual physical contact.  Why?  What's wrong?  Nothing at the moment, but I was wondering if maybe you had a coronavirus vaccine miracle that would make me immune.  Uh, no, it does not work that way, not Mo.  Uh, you gotta have faith, you won't get it.  And, uh, then, um, maybe you will, and maybe you won't.  Who knows?  Um, I am having faith.  Thank you very much.  Really?  It doesn't seem like it?  I mean, why don't you just fly a plane into the virus?  Wow!  Jesus, viruses, first of all, viruses are exceptionally tiny and so... So, one would have to be a pilot of exceptional skill and it doesn't sound like faith to me.  Oh, I am so sick of this.  You save a whore.  Hey, I told you, my mother was a virgin.
