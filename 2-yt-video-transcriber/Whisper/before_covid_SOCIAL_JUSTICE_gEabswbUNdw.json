            "text": " In July of 2012, I made a video with my little brother. I only meant to make one of them, but it was fun. So I made another one. Another one. Another one. And then another one. We just kept making them. And it kind of led us on a wild ride. Kid President, give Kid President a big round of applause. Here we go. Five, four, three, oh. Let's do this. After countless web videos. I'm Kid President. And I'm on a mission to make the world more awesome. Celebrity interviews. What's this called? The pencil sharpener. I kiss Beyonce. It was magical. Television show in a New York Times bestselling book. We just stopped. What happened to Kid President? We need Kid President more now than ever. Kid President. Kid President. What exactly happened? Where is Kid President? We all use mailbag. Kid President. Kid President. Where are you? I heard he's been really sick. Maybe he was on a trip and then he got lost in the forest. I think because he got abducted by aliens. Whatever happened to Kid President, I don't know. Guys, I heard Kid President died. He was... Well, I'm not dead. This is Kid President Robbie Novak in the flesh. Just because someone's not on YouTube doesn't mean they're dead. A lot of people, they call me Kid President, but I was just a character. In the videos, I was pretty wild. I would dance and do stuff, crazy stuff. But in real life, I was honestly pretty shy then. A lot of people then would come up to me like, hey, give me a pep talk or give me a corn dog. But I don't wear suits all the time. I don't really love corn dogs. Corn dogs rule! People mailed them to us a lot. Mail someone you know a corndog. No way, it's a corndog. It got pretty gross. People ask a lot, how can I become kid president? And I'm just like, I don't know, man, just get yourself a Brad. You'll be set. That's what I did. Now you see, Brad is my brother. But sometimes I call him Brad Chad, good old Brad Chad. He wanted to put something on the internet that got people to listen to kids. And it worked. Let's move! So my idea was that maybe we could just bridge that divide. Childlike optimism and grown-up cynicism. And also, I just really wanted to spend some time with Robbie. There were a lot of reasons why we stopped making videos, but for one, the only times that me and Brad could really spend together is when we were filming. It got tough on me and Brad. This was so Robbie could focus on school and family and friends. It was a whole bunch of fun, but we stopped making them. Just stopped. So, just before we stopped, I ended every video with a cliffhanger. Grad's hand would come in, I would get a letter. Ooh, some mail. Mail, some mail. And the letter said, Your voice has changed. Are you going to be kid president forever? Kid president. You're kid president. You're not gonna be a kid forever. Voice is getting deeper. What's next? What are you gonna do? I don't know. Oh, I see we're out of time. I left something in the stove. I'll answer it next episode. Answer that next episode. Bye. I'll answer that next video. We never answer. I don't know. Guess you're gonna have to just stay tuned and see what happens next, you know? Truth is, I didn't know what we would do next. That's how life works. Are we done? Did we do it? Did we make our space jam? What will be your space jam? What will you create will make the world awesome? Where do we go from here? What are we going to talk about now? I didn't think about that. Let's just stand here until they start watching. That's a plan. The biggest reason we stepped away was so Robbie could just go back to civilian life. I mean, it's been awesome. I've gotten to be with my friends. I play soccer, video games. I've been running. I've gotten to be in drumline, percussion, band. And Brad, well, he's been focusing on writing, coming up with crazy ideas. He made a karaoke backpack. It's literally a backpack with some mics in it. Everywhere you go is now a party. It's pretty crazy but it's pretty epic. I've been spending time with my family. I have a wife, two kids. It feels crazy. Good to be back. It's been a while. Hey, we out here. We're back at it again. It's going to be great. It's going to be awesome. Robbie doesn't really know this but we're going to be going on a big trip together. Alright, so what we're doing here, just packing my bag. By asking the questions, I wonder how we can make the world more wonderful. I wonder who we can help. He doesn't know all the places we're going to be going and has no clue the adventure we're in for. I don't even know what to pack, really. Brad won't tell me where we're going or what we're going to really be doing, but it's okay. I guess we'll just have to see. So I can't tell you exactly where we're going. Every spot. I can tell you though, there is a kid who's making the world more awesome. I know that we're going to go meet kids who are trying to make the world more awesome. And that's all I need to know. Aside from coming back to the internet, the other thing I'm really nervous about is breaking the news to Robbie that this road trip will be happening in my minivan. About the vehicle. We're taking your minivan, aren't we? Yeah. Minivan! It's ready. I don't know if this minivan can handle us. This trip is going to be awesome. We're going to meet amazing kids. I'm excited to spend time with them, for us to just be together again. I'm excited. I mean, I'm really excited. And there are kids all over the country, all over the world, who deserve to be heard. In the same way that Kid President was celebrated, there's so many kids all over the world every day doing things that deserve to be heard, that deserve to be applauded, and that deserve to be supported. They're going to have a lot of experiences, have a lot of fun, and it's just going to be a good time to try to make the world more awesome. Everything else with Kid President was just the beginning. Hey Brad, are we there yet? Are we there now? Go back to sleep. We're back! We have a whole lot of awesome people to meet. Some great stories to share. Follow along with our adventures and we hope to see you on the road. SoulPancake, subscribe!"
