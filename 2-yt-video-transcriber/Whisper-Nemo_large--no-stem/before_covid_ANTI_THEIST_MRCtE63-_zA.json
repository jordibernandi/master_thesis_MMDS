If you have a red letter edition of the Bible, that's not gonna necessarily be in red letters.  There's no way to verify it.  And you believe it because you also believe that Jesus rose from the dead after three days.  But even the Bible doesn't have him rise from the dead after three days.  It would have been from Friday night to Sunday morning.  That's not three days, that's a day and a half.  And actually, there's no evidence that he rose from the dead.  And it's difficult to even demonstrate reasonably that he actually existed, although I'm OK with that notion.  But if somebody said, I will rise again or after three days, I will rise again.  And then we killed them and they rose after three days.  That would be incredibly impressive.  I agree.  But having a book that says somebody once said that after they were killed, they would rise again in three days.  And I'm telling you, that's what happened.
