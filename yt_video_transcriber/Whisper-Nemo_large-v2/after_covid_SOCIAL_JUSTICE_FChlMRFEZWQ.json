The few words exchanged between the two officers during the search are almost identical to those they exchanged during the search just a few weeks earlier.  On that occasion, too, the search had ended with Erickson asking Pastran, An ambulance finally arrives to pick up Serrano.  He spends the next five days handcuffed in a hospital room, waiting for his abdominal wound to close.  Serrano took a plea deal to avoid jail time and didn't learn of this body cam footage existence until after he pleaded guilty.  The video, which didn't emerge for nearly two years, underscores the limited information available not just to the public, but also defendants, and validates criticism by police accountability advocates that body cameras are of little use if the evidence they capture remains inaccessible.  The NYPD declined to comment on this incident.  Erickson and Pastran remain on patrol. ",
