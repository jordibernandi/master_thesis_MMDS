That's not going to necessarily be in red letters. There's no way to verify it. And you believe it because you also believe that Jesus rose from the dead after three days. But even the Bible doesn't have him rise from the dead after three days. It would have been from Friday night to Sunday morning. That's not three days. That's a day and a half. And actually, there's no evidence that he rose from the dead. And it's difficult to even demonstrate reasonably that he actually existed, although I'm okay with that notion. But if somebody said, I will rise again, or after three days, I will rise again. And then. We killed them and they rose after three days. That would be incredibly impressive. I agree. But having a book that says somebody once said that after they were killed, they would rise again in three days. And I'm telling you, that's what happened. Okay.

And I'm going to stop right now because we're willing to have conversations. We're willing to talk about how and why we believe things. But I don't exist just so some atheist who's pissed off at his mom can send her here. I apologize, Rose, that you were duped like this because you're somebody who doesn't have \u2013 you're like most other people on the planet. You believe something. People around you believe it. You're convinced that it's true. You never really bothered to consider what sort of evidence should or shouldn't convince somebody. And you were sent in to a call-in show that is incredibly famous for taking \u2013 credulous, theistic beliefs and raking them over the coals. And your son owes you an apology. Yeah, and if your son's watching right now, dude, you need to do better. I would never have done this to my mom. And I talked about what my mom sent me for my birthday.",

If you think you can keep proving God, call in and do it for this guy here. That's rude. I wouldn't even have sent her to Eric. And Eric's going to be as nice to her as anybody. First of all, you're not in any way demonstrating that you're the more rational person or that your belief is rational or that their belief is irrational. I know that you're feeling bad about it, and I'm going to keep beating you up because I know you're listening. You should feel bad about it. It doesn't mean you're the worst person ever. Just learn.
