            "text": "So last Halloween, we had a lot of fun killing evil spirits, but this year we wanted to up the anties.  So we may or may have not rented the most haunted house in Texas.  And I didn't know what rang the play.  Let me take this.  Hello?  I'm gonna get you like a fish.  Now that is the spirit.  Where are you?  I'm already in the house.  You're in the house?  Guys, he's in the house!  He's in!  Guys, guys, first of all it's already in though.  You are super prepared this year.  Wow.  Jared, no crossbow this year.  Went shoddy.  Nice.  Is it loaded?  Again.  Okay, here.  Air Force Friendball.  There you go.  Richard, W-50s, huh?  Yeah.  Two is one and one is none.  Am I right?  Logan, how's the demon girlfriend from last year?  Breakup was a little rough, but I am single as... Yep, good luck!  Eli, glad you can make it this year.  Remember, I'm a fancy one.  Oh god, why would you... Oh, oh, thank you.  You're welcome.  Boys, shall we?  This is what happens more than my friends.  Who knows the name of the statue?  Anybody got a sister picture?  That's 15 years MREs.  Does anyone know CLS?  I am not putting my mouth on that.  Nope, nope.  Do we give him military honors?  I don't think so for choking a hotdog.  Hope it works.  What's up?  Looking for ghosts in our own place.  Looking for ghosts.  I want to play.  Come out, come out, wherever you are.  We attend to your own play.  I'd love to play.  You'll fall out.  Nope.  You'll burn.  I am.  June ghost.  A little nowhere.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  I'm good.  I have a 50 caliber, you have a chainsaw.  Knife through a gun fight.  Not a reliable chainsaw.  Push the choke.  The other button, it should be under it.  Good.  Here you go, big guy.  So I'm not gonna lie.  I'm having a decent amount of fun.  The group is having a blast.  But I've been frustrated in the fact that someone said they'd gut me like a fish and I can't find them.  But, but I have a solution.  I hear my classy lady.  Such a good flight.  Single is what?  I'm just trying to have a good time with my friends.  What did I hear?  You are single as one.  And once again, you won't let me do anything.  Single as what?  All right.  I said, I said, I said, oh, I didn't know how hard it is to come back in the afterlife.  I don't even know how this is possible.  Listen, I love you.  Who are you?  Back to us.  Kiss me.  Kiss me.  I know it.  Okay.  Yeah.  That was an amazing time.  Fantastic!  Great, great fun.  I got a kill with my gold desert eagle.  I got a flame thrower.  And a double-decker kill.  I am back in a... Relationship!  Your hoodie is so comfortable, by the way.  We're looking at rings.  Save the day!  I got that super scary work!  What's up, man?  USMC.  Nice.  Super five.  I poisoned the water well for you.  You're coming.  Guys, the night's not over.  I found a friend who poisoned the water well.  I poisoned the water well.  And there's a heart of zombies on the way, so let's have some more fun.  Good thing I'm already dead, you jerk.  Oh, that was a bad spin, chair.  Let me try that again.  The last zombie horde is gone.  And it is amazing to see that Riding the World of Evil brings such a diverse group of people together.  But I guess that's America.  Cheers and happy Halloween.  Oh, that's terrible.  BlackripleCoffee.com.  That's how we make these stupid videos.  Thanks for watching guys.  Oh god. ",
