            "text": "doing more for our planet.  You're literally the face of an industry that pumps out 256,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every single year.  And that's not even including fans' transport to get to the races.  You're literally the lead driver for Mercedes, a company that spews 16.4 tons of CO2 for every car it produces.  Daimler AG, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, was fined $700 million by German prosecutors last year for lying about its nitrogen oxide emission.  They literally installed secret devices that hid the true level of emissions so their cars could cheat emissions tests.  And I'm sure doing more for our planet was at the forefront of Lewis's mind when he purchased each of his 15 cars, 8 of which are supercars.  I'm sure the state of Mother Earth was a major factor in his decision to rent an entire garage in LA to store half of them in.  And yeah, big shock.  Lewis Hamilton likes cars.  Why is he lecturing us about climate change?  His carbon footprint is the size of a small country.  He's whining about damage to the oceans, to the background sound of a massive outboard motor.  It'd be like Jocelyn Wildenstein.  brow-beating is about the immorality of plastic surgery.  Dude has less self-awareness than a dog licking its balls in public.  This is a guy who cries on Instagram about how everyone needs to go vegan because the climate is decaying.  As he whizzes around the globe on a \u00a325 million private jet, a \u00a33 million yacht, Well, he's sponsored by an oil and gas company.  We all know the lifestyle that Lewis has, said rival driver Fernando Alonso, and that Formula One drivers take 200 planes a year.  You can't then say, don't eat meat.  But if there's one person in Formula One that's an even more gargantuan hypocrite than Lewis Hamilton, it's... No, it's still Lewis Hamilton.  You see, as a black person, Lewis understands the struggle for people of colour.  When it comes to sports and entertainment, both industries in which they're notoriously underrepresented, Lewis understands black oppression.  That's why with Mercedes, he's become Formula One's most ardent torchbearer for Black Lives Matter. ",

A city where Black Lives Matter so much, 73% of knife offenders and 53% of victims are from a black or ethnic minority background, but see as a black man.  Lewis is so oppressed that Mercedes gave him a contract for just \u00a360 million a season.  the struggle is real.  Aside from his 15 supercars, Lewis has been so discriminated against that he has to make do with an \u00a318 million six bedroom London mansion, and a \u00a332 million 6,547 square foot New York penthouse, and an apartment in Switzerland with a view of Lake Geneva, and a \u00a330 million apartment in the tax haven of Monaco, so a press.  I mean, just how hard done by would you feel as a person of colour to be sitting on a net worth?  of only $285 million, so oppressed!  If a black dude rapidly rising to the top of a cutthroat industry to become a multi-time world champion doesn't suggest that we're living in a post-racist era, I don't know what does.  But I've got a theory as to why Lewis Hamilton became so insufferably woke.  It all stems from a 2017 incident when he upset the thought police by telling his nephew not to wear a princess dress. ",

Ever since that brush with the unhinged mob, Hamilton has been walking on eggshells to protect his lucrative career, but now Lewis faces a new challenge.  Spacemax the Stappen.  The Red Bull prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was one of the few F1 drivers to refuse to cave to Hamilton's demand that he'd take a knee for Black Lives Matter.  I know who you are, and I see you.  Which makes sense because Red Bull is owned by D-Trick Mattachets, a Trump supporting populist billionaire who has spoken out against political correctness and Angela Merkel's migrant invasion madness.  Last month, Mattachets fired two diversity directors and sacked entire culture teams because they were trying to force the company into corporate virtue signaling for Black Lives Matter.  You're all fired.  Yeah.  Don't think a drive with Red Bull is in Lewis's future, and let's not forget Hamilton's cringe tweet happened in the same week that tax-dodging migrant abusing Ben and Jerry's lectured us about the necessity of taking in more illegal migrants.  Remember when multi-billion dollar corporations just made products and didn't guilt trip as about social justice as a pretentious marketing ploy.  Remember when celebrities weren't afraid to flaunt their wealth.  Remember when they understood that they'd hit life's jackpot and knew just to shut up and enjoy it?  Remember when they didn't lecture you about your consumption while blitzing around the world in speedboats and supercars?  Well, with people like Lewis Hamilton around, those days are long gone, and they're not coming back. ",
