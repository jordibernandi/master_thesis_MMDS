During part one of lessons of the Mueller report, we brought in John Dean to re-examine the Nixon impeachment.  Perhaps during part two we'll get to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.  Well, maybe the folks here could teach us some lessons for the witnesses so that we don't have to individually go through.  Here's the question.  And raise your hand if you would answer this in the affirmative.  Do any witnesses here have personal knowledge regarding the truth or falsity of a single material fact in the Mueller report?  If you have personal knowledge regarding the truth or falsity of a single material fact, just raise your hand so I can figure out who to ask the question to.  So, the record can reflect.  no witnesses have raised their hand.  No witnesses have any personal knowledge regarding a single fact in the report.  No witnesses last week had personal knowledge. ",

You have used subpoena power extensively in this committee and you won't subpoena the person who wrote the report.  And so this hearing should not be entitled lessons from the Mueller report.  It should be entitled Hot Takes from the Mueller Report because what we're getting are people who have no knowledge of the facts, no information as to the underlying information.  They're just reading it and offering their analysis and their hot takes.  But I think that there's a far more critical issue that our committee should be addressing and that we could address.

            "text": "This is Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz on the receiving end of an answer he didn't expect from Georgetown professor and national security analyst Carrie Courdero.  At a hearing about the Mueller report, Gaetz pulled a tired stunt that he's used in the past, which is to divert attention away from the issue at hand and instead bring up a completely unrelated issue to impress the president.  He tried to rope Cordero into his desperate pandering to Trump, invoking an old essay she wrote in 2012 in which she discusses the national security risk that Mexican cartels pose.  And she acknowledges that it still is a risk, but that nowhere in her essay was the solution of border wall, which is Gates' answer to all of this.  Because clearly, he's performing for an audience of one.  He's doing Trump's bidding, throwing his full weight behind Trump's only solution to the border issue, which is to divert billions of dollars toward a big slab of concrete.  But now, withstanding the ineffectiveness of the solution, the Southern border has nothing to do with the Mueller report.  although Trump would love nothing more than for his mouthpieces to deflect and throw some red meat to his base every time the issue of accountability was raised.  But this wasn't the only lapse in judgment by Matt Gaetz.  He throws a tantrum about the very bases of the hearing that expert witnesses were there to discuss the Mueller report instead of someone with direct knowledge of the probe.  First of all, the purpose of having expert witnesses is twofold.  One is that our judicial system is informed by precedent, like, for example, and I'm just taking a wild swing here, the precedent of impeaching presidents for having committed obstruction of justice.  Two, expert witnesses are there to inform members of Congress so that decisions aren't made by partisan hacks.  don't think a wild swing is necessary to identify who I'm talking about here.  And Gates goes so far as to ask the witnesses if any of them have personal knowledge of the Mueller probe.  But here's the thing, it wouldn't matter if they did.  Mueller released a 448 page report, and yet Gates is still alleging that there was no obstruction and no collusion regurgitating Trump's talking points.  What would the point be of bringing someone with intimate knowledge of the investigation forward if Gates is going to distort its findings anyway?  Here's what we already know.  The Mueller investigation found 10 instances of obstruction of justice.  From Trump firing then FBI Director James Comey when the FBI began its investigation into the Russia scandal, to then trying to have Mueller removed on multiple occasions, to ordering White House counsels down McGahn to lie about Trump's order to have him removed, to dangling pardons for Flynn and Manafort, to intimidating Michael Cohen when he began cooperating with prosecutors.  We know that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian officials to work toward getting Trump elected.  From the Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr, Manafort Kushner, and a Kremlin-linked lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, to Trump's national security advisor Mike Flynn discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador, to Paul Manafort sharing polling data with Constantine Kalimnik, to Trump himself asking Russia on national television to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails.

The purpose of this hearing is not to figure out what the probe uncovered.  The report had Gates dain to read it already did that in devastating fashions.  It's to figure out how to move forward, because while Republicans have opted to bury their heads in the sand and their desperate deference to Trump, that's not what history tells us we should do, that's not what experts tell us we should do, and that's not what the law tells us we should do.  Beyond that, who else does Gates expect Democrats to call?  The White House has blocked both Don McGahn and Attorney General Bill Barr from testifying, even under threat of being held in contempt of Congress, which they ultimately were.  And notwithstanding the wonderful optics that come with blocking officials from speaking publicly about the probe, Those are people directly connected to it.  Those are people with first-hand knowledge of Mueller's investigation.  And I don't recall Matt Gaetz throwing a fit about the White House forcing them into silence.  So instead of pounding his fists on the table because every hearing isn't an opportunity to impress his boss, Matt Gaetz should think before he tries his next scotch a moment, because it'd be a real shame if it were to backfire and leave the crowd laughing at him instead.
