            "text": "in book 3 of Avatar The Last Airbender there's an episode called the southern Raiders that largely features Katara and Zuko it's not really a part of the main story and that if you skipped this episode you would probably still understand what's going on over the course of the season sure there's some stuff in the beginning you would miss about why the group had to split up but that could easily just be incorporated into the beginning of the next episode most of this episode isn't strictly necessary but it's still really good and I want to talk about why that is because in storytelling generally you want everything to in some way advance the main plot it makes a story feel really well put together when everything is driving in the same direction too many side stories going on can 'cause the story to lose its focus but TV shows given a set number of episodes per season often have filler episodes to help them fill out the season too many of these can make a show frustrating to watch because you feel like they're never getting around to the actual plot but in limited quantities they can be a fun little break away from the main story and in some cases they can reveal things about a character that you never otherwise would have learned if it's not advancing the main plot it can at least provide a new insight into why a character is the way that they are that's what Katara's Revenge storyline does up until this point we know that her mom died when she was young but we don't know a whole lot of details about it so this episode gives us a look into her backstory and that can help us to understand her actions better which leads to a more satisfying show overall because we know more about and care more about every character while the main story might be about Aang stopping the Fire Lord the motivations and desires of the other central characters like Katara Sokka and Zuko are just as important to making the show feel substantial and well-rounded what this show could have done though was make Katara search for her mother's killer an entirely separate thing from the main storyline that would have been the easy route it doesn't require connecting any pieces to the larger story but the episode doesn't do that instead the catalyst for Katara wanting to find her mom is her distrust of Zuko which is absolutely a part of the main storyline from the start Zuko was obviously Katara's enemy as he went on his crusade to capture the avatar and restore his honor but at the end of book 2 katara slowly began to trust him she thought that he had changed she thought that he would help them but when it came down to it he betrayed them allowing Azula to strike Aang with lightning nearly killing him and preventing him from getting into the Avatar State after that traumatic betrayal Katara developed a strong dislike for Zuko even after he had a change of heart and tried to come back and apologize to aim Katara and Sokka it took a while for Aang and Sokka to trust Zuko but eventually they got there Aang is kind of the master of forgiveness and Sokka wasn't there in person for Zuko's betrayal but for Katara because of the time she spent with Zuko before being betrayed she couldn't bring herself to forgive him she had already started to trust him once and he destroyed that trust it makes sense that she would be wary to trust him again but it's also a barrier to accomplishing the protagonists main goal of defeating the Fire Lord because she has to work with Zuko to help Aang prepare for his big battle so the show needs to address that in some way leading perfectly into the southern Raiders episode there's already history behind Katara and Zuko going into this episode which connects it further to the overall plot but when Katara snaps at Zuko and says he should bring her mother back from the dead it's clear that her anger isn't only about his betrayal her anger is about what the Fire Nation has done and she still connects Zuko to the Fire Nation because he used to be on their side so Zuko wanting to be a part of the group decides to fix things by helping Katara get some sort of resolution they're hoping to prove that he is no longer on the fire nations side of course it's not that easy when Katara learns that she could find the person who kills her mother you can see something change in her normally an upbeat relatively peaceful character she's suddenly serious and out for blood we get our first look at a Katara filled to the brim with anger and hate so angry in fact that we see her blood Bend the last time she blood bent she cried about it hating the fact that she even learned how to do it for her to blood Bend now in this episode means that she's really reached a level of anger that we've never seen before we see a side of Katara that hasn't been present through most of the series which gives her another dimension as a character makes her feel more real of course the real moral dilemma of the episode is should she kill the person who killed her mother is it better to get revenge or to forgive in that regard the show has an interesting answer that's kind of somewhere in the middle she can't bring herself to kill her mother's murderer but she comes awfully close and has him begging for his life she doesn't fully explain her choice aside from saying that she can't do it but it seems like the fact that he's not a threat anymore plays a role he's just chillin in some tiny village in the mountains he's a horrific person but he's not fighting back not currently hurting people he's just a pathetic person and she can't bring herself to kill someone like that and while that's an interesting moral dilemma and the climax of the episode it's kind of a blip on the radar when it comes to the overall storyline what's more important in that regard is how it affects her view of Zuko Zuko supported her through the entire hunt for her mother's killer and that did seem to mean something in the end Katara couldn't bring herself to forgive the murderer but when thinking about forgiveness she found it in her heart to forgive Zuko because she knows that it's the right thing to do going forward this is a really important moment for repairing their relationship because how else could Katara forgive Zuko after such an awful betrayal it would have to be through him taking high-stakes actions to help her and from her having to sit and contemplate who deserves forgiveness this episode ticked both of those boxes now they're able to work together to help train aang and further the main storyline not only that but Zuko actually connects the whole thing back to Aang's journey right at the end Aang says that violence is never the answer and Zuko poses a very reasonable question",

            "text": "Aang is going to have to make a similar decision to Katara except that instead of a helpless old man it will be a tyrannical dictator who's trying to take over the world that's someone who needs to be stopped but with Aang so staunchly in the forgiveness over violence camp it's unclear how he'll actually be able to do that and his concern over this is examined through further episodes up until his actual battle with Ozai in this way the southern Raiders episode has big implications for the main storyline while being its own self-contained story it shows us a new side of Katara that further flushes out her character gives us new information about her backstory like the fact that her mother sacrifice herself to save Katara by pretending to be the last waterbender it allows her to make peace with Zuko and at foreshadows what aang is going to face in later episodes it says integrated into the overall storyline as a side story could be and that's what makes it so strong if you wanted to cut down the season you could take it out have her forgive Zuko slowly over a couple of episodes and get on with the main story but then you'd be missing out on a large part of who Katara is so this episode might not directly be driving forward the main plot but it's an important story nonetheless in contrast to this would be something like Episode 9 of book 3 nightmares and daydreams in this episode aang worries about how he's going to defeat the fire lord while Zuko gets a taste of life back in the fire Kingdom it's a very important episode for Zuko's character but almost everything Aang does could be cut without hurting the overall story because even though aang is the main character worrying about how to defeat the main protagonist this episode doesn't really teach us anything new about his character or change their situation at all before this he was going to try and defeat the Fire Lord even though he doesn't know how and after this he's going to try and defeat the Fire Lord even though he doesn't know how he ends up in the same place without revealing anything new about his character or backstory we already knew he was worried about this and him having dreams about his worries probably didn't need to take up a full episode that's not to say the episode is bad every show is going to have stronger or weaker episodes but in comparison to the southern Raiders episode nightmares and daydreams seems a lot more like filler despite its closeness to the main plot because things that drive the story don't just have to be about Aang and the Fire Lord as long as they can give us enough new information or move the overall story forward in some kind of significant way if Aang's worry had been because of something that happened to him in the past that we didn't know about it could have made the episode more impactful or if he had discovered some method to defeat the Fire Lord that he didn't have in the beginning because it doesn't do that it feels a lot more like filler but Katara's revenge storyline gives us new information deepens relationships between main characters and put saying on a better path to defeating the Fire Lord since his firebending teacher and waterbending teacher now get along all of this is just to say that even though I love this whole series I think the Katara's revenge storyline is one of the strongest side stories out of all three books and I think it sets a good example for what makes a side story feel solid and meaningful anyway thanks so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it I would really appreciate your support over on patreon I'm only able to make these videos thanks to the generosity of my patreon supporters and your support on patreon would mean the world to me and help me make more videos like this one in the comments let me know what you thought of the southern Raiders episode and what your favorite episode of the series is thanks everyone and I'll see you next time",
