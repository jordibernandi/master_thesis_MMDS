            "text": "Well, there's a number, there's a number of differences.  One would be, so isn't it, I'll describe what we are and then I'll describe what I think Navy SEALs are addicted to, to make that distinction, but certainly for.  For the SES, we traditionally recruit from RAF Army, Navy, territorials, and the law come in.  And then there's plenty of troops in that set.  And we have our own boat troops, of boat troops, one quarter of our squadrons that do that.  And they'll do traditional Navy SEAL type operations generally.  What happens normally for the SBS, the Special Boat Service, is that they are primarily recruited from Marines and that Marines will then join the SPS and the SPS will then do their book course.  whichever book trip guy is going to do with them.  Now that SPS book course and sort of parts of the Marine course will be similar to what the Navy seals go through when they do their training.  and the Navy seals and my understanding is that CL Team 6 are the sort of main account of terrorist unit within the Navy SEALs.  They all go through quite a rigorous sort of marine based selection process, which will have different modules attached to it.  but then Navy Seals, and this is where some people get mixed up.  Navy Seals are probably, because particularly Seal Team Sex are predominantly the main sort of door kickers, kind of terrorism unit within the US.  People think it's Delaforce.  Delaforce are completely separate, and Delaforce were modeled on the SES.  So there was a major, I'm sure you remember his name, he came across and he saw selection, he saw how the SES were structured and what they were meant for and he went back and he designed almost a sort of replica in terms of a six-month selection process, what they were looking for.  And that made Delta forced who are traditionally from all sorts of screen readers, Rangers and all that sort of stuff.  And they have a kind of terrorism element to them as well.  But they operate slightly differently in how they go about doing the business.  And the only reason I say that is because I was fortunate enough to do an exchange with both of them.  So when we went out to the Middle East, I ended up in a team with cell team sex and one of the Delta Force teams as well.  So yeah, they're slightly different in how they are.  People get mixed up between the SES and the SPS.  The SPS are probably closer to cell team sex.  At the SES, there are sort of hybrid of silting sex and Delta Force, you know, just like their Rangers are like our parents.  But to put in a perspective, the US Marines have more soldiers than our army More ships than our Navy and more aircraft than our RAF and that's just their Marines.  So there are big units the the UX.  so when the US talk of its special forces, you know, they've they've got over 100,000 special forces, you know, we have maybe 500, you know. ",

So we have a lot of ex Navy, just like we have a lot of RAF, maybe guys from refrigerant stuff in there.  And so there's a sort of hybrid of all units within the British military, really, which is one of our strengths.  You know, we would want to have all Paris, all Marines, you know, all Navy.  We like the fact that we've got people from all different backgrounds and stuff. ",
